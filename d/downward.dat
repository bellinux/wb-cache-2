5|$|As of the species' {{most recent}} review in 2008, Kitti's hog-nosed bat is listed by the IUCN as vulnerable, with a <b>downward</b> {{population}} trend.|$|E
5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high. Similar projections of the tilted beds <b>downward,</b> coupled with geophysical measurements on the greenstone belts in Canada, suggest the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the belts project <b>downward</b> {{at least a few}} kilometers.|$|E

5|$|Early {{ideas for}} The <b>Downward</b> Spiral were {{conceived}} after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor developed a concept about the album's themes and later {{used it as}} lyrics. He searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking {{the beginning of the}} making of both Broken and The <b>Downward</b> Spiral. This was against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in <b>downward</b> force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the <b>downward</b> force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{levels in}} the {{atmosphere}} are trending slightly <b>downward</b> globally, possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) <b>downward</b> {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the <b>downward</b> force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Apple {{rejected}} {{a proposal for}} a Nine Inch Nails iPhone application, citing objectionable content in The <b>Downward</b> Spiral. Days later, Apple reversed the decision, but refused to explain its reasoning.|$|E
5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls <b>downward.</b> The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The <b>downward</b> flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E
5|$|Once Pluto was found, its faintness {{and lack}} of a resolvable disc {{cast doubt on the}} idea that it was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised <b>downward</b> {{throughout}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Reznor has toured {{with some}} of his influences, {{including}} a brief tour opening for Skinny Puppy in 1989. In 1995 Nine Inch Nails went on tour with David Bowie, who along with Pink Floyd had been a significant influence on The <b>Downward</b> Spiral.|$|E
5|$|The family Threskiornithidae {{includes}} the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings. Their bodies are elongated, the neck more so, with long legs. The bill is also long, curved <b>downward</b> in the ibises, straight and markedly flattened in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|The related Banksia caleyi {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} but can be distinguished by its recurved (<b>downward</b> curving) leaf margins, and smaller follicles and perianths. Its flowers appear from October to December.|$|E
5|$|Unbinilium {{should be}} a solid at room temperature, with melting point 680°C: this {{continues}} the <b>downward</b> trend down the group, being lower than the value 700°C for radium. The boiling point of ununennium {{is expected to be}} around 1700°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group (in particular, radium boils at 1737°C), following the <b>downward</b> periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been predicted to be 7g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group: the value for radium is 5.5g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|When Mulder and Scully search Karin's house, {{they come}} upon the corpsebelonging to Karin's fatherin the root cellar. They then find Lisa, frightened but unharmed, in the kitchen. Karin drives to Bobby's house and chases {{him into the}} orchard. Suddenly, Bobby is dragged <b>downward</b> into the mud. While {{attempting}} to rescue the teenager, Mulder simultaneously encourages Karin {{to break the cycle}} and to fight the voice inside her head. A tendon-like root snakes out of the mud and begins to drag Mulder <b>downward.</b> Ramirez appears, his axe in hand, and decapitates Karin, killing her. Mulder and Bobby are released by the unseen force.|$|E
5|$|After the {{momentary}} reduction in speed, the train {{turns to the}} right and descends into a <b>downward</b> 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an upward 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs {{from the top of}} the head <b>downward.</b> In between the Y-shaped line lies the frontal triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in the centre of the labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the <b>downward</b> slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 1990s the <b>downward</b> trend was {{starting}} to reverse: at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums {{in the aftermath of the}} Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.|$|E
5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the <b>downward</b> spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed <b>downward.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{succeeded in}} {{reversing}} the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next {{to reverse the}} effects of the McKinley tariff. The Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893. After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin. The bill proposed moderate <b>downward</b> revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials. The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (US$ today).|$|E
5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for {{the figure in the}} foreground with face turned <b>downward</b> and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that several imitation medallions and bracteates of the Migration Period (ca. first centuries AD) feature depictions of Hel. In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff. The <b>downward</b> slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm, corresponding to Hel.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the subject}} of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking <b>downward,</b> that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because he wanted to see just what it was that he was being so heavily {{solicited}} to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Borsuk-Białynicka {{assumed that}} in {{standard}} position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly <b>downward.</b> This {{was based on}} the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck. Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small <b>downward</b> movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself upward. Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds spend {{many months}} at a time at sea, so they must sleep in the water. Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting <b>downward</b> in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into sleep mode.|$|E
5|$|Polistes nests can be {{built from}} wood fiber which are {{collected}} from posts and plant stems. The fiber is formed into a paper like comb with hexagonal cells. The nests are orientated <b>downward</b> and are held up by one filament. P. exclamans have also been observed occupying artificial nests put out by researchers and consisting of bundles of straws.|$|E
5|$|Some site opponents assert that, {{after the}} {{predicted}} containment {{failure of the}} waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing <b>downward</b> from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will be stored {{in such a way}} as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{caterpillars}} of many butterflies attach {{themselves by}} a button of silk to {{the underside of}} a branch or stone or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like process called a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head <b>downward,</b> but in the families Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the chrysalis is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around {{the middle of the}} chrysalis.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate <b>downward</b> through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The <b>downward</b> {{spiral of}} {{the economy has been}} {{attributed}} mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters attest that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|The mitre may {{be shown}} {{in all sorts of}} colours. It may be {{represented}} either gold or jewelled, the former more common in English heraldry. A form of mitre with coronet is proper to the Bishop of Durham because of his role as Prince-Bishop of the palatinate of Durham. For similar reasons the Bishop of Durham and some other bishops display a sword behind the shield, pointed <b>downward</b> to signify a former civil jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{start of}} a {{demographic}} shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and the docks moved into storage and freight. The <b>downward</b> shift continued into the 20th century as the local population's dependency on the docks continued: as the docks themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 {{has a more}} rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat. Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a <b>downward</b> sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows.|$|E
