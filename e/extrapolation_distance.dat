The {{expected}} {{sensitivity of}} the water Cerenkov detector array of the southern Auger Observatory site is described by calculations of the energy and zenith angle dependent aperture function (A(E,θ) km 2 sr).

40|$|Abstract: The {{structure}} {{and content of the}} Moab Fault zone are described for 37 transects across the fault zone where throws range from less than 100 m to c. 960 m. The 45 km long fault trace intersects a sedimentary sequence containing a high proportion of sandstones with good reservoir properties, interspersed with numerous mudstone layers. Typically, the fault zone is bounded by two external slip zones with the fault zone components separated by up to nine internal slip zones. Fault zone components are tabular lenses of variably deformed sandstones and sandstone cataclasites and breccia, with a wide size range, usually enclosed in a matrix of shaley fault gouge containing mm to m scale ntrained sandstone fragments. Neither fault zone structure nor content can be predicted by <b>extrapolation</b> over <b>distances</b> as little as 10 m.

40|$|A large-volume {{prototype}} of a liquid-core fibre detector {{has been built}} and installed in the CERN neutrino beam. For the first time high-quality images of neutrino interactions were recorded with such a detector. The analysis {{presented in this paper}} is based on a sample of 151 recorded interactions. It aims at evaluating the precision of the neutrino vertex reconstruction, to determine the capability of the technique for the detection of short-lived particles. To gather experience, a small sample of 31 events has been analysed on an event-by-event basis using an interactive track finding program. A non-interactive algorithm has been applied to the complete sample. A reconstruction efficiency of 84 % and a vertex resolution of 30 μm (transverse to the beam direction) were achieved. The instrumental impact parameter of the measured tracks relative to the vertex is, on average, 43 μm for interactions in the sensitive part of the detector and 66 μm for events occurring in upstream materials (where the <b>extrapolation</b> <b>distance</b> to the vertex is longer). © 1998 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The use of {{diffusion}} theory in calculations on photon waves necessitates {{a new look}} at boundary conditions, since the stan-dard boundary conditions have been derived under static conditions. When the underlying process satisfies the transport equation, the proper boundary conditions are obtained by solving the Milne problem. This paper presents benchmark-quality values for extrapolation distances calculated by transport theory, for various values of absorption and three models of the phase function—isotropic, linearly anisotropic and Henyey-Greenstein scattering. The results show that the static boundary conditions are perfectly adequate up to photon wave frequencies of 1 GHz or even more. Specifically, the quantity Σtrd, where Σ′tr = Σtr- ik, where Σtr is the macroscopic transport cross section and k the wave number in the medium and d the linear <b>extrapolation</b> <b>distance,</b> is essentially independent of frequency over this range. We have also examined the ratio of the diffusion length as given by transport theory to that given by {{diffusion theory}} itself.

Results for the source multiplier for a given safety factor are obtained for slab, cylindrical and spherical systems. The spatial term in the Pál-Bell equation is dealt with by Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation methods and this enables an <b>extrapolation</b> <b>distance</b> to be included, thereby simulating a reflector.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to present a new numerical strategy using soft-computing techniques to determine the optimal die gap programming of extrusion blow molding processes. In this study, the design objective is to target a uniform part thickness after parison inflation by manipulating the parison die gap openings over time. To model the whole process, that is, the parison extrusion, the mould clamping and the parison inflation, commercial finite element software (BlowSim) from the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada is used. However, the use of such software is time-consuming and one important issue in a design environment is to minimize the number of simulations to get the optimal operating conditions. To do so, we proposed a new strategy called fuzzy neural 2 ̆ 013 Taguchi network with genetic algorithm (FUNTGA) that establishes a back propagation network using a Taguchis experimental array to predict the relationship between design variables and responses. Genetic algorithm (GA) is then applied to search for the optimum design of die gap parison programming. As the number of training samples is greatly reduced due to the use of orthogonal arrays, the prediction accuracy of the neural network model is closely related to the distance between sampling points and the evolved designs. The <b>extrapolation</b> <b>distance</b> concept is proposed and introduced to GA using fuzzy rules to modify the fitness function and thus improving search efficiency. The comparison of the results with commercial optimization software from NRC demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

Some of the effects included are (1) linearly anisotropic center of mass elastic scattering, (2) heavy element inelastic scattering based on the evaporation model of the nucleus, and (3) optional variation of the buckling with lethargy. The microscopic cross-section data developed for this program covered 473 lethargy points from lethargy u = 0 (10 Mev) to u = 19. 8 (0. 025 ev). The value of the fission neutron age in water calculated here is 26. 5 square centimeters; this value is to be compared with the recent experimental value given as 27. 86 square centimeters. The Fourier transform of the slowing-down kernel for water to indium resonance energy calculated here compared well with the Fourier transform of the kernel for water as measured by Hill, Roberts, and Fitch.

Care, however, does {{have to be taken}} in implementing (apparently) minor details to avoid locking effects which adversely affect accuracy and which can destroy the method reliability. As the effects related to the finite element interpolation have been discussed before this paper focuses on the nonlinear locking due to the use, implicit in the method, of finite <b>distance</b> <b>extrapolations.</b> Within this scope, it is shown that perturbation algorithms based on compatible formulations can imply a strong critical and post-critical locking when analysing structures characterized by high stiffness ratios in the presence of moderate pre-critical rotations.

40|$|Gas hydrate saturations were {{calculated}} based on Archie's relation and rock-physics modeling utilizing log measurements of electrical resistivity and P-wave velocity through the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) at two {{sites in the}} Krishna Godavari (KG) basin off the East Coast of India. Acoustic impedance inversion was then performed around the well sites for regional extrapolation of the borehole data. Well-log based gas hydrate concentration estimates and core data are in general agreement with the seismic impedance inversion results at the individual well sites. However, the correlation with seismic data and thus the confidence in the <b>extrapolation</b> decreases with <b>distance</b> from the well site. To address the general problem of unknown regional confidence limits in the extrapolation and aid in regional gas hydrate assessment analyses, a new approach is introduced by calculating the running-sum of the seismic similarity attribute across the gas hydrate stability zone. The running-sum of the similarity attribute can be used locally on a 2 D seismic line or 3 D seismic volume for defining the limit of well-data extrapolation around a given well site. By normalizing the running-sum of the similarity attribute from all available 2 D seismic data in the KG basin, a regional map was generated yielding effective confidence limits for extrapolation of well-log data. Such maps of regional confidence limits can be used strategically in basin-wide gas hydrate assessments as they provide a measure of probability to find a given gas hydrate concentration, and may also offer a guide for defining a minimum regional spacing between well-sites to address the overall structural complexity of the basin (which {{is reflected in the}} similarity of the seismic data) ...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} of the PhD thesis {{is to develop a}} new type of positioning sensor to align components at micrometre level over 200 m with respect to a laser beam as straight line reference. The second objective is to estimate the measurement accuracy of the total alignment system over 200 m. The context of the PhD thesis is the Compact Linear Collider project, which is a study for a future particle accelerator. The proposed positioning sensor is made of a camera and an open/close shutter. The sensor can measure the position of the laser beam with respect to its own coordinate system. To do a measurement, the shutter closes, a laser spot appears on it, the camera captures a picture of the laser spot and the coordinates of the laser spot centre are reconstructed in the sensor coordinate system with image processing. Such a measurement requires reference targets on the positioning sensor. To reach the rst {{objective of}} the PhD thesis, we used laser theory and cam- era model to de ne an accurate image processing and we performed experiments to validate a prototype of a positioning sensor. For the second objective, we could not obtain results regarding measurement accuracy because we could not develop a full alignment system under vacuum over 200 m. However, we could estimate laser pointing stability over 200 m by extrapolating results obtained over 12 m. As a result, we present in this report a sensor design, a calibration protocol and estimations regarding measurement uncertainty. In case of a separate cali- bration with theodolites, we estimated the measurement uncertainty of the po- sitioning sensor to be 4 μ m for all coordinates. In case of a full auto-calibration, we estimated the measurement uncertainty of the positioning sensor to be 10 μ m for the radial and the vertical coordinates and 20 μ m for the depth coordinate. Concerning the <b>extrapolation</b> over long <b>distance,</b> we estimated laser pointing stability to be 10 μ m for a laser beam propagation distance of 200 m.

40|$|Fatigue life {{assessment}} of weldedstructures is commonly {{based on the}} nominal stress method, but more flexible and accurate methods have been introduced. In general, the assessment accuracy is improved as more localized information about the weld is incorporated. The structural hot spot stress method includes the influence of macro geometric effects and structural discontinuities on the design stress but excludes the local features of the weld. In this thesis, {{the limitations of the}} structural hot spot stress method are discussed and a modified structural stress method with improved accuracy is developed and verified for selected welded details. The fatigue life of structures in the as-welded state consists mainly of crack growth from pre-existing cracks or defects. Crack growth rate depends on crack geometry and the stress state on the crack face plane. This means that the stress level and shape of the stress distribution in the assumed crack path governs thetotal fatigue life. In many structural details the stress distribution is similar and adequate fatigue life estimates can be obtained just by adjusting the stress level based on a single stress value, i. e., the structural hot spot stress. There are, however, cases for which the structural stress approach is less appropriate because the stress distribution differs significantly from the more common cases. Plate edge attachments and plates on elastic foundations are some examples of structures with this type of stress distribution. The importance of fillet weld size and weld load variation on the stress distribution is another central topic in this thesis. Structural hot spot stress determination is generally based on a procedure that involves extrapolation of plate surface stresses. Other possibilities for determining the structural hot spot stress is to extrapolate stresses through the thickness at the weld toe or to use Dong's method which includes through-thickness <b>extrapolation</b> at some <b>distance</b> from the weld toe. Both of these latter methods are less sensitive to the FE mesh used. Structural stress based on surface extrapolation is sensitive to the extrapolation points selected and to the FE mesh used near these points. Rules for proper meshing, however, are well defined and not difficult to apply. To improve the accuracy of the traditional structural hot spot stress, a multi-linear stress distribution is introduced. The magnitude of the weld toe stress after linearization is dependent on the weld size, weld load and plate thickness. Simple equations have been derived by comparing assessment results based on the local linear stress distribution and LEFM based calculations. The proposed method is called the modified structural stress method (MSHS) since the structural hot spot stress (SHS) value is corrected using information on weld size andweld load. The correction procedure is verified using fatigue test results found in the literature. Also, a test case was conducted comparing the proposed method with other local fatigue assessment methods...|$|R
