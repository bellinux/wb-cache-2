40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the genetic composition and relationships among livestock breeds is a necessary step {{for the implementation of}} management and conservation plans. This study aims to characterise the genetic diversity and relationships among six sheep breeds of meat aptitude that are spread through the eastern Pyrenees: Tarasconnaise, Castillonnaise and Rouge du Roussillon from France, and Aranesa, Xisqueta and Ripollesa from Spain. All but Tarasconnaise are catalogued as endangered. These breeds do not share the same ancestral origin but commercial trades and gene flow between herds are known to have occurred for centuries. Additionally, two outgroup breeds were included: the Guirra, from a different geographical location, and the Lacaune, a <b>highly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>breed</b> of dairy aptitude. A total of 410 individuals were typed using a panel of 12 microsatellite markers. Statistical, phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses showed that eastern Pyrenean breeds retained high levels of genetic diversity and low, but significant, levels of genetic differentiation (F ST = 4. 1 %). While outgroups were clearly differentiated from other breeds, Pyrenean breeds tended to form two clusters. The first encompassed Tarasconnaise and Aranesa, which probably descend from a common meta-population. The second tended to group the other four breeds. However, none reached high mean Q-values of membership to a discrete cluster. This is consistent with the recent past gene flow between breeds, despite different ancestral genetic origins. The genetic characterisation carried out of the eastern Pyrenean sheep populations provides useful information to support decision making on their conservation and focusing efforts and resources to more singular breeds. </object...|$|E
40|$|While transcriptomic {{analysis}} has provided incredible insight into cell operation, an integrated multi-omics approach {{is crucial to}} gain further insights into complex biological systems. Here, we chose to develop an integrated network method of proteomic and phenotypic data, with integration of transcriptomic information, to highlight some important proteins during the end of gestation in pig skeletal muscle. Networks are increasingly used to analyze and visualize data in biology and genetics. An integrated network analysis was first developed to explore relationships between co-expression network models, built from proteomic data, and targeted biological phenotypes of interest to identify molecular signatures underlying late fetal muscle development. Second, correlation with muscle transcriptomic data was also investigated to complete and combine different layers of expression. Piglet maturation, which occurs {{at the end of}} gestation, leads to a state of full development after birth and is an important determinant of early survival. The objective of our project is an integrated global multi-omics analysis (transcriptome, proteome and targeted biological phenotypes) with a focus on skeletal muscle because of its key role in adaptation to extra-uterine life (locomotion and thermogenesis). Progeny from two extreme purebreds for maturity (Large White and Meishan) were investigated. The Large White (LW) breed is a <b>highly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>breed</b> with a high rate of mortality at birth, whereas the Chinese Meishan (MS) is a more robust breed exhibiting an extremely low neonatal mortality. The late fetal maturation process was analyzed on the progeny from these two breeds (LW, MS and reciprocal F 1) at two developmental time points during the end of gestation (90 and 110 d of gestation). First, three targeted biological phenotypes (glycogen, MyHC adult fast and embryonic) were found as good descriptors of muscle maturity. The proteomic approach showed that proteins associated with the cytoskeleton and muscle filaments were overexpressed at 90 dg, whereas proteins involved in muscle energy metabolism were strongly up-regulated at 110 dg. The integrated network analysis revealed a high number of proteins involved in the mitochondrial oxidation/reduction metabolic process that were overexpressed at 110 dg with a higher expression in MS than in LW. In particular, CKMT 2 and ATP 5 A 1 were identified as important nodes and possible good biological markers of muscle maturity at 110 dg. Our data also showed that some of these proteins are transcriptionally regulated and that PPARGC 1 A could be an important transcriptional factor...|$|E
40|$|Calving is a {{key event}} on any cattle farm, with both {{economic}} and animal welfare consequences when complications arise. Although mostly reported in <b>highly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>breeds,</b> problematic calving performance is also a worry to the unselected dualpurpose Murboden breed, local to Austria. This study presents genetic parameter estimates for calving ease and stillbirth in Murboden cattle. Furthermore, a potential effect of inbreeding on the breeds’ calving performance is evaluated. Results show a moderate direct and maternal heritability (0. 18 ± 0. 04; 0. 11 ± 0. 02) and a significant negative direct-maternal genetic correlation for calving ease (- 0. 41 ± 0. 10). Heritabilities of stillbirth are low yet significant (0. 048 ± 0. 01; 0. 018 ± 0. 007). A significant effect of inbreeding was detected on maternal calving ease i. e. {{the ease with which}} a dam calves. By categorizing the inbreeding coefficients of the dam in six ascending classes it was shown that calving ease worsens as inbreeding coefficients become larger. Results of this study reveal significant genetic variation in calving performance of the Murboden breed which opens doors for genetic selection. An additional important aspect {{of this study is that}} its result on inbreeding depression gives counterweight to the general intuitive notion in literature that high selection for production traits is the major contributor to calving difficulty in dairy and beef cattle breeds worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Two {{behaviours}} {{of honey}} bees, hygienic and grooming, are mechanisms {{of defense against}} brood diseases and parasitic mites, including Varroa destructor. Apis mellifera colonies remove the worker brood infested with Varroa destructor mites from the nest (hygienic behaviour), and groom the mites off other adult bees (grooming behaviour). In this study hygienic and grooming behaviours of Sjeničko-Pešterski honey bee ecotype were analysed in 440 honey bee colonies from 11 localities {{in the region of}} Sjeničko-Pešterski plateau, Podpešterje, Golija Mt. and Rogozna ML At each locality 40 honey bee colonies were investigated: 10 potent colonies with one-year old queen, 10 potent colonies with two-year old queen, 10 medium potent and 10 weak honey bee colonies. Hygienic behaviour was expressed in a range from 95. 12 % to 99. 50 % in potent honey bee colonies with one-year old and two-year old queens. Statistically highly significant (p< 0. 01) differences were registered among the analysed honey bee colonies at the investigated region, in favour of the potent honey bee colonies, compared to the medium potent and weak colonies. Also, statistically highly significant (p< 0. 01) differences were recorded between potent colonies with one-year old queens and colonies with two-year old queens, in favour of the colonies with one-year old queens. In general, investigated colonies belong to a category of the so called "hygienic colonies", as the efficiency of elimination of damaged pupae amounted to 91. 50 %. Grooming behaviour of Sjeničko-Pešterski honey bee ecotype potentially exists, but its significance cannot be discussed as, on the whole, investigated colonies showed potential of 34, 04 %. Our results point to an indisputable relationship between analysed behaviours and the strength of honey bee colonies: hygienic behaviour is more expressed in potent colonies (from 95. 12 % to 99. 50 %) regardless of queen age; grooming behaviour was expressed only in potent honey bee colonies with one-year old queen at all 11 localities, where the number of damaged mites ranged from 36, 05 % to 39, 61 %. The damaged mites were separated into six categories. The most frequent category of damage was damaged legs (53. 38 % in potent colonies with one-year old queens and 52. 02 % in potent colonies with two-year old queens). The potent honey bee colonies from the investigated region especially with one-year old queen, could be used for <b>highly</b> <b>selected</b> <b>breeds</b> improving and queens rearing...|$|R

In the introduction I would like to describe mainly the origin and domestication of cattle. Much of the work is also devoted to meat production, its control and eventually classification and monetising the final product according to a single system SEUROP applicable in countries European Union. In this chapter were simultaneously described factors of the most important facts affecting meat performance that affects the overall results of the breed, including its profitability. 	 The second half of the thesis summarizes the basics of cattle breeding, organization during the calendar year and grazing. There is an idea of reproduction, calving and basic measures during rearing and weaning calves. In other chapters, are explained the circumstances of the development of animal husbandry and the current status of beef breeds in the country.

40|$|Local sheep breeds from {{southern}} Italy have {{suffered in the}} last decades a severe population size decline due to replacement with <b>selected</b> <b>breeds.</b> Presently, interest in preserving these resources has grown up and attempts are being made to encourage farmers to rear native sheep breeds. Authentication and verification of the breed origin of sheep meat may represent a valuable tool of commercial valorization. This study aims to compare the statistical power in assigning sheep samples to their true bree (sarda and Comisana) prevalent on the national lamb market and five local rare sheep breeds from Southern Italy (Bagnolese, laticauda, Gentile di Puglia, Altamurana, Leccese) were type at 19 STR and 104 SNP loci. A Maximum Likelihood-based assignment test was adopted to evaluate the proportion of correct breed allocation. STR mrkers performed better than SNP markers in all the seven breeds (with an average percentage of corrct allocation equal to 99. 6 +- 0. 5 and 85. 9 +- 15. 5, respectively).

40|$|Abstract Background High {{selection}} pressure on domestic cattle {{has led to}} an undesirable increase in inbreeding, {{as well as to the}} deterioration of some functional traits which are indirectly selected. Semen stored in a cryobank may be a useful way to redirect selection or limit the loss of genetic diversity in a <b>selected</b> <b>breed.</b> The purpose of this study was to analyse the efficiency of current cryobank sampling methods, by investigating the benefits of using cryopreserved semen in a selection scheme several generations after the semen was collected. Methods The theoretical impact of using cryopreserved semen in a selection scheme of a dairy cattle breed was investigated by simulating various scenarios involving two negatively correlated traits and a change in genetic variability of the breed. Results Our results indicate that using cryopreserved semen to redirect selection will have an impact on negatively selected traits only if it is combined with major changes in selection objectives or practices. If the purpose is to increase genetic diversity in the breed, it can be a viable option. Conclusions Using cryopreserved semen to redirect selection or to improve genetic diversity should be carried out with caution, by considering the pros and cons of prospective changes in genetic diversity and the value of the selected traits. However, the use of genomic information should lead to more interesting perspectives to choose which animals to store in a cryobank and to increase the value of cryobank collections for <b>selected</b> <b>breeds.</b> </p...|$|R
