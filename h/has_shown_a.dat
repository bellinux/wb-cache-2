40|$|The {{species of}} {{succulent}} plants belong to several families of angiosperms and are&# 13; spread throughout several {{regions of the}} globe. In nature, many species of succulent plants are&# 13; endangered, especially {{as a result of}} human intervention in their natural habitats. In the climatic&# 13; conditions of Transylvania, Romania, a large number of succulent plants can be successfully&# 13; cultivated outdoors during their entire growth period by means of a special conditioning of the soil&# 13; with plastic foil and pebbles. Most of the species under scrutiny in the Agrobotanical Garden of the&# 13; University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>a</b> good or&# 13; satisfactory development. Two species only <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>an</b> unsatisfactory development.

In case of&# 13; the plants that require protection during their dormant period, out of 114 examined taxons, belonging&# 13; to 100 species, 102 taxons <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>a</b> good response, 12 taxons a satisfactory response and only&# 13; one taxon an unsatisfactory response. All the species under scrutiny <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>a</b> harmonious&# 13; development <b>showing</b> <b>a</b> nature-like habit, thanks to the favourable weather conditions during their&# 13; growing period (summer).

According to Svenska Dagbladet, support in 2011 was at 23 percent, and has risen somewhat significantly to 41 percent in September 2015, when only 39 {{percent of respondents}} were opposed to NATO membership. An October 2014 survey commissioned by TV4 News also showed slightly more respondents supporting membership than opposing it. In 2014, news that a military expert in Sweden had calculated that the country could hold out for a week if attacked temporarily lifted support for NATO membership in polls. A May 2017 poll by Pew showed that support for membership had risen to 47 percent.|$|E
5|$|Ruralurban {{migration}} is significant in Bintulu because of greater job availability in the town. Since 2007, new residents have started several squatter areas in Bintulu due to inability to find affordable housing, around Kidurong Industrial estate and Sungai Sebatang. To address the issue, several low-cost housing projects were initiated by BDA and Sarawak state government to relocate the squatters. The state government planned to achieve zero squatters status {{by the year}} 2020. Bintulu also saw {{the rise in the}} number of residential and commercial properties such as double-storeyed terraced houses, terraced shopoffices, Kidurong Commercial Centre, and Time Square Shopping Mall.

5|$|The Republic of Ireland <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>a</b> strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the}} top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft Quaternary glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>a</b> less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.|$|E

It was inhabited by the Saxons and mentioned in the Domesday book as Favreshant. The town was favoured by King Stephen who established Faversham Abbey, which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Subsequently, the town became an important seaport and established itself as a centre for brewing, and the Shepherd Neame Brewery, founded in 1698, remains a significant major employer.|$|E
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, {{it was a small}} city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized {{at the beginning of the}} century. During Japan's military buildup in the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city <b>has</b> <b>shown</b> <b>a</b> large increase in population in recent years, this trend results largely from the inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's economic revival strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E
