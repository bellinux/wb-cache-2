50|$|Water and gas taps have {{adjustable}} flow: {{gate valves}} are more progressive; ball valves more coarse, typically used in on-off applications. Turning a valve knob or lever sets adjusts flow by varying the aperture {{of the control}} device in the valve assembly. The result when opened in any degree is a choked flow. Its rate is independent of the viscosity or temperature of the fluid or gas in the pipe, and depends only weakly on the supply pressure, so that flow rate is stable at a given setting. At <b>intermediate</b> <b>flow</b> settings the pressure at the valve restriction drops nearly to zero from the Venturi effect; in water taps, this causes the water to boil momentarily at room temperature as it passes through the restriction. Bubbles of cool water vapor form and collapse at the restriction, causing the familiar hissing sound. At very low flow settings, the viscosity of the water becomes important and the pressure drop (and hissing noise) vanish; at full flow settings, parasitic drag in the pipes becomes important and the water again becomes quiet.|$|E

The result is divided into a liquid part that is the surface runoff and a second part that infiltrates.Second the soil moisture is calculated after defining an initial value and the field capacity (FC). Third calculation of the actual Evapotranspiration (ETPa), first by using an external model (ex: Penman) for finding the potential ETP and then fitting the result to the temperatures and the permanent wilting point(PWP) of the catchment in question. A parameter C which reflects {{the increase in the}} ETP with the differences in temperatures ( [...] Actual Temperature and Monthly mean Temperature).The model consists of considering the catchment as 2 reservoirs (S1 and S2) connected together by a percolation flow, the inflow to the first reservoir is calculated as the surface runoff which is what remains from the initial precipitations after calculating the infiltration and the evapotranspiration.The outflow from the first reservoir is divided into two separate flows (Q1 and Q2) where Q1 represents the fast flow which is trigered after a certain threshold L to be defined by the user and Q2 the <b>intermediate</b> <b>flow.</b> A constant K1 is used to find the outflows {{as a function of the}} storage in S1.To consider the percolation rate a constant Kd is used as along as the storage is S1.The outflow from the second reservoir is considered to be the groundwater flow (Q3) function of a constant K2 and the storage in S2.The total flow generated from a certain rain event is the sum of the 3 flows.The result of the model are later compared to the actual measured flow values and Nasch parameter is used to calibrate the model by changing the different parameters. The model has in total 9 parameters : TT,Cmelt,FC,C,PWP,L,K1,K2,Kd For a good calibration of the model it is better to use Monte-Carlo simulation or the GLUE-Method to properly define the parameters and the uncertainty in the model.The model is fairly reliable but as usual the need of good input data is essential for good results.HBV has been used for discharge modelling in many countries worldwide, including Brazil, China, Iran, Mozambique, Sweden and Zimbabwe. The HBV has also been used to simulate internal variables such as groundwater levels. The model has also been used for hydrological change detection studies.|$|E

Many restoration projects rely on diversions from the Mississippi River, but uncertainty exists about the timing {{and the amount of}} actually available sediment. This study examined long-term (1980 – 2010) suspended sediment yield as affected by different hydrologic regimes to determine actual suspended sediment availability and how this may affect diversion management. A stage hydrograph-based approach was employed to quantify total suspended sediment load (SSL) of the lower Mississippi River at Tarbert Landing during three river flow conditions: Peak Flow Stage (stage = 16. 8 m, discharge > 32, 000 m 3 s− 1), High Flow Stage (stage = 14. 6 m, discharge = 25, 000 – 32, 000 m 3 s− 1), and <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Flow</b> Stage (Stage = 12. 1 m, discharge = 18, 000 – 25, 000 m 3 s− 1). Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and SSL were maximized during High Flow and <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Flow</b> Stages, accounting for approximately 50 % of the total annual sediment yield, even though duration of the stages accounted for only one-third of a year. Peak Flow Stage had the highest discharge, but significantly lower SSC (p < 0. 05), indicating that diversion of the river at this stage would be less effective for sediment capture.

40|$|The {{intermediate}} flash {{region that}} develops downstream from the Mach disk during {{the discharge of}} a 7. 62 -mm rifle into ambient air is examined by laser-Doppler velocimetry. The objective is to investigate whether or not slip surfaces are formed which would prevent the entrainment of oxygen and, therefore, the initiation of combustion reactions in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>flow</b> region. In addition, local temperature histories are measured in this flow region during the discharge of the rifle into air, nitrogen, and oxygen using specially designed, intrusive temperature gauges.

Then local temperatures should increase with the oxygen content of the surroundings. It has been found from velocity data that slip surfaces are formed in the first few millimetres and then are absent. Also, the observed temperatures are ranked in the order T(N 2) smaller than T(air) small er than T(O 2).

40|$|Drought {{conditions}} in the Sabie catchment in the eastern Transvaal (now called Mpumalanga), South Africa, has had an observable effect on the sediment dynamics of the river. Sediment production within the catchment is largely unaffected by {{a reduction in the}} frequency and magnitude of rainfall events, although the rate of translocation of the weathered material from the catchment into the river channel is noticeably altered. The infrequent storm events during drought conditions generate a greater sed- iment input to the river from the catchment than a similar-magnitude event under average conditions. This sediment is also less likely to be transported through the system due to the reduced frequency of <b>intermediate</b> <b>flows</b> which act to rework in-channel sed- iment accumulations. Thus, significant accumulations of alluvial material are likely to form at specific locations, particularly where the local sediment transport capacity of the channel is low. Studies of the transport dynamics of the Sabie River, under both nor- mal and drought conditions, reveal that there are major depositional zones between Kruger Weir and Skukuza, and in the area around Lower Sabie. The 1992 drought resulted in a significant build-up of sediment in these areas, with a consequent reduc- tion in geomorphic diversity. This sediment is becoming stabilised due to the lower and less variable flows of the recent drought and associated vegetative colonisation. An increase in the magnitude and frequency of high and <b>intermediate</b> <b>flows</b> is needed to mobilise this accumulated sediment and to prevent its stabilisation by riparian vegetation...|$|R
