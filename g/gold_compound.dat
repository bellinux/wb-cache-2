The molecular mechanisms through which <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> produce their biological effects are still largely unknown {{and the subject}} of intense investigations. Recent studies point out that the mechanism of action of cytotoxic <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> are essentially DNA-independent and cisplatin-unrelated, most likely relying on gold interactions with a few crucial proteins. Notably, various cellular proteins playing relevant functional roles were proposed to represent effective targets for cytotoxic <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> but these hypotheses still need validation [1]. Our research group has focused attention on the likely protein targets for cytotoxic <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> and on the elucidation of their molecular mechanisms. At present this goal is being pursued through two distinct approaches that will be described in detail. On one hand, studies are being carried out on isolated proteins; their interactions with representative <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> are studied through independent biophysical methods. Particularly informative is the joint use of X-ray diffraction and ESI MS on small model proteins that allowed us to define the actual molecular mechanisms of protein metalation [2]. On the other hand, studies are directed to monitor the alterations in the cell proteome caused by cancer cell exposure to cytotoxic <b>gold</b> <b>compounds.</b> This goal may be achieved through classical proteomic strategies. In a recent study we considered the effects of the gold(III) complex Aubipyc on A 2780 ovarian cancer cells.

During the last two decades, a large variety of gold(I) and gold(III) compounds are reported to possess relevant antiproliferative properties in vitro against selected human tumor cell lines, qualifying themselves as excellent candidates for further pharmacological evaluation. The unique chemical properties of the gold center confer very interesting and innovative pharmacological profiles to gold-based metallodrugs.

Background: The {{continuous}} {{emergence of}} drug resistant strains of HIV {{as a result}} of errors made by reverse transcriptase coupled with undesirable side effects of available drugs, latency problems, cost etc, warrants the continuous search for new drug candidates. Chrysotherapy which is the use of <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> for the treatment of various ailments has been practiced since 2500 BC. The use of <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> such as auranofin for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has lead to remission of this disease. <b>Gold</b> <b>compounds</b> such as auranofin not only prevented the progression of arthritis but also increased the CD 4 + count of an HIV positive patient who was not on antiretrovirals. These compounds have been implicated in the treatment of cancers, autoimmune diseases and microorganism infections. Objectives: In this work, novel <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> were evaluated with the aim of identifying lead compound(s) that can eventually serve as anti-HIV agents. Materials and Methods: Eleven gold (I) phosphine complexes, four of their corresponding ligands (<b>compound</b> without <b>gold</b> atom), and a gold (III) complex were tested for the ability to inhibit reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) in direct enzyme assays. Uptake of the compounds by host cells was evaluated with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Potential toxicity of the <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> was screened for by viability dyes and flow cytometry assays. To determine inhibition of whole virus by other mechanisms in addition to RT or PR, p 24 production by infected cells was evaluated. Prior to all these analysis, stability of compounds in solution was determined by 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and UV-visible spectroscopy. Results: The compounds were shown to be stable in solution over a one week period and were taken up by both continuous cell lines and primary cells. Eight of the <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> significantly inhibited HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase at concentrations of 25 and 250 μM while four compounds and the four ligands did not. In a fluorogenic assay against HIV- 1 PR, four of the <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> demonstrated inhibitory activity.

40|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>compounds</b> form a {{new class}} of {{promising}} metal-based drugs with a number of potential therapeutic applications, particularly in the fields of anticancer and antimicrobial treatments. Previous research revealed that a group of structurally diverse <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> cause conspicuous inhibition of the protease activities of the human proteasome. Given the pharmacological importance of protease inhibition, the present study further explored whether these <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> might inhibit a few other proteases that are accepted druggable targets for disease treatment. In particular, four distinct cysteine proteases were considered here: cathepsin B and L that play a primary role in tumor-cell invasion and metastasis; rhodesain, the major cathepsin L-like cysteine protease of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and CPB 2. 8 ΔCTE, a Leishmania mexicana mature cysteine protease. Based on the encouraging results obtained for some of the tested <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> on the two parasitic cysteine proteases, especially against CPB 2. 8 ΔCTE, with IC 50 s in the micromolar range, we next evaluated whether those <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> might contrast effectively the growth of the respective protozoa and indeed important antiprotozoal properties were disclosed; on the other hand a certain lack of selectivity was highlighted.

40|$|The {{thioredoxin}} system plays a {{key role}} in regulating the overall intracellular redox balance. It basically comprises the small redox protein thioredoxin (Trx), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, in its reduced form (NADPH), and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), a large homodimeric selenzoenzyme controlling the redox state of thioredoxin. Details of the thioredoxin system are provided herein, particular emphasis being given to the protein chemistry of thioredoxin reductases. Several lines of evidence point out today that the thioredoxin system represents an effective "druggable" target for the development of new anticancer agents. Accordingly, a number of established anticancer agents were retrospectively found to be potent inhibitors of thioredoxin reductases and to induce severe oxidative stress. During the last decade a variety of <b>gold</b> <b>compounds,</b> either gold(I) or gold(III), were reported to manifest outstanding antitumor properties, forming a promising class of experimental anticancer agents. In turn, recent studies have revealed that several cytotoxic <b>gold</b> <b>Compounds,</b> either gold(I) or gold(III), are potent TrxR inhibitors. Details of their mechanism of selenoenzyme inhibition are currently under investigation, in our laboratory, and some new results will be anticipated here; notably, preferential gold targeting of active site selenolate could be experimentally supported. Based on the numerous experimental evidences now available, both at the molecular and cellular level, we propose that the relevant cytotoxic actions produced by <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> are mainly the result of potent inhibition of thioredoxin reductase; the alterations of mitochondrial functions, elicited by profound TrxR inhibition, would eventually lead to cell apoptosis.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of cancer cells is {{their ability to}} evade apoptosis and mitochondria {{play a critical role}} in this process. Delineating mitochondrial differences between normal and cancer cells has proven challenging due to the lack of matched cell lines. Here, we compare two matched liver progenitor cell (LPC) lines, one non-tumorigenic [p 53 -immortalized liver (PIL) 4] and the other tumorigenic (PIL 2). Analysis of these cell lines and a p 53 wild-type non-tumorigenic cell line [bipotential murine oval liver (BMOL) ] revealed an increase in expression of genes encoding the antiapoptotic proteins cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP) 1 and yes associate protein in the PIL 2 cells, which resulted in an increase in the protein encoded by these genes. PIL 2 cells have higher mitochondrial membrane potential (??m) compared with PIL 4 and BMOL and had greater levels of reactive oxygen species, despite the fact that the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide disumutase, was elevated at transcript and protein levels. Taken together, these results may account for the observed resistance of PIL 2 cells to apoptotic stimuli compared with PIL 4. We tested a new <b>gold</b> <b>compound</b> to show that hyperpolarized ??m led to its increased accumulation in mitochondria of PIL 2 cells. This compound selectively induces apoptosis in PIL 2 cells but not in PIL 4 or BMOL.

40|$|Small-angle x-ray {{scattering}} {{is used to}} study size distributions of noble metal nanoparticles embedded in polyelectrolyte hydrogels with oppositely charged surfactants. A procedure is proposed to subtract matrix scattering and to extract pure scattering due to the nanoparticles allowing to evaluate their size distribution functions {{by means of a}} regularization technique. Two kinds of collapsed gel-surfactant complexes were studied: a complex of a cationic gel of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) with an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (PDADMACl/SDS), and that of an anionic gel of poly(methacrylic acid) with a cationic surfactant cetylpyridinium chloride (PMA/CPC). Addition of a <b>gold</b> <b>compound</b> (HAuCl 4 ⋅ 3 H 2 O) (HAuCl 4 ⋅ 3 H 2 O) to the PDADMACl/SDS system forms the metal compound clusters and leads to a partial distortion of the gel structure. After subsequent reduction of the <b>gold</b> <b>compound</b> with sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) (NaBH 4) ordering in the gel disappears and gold nanoparticles are formed. Their size distribution includes a fraction of small particles with approximately {{the same size as the}} compound clusters before reduction and a fraction of larger particles with the radii up to 40 nm. For the collapsed PDADMACl/SDS gels, aging does not change the size distribution profile; for the noncollapsed PDADMACl gels without surfactant, metal particles are found to grow with time. This suggests that the aggregation of metal colloids is prevented by the ordering in the collapsed gel-surfactant complex. The addition of HAuCl 4 ⋅ 3 H 2 OHAuCl 4 ⋅ 3 H 2 O and the subsequent reduction of the metal ions in the PMA/CPC system does not distort the gel structure as the degree of incorporation of AuCl− 4 AuCl 4 − ions is very low. Particle sizes in the PMA/CPC system are found to be somewhat larger than those in the PDADMACl/SDS system. The PDADMACl/SDS gels loaded with the PtCl 4 PtCl 4 compound were also studied to analyze the influence of the reducing agent type on the particle size distribution distributions. Fast reduction with NaBH 4 NaBH 4 yielded mostly small particles with the radii around 2 nm grown from the compound clusters similar to those observed for the gold-loaded gels. In contrast, slow reduction with N 2 H 4 ⋅H 2 ON 2 H 4 ⋅H 2 O was found to produce larger nanoparticles and the size distribution function shows a major fraction of the particles with the radii up to 30 nm...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} gold(I) {{complexes}} (auranofin, triethylphosphine gold and aurothiomalate), gold(III) complexes ([Au(2, 2 ′-diethylendiamine) Cl]Cl 2, [(Au(2 -(1, 1 -dimethylbenzyl) -pyridine) (CH 3 COO) 2], [Au(6 -(1, 1 -dimethylbenzyl) - 2, 2 ′-bipyridine) (OH) ](PF 6), [Au(bipy dmb -H) (2, 6 -xylidine) ](PF 6)), metal ions (zinc and cadmium acetate) and metal complexes (cisplatin, zinc pyrithione and tributyltin) on mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase and mitochondrial functions have been examined. Both gold(I) and gold(III) complexes are extremely efficient inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase showing IC 50 ranging from 0. 020 to 1. 42 μM while metal ions and complexes not containing gold are less effective, exhibiting IC 50 going from 11. 8 to 76. 0 μM. At variance with thioredoxin reductase, auranofin is completely ineffective in inhibiting glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase, while gold(III) compounds show some effect on glutathione peroxidase. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is scarcely affected by <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> {{while the other}} metal complexes and metal ions, in particular zinc ion and zinc pyrithione, show a more marked inhibitory effect that is reflected on a rapid induction of membrane potential decrease that precedes swelling. Therefore, differently from <b>gold</b> <b>compounds,</b> the various metal ions and metal complexes exert their effect on different targets indicating a lower specificity. It is concluded that <b>gold</b> <b>compounds</b> are highly specific inhibitors of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase and this action influences other functions such as membrane permeability properties. Metal ions and metal complexes markedly inhibit the activity of thioredoxin reductase although to an extent {{lower than that of}} <b>gold</b> <b>compounds.</b> They also inhibit mitochondrial respiration, decrease membrane potential and, finally, induce swelling...|$|R
