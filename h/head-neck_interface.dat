40|$|This study {{predicts the}} {{frictional}} moments at the head-cup interface and frictional torques and bending moments {{acting on the}} <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface</b> of a modular total hip replacement {{across a range of}} activities of daily living. The predicted moment and torque profiles are based on the kinematics of four patients and the implant characteristics of a metal-on-metal implant. Depending on the body weight and type of activity, the moments and torques had significant variations in both magnitude and direction over the activity cycles. For the nine investigated activities, the maximum magnitude of the frictional moment ranged from 2. 6 to 7. 1 Nm. The maximum magnitude of the torque acting on the <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface</b> ranged from 2. 3 to 5. 7 Nm. The bending moment acting on the <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface</b> varied from 7 to 21. 6 Nm. One-leg-standing had the widest range of frictional torque on the <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface</b> (11 Nm) while normal walking had the smallest range (6. 1 Nm). The widest range, together with the maximum magnitude of torque, bending moment, and frictional moment, occurred during one-leg-standing of the lightest patient. Most of the simulated activities resulted in frictional torques that were near the previously reported oxide layer depassivation threshold torque. The predicted bending moments were also found at a level believed to contribute to the oxide layer depassivation. The calculated magnitudes and directions of the moments, applied directly to the head-neck taper junction, provide realistic mechanical loading data for in vitro and computational studies on the mechanical behaviour and multi-axial fretting at the <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|E

30|$|Trunnionosis {{is defined}} as the wear of the femoral <b>head–neck</b> <b>interface</b> and has been {{acknowledged}} as a source of total hip arthroplasty (THA) failure [1]. This phenomenon appears to have gained prevalence with newer THA implant designs, particularly when modularity was introduced. Modularity allows for a better intraoperative restoration of leg length and control of hip offset [2], but while this enables a more customized fit for the patient, it may have untoward effects. The modularity at times {{may play a role in}} increased wear and mechanical insufficiency at the trunnion, ultimately leading to revision [3]. In fact, trunnionosis is estimated to account for up to 3  % of all THA revision procedures [4, 5].|$|E
40|$|Objective: Recently, {{concerns}} have arisen about metal-on-metal (MoM) {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) due to their potential responsibility in systemic and local adverse reaction to metal debries (ARDM). Purposes {{of this study were}} to identify abnormal wear, observe the role of ions alarm levels in the diagnosis of ARDM and describe histopathology of soft tissues surrounding MoM-THAs failed. Methods: 59 primary MoM-THAs had follow-up consisting in periodical orthopedic controls using Oxford Hip Score (OHS), radiographs and testing whole blood cobalt and chromium ions. A Metal artifact reduction sequence (MARS) MRI and an eventual revision surgery was proposed to patients with anomalies in previous exams. During the surgery were collected material to exam. The prosthesis articular surface was analyzed by a contact-scanner, blood samples using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), while tissue morphology was graded in light microscopy. Results: 8 prosthesis need a revision. The mean linear wear was 2, 42 µm/year (range 0, 41 - 16, 54) for the femoral head and 1, 27 µm/year (range 0, 10 - 2, 98) for the liner. Light microscopy revealed significant signs of corrosion at the <b>interface</b> <b>head-neck</b> in 7 of these implants. Only in 3 MoM-THA revisioned, whole blood ions levels were higher than 7 µg/l actually indicated as alarm: mean chromium 5. 35 µg/l (range 0, 16 - 11, 95); mean cobalt 4, 37 µg/l (range 0, 35 - 18, 7). Histology of soft tissue revealed a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate and extensive superficial necrosis. Inflammatory cells pattern was different in each case. Conclusions: ARDM occurs also around MoM with low wear of bearing surfaces. Hypothesizing multiple sites of releasing metal particles, it could not be excluded ARDM also in others material matchings. Metal ions measurements can be used as diagnostic index of wear, but should be integrated with clinical and radiological aspects in a multilayer follow-up. The pathogenesis of ARDM is still unkown...|$|R
30|$|Trunnionosis {{is defined}} as wear of the femoral <b>head–neck</b> <b>interface</b> and has {{recently}} been acknowledged as a growing cause of total hip arthroplasty failure. Some studies have reported that it accounts for up to 3  % of all revisions. The exact cause of trunnionosis is currently unknown; however, postulated etiologies include modular junction wear, corrosion damage, and metal ion release. Additionally, implant design and trunnion geometries {{may contribute to the}} progression of component failure. In order to aid in our understanding of this phenomenon, our aim was to present the current literature on (1) the effect of femoral head size on trunnionosis, (2) the effect of trunnion design on trunnionosis, (3) localized biological reactions associated with trunnionosis, and (4) gross trunnion failures. It is hoped that this will encourage further research and interest aimed at minimizing this complication.|$|E
3000|$|The use of modular {{components}} greatly increases flexibility during THA {{but also}} introduces {{the risk of}} failures at the interfaces and possible intraoperative errors in matching. Dislocation {{is a potential problem}} after THA [1, 5, 6], and dissociation of modular components after dislocation is unique to modular systems. Dissociation can occur during closed reduction of dislocation at two different interface levels: the fixed acetabular shell–polyethylene liner interface [2, 7 – 13], and the femoral <b>head–neck</b> <b>interface</b> [2 – 4]. In the case reported here, dissociation occurred at the femoral neck–stem interface, with no previous traumatic incidence. To the best of our knowledge, no such case has been reported previously concerning this type of prostheses. The manner in which this incident occurred reveals inadequate modular component fixation or a repetitive force that provoked micromovement of the modular interface that finally led to component dissociation. Potential causes of dissociation during normal walking are: [...]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{modularity}} of femoral {{head and}} femoral stem provides many benefits to surgeons. However, case- reports have shown failure in large head Metal-on-Metal hip replacement due to trunnionosis. The exact causes of trunnionosis {{are not yet}} identified but the additional interface at the modular joint {{seems to be a}} contributing factor. In this study, a three dimensional non-linear finite element model was created to analyse the effects of head size and trunnion design on the micromotion at the <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface.</b> Four different metal head sizes and two trunnions designs and materials were used in the model. The femoral heads were assembled onto the trunnions with 7 kN axial force and one cycle of gait load was applied to the head after assembly. The study showed that the micromotion was substantially increased in femoral head larger than 36 mm. Trunnions material has greater effect on micromotion than trunnion design, particularly with the larger head sizes. The stability at the modular junction is important. Our findings suggest that there is a limit of assembly force to maintain enough stability on the joint; beyond this limit; the maximum micromotion will not be affected...|$|E
40|$|Background. Modular total hip arthroplasties are {{increasingly}} popular because customisation allows optimal restoration of patient biomechanics. However, {{the introduction of}} component interfaces provides greater opportunities for failure. We present a case of late nontraumatic dissociation of the <b>head-neck</b> <b>interface,</b> more than 10 years after insertion. Case Description. A 58 -year-old woman had a left metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty in 2002 for hip dysplasia. Following an uneventful 10 -year period, she presented to hospital in severe pain after standing from a seated position, and radiographs demonstrated complete dissociation of the modular femoral head from the stem, with the femoral head remaining in its cup. There was no prior trauma or infection. Mild wear and metallosis were present on the articulating surface between the femoral head and trunnion. Soft tissues were unaffected. Discussion and Conclusions. This is the latest occurrence reported to date for nontraumatic component failure in such an implant by more than 7 years. The majority of cases occur {{in the context of}} dislocation and attempted closed reduction. We analyse and discuss possible mechanisms for failure, aiming to raise awareness of this potential complication and encouraging utmost care in component handling and insertion, as well as the long term follow-up of such patients...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Membrane fusion {{within the}} Paramyxoviridae family of viruses is {{mediated}} by a surface glycoprotein termed the “F”, or fusion, protein. Membrane fusion {{is assumed to}} involve a series of structural transitions of F from a metastable (prefusion) state to a highly stable (postfusion) state. No detail {{is available at the}} atomic level regarding the metastable form of these proteins or regarding the transitions accompanying fusion. Results: The three-dimensional structure of the fusion protein of Newcastle disease virus (NDV-F) has been determined. The trimeric NDV-F molecule is organized into head, neck, and stalk regions. The head is comprised of a highly twisted β domain and an additional immunoglobulin-like β domain. The neck is formed by the C-terminal extension of the heptad repeat region HR-A, capped by a four-helical bundle. The C terminus of HR-A is encased by a further helix HR-C and a 4 -stranded β sheet. The stalk is formed by the remaining visible portion of HR-A and by polypeptide immediately N-terminal to the C-terminal heptad repeat region HR-B. An axial channel extends through the head and neck and is fenestrated by three large radial channels located approximately at the <b>head–neck</b> <b>interface.</b> Conclusion: We propose that prior to fusion activation, the hydrophobic fusion peptides in NDV-F are sequestered within the radial channels within the head, with the central HR-A coiled coil being only partly formed. Fusion activation then involves, inter alia, the assembly of a complete HR-A coiled coil, with the fusion peptides and transmembrane anchors being brought into close proximity. The structure of NDV-F is fundamentally different than that of influenza virus hemagglutinin, in that the central coiled coil is in the opposite orientation with respect to the viral membrane...|$|E
