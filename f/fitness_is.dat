5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. <b>Fitness</b> <b>is</b> measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> {{not the same as the}} total number of offspring: instead <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E

But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E

25|$|Inclusive fitness {{differs from}} {{individual}} fitness by including {{the ability of}} an allele in one individual to promote the survival and/or reproduction of other individuals that share that allele, in preference to individuals with a different allele. One mechanism of inclusive <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> kin selection.|$|E
25|$|Inclusive <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> {{the sum of}} an organism's {{classical}} fitness (how many of its own offspring {{it produces}} and supports) {{and the number of}} equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others. The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the association between perceived and aerobic physical fitness and both psychological functioning and physiological stress responsivity. Sixty nonsymptomatic participants (30 males, 30 females) participated in the experiment. Participants completed a series of personality and mood questionnaires {{as well as a}} laboratory procedure measuring cardiovascular responses (i. e., heart rate and blood pressure) while performing stressful laboratory tasks (i. e., the Stroop Color Naming Test and a sham IQ test). Aerobic fitness (i. e., VO 2 max using the Bruce protocol) as well as perceived <b>fitness</b> <b>were</b> also determined. Results suggest that perceived <b>fitness</b> <b>was</b> generally associated with positive personality and mood variables while aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>was</b> not.

25|$|The {{concept of}} a scalar valued fitness {{function}} f(s) also corresponds to the {{concept of a}} potential or energy function in physics. The two concepts only differ in that physicists traditionally think in terms of minimizing the potential function, while biologists prefer the notion that <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> being maximized. Therefore, taking the inverse of a potential function turns it into a fitness function, and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|This {{hypothesis}} was proposed by Alexey Kondrashov, and is sometimes {{known as the}} deterministic mutation hypothesis. It assumes {{that the majority of}} deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> known as synergistic epistasis.|$|E
25|$|If {{adaptation}} increasing population <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> {{slower than}} environmental degradation plus {{the accumulation of}} slightly deleterious mutations, then a population will go extinct. Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to fix in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause mutational meltdown.|$|E
25|$|The {{time that}} a freediver can spend {{underwater}} on a single excursion is severely restricted in comparison with scuba, and a considerably greater level of <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> required for longer breath-hold times. A scuba diver generally has sufficient time to recover from a minor disorientating incident in a cave, as there is sufficient breathing gas to perform the recovery procedures. This is not available to the freediver, who has only the oxygen still available in their system.|$|E

25|$|The biological/maturational account {{suggests}} that genetic <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> improved by having many memories that {{fall within the}} reminiscence bump. Cognitive capacities are at their optimum from the ages of 10 to 30 and the reminiscence bump may reflect a peak in cognitive performance. This account is therefore sometimes called the cognitive abilities account. Researchers {{have suggested that the}} increase of cognitive ability in early adulthood may cause memories during this time period to be more adequately stored (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). The reminiscence bump is caused by age-related differences in encoding efficiency, which cause more memories to be stored in adolescence and early adulthood.|$|E

25|$|Most genes {{have more}} than one effect on the {{phenotype}} of an organism (pleiotropism). Some of these effects may be visible, and others cryptic, so it is often important to look beyond the most obvious effects of a gene to identify other effects. Cases occur where a gene affects an unimportant visible character, yet a change in <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> recorded. In such cases the gene's other (cryptic or 'physiological') effects may be responsible for the change in fitness. Pleiotropism is posing continual challenges for many clinical dysmorphologists in their attempt to explain birth defects which affect one or more organ system, with only a single underlying causative agent. For many pleiotropic disorders, the connection between the gene defect and the various manifestations is neither obvious, nor well understood.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between fitness, BMI, and neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil concentrations in apparently healthy, nonsmoking men. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 452 men from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study examining the resting concentration of white blood cell subfractions across fitness (maximal METS during a treadmill exercise test) and fatness (BMI) categories after adjusting for age. RESULTS: <b>Fitness</b> <b>was</b> inversely associated with all WBC subfraction concentrations. After further adjusting for BMI, only total WBC, neutrophil, and basophil concentrations remained significantly associated with <b>fitness.</b> BMI <b>was</b> directly associated with total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and basophil concentrations and when <b>fitness</b> <b>was</b> added to the model, only monocytes lost significance. CONCLUSION: Fitness (inversely) and fatness (directly) are associated with WBC subfraction populations...|$|R
500|$|A related {{claim is}} that natural {{selection}} is tautological. Specifically, {{it is often}} argued that the phrase [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] is a tautology, in that <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> defined as ability to survive and reproduce. [...] This phrase was first used by Herbert Spencer in 1864 but is rarely used by biologists. Additionally, <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> more accurately defined as the state of possessing traits that make survival more likely; this definition, unlike simple [...] "survivability," [...] avoids being trivially true.|$|E

[...] The CPOX gene is located at 3q11.2-q12.1, has 6 introns and 7 exons and produces an mRNA strand that is 2675 bases in length. [...] It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that a deficiency of 50% of the normal enzyme activity is enough to cause symptoms. [...] As reproductive <b>fitness</b> <b>is</b> not impacted, homozygous affected individuals have been reported. [...] Along with other acute porphyrias HCP demonstrates reduced penetrance, meaning not all individuals who carry a disease-causing mutation will express symptoms.|$|E
