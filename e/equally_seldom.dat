60|$|So I go {{slowly up}} the hill, till the valley lies beneath {{me like a}} long green garden between its two banks of brown moor; and on through a cheerful little green, with red brick cottages {{scattered}} all round, each with its large neat garden, and beehives, and pigs and geese, and turf-stack, and clipt yews and hollies before the door, and rosy dark-eyed children, and all the simple healthy comforts of a wild 'heth-cropper's' home. When he can, the good {{man of the house}} works at farm labour, or cuts his own turf; and when work is scarce, he cuts copses and makes heath-brooms, and does a little poaching. True, he seldom goes to church, save to be christened, married, or buried: but he <b>equally</b> <b>seldom</b> gets drunk. For church and public stand together two miles off; so that social wants sometimes bring their own compensations with them, and there are two sides to every question.|$|E

This article will examine the political imagery created for an unusual patron, and used for an <b>equally</b> <b>seldom</b> discussed function. The objects of this discussion will be the emblematic decoration of banners, created as the main artefacts in a political spectacle devised by Vikentije Jovanovic (1731 - 1734), the Orthodox archbishop of Karlovci. The spectacle in question was the inauguration ceremony of the Illirian-Rascian regiment he founded in 1735. Postprin...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine what kind of values are {{considered}} self-evident {{on the level of}} culture, {{based on the assumption that}} advertisers and copywriters, wanting to sell their product as successfully as possible, appeal on values they consider to be dominant in the society. The main question discussed in this thesis is: what kind of values are dominant in advertisements of Eesti Ekspress – traditional, modernistic or post-modernistic? Are these values more individualistic or collectivistic? To answer these questions the author of the thesis used quantitative and qualitative content analysis. 54 whole page advertisements of Eesti Ekspress from 2005 were analyzed. The author concluded that on the individualism-collectivism scale the analyzed advertisements contained more individualistic and less universal values. In the category of individualistic values, most numerous were examples of hedonism, achievement and self-direction. In the category of collectivistic values security and benevolence most frequently occurred, in the category of universal values – harmony with the nature, world of beauty and inner harmony. On the traditionalism-modernism-postmodernism scale, mostly post-modernistic values were present. Traditional and modernistic values were more or less <b>equally</b> <b>seldom.</b> Mostly such post-modernistic values as enjoyment of life and nice things as well as comfort were represented. Most common traditional values were importance of family, importance of work, ethics and good manners. More frequent modernistic values were technology, social status and economy. To sum up one can say that conclusions of this thesis and results of value surveys conducted in Estonia are similar only on very general level – compared to other values, individualistic and post-modernistic values are represented a bit more frequently. Among collective values separate values related to security such as strong family, sense of togetherness and health have their firm position. As for separate values, the results are partly even contradictory. Only three types of values often used in advertisements have an important place in answers of residents of Estonia – health, strong family and freedom. So the thesis confirms the presumption that values carried by separate individuals do not always coincide with the values carried by the society as a whole...|$|E

40|$|The highly {{competitive}} nature of intercollegiate athletics {{has created an}} “arms race ” with schools commit-ting major resources to new and upgraded facilities. However, these facility resources are <b>seldom</b> <b>equally</b> spread amongst all sport programs. The hammer throw, a throwing event within track and field, often has competi-tion and practice venues that are overlooked or neglected. Significant injuries and deaths in this event warrant {{an examination of the}} hammer throw facilities from both a policy and risk management perspective. This study examined the level of compliance for National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hammer throw facili-ties with NCAA and International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) recommendations for facilities across all three NCAA divisions via a 35 -item online survey. Respondents indicated 69. 6 % of hammer facili-ties were in compliance with NCAA guidelines while only 35. 8 % complied with the more stringent IAAF stan...|$|R
6000|$|We may {{impute to}} the same general cause (the greater need of {{protection}} for the female, owing to her weaker flight, greater exposure to attack, and supreme importance)--the fact of the colours of female insects being so very generally duller and less conspicuous {{than those of the}} other sex. And that it is chiefly due to this cause rather than to what Mr. Darwin terms [...] "sexual selection" [...] appears to be shown by the otherwise inexplicable fact, that in the groups which have a protection of any kind independent of concealment, sexual differences of colour are either quite wanting or slightly developed. The Heliconidæ and Danaidæ, protected by a disagreeable flavour, have the females as bright and conspicuous as the males, and very rarely differing at all from them. The stinging Hymenoptera have the two sexes equally well coloured. The Carabidæ, the Coccinellidæ, Chrysomelidæ, and the Telephori have both sexes <b>equally</b> conspicuous, and <b>seldom</b> differing in colours. The brilliant Curculios, which are protected by their hardness, are brilliant in both sexes. Lastly, the glittering Cetoniadæ and Buprestidæ, which seem to be protected by their hard and polished coats, their rapid motions, and peculiar habits, present few sexual differences of colour, while sexual selection has often manifested itself by structural differences, such as horns, spines, or other processes.|$|R
40|$|Fiscal {{pressure}} and demographic change lead governments to seek ways of reducing state expenditure on pensions. Individuals {{are asked to}} take more responsibility, and funded, supplementary pension schemes have been established in many countries. This article looks at schemes that are voluntary – the NEST or Personal Accounts scheme in Britain and the Riester Pension scheme in Germany. It examines the debate about whether it is worthwhile for some people to participate in pension schemes that are not mandatory – particularly those with low incomes and/or potentially broken careers. The small pensions they accumulate in such schemes merely offset entitlements to means-tested pension benefits, leaving them no better off in old age. Concerns about the behavioural consequences of pension means-testing are not new. Nonetheless, few policymakers {{have been willing to}} look at when and how such concerns were expressed in the context of voluntary pension savings. <b>Equally,</b> they have <b>seldom</b> been prepared to explain the costs involved in guaranteeing savings-based pensions or the implications that the lack of offering such a guarantee might have for individual behaviour. The state has sought for people to take greater ‘self-responsibility’ for their retirement income, but many people wish for some certainty with respect to the pensions they can expect. These goals might well be in conflict. Whether the ‘state pension for the 21 st century’, as proposed by the UK government, will succeed in satisfying the objectives both of the state and of pension savers remains an open question...|$|R
