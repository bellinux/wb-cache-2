5000|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that schizophrenia {{may be due to}} an increase or a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> glutamate signaling, leading to abnormal excitatory signaling in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain. [...] Glutamate release by astrocytes has been linked to the synchrony of neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> system Xc- activity may result in an increase in synaptic glutamate and a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> extrasynaptic glutamate. Administration of N-acetylcysteine leads to an increase in extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation, suggesting that glutamate released from system Xc- may cause the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> system Xc- activity may cause a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors due to either a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> extrasynaptic Glutamate levels or a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> glutathione levels after the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> cystine transport. On the other hand, a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> system Xc- activity may lead to an increase in the activation of synaptic NMDA receptors due to the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> activation of Group 2 mGluRs. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> nonvesicular release of glutamate leads to an increase in expression of postsynaptic glutamate receptors, such as NMDA receptors. A disruption in nonvesicular glutamate release may affect synapse formation, lead to altered release of neurotransmitters, and could even disturb cortical migration during development. All of these seem to be associated with schizophrenia.|$|R

This results in an ash fall deposit which generally <b>decreases</b> <b>in</b> thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano.

It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E
