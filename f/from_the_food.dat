5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form}} of macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The leopard seal, a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> they eat.|$|E

5|$|Springbok are {{primarily}} browsers and may switch to grazing occasionally; they feed on shrubs and young succulents (such as Lampranthus species) before they lignify. They prefer grasses such as Themeda triandra. Springbok can meet their water needs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> they eat, {{and are able}} to survive without drinking water through dry season. In extreme cases, they do not drink any water over the course of their lives. Springbok may accomplish this by selecting flowers, seeds, and leaves of shrubs before dawn, when the food items are most succulent. In places such as the Etosha National Park, springbok seek out water bodies where they are available. Springbok gather in the wet season and disperse during the dry season, unlike other African mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral digestion. Insects using extra-oral digestion expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract {{a significant proportion of}} the available nutrients <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> source. The gut is where almost all of insects' digestion takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
5|$|Different bat {{species have}} {{different}} diets including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy though flight, bats must consume {{large amounts of}} food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. Predatory bats typically hunt at night, reducing competition with birds, and minimizing contact with certain predators. They can travel large distances, up to , in search of food. Bats are not restricted to any one hunting strategy, but rather use a mix. The bite force of small bats is generated through mechanical advantage, allowing them to bite through the hardened armor of insects or the skin of fruit. Bats get most of their water needs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> they eat. However, numerous species may drink from water sources like lakes and streams. They may fly over the water surface and dip their tongues.|$|E
