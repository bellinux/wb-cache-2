25|$|After 25 {{years from}} the {{introduction}} of the first-generation Range Rover, the second-generation Range Rover—model-designation P38A—was introduced for the 1995 model year, with an updated version of the Rover V8 engine. There was also the option of a 2.5-litre BMW six-cylinder turbo-diesel with a Bosch injection pump. This was the first <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> with electronic controls in a Land Rover, before common rails were introduced. This was a result of BMW's subsequent ownership of Rover Group and hence the Land Rover brand. The new model offered more equipment and premium trims, positioning the vehicle above the Land Rover Discovery to face the increased competition in the SUV marketplace. This model was the last to feature the Rover V8 and interior leather supplied by Connolly who went out of business in 2002. It was the first model to feature Satellite Navigation as an option.|$|E
2500|$|Vegetable oil {{can also}} be used in many older diesel engines that do not use common rail or unit {{injection}} electronic <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in indirect injection engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [...] VW TDI engines and other similar engines with direct injection. Several companies, such as Elsbett or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.|$|E

40|$|Recent papers [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] have {{proposed}} two different systems to more efficiently and more rapidly burn the fuel in highly boosted, high compression ratio, directly injected internal combustion engines permitting multi-mode combustion operation. In a first system, a second direct injector is {{coupled with the}} standard Diesel direct injector and glow plug. The second direct injector introduces {{the most of the}} fuel while the Diesel direct injector only introduces a minimum amount of fuel to control the start of the combustion about top dead centre. The fuel injected before the <b>Diesel</b> ignition <b>injection</b> burns premixed, the fuel injected after the <b>Diesel</b> ignition <b>injection</b> burns diffusion. This design permits combustion premixed gasoline-like if all the fuel is injected before the <b>Diesel</b> ignition <b>injection,</b> diffusion Diesel-like if all the fuel is injected after the <b>Diesel</b> ignition <b>injection</b> (as done in the Westport High Pressure Direct Injection concept [12]), and mixed gasoline/Diesel like injecting the fuel before and after the <b>Diesel</b> ignition <b>injection.</b> The premixed gasoline-like mode is actually a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) -like mode, where an amount of fuel smaller than the threshold value producing top dead centre auto ignition is then ignited at top dead centre by the <b>Diesel</b> ignition <b>injection</b> in a more robust, stable and repeatable operation unaffected by small changes in properties and composition of the fuel and air mixture...|$|R

50|$|Rudolf Diesel {{patented}} the {{compression-ignition engine}} in 1892; however his injection system, where combustion was produced isobarically (the technique having been patented by George Brayton in 1874 for his carburettor), was not subsumed into later engines, Akroyd-Stuart's injection system with isochoric combustion developed at Hornsbys being preferred. However the airblast method {{was the only}} capable technique for introducing and vaporizing heavier fuel in the cylinder until <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> systems were developed by Bosch, and although similar in mechanism to modern <b>diesel</b> <b>injection</b> system the fuel delivery system in hot oil engines did not vaporize oil so in essence Rudolph Diesel's solution is the forerunner of modern diesel engines where fuel is vaporized as well as pressurized by the fuel delivery system and not by thermal vaporization in an internal hot chamber.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{high pressure}} <b>diesel</b> fuel <b>injection</b> into the combustion chamber by performing computational simulations using the Euler-Eulerian multiphase approach. Six diesel-like conditions were simulated {{for which the}} liquid fuel jet was injected into a pressurised inert environment (100 % N 2) through a 205 µm nozzle hole. The analysis {{was focused on the}} liquid jet and vapour penetration, describing spatial and temporal spray evolution. For this purpose, an Eulerian multiphase model was implemented, variations of the sub-model coefficients were performed, and their impact on the spray formation was investigated. The final set of sub-model coefficients was applied to all operating points. Several simulations of high pressure <b>diesel</b> <b>injections</b> (50, 80, and 120 MPa) combined with different chamber pressures (5. 4 and 7. 2 MPa) were carried out and results were compared to the experimental data. The predicted results share a similar spray cloud shape for all conditions with the different vapour and liquid penetration length. The liquid penetration is shortened with the increase in chamber pressure, whilst the vapour penetration is more pronounced by elevating the injection pressure. Finally, the results showed good agreement when compared to the measured data, and yielded the correct trends for both the liquid and vapour penetrations under different operating conditions...|$|R
