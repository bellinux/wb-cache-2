50|$|<b>Fedotozine</b> (INN; JO 1196 for the (-) {{tartrate}} salt) is an opioid drug of the arylacetamide series {{which acts}} as a peripherally-specific, selective κ1-opioid receptor agonist with preference for the κ1A subtype. It was under investigation {{for the treatment of}} gastrointestinal conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia and made it to phase III clinical trials, but ultimately development was discontinued and it was never marketed.|$|E
5000|$|Eluxadoline is a {{peripherally}} restricted KOR agonist {{as well as}} MOR agonist and DOR antagonist {{that has}} been approved {{for the treatment of}} diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Asimadoline and <b>fedotozine</b> are selective and similarly peripherally restricted KOR agonists that were also investigated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome and reportedly demonstrated at least some efficacy for this indication but were ultimately never marketed.|$|E
40|$|Background—Peripheral kappa {{receptor}} agonists {{may provide}} a new therapeutic approach {{for the treatment of}} functional dyspepsia.  Aims—To evaluate, in a large multicentre trial, the use of the kappa receptor agonist <b>fedotozine</b> to improve symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia.  Methods—Two {{or more of the following}} persistent symptoms were required for inclusion: epigastric pain, early satiety, epigastric fullness or distension, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of slow digestion. On completing a two week placebo washout, 271 patients were randomised into two groups to receive 30 mg <b>fedotozine</b> three times daily or placebo for six weeks under double blind conditions.  Results—The improvement in the overall intensity of dyspeptic symptoms (main efficacy criterion) was significantly more pronounced in the <b>fedotozine</b> group (p= 0. 002) compared with placebo, as was epigastric pain (p= 0. 004) and nausea (p= 0. 01); the improvement in postprandial fullness was nearly significant (p= 0. 052). Inability to finish a meal and slow digestion were unaffected. The patient global score, the average of the five individual symptoms, was notably ameliorated with <b>fedotozine</b> (p= 0. 021). The safety of <b>fedotozine</b> was excellent.  Conclusions—Fedotozine at 30 mg three times daily is safe and more effective than placebo for the relief of key symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia. ...|$|E
40|$|In a rat {{model of}} {{postoperative}} ileus, induced by abdominal surgery, we investigated {{the effect of}} mu- and kappa-opioid receptors. Different degrees of inhibition of the gastrointestinal transit, measured by the migration of Evans blue, were achieved by skin incision, laparotomy or laparotomy plus manipulation of the gut. Morphine (1 mg/kg), a preferential mu-opioid receptor agonist, significantly inhibited the transit after skin incision, while the transit after the laparotomy with or without manipulation was not significantly affected. <b>Fedotozine</b> (5 mg/kg), a peripheral kappa-opioid receptor agonist, enhanced the transit after laparotomy plus manipulation, while naloxone (1 mg/kg), a non-specific opioid receptor antagonist, further inhibited the transit after laparotomy plus manipulation. Naloxone and <b>fedotozine</b> alone {{had no effect on}} the transit after skin incision or laparotomy without manipulation. However, naloxone prevented the effect of morphine on the transit after skin incision and of <b>fedotozine</b> on the laparotomy plus manipulation. These results support a role for peripheral kappa-opioid receptors in the pathogenesis of postoperative ileus induced by abdominal surger...|$|E
40|$|Endogenous opioid {{peptides}} – enkephalins, beta-endorphin and dynorphins – {{are located}} in specific sites of the brain, the spinal cord, the autonomic ganglia and the enteric nervous system. Endogenous opioids participate in the regulation of nervous visceral afference and sensitivity {{as well as of}} several visceral motor function induced by the central nervous system and through the enteroenteric and the myoenteric reflexes. Their final effect on gut physiology is the net and harmonically balanced result of their binding to mu, delta and kappa opioid receptor subtypes. Exogenous opioid receptor ligands with different affinities for the opioid receptor subtypes have been effectively used to modify and normalize altered gut functions. Themureceptor agonists – morphine and, to a greater extent, the meperidine congeners diphenoxylate and loperamide – have been shown to slow gastrointestinal transit by their effects on the circular and longitudinal muscle of the intestine. Diphenoxylate and, more efficiently, loperamide, for the lack of any effect on the central nervous system, have been usefully employed in the treatment of diarrhea in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Unlike the mu receptor agonists morphine and loperamide, which invariably stimulate colonic motility, trimebutine, which has almost equal affinity for mu, delta and kappa receptors, has no effect on normal colonic activity but reduces the abnormal increase in postprandial motor activity in IBS patients and accelerates slow large bowel transit in constipated patients. Opioid ligands can be usefully employed to normalize altered visceral sensitivity in IBS patients. The kappa receptor agonist <b>fedotozine</b> exerts its antinociceptive effect by acting on peripheral nerve endings of sensory vagal and nonvagal afferent pathways. <b>Fedotozine</b> has been shown to increase the threshold of perception to colonic distension in experimental conditions and to affect favourably symptoms of IBS in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} {{relating to}} the site and mechanism of action of “centrally acting ” agents which may affect visceral sensitivity is reviewed. Antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline {{as well as the}} newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are thought to act {{at the level of the}} CNS. Opiates, including morphine as well as compounds such as trimebutine or <b>fedotozine</b> designed for therapeutic use in irritable bowel syndrome, are effective in reducing visceral nociception. Cytokines in the CNS are known to be involved in the modulation of pain and there is also evidence to suggest that centrally acting cytokines may play a role in the production of visceral hypersensitivity. Consequently, they may provide an interesting target for future research. SUMMARY This paper reviews evidence {{relating to the}} site and mechanism of action of “centrally acting” agents which may affect visceral sensitivity. Anti-depressant drugs such as amitriptyline as well as the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are thought to act at the level of the cen-tral nervous system (CNS). There is increasing evidence that the peripheral effects of these drugs may contribute to their ability to attenuate somatic pain but there is no evidence that these compounds affect visceral sensitivity per se. Opiates, including morphine and drugs such as trimebutine and <b>fedotozine,</b> are effective at reducing visceral nociception, and recent data suggest that this occurs as a result of a peripheral action at the level of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). One possibility is that visceral stimulation induces long term alterations in the CNS. Cytokines in the CNS are known to be involved in the modulation of pain and there is also evidence to suggest that centrally acting cytokines may play a role in the production of visceral hypersen-sitivity. Consequently, they provide an interesting target for future research...|$|E
40|$|Efficacy {{and safety}} of <b>fedotozine</b> (FZ), a {{peripheral}} K agonist, were {{compared to that of}} placebo (PL) in patients with functional dyspepsia. Methods. A phase Ill, double blind, parallel group trial was carried out in UK and Eire by 25 hospital or general practice centers. The entry criteria were: presence of 2 or more post-prandial dyspeptic symptoms occurring at least 3 times a week in the previous 3 months; the symptoms included epigastric pain, early satiety, epigastric fullness or distension, nausea or vomiting, feeling of slow digestion. Each patient had negative gastroduodenoscopy, upper abdominal ultrasound and routine blood tests. Patients completed a diary card daily and rated the overall intensity of their symptoms (main criterion) as well as the intensity of each dyspeptic symptom using a 5 point scale. 333 patients entered the trial. At the end of the run-in period lasting 7 to 14 days, patients with a low symptomatic score were excluded. 271 patients (139 F/ 132 M, aged 42 ± 14 yrs, m ± SD) were randomized to receive either oral FZ, 30 mg tid (n = 140) or PL tid (n = 131) for 6 weeks. Intent-totreat analysis was performed comparing the mean over the 6 wk treatment adjusted for the baseline value (ancova). Results. FZ and PL groups were comparable before treatment. During treatment, the improvement for the overall intensity of dyspeptic symptoms was significantly higher (treatment effect: 0. 180; 95...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Current {{approaches}} to treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) aim to normalise disturbed intestinal physiology. The most effective centrally acting drugs are tricyclic antidepressants. Alosetron, a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist {{is effective in}} women with diarrhea-predominant IBS whilst tegaserod and prucalopride are 5 -HT 4 agonists enhancing bowel motility in constipation-predominant IBS. Serotonergic receptor modulation has been the first targeted pharmacological intervention. The development of new drugs constitutes a major challenge as there are many targets along the brain-gut axis and the enteric nervous system (ENS). Newer tricyclic antidepressants with fewer side effects and corticotrophin releasing factor- 1 (CRF- 1) antagonists are examples of future centrally acting drugs. Agents that alter visceral sensitivity include kappa-opioid agonists (<b>fedotozine,</b> trimebutine, asimadoline), alpha- 2 adrenoreceptor agonists (clonidine, lidamidine), tachykinin receptor antagonists (neurokinin A, substance P) and other experimental anti-nociceptive drugs (GABA-B receptor agonists). COX- 2 inhibitors may be effective for postinfectious IBS. Drugs potentially useful in controlling intestinal motility and secretion other than serotonergic receptors modulators, include muscarinic receptors antagonists (derifenacin, zamenifenacin), octreotide and CCK- 1 receptor antagonists (dexloglumide). Neurotrophins (NT- 3 and brain derived neurotrophic factor) are promising factors {{for the treatment of}} IBS patients with constipation. The development of new and effective drugs for IBS requires a more detailed understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, a fact that will allow us a more targeted intervention.
