25|$|It {{is often}} {{considered}} that holding {{the rank of}} makushita {{is the first step}} toward becoming a professional (sekitori ranked) sumo wrestler. Furthermore, it can be regarded as the most heavily contested division, with younger sumo wrestlers on their way up competing with those older sumo wrestlers who have dropped from jūryō and are determined to regain the higher rank. A key incentive is the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>being</b> ranked in the topmost makushita slot versus the lowest jūryō rank, which has been likened to being that between heaven and hell: A wrestler ranked at makushita or lower is expected to carry out chores for the stable and any sekitori within it, whereas the jūryō wrestler will be served upon. Similarly the jūryō wrestler receives a comfortable monthly salary, whereas a wrestler below makushita still only receives a small living allowance.|$|E
500|$|Before 1916, American {{scholars}} {{doubted that}} sharks would fatally wound a living {{person in the}} temperate waters of the northeastern United States without provocation. One skeptical scientist wrote, [...] "There is a great <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>being</b> attacked by a shark and being bitten by one." [...] He believed that sharks tangled in fishing nets or feeding on carrion might accidentally bite a nearby human. In 1891, millionaire banker and adventurer Hermann Oelrichs offered a $500 reward in the New York Sun [...] "for an authenticated case of a man having been attacked by a shark in [...] temperate waters" [...] north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. He wanted proof that [...] "in temperate waters even one man, woman, or child, while alive, was ever attacked by a shark." [...] The reward went unclaimed and scientists remained convinced that the upper eastern coast of the United States was inhabited by harmless sharks.|$|E

500|$|The Rainmen went on {{to qualify}} for the 2015 Finals against the Windsor Express. In their Game 1 defeat, Clinkscales {{committed}} three fouls within the first 12 minutes, but still managed to score 13 points. The series featured several physical and verbal altercations, and after it was tied at three games apiece, the Rainmen chose to forfeit the deciding seventh game. Prior to the contest, a brawl occurred between members of both sides. The league fined Clinkscales, along with ten of his teammates, $5,000 each for poor sportsmanship on the court. They were also suspended indefinitely from the NBL Canada during the investigation. Commenting on the incident, Clinkscales later explained, [...] "We practice hard against each other, we beat each other up, but there's a <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>being</b> physical and dirty and hurting people." [...] The league fined players, coaches, and teams a total of $90,000, and the Rainmen ultimately collapsed after facing bankruptcy. Clinkscales ended the season averaging 6.6 points, 5.9 assists, and 1.4 steals per game.|$|E

2500|$|On the entropy {{scale of}} {{information}} gain {{there is very}} little difference between near certainty and absolute certainty—coding according to a near certainty requires hardly any more bits than coding according to an absolute certainty. On the other hand, on the logit scale implied by weight of evidence, {{the difference between the two}} is enormous – infinite perhaps; this might reflect the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>being</b> almost sure (on a probabilistic level) that, say, the Riemann hypothesis is correct, compared to being certain that it is correct because one has a mathematical proof. [...] These two different scales of loss function for uncertainty are both useful, according to how well each reflects the particular circumstances of the problem in question.|$|E

As Robin wakes up to embrace Regina, she is more {{concerned}} with the Once Upon a Time book and explains to Robin she that wants to find her happy ending and the author. Robin takes it upon himself to help Regina find the book's origins, so he steals the book after Regina raced off to the loft and pays a visit to Granny's, where he sees Will pouring his [...] "Lunch and Dinner" [...] (from a liquor flask) and asks for his help. Will tells Robin about how the events played out in Storybrooke until Emma's arrival and points to the place where it began. The two stop by the library, where after searching through several books, Robin notices a page falling out of his bag. He then calls Regina, who while helping the others find Emma was talking to Mary Margaret about the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>being</b> a hero and a villain. Regina was comforted by Mary Margret who insisted that neither one of them were all good or all evil. As Regina leaves to meet Robin, Mary Margret tells her that happy endings are hard to come by, but that she can have one if she is willing to fight for it.|$|E

The number of red blood cells showed no changes in statistical terms, the <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> batches <b>being</b> insignificant (p < 0. 5).
