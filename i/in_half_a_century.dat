500|$|On May 2, 2011, after a five-week campaign, Harper led the Conservatives {{to their}} third {{consecutive}} election victory—the {{first time a}} centre-right party has accomplished this <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> The Conservatives increased their standing in parliament to 166, up from 143 at {{the dissolution of the}} previous parliament. This resulted in the first centre-right majority government since the Progressive Conservatives won what would be their last majority in 1988. The Conservatives also received a greater number of total votes than in 2008. [...] Notably, the Conservatives had a significant breakthrough in southern Ontario, a region where neither they nor the Reform/Alliance side of the merger had done well in the previous two decades. They managed to win several seats in Toronto itself; no centre-right party had won seats in the former Metro Toronto since 1988.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Barry Bonds {{established}} the current record of 73 {{home runs in}} a single season. There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled {{in large part by}} the abuse of illegal steroids (as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion), but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance-enhancing drugs before 2004. In 2007, Bonds became MLB's all-time home run leader, surpassing Hank Aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs. Even though McGwire, Sosa, and Bonds—as well as many other players, including storied pitcher Roger Clemens—have been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal, their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues' defining attraction. In contrast to the professional game's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption, Little League enrollment was in decline: after peaking in 1996, it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade. With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance-enhancing drug use a possible factor, the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010, which became known as the [...] "Year of the Pitcher". Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years, and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been <b>in</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

Offshore the Southeastern United States, the ship Lavinia en route to New Orleans from New York City intercepted the powerful hurricane. A combination of high waves and strong winds caused severe damage to the vessel, and it was saved only by the storm's passage. Almost simultaneously, the ship Brandt from Charleston, South Carolina bound for New York encountered winds that [...] "blew a perfect hurricane," [...] with its sails torn apart and reduced to bare poles. Tumbled about by southwesterly winds and a strong current, the vessel soon found itself in [...] waves, with up to [...] of standing water in the hold. A 14-year-old boy was washed overboard. Aided by a French frigate, as well as a lessening of the tumultuous weather, the ship eventually found ground in Norfolk. In late August, passengers aboard the schooner Mary Ellen from Baltimore observed a second schooner partially dissembled. She soon also intercepted the system and was knocked on its side by a large wave. It was righted and continued on its course to Charleston, but not before sustaining substantial damage. Another schooner, the Solon from New Orleans, passed through the hurricane offshore the Georgia or South Carolina coastlines. Massive waves wrecked the ship, washing overboard all passengers except the captain and his crew member. Both men were rescued by the Mary Eleanor of Savannah, Georgia, but the captain died a day later from fatigue. Although the eye of the cyclone passed well east of Charleston, winds [...] "blew with great violence" [...] for six hours. Only minimal damage occurred in the city and surrounding areas as the storm passed by during low tide.|$|E
