From some of <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> samples, enterococci including Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens, and S. faecium were identified, but S. durans was not detected. These three spp. of enterococcus did not grow in yolk-free egg white, but grew well in egg white containing small quantities of egg yolk. These enterococci hardly decreased by the pasteurization in various conditions including Cunningham and Lineweaver's method. In the desugaring process by glucose oxidase method these enterococci perished, but in yeast or bacteria fermentation of yolk-free egg white, the counts of these enterococci hardly changed. Small counts of presumable enterococci perished in the spontaneous fermentation of yolk-free egg white, but increased rapidly in the fermentation of the egg white containing 0. 15 % yolk.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{functional}} proteins {{was not born}} until the 1950 s and, initially, the only commercially-produced functional proteins were merely dried fresh foods, for example <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> and non-fat dried milk. These products were similar to their fresh counterparts and no attempt was made in food industry to purify or fractionate proteins. The use of purified proteins was first achieved in other industries. For example, casein had been produced for many years piror to its isolation for food usage for plastic production and paper coating. The production of functional proteins accelerated in 1960 s with the production of soya isolate and sodium caseinate.

This strength is a meas-ure of the extent of the thermal treatment, the egg white ability to bind water, and is monitored as a quality parameter by the manufacturers of <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> (K�� � et al. 1990). The method of the gel strength measurement is described in the materials of the company Taiyo Kagaku Co. (1988). The Food Research Institute Prague, the Czech Republic, further improved this method (K��� � et al. 1997), which was supported by {{the development of a new}} device (GS-meter) enabling the measurement of this parameter in the manufacturers ’ laboratories. In the course of its industrial treatment, the egg white occasionally significantly changes its proper-ties, especially viscosity. Homogenisation and filtra-tion under pressure compress the egg white into firm, highly viscous cords, which are untreatable and frequently put the production equipment out of order. Variations of these properties manifest them selves particularly in the ability of foam generation, its stability and firmness, and influence the strength of the gel prepared of such egg whites. This is the reason why we decided to monitor systematically the influence of the native egg white properties on the gel strength and studied the gel strength in the dependence on pH value, the dry ma�er content, the age of eggs, and the hen genus.

The average molecular weight of DEW products with alkaline pHs was relatively higher than those with neutral pHs and the same degree of protein unfolding, probably because of more disulfide bond formation between protein molecules. In addition, strong correlations were found between hydrophobicity, surface SH groups plus average molecular weight of DEW-SPA, and physical properties of the gels from DEW products.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in texturally and nutritionally satisfying vegetable alternatives for meat. Wheat gluten proteins have unique functional properties but a poor nutritional value in comparison to animal proteins. This study investigated the potential of egg white and bovine milk casein with well-balanced amino acid composition to increase the quality of wheat gluten-based protein-rich foods. RESULTS: Heating a wheat gluten (51. 4 g) - water (100. 0 ml) blend for 120 minutes at 100 °C increased its firmness less than heating a wheat gluten (33. 0 g) - freeze <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> (16. 8 g) - water (100. 0 ml) blend. In contrast, the addition of casein to the gluten-water blend negatively impacted firmness after heating. Firmness was correlated to loss of protein extractability in sodium dodecyl sulfate containing medium during heating, which was higher with egg white than with casein. Even more, heat-induced polymerization of the gluten-water blend with egg white but not with casein was larger than expected from the losses in extractability of gluten and egg white on their own. CONCLUSION: Structure formation was favored by mixing gluten with egg white but not with casein. These observations were linked to the intrinsic polymerization behavior of egg white and casein, but also to their interaction with gluten. Thus, not all nutritionally suitable proteins {{can be used for}} enrichment of gluten-based protein-rich foods. status: publishe...|$|E

Variations in source and type of chick, source of egg white, and the main source of energy were made in an attempt to correct these conditions. When zinc was limiting and sucrose {{was the source}} of energy, consistent differences in growth between RDEW and CDEW-chicks were not found for either Leghorn or broiler-type chicks. When zinc was high, CDEW-chicks were significantly improved in weight and feathering than RDEW-chicks, regardless of type or source of chick or source of egg white. When dextrin was fed, the feather scores of all RDEW-fed chicks were significantly im-proved. Those of low-zinc chicks did not differ significantly from CDEW-chicks fed sucrose. When zinc was not limiting, CDEW + sucrose chicks were significantly larger in weight and lower in feather scores than RDEW + dextrin chicks and did not differ from chicks on casein-based diets. These experiments do not pinpoint the reason for the poor performance of chicks fed RDEW plus 30 ppm Zn diets but suggest that when RDEW is used as a protein source for young chicks, another protein source should also be fed to check the growth potential of the chicks...|$|E
40|$|Egg {{white is}} {{extensively}} utilized as a functional food material in food processing {{due to the}} multiple functional roles of egg white proteins such as foaming, gelling and emulsifying properties. The foaming property of egg white has been widely studied using different methods. In this research, two different foaming methods were used to prepare egg white foams by a whipping method using a standard mix beater and a sparging method using a whipped cream dispenser (pressurized dispenser). Egg white is also commercially available in several different physical forms, such as fresh egg white liquid, frozen fresh egg white liquid (EWL) and spray <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powder (EWP). In this study, EWL and EWP solutions were used to compare their foaming ability and foam stability. Various factors affecting on the formation and stability of egg white foam were investigated to understand {{their impact on the}} functional properties of egg white as foaming agents under specific conditions, including whipping time and speed, shaking time, temperature, pH, type and ionic strength of salts, thermal treatment and addition of some ingredients (e. g. sugar and hydrocolloids). All foams produced were analysed on the basis of two different parameters of foam properties, such as foamability after preparation and foam stability with time after foam preparation. Foam stability was also analysed by two different aspects, foam volume stability against foam collapse and foam liquid stability against liquid drainage. Another objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the application of cooking egg white foam in a microwave oven after the foam preparation with an aim of developing a prototype of value added new products derived from egg white foam. The microbiological stability of egg white was also measured to determine the shelf stability of non-pasteurised and pasteurised egg white solutions with and without added ingredients against microbial growth.

Currently, no reported study {{is related to the}} storage stability of <b>dried</b> hen <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> (DEW) and its hydrolysates (HEW) in an IMF matrix. Therefore, three DEW/HEW dough model systems (100 %HEW + 0 %DEW, 75 %HEW + 25 %DEW and 50 %HEW + 50 %DEW) were established using two commercial spray-dried <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powders to study the effect of temperature and fraction of HEW on these IMF models (water activity (a(w)) : similar to 0. 8). During storage at three different temperatures (23, 35 and 45 degrees C) for 70 days, the selected physicochemical properties of the dough systems were compared. Overall, kinetic analysis showed an apparent zero-order model fit for the change in the colour (L*), fluorescence intensity (FI) and hardness, as a function of time, for different dough model systems. As expected, the L*, FI and hardness increased as a function of time mainly due to the Maillard reaction. The amount of free amino groups decreased, with an increase in rate of loss, as temperature increased in the 100 %HEW + 0 %DEW model. When DEW was substituted for some HEW, the regeneration of the free amino groups after loss was observed as a function of time. Furthermore, when the percentage of HEW was decreased, the incidence of mouldy samples occurred sooner, which indicates that HEW has some antimicrobial ability, especially in the 100 %HEW + 0 %DEW system where mould growth did not occur...|$|R
40|$|Egg is {{a widely}} used {{ingredient}} in many food products all around the world.

The aim of our study was thus to investigate the effect of a wide range of pasteurization rates (on liquid whole <b>egg)</b> or <b>dry</b> heating rates (on <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powder) on the in vitro digestibility, antigenicity and allergenicity of egg proteins. Liquid whole egg was pasteurized from 2 to 6 min between 60 °C and 66 °C, and <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powder was <b>dry</b> heated from 1 to 10 days between 60 °C and 90 °C. In vitro digestion of samples was performed using a model that mimics successive gastric and duodenal stages of digestion in the adult human. The degree of hydrolysis was quantified by OPA method at the end of each stage, and the SDS PAGE pattern was followed throughout the in vitro digestion. Ovomucoïd, ovotransferrin and lysozyme antigenicity was tested by inhibition ELISA with specific monoclonal antibodies. Liquid whole egg allergenicity was investigated in 54 egg-allergic children by skin prick testing and IgE-binding pattern to egg proteins was determined by indirect ELISA. <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> powder allergenicity was tested on mice sensitized and challenged through oral route by measuring plasmatic histamine concentration, specific and total IgE and IgG levels, and cytokine concentration in spleen cell culture supernatants. Pasteurization of liquid whole egg, from 4 to 10 min at 60 °C, improved protein in vitro digestibility and decreased ovomucoïd antigenicity, but did not significantly change ovotransferrin and lysozyme antigenicity. Conversely, pasteurization from 4 to 10 min at 66 °C decreased protein in vitro digestibility and lysozyme antigenicity, but increased drastically ovotransferrin antigenicity. Pasteurization (6 min at 66 °C) had a limited impact on the prick test (PT) reactivity of most children. However, two main classes of patients were obtained from PT diameter variations: for 34 children, pasteurization had no impact on PT reactivity, whereas for 20 children, pasteurization significantly decreased reactivity. A large effect was even found for 4 children who had null PT with pasteurized liquid whole egg. No correlation was found between patterns of IgE-binding to egg proteins and patterns of PT-reactivity as a function of pasteurization. <b>Dry</b> heating of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powder, from 1 to 10 days at 60 °C, improved protein in vitro digestibility and slightly decreased lysozyme antigenicity. On the other hand, dry heating over 1 day at 80 °C or 90 °C decreased protein in vitro digestibility and lysozyme antigenicity, but drastically increased ovotransferrin antigenicity. <b>Dry</b> heating of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powder up to 7 days at 80 °C had a limited impact on egg allergy tested in mice. No significant effect was found on histamine concentration, or specific and total IgE and IgG levels. Only a significant decrease of IL 4 cytokine concentration was observed for mice groups fed with dry heated powders. Heat treatments applied to egg products thus have, in most cases, a rather low impact on in vivo allergenicity, despite significant changes in protein digestibility and antigenicity...|$|R

They were allocated into two equal groups and given a good quality biotin supplemented milk replacer up to 42 days of ages and then they allocated to continue to receive the biotin adequate diet or a diet without supplemented biotin and containing the biotin-binding protein avidin in <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> up to 84 days of ages. Thereafter all kids were continued to receive a progressively reducing quantities of the milk diet and in addition a commercial creep feed and chopped hay ad libitum. After weaning at 18 weeks of age, they received chopped hay (0. 75) and concentrate (0. 25) ad libitum {{to the end of}} the study at 24 weeks. Responses in live weight gain, dry matter intake, fibre characteristics, hair loss by combing, Plasma biotin and level of glucose, urea and PCV were measured through the experimental periods. The result indicated that at the end of the pre-ruminant period, biotin deficiency had a significant effect on reducing live weight gain (p< 0. 05), feed intake (p< 0. 01) and increasing combed hair loss (p< 0. 001). Total hair loss of mohair due to biotin deficiency was significantly (p< 0. 01) higher than cashmere. Following the introduction to solid feed there were no differences in animal performance due to diet. Total clean fibre yield by Angora goat in all periods was significantly (p< 0. 001) higher that for the Cashmere goats. While biotin supplemented milk replacer diet increased plasma biotin concentration this did not result in any significant increase in glucose, urea and PCV in all periods of study. However, during solid feeding Cashmere kids had a significantly higher live weight gain (p< 0. 05) and dry matter intake (p< 0. 01) than Angora kids. Difference between two genotypes was noted during soild feeding in superior values of feed intake(0. 01), live weight gain (p< 0. 01), glucose concentration (p< 0. 001) and PCV% (p< 0. 001) in Chashmer than Angora goats...|$|E

Sorghum has been identified to be a safe grain {{to use as a}} wheat alternative for the celiac community. There are many sorghum hybrids that are commercial available for use in food and feed. Noodles are selected for the growing market in the US and the lack of research and availability for sorghum noodles. Viscoelastic properties are crucial for making acceptable noodles which makes this research more challengeable. The research hypothesis is that sorghum can be used in making gluten-free noodles and there are end product quality differences that exist among the hybrids in production of gluten-free noodles. A series of chemical and physical analyses were conducted to compare four sorghum hybrids (Orbit, NE # 8, F- 525, NE # 4) in a gluten-free noodle system. The noodles were formulated with 100 % sorghum flour and the other functional ingredients including <b>dried</b> whole <b>eggs,</b> <b>egg</b> <b>whites,</b> xanthan gum and corn starch.

40|$|The {{essential}} {{theme of}} this dissertation focuses on better utilization of egg products and exploration and resolution of problems associated with functionalities of egg lecithin and egg protein in food. Egg provides both high quality protein and lipids, especially lecithin. Egg lecithin is the second major source for commercial lecithin, and its application covers foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical fields. One of the main functionalities of egg albumen protein in food preparation is its excellent foaming property as seen in various foamy food products, such as meringues and angel food cakes. A major concern in utilizing egg lecithin as an emulsifier in food emulsions is lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation causes off-flavor and losses in nutritional quality. In emulsion systems, multiple factors could affect oxidative stability of lecithin of both soy and egg sources. In our study, the role of transition metal ions, cupric and ferric ions, in oxidative stability of egg and soy lecithin was evaluated in emulsions. The effect of pH on lipid oxidation was also examined under two concentrations for each ion (50 yM and 500 yM). For the source of EL and SL used in the studies presented in Chapter 2, {{it was found that}} egg lecithin (EL) had a similar peroxide value (PV) development pattern as soy lecithin (SL) when treated with cupric ion under both acidic and neutral pH. Acidic pH of 3 accelerated oxidation of both EL and SL, especially under high concentration of cupric ion. When treated with ferric ion, EL oxidized much faster than SL. EL had higher secondary oxidation products (TBARS) than SL. Acidic pH accelerated TBARS development for both EL and SL, but EL had more significantly increased values. Cupric ion was more powerful than ferric ion in catalyzing oxidation of both EL and SL under both acidic and neutral pH conditions as measured by PV and TBARS. Overall, SL showed better oxidative stability than EL under our experimental conditions. This study also suggests that using multiple methods is necessary in properly evaluating lipid oxidative stability, especially in the situation where lipid hydroperoxides tend to be easily decomposed. As a minor component in egg lecithin, ethanolamine plasmalogen attracted our attention because of the increased interest in studying its antioxidant effect in an in vivo and in vitro. The reported antioxidant effect might have contributed to the better oxidative stability of EL than SL as we previously found in bulk oil. To better understand the role of ethanolamine plasmalogen in maintaining oxidative stability in in vitro system, an EthPm extracted from bovine brain (BBEP) was used in our oxidation study. It was found that in the purified soybean oil (PSO) system, the addition of 200 and 1000 ppm BBEP promoted lipid oxidation, whereas SL added at the same amount showed a similar oxidation trend to the PSO control. The more BBEP is added, the faster the lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation of BBEP treatments was even faster in the presence of cupric ion than its non-cupric counterparts. In commercial soybean oil (CSO) with the presence of tocopherols, SL at 1000 ppm as an antioxidant acted synergistically with the natural tocopherols, but the addition of BBEP accelerated lipid oxidation as evidenced by the oxidative stability index (OSI). In the model liposome system, BBEP-added egg PL (EPL) liposome tended to have a fast breakdown of the lipid hydroperoxides, consequently promoted more secondary oxidation products. The oxidation of liposome lipid in the presence of copper was not affected by the presence of BBEP, which indicates that the hypothesis of ethanolamine plasmalogens chelating cupric ion as the antioxidant mechanism was not supported. The addition of cumene hydroperoxide to the EPL liposome promoted lipid oxidation as reflected by a very fast development of PV and TBARS. However, our study failed to differentiate the effect of BBEP and SL and their concentration on oxidation. It can be concluded that EthPm is not an antioxidant but rather a pro-oxidant in bulk lipid systems, whereas addition of EthPm has no significant effect on oxidation in liposome PL. While egg lipid is of a concern due to its oxidative stability when used in emulsified food, yolk lipid contamination to <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> is another issue involved in egg protein foaming. Our study revealed that a concentration as low as 0. 022 % (as-is basis) of yolk contamination caused significant reductions in foaming capacity and foaming speed. Further test confirmed that it is the neutral lipid fraction of egg yolk causing the major detrimental effect on foaming, and the phospholipids fraction did not give significant foaming reduction at a concentration as high as 0. 1 %. High-speed and short-time shearing caused no apparent damage but longer shearing time significantly impaired foaming. Foaming was significantly reduced at a temperature of 55 yC for 10 min, whereas it did not change up to 3 min at a heating temperature of 62 to 64 yC. Industrial processing steps (pumping, pipe transfer, and storage) did not produce negative effects on foaming of the final products and the controlled pasteurization was actually beneficial for good foaming performance. Therefore, it is concluded that yolk contamination of the <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> was the major factor in reducing foaming properties of the white protein. Foaming properties of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> protein are affected by yolk lipid contamination, but proteins of basic nature may restore the foaming properties of the yolk-contaminated <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> protein. In this study, we also esterified the acidic groups on soy protein isolate (SPI) and studied the potential of such modified protein in improving foaming. It was shown that the modification changed the isoelectric point of soy protein isolate (SPI) from 4. 5 to about 10. Sonication was proven to be a very effective means to re-disperse the methanol-denatured soy protein during the reaction condition, as shown by the improved solubility profile. The sonicated-modified SPI (SMSPI), when added to the yolk-contaminated (at 0. 4 % level, as-is basis) <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> gave significantly improved foaming properties. Addition of SMSPI (16 %, based on <b>dry</b> <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> and 1. 6 % based on liquid <b>egg</b> <b>white)</b> increased the foaming performance of both pure <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> and yolk-contaminated <b>egg</b> <b>white.</b> SMSPI consistently performed better than the unmodified SPI for improving foaming. Addition of SMSPI fully restored foam expansion and foam liquid stability of 0. 4 % yolk-contaminated <b>egg</b> <b>white,</b> and it even out-performed the foaming of pure white protein. Therefore, a feasible solution to restore the foaming properties of yolk-contaminated <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> has been identified...|$|R
