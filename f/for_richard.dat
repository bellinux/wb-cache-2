5|$|When {{only the}} four {{alliance}} members remained, the vote initially {{ended in a}} draw; close allies Richard and Rudy voted for Susan, and Susan and Kelly voted <b>for</b> <b>Richard.</b> On the revote, Kelly decided to switch her vote and Susan was eliminated. After winning the final immunity challenge, Kelly decided to eliminate Rudy because she believed she had a better chance against Richard. At the final Tribal Council, Susan lambasted Kelly for switching her vote and proclaimed her support <b>for</b> <b>Richard.</b> Richard's strategic prowess and leadership were valued over Kelly's impressive challenge performances, and the jury awarded him the title of Sole Survivor in a vote of 4-3.|$|E

5|$|Austin-based theatre company The Hidden Room {{developed}} a staged reading of John Wilkes Booth's Richard III {{based on the}} manuscript promptbook {{in the collection of}} the Harry Ransom Center. The promptbook is one of only two known surviving promptbooks created by John Wilkes Booth, and uses the Colley Cibber adaptation of Shakespeare's text. The full book with the actor's handwritten notations has been digitized. The other promptbook is also <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> III, and can be found in the Harvard Theatre Collection.|$|E
5|$|Built <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> Churche, {{a wealthy}} Nantwich merchant, and his wife, it {{remained}} {{in their family}} until the 20thcentury. In 1930, it was rescued from being shipped to the USA by Edgar Myott and his wife, who began restoration work. As well as a dwelling, the mansion {{has been used as}} a school, restaurant, shop, and granary and hay store.|$|E

50|$|Back in the courtroom, Lyle tells Reverend Henry that he {{will never}} {{apologize}} <b>for</b> <b>Richard's</b> death. The play ends with the black characters leaving {{to go on a}} protest March, and a downtrodden Parnell joining them.|$|R
5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun <b>for</b> <b>Richard,</b> though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991. Unlike the traditional support for canonization of a saint, which begins with popular devotion {{and is only}} later recognized by the Church, support <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> began outside her immediate home area and was first promoted by the clergy, beginning with Brennan, Crowley, and Calais. The bishop of the Lafayette diocese {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and referred to her as a saint. Another bishop of the diocese, Harry Flynn, presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989, along with sixteen other priests. The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization, the Friends of Charlene, to spread her story.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, in {{association}} with the Richard III Society, announced that they had joined forces to begin a search for the remains of King Richard. The search <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> III was led by Philippa Langley of the Society's Looking <b>For</b> <b>Richard</b> Project with the archaeological work led by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS). Experts set out to locate the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries), and to discover whether his remains were still interred there. By comparing fixed points between maps in a historical sequence, the search located the Church of the Grey Friars, where Richard's body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern-day city centre car park.|$|E
5|$|Returning to London {{later in}} 1953 Gielgud took over {{management}} of the Lyric, Hammersmith, for a classical season of Richard II, Congreve's The Way of the World, and Thomas Otway's Venice Preserv'd, directing the first, acting in the last, and doing both in the second. Feeling {{he was too old}} <b>for</b> <b>Richard,</b> he cast the young Paul Scofield; both the actor and the production were a critical and commercial success. During the season Gielgud was knighted in the 1953 Coronation Honours.|$|E
50|$|Richard's enemies were {{inclined}} to believe that Edward's sudden death was divine retribution <b>for</b> <b>Richard's</b> alleged involvement in the usurpation and subsequent disappearance of the sons of Edward IV, Edward V of England and Richard, Duke of York.|$|R

5|$|The first {{collation}} of the New Testament {{was made}} in 1716 by Johann Jakob Wettstein <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> Bentley, who intended to prepare a new edition of the Novum Testamentum Graece. According to Bentley's correspondence, it took two hours to read one page, and Bentley paid Wettstein £50. This collation was used by Wettstein in his own Greek New Testament of 1751–1752.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's most {{important}} patrons were the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall, Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned {{to design the}} entrance lodge and other structures for Grosvenor Park in Chester, and StJohn's Church {{in the village of}} Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster. When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son Hugh Grosvenor, 1stDuke of Westminster. Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the 2nd Duke, throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1stDuke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15schools, around 50farms (in whole or in part), about 300cottages, lodges and smithies, two factories, two inns and about 12commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's Halkyn estate in Flintshire, including another church.|$|E
5|$|From 1953 to 1961 Grant {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume Lord Haranath: A Biography by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu topics for Indian journals like the Bombay-based The Call Divine, as well as <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> Cavendish's Man, Myth & Magic. Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as At the Feet of the Guru in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.|$|E
50|$|However, {{ahead of}} the 2016-17 season, Richards was {{expected}} to lose his first team place at Fulham, with Manager Slaviša Jokanović prefer Ryan Fredericks in the right-back position. As a result, Fulham accepted a bid from Cardiff City <b>for</b> <b>Richards.</b>|$|R

5|$|Longchamp went to {{the court}} of Henry VI, the Holy Roman Emperor, who was holding King Richard captive at Trifels. The bishop {{arranged}} <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> to be held at the imperial court and negotiated a payment plan for the ransom, 100,000marks, under the terms of which the emperor agreed to release Richard once 70,000marks had been paid and hostages for the payment of the rest had been received. When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France's offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive, Longchamp attended along with Walter of Coutances and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother. After further diplomatic wrangling, Richard was freed on 4 February 1194.|$|E
5|$|Miles, Richard, and Ben {{go back to}} {{the barracks}} to get some C4 that Ben {{secretly}} kept in his closet behind the bookcase. When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but when they come out they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1942, MacArthur {{accepted}} $500,000 from President Quezon of the Philippines as {{payment for}} his pre-war service. MacArthur's staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff. Eisenhower—after being appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force (AEF)—was also offered money by Quezon, but declined. These payments were {{known only to}} a few in Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979. While the payments had been fully legal, the revelation tarnished MacArthur's reputation.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare almost {{certainly}} wrote {{the role of}} Hamlet <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> Burbage. He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range. Judging {{by the number of}} reprints, Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare's fourth most popular play during his lifetime—only Henry IV Part 1, Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it. Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set; however, as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets, this would not have affected the staging.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk did {{not receive}} major grants from Edward IV either, {{although}} de la Pole continued to support him in arms when necessary, and when Edward lost his throne in 1470, Suffolk was not trusted by the new Lancastrian regime. Suffolk fought for Edward at the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury but did not join Edward's inner circle during his second reign. He seems to have acquiesced in the usurpation of Richard III in 1483, but, unlike his son, was not present <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> III's defeat at the Battle of Bosworth two years later. Henry VII {{does not seem to}} have held Suffolk's son's treason against the duke, and even seems to have protected him from the former's attainder. John de la Pole died in 1492 and was buried at Wingfield Church, Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fortification}} at Camber {{may have}} been built shortly after 1486 by Sir Richard Guldeford, the Master of the Ordnance, who was given the manor of Higham by King Henry VII in exchange <b>for</b> <b>Richard</b> constructing a tower to protect the anchorage. There is no surviving evidence, however, to show if a tower was in fact built as Guldeford had promised, and Henry VII did not invest much in his coastal defences {{during the rest of}} his reign. Many castles across England were left in poor repair, often considered to be outdated and too expensive to maintain.|$|E
