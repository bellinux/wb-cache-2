In addition, he saw people, including his teammates, gathering ammunition and weapons {{to prepare for the}} revolution.|$|E

5|$|Disney had {{originally}} planned to add Giselle to the Disney Princess line-up, as was shown at a 2007 Toy Fair where the Giselle doll was featured with packaging declaring her with Disney Princess status but {{decided against it}} when they realized they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> lifelong rights to Amy Adams' image. While Giselle is not being marketed {{as one of the}} Disney Princesses, Enchanted merchandise was made available in various outlets with Adams' animated likeness being used on all Giselle merchandise. Giselle led the 2007 Hollywood Holly-Day Parade at Disney's Hollywood Studios. She was also featured in the 2007 Walt Disney World Christmas Day Parade in the Magic Kingdom with the official Disney Princesses.|$|E

Hilliard scored 1,413 points in his high school career, finishing second in Liberty history to Warren West. He committed to Villanova in November 2010. When Hilliard informed his mother he was receiving a full scholarship to Villanova, she did not understand and was trying to figure how much she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> her son's education. In addition to his basketball prowess, Hilliard was the quarterback on his high school football team and could throw the ball 65 yards.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 NSB Gardermoen {{stated that}} they {{expected}} to charge commuter and intercity trains 100 million Norwegian krone per year {{to use the new}} line. County politicians in Akershus stated that it was not reasonable for commuters to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the new railway. Early estimates showed that this would almost double to price from Oslo to Eidsvoll, and that passengers would have different prices, depending on which route they followed. Stor-Oslo Lokaltrafikk, which was responsible for buses in Akershus, {{stated that they}} had no way to influence NSB's prices, but that they would consider starting a coach service along the route, which would not charge the surcharge.|$|E

5|$|Northrop Grumman and Raytheon {{decided in}} 2002 to locate its ground station for National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, the {{successor}} of EOS, to Helsinki, Finland, instead of Svalbard. The reason was lack of {{optical fiber cable}} connection to the archipelago. NSC took initiative to build such a cable in July 2002 and gained interest from NASA, NOAA and Telenor. The cable was financed by the satellite operators paying the same fee for the transmission of data as they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> a satellite connection until the cable was paid for. A 40 million United States dollar contract was signed with Tyco International for two cables between Harstad on the mainland and Longyearbyen. Construction started in June 2003 and was completed in January 2004.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
5|$|New {{purchases}} {{of the game}} are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's Cerberus Network, an online downloadable content and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like GameStop have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher {{does not make a}} profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all Mass Effect 2s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.|$|E
