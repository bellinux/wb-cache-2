5|$|Low-power and {{high-power}} devices remain operational {{with this}} standard, but devices using SuperSpeed {{can take advantage}} of increased available current of between 150mA and 900mA, respectively. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2– December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5A but does not allow concurrent <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b> The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5A.|$|E
5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, {{shielded twisted pair}} but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed <b>data</b> <b>transmission,</b> cables contain twice as many wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure that}} there are enough signal {{transitions}} for clock recovery {{to occur in the}} bitstream, a bit stuffing technique is applied to the data stream: an extra 0bit is insert into the data stream after any occurrence of six consecutive 1bits. (Thus ensuring that there is a 0bit to cause a transmission state transition.) Seven consecutively received 1bits are always an error. For USB3.0, additional <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> encoding is used to handle the higher data rates required.|$|E
5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} hearing in 2002 both DNK director Tor Helge Lyngstøl and Minister of Justice, Odd Einar Dørum, {{stated that the}} choice of TETRA would provide sufficient data capacity. In {{a parliamentary}} decision in 2004 {{it was decided to}} opt for the open European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as a <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> standard, which is used by all other police TETRA systems in Europe, but this was later changed by the directorate to the proprietary TETRA Enhanced Data Service (TEDS) owned by Motorola. The latter would limit the number of supplies and would increase the investment costs.|$|E
5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed <b>data</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E

30|$|For the {{relationship}} among the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> success rate of sensor nodes, the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> rate and node transmission radius of three different MAC protocols were compared. The <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> success rate of sensor nodes of three different MAC protocols was disproportional to the transmission rate (refer to Fig.  3 a). When this was proportional to the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> rate, the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> success rate of the BSPMDP-MAC protocol became {{higher than that of}} other two protocols. The competitive nodes obtained channel access privilege via the tone frame competition in the ST-Lohi protocol. When collision occurred, the random collision backoff was used to affect the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> success rate. One low-probability tone frame collision as used in the AUT-Lohi protocol. When collision occurred, the confliction backoff algorithm was used to reduce competition time and decrease the loss rate of packets in AUT-Lohi. When the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> rate was lower, this method was effective. When the <b>data</b> packet <b>transmission</b> rate increased, the transmission success rate of data packets quickly decreased.|$|R
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E
