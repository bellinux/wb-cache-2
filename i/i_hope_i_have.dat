The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
500|$|There is also {{debate over}} whether or not a-consciousness and p-consciousness always co-exist or if they can exist separately. [...] Although p-consciousness without a-consciousness is more widely accepted, there have been some {{hypothetical}} examples of A without P. Block for instance suggests the case of a “zombie” that is computationally identical to a person but without any subjectivity. However, he remains somewhat skeptical concluding [...] "I don’t know whether there are any actual cases of A-consciousness without P-consciousness, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> illustrated their conceptual possibility." ...|$|E

On 23 September 1996, Casper {{sent a letter}} to James Fallows, editor of U.S. News & World Report, stating, [...] "As the president of a university that is among the top-ranked universities, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the standing to persuade you that much about these rankings - particularly their specious formulas and spurious precision - is utterly misleading." ...|$|E

I am very keen on keeping the Scottish entity of the Firm. But <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not conveyed that I have swung against the University man...

2500|$|In November 1839 Williams and Octavius Hadfield {{arrived in}} Port Nicholson, Wellington, {{days after the}} New Zealand Company {{purchased}} the land around Wellington harbour. Within months the company purported to purchase approximately 20 million acres (8 million hectares) in Nelson, Wellington, Whanganui and Taranaki. Williams attempted {{to interfere with the}} land purchasing practices of the company. Reihana, a Christian who had spent time in the Bay of Islands, had bought for himself 60 acres (24 hectares) of land in Te Aro, in what is now central Wellington. [...] When Reihana and his wife decided to go and live in Taranaki, Williams persuaded Reihana to pass the land to him [...] to hold in trust for Reihana. On his journey north, Williams records {{in a letter to his}} wife, “I have secured a piece of land, I trust, from the paws of the New Zealand Company, for the natives; another piece <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> upset.” Upon arriving in Whanganui, Williams records, “After breakfast, held council with the chiefs respecting their land, as they were in considerable alarm lest the Europeans should take possession of the county. All approve of their land being purchased and held in trust for their benefit alone.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1920s {{contained}} {{analysis of}} the poem that emphasised the poem's power. In Road to Xanadu (1927), a book length study of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and [...] "Kubla Khan", John Livingston Lowes claimed that the poems were [...] "two {{of the most remarkable}} poems in English". When turning to the background of the works, he argued, [...] "Coleridge as Coleridge, be it said at once, is a secondary moment to our purpose; it is the significant process, not the man, which constitutes our theme. But the amazing modus operandi of his genius, in the fresh light which <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to offer, becomes the very abstract and brief chronicle of the procedure of the creative faculty itself." [...] After breaking down the various aspects of the poem, Lowes stated, [...] "with a picture of unimpaired and thrilling vividness, the fragment ends. And with it ends, for all save Coleridge, the dream. 'The earth hath bubbles as the water has, and this is of them.' For 'Kubla Khan' is as near enchantment, I suppose, as we are like to come in this dull world. And over it is cast the glamour, enhanced beyond all reckoning in the dream, of the remote in time and space – that visionary presence of a vague and gorgeous and mysterious Past which brooded, as Coleridge read, above the inscrutable Nile, and domed pavilions in Cashmere, and the vanished stateliness of Xanadu." [...] He continued by describing the power of the poem: [...] "For none of the things which we have seen – dome, river, chasm, fountain, caves of ice, or floating hair – nor any combination of them holds the secret key to that sense of an incommunicable witchery which pervades the poem. That is something more impalpable by far, into which entered who can tell what tracelesss, shadowy recollections ... The poem is steeped in the wonder of all Coleridge's enchanted voyagings." [...] Lowes then concluded about the two works: [...] "Not even in the magical four and fifty lines of 'Kubla Khan' is sheer visualizing energy so intensely exercised as in 'The Ancient Mariner.' But every crystal-clear picture there, {{is an integral part of}} a preconceived and consciously elaborated whole ... In 'Kubla Khan' the linked and interweaving images irresponsibly and gloriously stream, like the pulsing, fluctuating banners of the North. And their pageant is as aimless as it is magnificent ... There is, then ... one glory of 'Kubla Khan' and another glory of 'The Ancient Mariner,' as one star differeth from another star in glory." [...] George Watson, in 1966, claimed that Lowes's {{analysis of the}} poems [...] "will stand as a permanent monument to historical criticism." [...] Also in 1966, Kenneth Burke, declared, [...] "Count me among those who would view this poem both as a marvel, and as 'in principle' finished" ...|$|E
