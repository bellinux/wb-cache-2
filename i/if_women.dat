5|$|A {{few years}} after being married, Anne Dallas Dudley became {{involved}} in the temperance movement as a supporter of alcohol prohibition. Through her work in the temperance movement and her association with friends such as Maria Daviess and Ida Clyde Clark, Dudley became convinced that women's place in society could only be improved <b>if</b> <b>women</b> were allowed to vote. At the time, however, a majority of men and women opposed the idea of women participating in the political process.|$|E
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive. Goldhill writes that the theatre {{can be seen as}} a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom, and women may have been excluded. David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. <b>If</b> <b>women</b> did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and political life of the nation would greatly improve <b>if</b> <b>women</b> were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E

50|$|In Finland, {{abortion}} was illegal until 1950, when the Parliament of Finland legalized abortions {{to preserve the}} physical or mental health of the <b>woman,</b> <b>if</b> the <b>woman</b> was under 16, if the fetus might be deformed, or the woman had been raped. Under pressure from the women's liberation movement and supportive editorials from most national newspapers, Finnish law was further liberalized in 1970. The 1970 law allowed abortion up to 16 weeks of pregnancy for broad socio-economic reasons, <b>if</b> the <b>woman</b> was younger than 17, <b>if</b> the <b>woman</b> was older than 40, <b>if</b> the <b>woman</b> had already had four children, or if {{at least one parent}} would be unable to raise the child owing to disease or mental disturbance.|$|R

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking <b>if</b> <b>women</b> {{had ever had}} sexual relations with another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{driver of}} this {{difference}} is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage {{in the selection of}} their partner. Elder family members must find suitable husbands for young females in the households. <b>If</b> <b>women</b> are known to have adverse previous medical histories, their ability to find a partner is significantly reduced. This difference leads to diverging health outcomes for men and women.|$|E
5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear <b>if</b> <b>women</b> were given equal footing with men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E

5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. <b>If</b> <b>women</b> {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, then his family should have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
5|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns <b>if</b> <b>women</b> participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. <b>If</b> <b>women</b> express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E
30|$|Column (1) {{presents}} a baseline model for all women. The signs {{as well as}} the sizes of the estimated coefficients are not surprising. <b>If</b> a <b>woman</b> has (young) children, she works significantly fewer hours per week. The number of weekly hours worked is also reduced <b>if</b> a <b>woman</b> faces lower hourly wages or <b>if</b> a <b>woman</b> has higher income from other sources. However, these coefficients are not significant. The author finds a significant effect of a high level of education: women who have attained an ISCED level of 4 or 5 work approximately 1.3 hours more per week.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} the School of Education of UNCG {{has its roots in}} the {{founding}} of the university itself.

25|$|Although the Israeli Declaration of Independence states: “The State of Israel (…) {{will ensure}} {{complete}} equality {{of social and}} political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex,” the Haredi political parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) have never allowed women on their lists for Knesset elections. However, in December 2014, women activists in the Haredi community have threatened a boycott of Haredi parties in upcoming elections <b>if</b> <b>women</b> are not included in election slates.|$|E
25|$|Controversy erupted {{over the}} practice. Many people, {{both men and}} women from {{backgrounds}} of both Islamic and non-Islamic faith questioned the hijab and what it stood for in terms of women and their rights. There was questioning of whether in practice the hijab was truly a female choice or <b>if</b> <b>women</b> were being coerced or pressured into wearing it. Many instances, such as a period of forced veiling for women in Iran, brought these issues to the forefront and generated great debate from both scholars and everyday people.|$|E

25|$|The women's {{contribution}} {{to the war effort}} challenged the notion of women's physical and mental inferiority and made it more difficult to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. <b>If</b> <b>women</b> could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena.|$|E
25|$|While the {{percentage}} of women working low-skill agriculture and services work is compatible with the notion that women face limited economic opportunities in Muslim nations, data from the ILO does not support or refute that conclusion. Industrial work attracts few women which may be accounted for the physical nature of much industrial work. Furthermore, <b>if</b> <b>women</b> in majority Muslim countries are funneled into agriculture and service-oriented work due to a weak skill set, then it follows {{that they would not be}} hired for industrial work as some of it, such as smelting, requires specific vocational skills.|$|E

Other topical songs include Daktilo (The Typewriter) which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires 7 Society.
