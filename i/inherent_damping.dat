The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as {{those found in the}} Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower.

Toward {{the end of the}} expansion process, the mandrel pops out of the tube resulting in displacement, stress, and pressure waves propagating through the system. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the dynamics of the tube-fluid system due to the pop-out phenomenon. The model takes into consideration the coupling effect between fluids and the structure, as well as the <b>inherent</b> system <b>damping</b> of its response. An analytical solution describing the wave propagation in the tube-fluid system was obtained.

In addition, it showed that the coupling effect was more prominent in the tube as compared to the outer and inner fluids. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to investigate the effect of the geometrical and material properties on the response. The sensitivity analysis showed that the coupling effect vanished with the increase in tube stiffness and reached an asymptotic value with an increase in formation stiffness...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} correlation was observed between {{the occurrence of}} stay-cable vibrations and the combined presence of wind and rain, as the latter led {{to the adoption of}} the term Rain-Wind Induced Vibrations.

An analytical model is presented in this paper to represent the resistively shunted piezoelectric beam. A single expression for the system response, encompassing both the mechanical and electrical aspects, is derived. The aptness of the presented model in describing the system is evident from the discussions of the shortcomings of the two most employed models found in literature.

A parametric study is performed to investigate {{the effects of the}} mechanical interaction between pedestrians, represented by simple lumped parameter models, and the supporting footbridge. The most significant HSI-effect for the low-frequency modes of a footbridge, is in the effective damping ratio of the coupled system which is much higher than the <b>inherent</b> structural <b>damping.</b> The effective damping ratio increases monotonically with the pedestrian density but is highly dependent on the natural frequency of the footbridge.

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{combining}} active damping with a purely passive isolation system, with hysteretic damping, to reduce possible pounding effects under near-fault ground motions is addressed. The used isolation {{system is a}} recently proposed one that {{is referred to as}} roll in cage (RNC) isolator. It has an integrated buffer mechanism to prevent excessive bearing displacements under strong seismic excitations. There-fore, possible pounding under such strong earthquakes will be within the bounds of RNC isolator to avoid adjacent structural pounding. Active control is invoked at a certain bearing displacement to reduce it before reaching its design limit, after which pounding takes place. It was found that increasing the RNC isolator’s <b>inherent</b> hysteretic <b>damping</b> reduces the bearing displacement and consequently alleviates or even eliminate pounding. Moreover, the integration of active control, at smaller bearing displacements, with the RNC isolator can reduce the bearing displacement but adds more rigidity to the isolation system, which leads to less efficient isolation.

40|$|The {{optimization}} of liners for {{noise reduction}} lacks a thorough {{comprehension of the}} <b>inherent</b> aeroacoustic <b>damping</b> phenomena. Therefore, {{the interaction of the}} acoustic particle velocity (APV) and the flow velocity field at liners has to be investigated. Hence, the simultaneous measurement of both quantities, differing by several orders of magnitude, is aspired. However, the required high dynamic range is challenging. In order to analyse the energy transfer from the acoustic wave to the flow turbulence, turbulence spectra must be resolved which necessitates a high measurement rate as well. Doppler global velocimetry with sinusoidal laser frequency modulation (FM-DGV) fulfils these demanding requirements. First, the capability of FM-DGV for APV measurements was successfully validated with microphone measurements.
