40|$|Abstract Aims: The {{promotion}} of sports participation {{during the early}} years of life is important not only because it promotes health during childhood and adolescence, but also because it has benefits in adulthood. This study was developed to identify the association between sports participation {{during the early years}} of life and adulthood, to analyze the non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> throughout life and to identify the correlates of non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports.</b> DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The sample was composed of 743 adults randomly selected in a medium-size Brazilian city. Non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> during childhood and adolescence was assessed through specific questions, and non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> <b>in</b> adulthood was assessed using the second section of Baecke questionnaire. Answering “no” in the three periods assessed (childhood, adolescence and adulthood) was characterized as non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> throughout life. Chronological age, sex, formal education, BMI, current job and ethnicity were considered covariates. Categorical data were expressed as rates and compared using chi-square test and binary logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of adults not engaged <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> throughout life was 58. 5 % (95 % CI= 55. 1 - 62. 1). Females (OR = 2. 41 [1. 71 - 3. 38]), those more advanced in age (OR = 3. 29 [1. 82 - 5. 94]) and/or possessing a lower level of education (OR = 4. 47 [2. 45 - 8. 17]) were associated with the non-engagement <b>in</b> <b>sports.</b> Conclusion: Non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> during childhood can influence non-participation <b>in</b> <b>sports</b> during adulthood, which is significantly affected by sex, age and education level...|$|R

In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion <b>in</b> <b>Sport,</b> meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighth}} game, the {{competition}} {{had become more}} than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw {{as a result of}} scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.|$|E
