5|$|Chloe Sullivan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> as independent, intelligent, {{curious and}} {{impulsive}} {{by both the}} writers and the actress that portrays her. The latter two characteristics often cause Chloe {{to get into trouble}} with both her friends and with local industrialists Lionel Luthor and his son Lex, two of the show's primary antagonists.

5|$|The New Walford Guide to Reference Resources {{praised the}} FEPP website for its links to {{resources}} {{on freedom of}} expression and censorship. FEPP <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> by the Austin American-Statesman as a think tank devoted to researching the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Denver Post described the organization as a censorship , and a separate article from the same newspaper called it a left-of-center politically aligned group, which advocated for both intellectual freedom and artistic freedom.|$|E
5|$|Thirty {{episodes of}} Strangers with Candy were made, which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000. Though its ratings were not {{remarkable}} during its initial run, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> as a cult {{show with a}} small but dedicated audience. Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello.|$|E

5|$|A single fungal serpin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of {{anaerobic}} fungi {{found in}} the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|Chalcogens have diverse fluorides: {{unstable}} difluorides {{have been}} reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms, so sulfur hexafluoride is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only iodine heptafluoride <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> among possible interhalogen heptafluorides. Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms, and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine.|$|E
5|$|El Greco's {{dramatic}} and expressionistic style {{was met with}} puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco {{is regarded as a}} precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.|$|E

5|$|Józef {{was born}} on 5 December 1867 to the medieval noble family Piłsudski, at their manor named Zułów near the Zułowo village (now Zalavas, Švenčionys {{district}} municipality, Lithuania), in the Russian Empire since 1795 on {{the territory of the}} former Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family. The Piłsudski family, although pauperized, cherished Polish patriotic traditions and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> either as Polish or as Polonized-Lithuanian. Józef was the second son born to the family.|$|E
5|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} in Malawi <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> by drastic {{declines in the}} number of health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: {{more than half of all}} hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV/AIDS. However, Malawi currently faces a significant deficit in human resources: only 159 doctors were practicing in Malawi in 2007. The World Health Organization's Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country, but the vast majority of Malawi's health facilities fail to meet this standard.|$|E
5|$|The Neo-Pentecostal {{movement}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> {{in part by}} {{an emphasis}} on prosperity theology, which gained greater acceptance within charismatic Christianity during the late 1990s. By 2006, {{three of the four}} largest congregations in the United States were teaching prosperity theology, and Joel Osteen has been credited with spreading it outside of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movement through his books, which have sold over 4 million copies. Bruce Wilkinson's The Prayer of Jabez also sold millions of copies and invited readers to seek prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It {{has also been}} found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease of American power.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>characterized</b> as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
