5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child. Both claimed that they <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> dead child to be buried in Sudbury, but no records of this could be discovered and no trace was found of the child's burial site. In his written confession, Corder admitted that he and Marten had argued {{on the day of the}} murder over the possibility of the burial site being discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the German night fighter intruders began {{achieving}} substantial successes. British ground defences, which <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> {{toll on the}} German {{units in}} 1940, were now side-stepped by a decision to shift the area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes. German losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes.|$|E

5|$|Careful to {{maintain}} the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of Liguria and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), Segusio (Susa), and the island of Amacina in the Larius Lucus (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the Apennines and plundered Tuscia, but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to Herwig Wolfram, it was probably only in 578–579 that Tuscany was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, {{although it was not}} completed by the time of his death.|$|E
5|$|Salo and Alesi {{became the}} first drivers to make {{scheduled}} pit stops on lap 16. Coulthard made a pit stop one lap later to remove the debris from his radiator and rejoined in sixth. Button became the race's fifth retirement because of an engine failure on lap 19. Michael Schumacher continued to set consecutive fastest laps, as he built an 8.8-second gap to Barrichello by his first pit stop on lap 24. Barrichello took over the lead for one lap before his pit stop on the following lap handing it back to Michael Schumacher. By the end of lap 26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> pit stops. The race order was Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Herbert, Verstappen, Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Wurz, Irvine, Zonta, Fisichella, Salo, Gené, Ralf Schumacher, Mazzacane, Alesi and Trulli.|$|E
5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed suit on the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} pit {{stop on the}} 26th lap and emerged behind Michael Schumacher, while Verstappen retired from the race with a {{mechanical}} problem. All of the leaders <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> stops {{by the start of}} lap 28, the top ten were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Salo, Zonta and Wurz. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started to close the gap to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the pit lane, triggering the second round of pit stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their pit stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's pit stop was problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the pit lane on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s {{there was}} a {{movement}} to drop achievement scores. After a period of time, the countries, states and provinces that reintroduced them agreed that academic standards had dropped, students had studied less, and <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> studying less seriously. They reintroduced the tests after studies and research concluded that the high-stakes tests produced benefits that outweighed the costs.|$|E

An extensive refit was required, but no progress was made for three years, despite a fresh naval survey in October 1766. Repairs finally commenced in December 1767, lasting eleven months and costing £5,442, significantly more than the original construction cost of the ship.|$|E
25|$|The siege {{continued}} {{throughout the}} summer of 117, but the years of constant campaigning in the baking eastern heat <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> toll on Trajan, who suffered a heatstroke. He decided to begin the long journey back to Rome in order to recover. Sailing from Seleucia, the emperor's health deteriorated rapidly. He was taken ashore at Selinus in Cilicia, where he died, and his successor, Hadrian, assumed the reins of government in 118.|$|E

25|$|Theodore's {{years of}} exile, regular fasting, and {{exceptional}} exertions <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> toll, and in 826 he became quite ill. In this year, he dictated his Testament, {{a form of}} spiritual guidance for the future abbots of the Stoudios monastery, to his disciple Naukratios. He died on the 11 of November of that same year, while celebrating mass, apparently in the monastery of Hagios Tryphon on Cape Akritas in Bithynia. Eighteen years later, his remains, {{along with those of}} his brother Joseph, were brought back to the Stoudios Monastery, where they were interred beside the grave of their uncle Platon.|$|E
25|$|The {{provisions}} of the treaty regarding the investiture were put into effect at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, when the Pomeranian dukes Barnim IX and George I {{for the first time}} formally received their duchy as a fief. Emperor Charles V and the prince-electors were the first to enter the Diet, and after they <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> seats, Joachim I Nestor formally announced that he protested against the investiture of the House of Pomerania, but would be satisfied if he was allowed to participate in the ceremony and touch the Pomeranian flags. The emperor replied that the protest is noted. George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, seconded the elector's protest.|$|E
