A convertible can {{be transformed into a}} tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only <b>input</b> <b>mechanism.</b> On March 12, 2013, Microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of 1024×768 (down from the previous 1366×768). The amended requirement is intended to allow [...] "greater design flexibility" [...] for future products.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{controls}} are {{relegated to the}} nine keys of the number pad, and the game is completely playable using only the keyboard (numpad keys and enter), excluding the start menu and control screen. This is assisted by a visual representation of the keypad in the lower {{right corner of the}} screen, which also shows the function of each key at any given time. For example, during ship-to-ship combat, the [...] "3", [...] "7", and [...] "1" [...] keys on the numpad representation are shown with images of different cannonball types - these buttons are used to select different types of cannonballs to fire. The on-screen keypad can also be clicked with a mouse, performing the same function as the keyboard key would have performed. Though the mouse can be used for various commands, the keypad is the preferred <b>input</b> <b>mechanism</b> due to the game's mechanics.|$|E

Previous attempts at mobile virtual environments have yielded unsatisfactory results. This research aims to create a believable mobile virtual environment, capable of running in real-time and making use of intuitive <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The rendering of the virtual environment is accomplished with the use of OpenGL ES, while the interaction of the system is handled by a tilt sensor and GPS receiver. Optimisation techniques are necessary to achieve a minimum interactive frame rate of 5 frames per second including mipmaps, frustum culling, minimisation of OpenGL ES state changes and the use of fixed-point calculations rather than floating-point calculations. User tests clearly show that the use of intuitive <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is greatly preferred over conventional keypad input. This research shows that believable mobile virtual environments are feasible and are able to provide the user with intuitive <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and an interactive frame rate...|$|R

40|$|Tagging helps achieve {{improved}} indexing and {{recommendation of}} resources (e. g., videos or pictures) in large data collections. In order {{to reap the}} benefits of tagging, people must be persuaded to label the resources they consume. This paper reports on a study in which four different tagging <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and their effect on users' motivation to tag were compared. The mechanisms consisted of a standard tag input box, a chatbot-like environment, a bookmarking mechanism, and a "tag and vote" game. The results of our experiment show that the use of the nonstandard tagging <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms</b> does not affect users' motivation to tag. In some instances tagging mechanisms were found to distract users from their primary task: consuming resources. Persuading people to tag might be accomplished more effectively by using other motivating tagging mechanisms (e. g., tagging games), or motivation could be created by explaining the usefulness of tagging...|$|R

40|$|The limited {{scope of}} the input {{interface}} in mobile computing environment {{has led to the}} development of intelligent <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> These mechanisms can be classified into two categories- text input and graphic input. While graphic input methods are widely used in PDAs and palm pilots, text based interfaces are more appropriate for mobile communication devices. Tap-a-tap, multi-tap, predictive text input etc. are some of the popular text <b>input</b> <b>mechanisms</b> used in mobile computing devices such as simputers, PDAs and mobile phones. This paper broadly focuses on the text-based input solutions for the mobile communication devices. Messaging or more simply texting, is one of the key features in mobiles and the limitations of the telephone keypad pose a greater challenge in keying in texts. The common solution is multi-tap approach, where the characters are spread across the keypad and the user has to press the keys appropriate number of times for a specific character. The disadvantage with this approach is the slow typing, waiting time etc. Keying in a substantially long message will often result in fatigue. Several research works focused on finding a better and efficien...|$|R

5000|$|Besides {{the usual}} {{malfunctions}} common to laser printers with worn rollers or accumulated paper dust, older IIISi and 4Si printers eventually exhibit a [...] "phantom paper jam." [...] On longer documents, the printer will stop and report a paper jam, {{but with no}} visible reason why the paper wasn't feeding correctly. There {{are a couple of}} solenoids at the paper tray <b>input</b> <b>mechanism</b> that have felt pads designed to cushion them when they snap on, and the glue holding these pads in place can migrate to the surface. This delays the release of the solenoid, which causes the paper to start feeding slightly late. The error accumulates with each page printed, and eventually the paper is entering the mechanism so late that the printer believes that a jam has occurred. The tell-tale symptom is a print job with a top margin that shrinks from page to page. This problem is fixed by removing the felt pads, cleaning off the adhesive (isopropyl alcohol works well), and placing some electrical tape or other material to provide a cushion for the solenoid. Unfortunately, accessing the solenoids requires disassembling most of the <b>input</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

Although hardware keyboards are available with dual keyboard layouts (e.g. Cyrillic/Latin letters in various national layouts), the on-screen keyboard provides a handy substitute while working at different stations or on laptops, which seldom come with dual layouts.|$|E
50|$|As {{the work}} continued, the team decided that locking {{the system to}} the {{particular}} hardware they were using was not appropriate, and started modifying the PDI system {{to be based on}} alpha-numeric codes instead of binary numbers. A major advantage to this approach is that the data can be sent over common communications channels instead of relying on an 8-bit clean link to the host computer. In 1975 the CRC contracted Norpak to develop an interactive color display terminal based on the new alpha-numeric PDI. The CRC had patented several of the technologies by the end of 1977; a touch-sensitive <b>input</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the basic graphics system, and the interactive graphics programming language.|$|E
