5000|$|Militarily, this headdress came in {{different}} styles. The Prussian style had a cone-shaped brass or white-metal front {{with a cloth}} rear having lace braiding; the Russian style initially consisted of a tall brass plate atop of a leather cap with a peak at the rear, although the German model was subsequently adopted. The British style—usually simply called a [...] "grenadier cap" [...] instead of a mitre—had a tall cloth front with elaborate regimental embroidery forward of a sloping red back, lined in white. Some German and Russian fusilier regiments also wore a mitre with a smaller brass <b>front-plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The panoply’s cuirass {{consists}} of two pieces, for the chest and back. These are joined {{on the left side}} by a hinge. There is a bronze loop {{on the right side of}} the <b>front-plate</b> and a similar loop on each shoulder. Large shoulder-guards fit over the cuirass. Two triangular plates are attached to the shoulder-guards and gave protection to the wearer’s armpits when his arms were in the raised position. There is also a deep neck-guard. The Linear B ideogram depicting armour of this type makes the neck-guard clearly discernible, and protection by a high bronze collar was a typical feature of Near Eastern body armour. Three pairs of curved plates hang from the waist to protect the groin and the thighs. All these pieces are made of beaten bronze sheet and are backed with leather and loosely fastened by ox-hide thongs to allow some degree of movement. The complete panoply thus forms a cumbersome tubular suit of armour, which fully protects the neck and torso, and extends down to the knees. It appears that lower arm-guards and a set of greaves further protected the warrior, all made of bronze, as fragments of these were also found in the grave at Dendra. Slivers of boars’ tusks were also discovered, which once made up a boars’-tusk helmet.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. According to "A Test Plan for Investigating the Structural Integrity of TileCal modules" by Norman Hill {{a series}} of {{mechanical}} tests have been carried out. Stiffnesses and loads which could cause failure of the sub-module were measured. Measurements of displacements were carried out using dial indicators. These data have been compared with results of numerical calculations. 2 Shear failure of the <b>front-plate</b> To simulate front part of three submodules connected with one <b>front-plate,</b> a set-up shown in Fig. 1 a has been realised. The final load equal to 85 tons caused failure of two cross-sections of the <b>front-plate</b> and some parts of welds. The average value of shear stresses in the <b>front-plate</b> are equal to av = 85 tons Δ 9810 N tons =(2 Δ 1240 mm) = 336 MP a: 1 Using the Mises-Hencky theory the equivalent one...|$|E
50|$|The {{shape and}} {{appearance}} of fur hats differed according to period and country. While France used smaller bearskins, Spain preferred towering ones with long flowing bags, and while Britain had its tall cloth mitres with lacing and braiding, Russia would sport equally tall leather helmets with brass <b>front-plates.</b> The first headdresses were fairly low, {{and in the}} case of Spain and Austria sometimes contained elements from both mitres and bearskins. At the beginning of the 18th century and briefly during the 1770s, French grenadiers wore tricorne hats, rather than either the mitre or fur cap. Gradually, both began to increase in size and decoration, now showing devices such as pompoms, cords, badges, <b>front-plates,</b> plumes, braiding and also various national heraldic symbols.|$|R
40|$|The use of ticket slot {{machines}} has been improved by developing principles {{for the design}} of the <b>front-plates</b> giving user guidance. Applying a new two-dimensional matrix-presentation to the panels of the Stuttgart ticket {{slot machines}} instead of the formerly undefined organisation, errors as well as the time needed to obtain a ticket decreased significantly. The new panel based on the operating sequence diagram is being presented. (IITB...|$|R
2500|$|High-relief {{ornamental}} designs {{known as}} the [...] "Plastic Style" [...] are found on warriors' equipment from Pişcolt, comprising a shield with an ornate handle and shield-boss {{as well as a}} sword in an ornamented scabbard with traces of a [...] "dragon-pair" [...] motif. This motif is one of the genuinely pan-European themes of early La Tène art and is found embellishing the upper end of scabbard <b>front-plates</b> from southeast Britain to Transylvania.|$|R
40|$|An amorphous-Selenium (a-Se) based portal detector, {{which uses}} the metal {{substrate}} as a conversion plate, is studied using Monte Carlo techniques. The optimal thickness and material {{of the metal}} plate and a-Se thicknesses are investigated by modelling dose deposition in the a-Se layer for a 6 MV exit beam. Simulations of Detective Quantum Efficiency DQE(f) show that although DQE(0) increases with metal thickness up to $d sb{max},$ there is a cross-over near 1 cycle/mm which indicates that smaller metal thicknesses are more useful to visualize edges and small objects. A similar cross-over, though not as prominent, is also observed with constant metal thickness while varying a-Se thickness. Tungsten front plates are shown be optimal in terms of DQE for the plates under investigation. The effect of the scattered beam, described by the Scatter Fraction SF and Scatter-to-Primary Ratio SPR, is also modelled {{to ensure that the}} <b>front-plate,</b> which also acts as a scatter-rejection tool, satisfactorily filters out the scatter component. The SF is measured experimentally with a prototype imager for four metal plate/a-Se combinations and agrees with the Monte Carlo results within experimental uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} (MTF), noise power spectrum (NPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) for metal/film portal detectors are {{reported for the}} Cobalt- 60 and 10 MV spectra. The detectors consist of a double-emulsion portal film secured between plates of aluminum, copper, brass or lead with thicknesses from 0 to 4. 81 mm. The study of MTF, NPS, and DQE shows that both photons and secondary electrons produced within the <b>front-plate</b> and backscattered electrons from the back-plate affect metal/film portal imaging. Study of DQE indicates that the best portal detectors are those without back-plates, and with high density front-plates with thicknesses less than the maximum electron range. This MTF data was modeled with the logit analysis. It is shown that the parameters resulting from the logit analysis depend on the mass thickness and the atomic number of the metal plates. Metal/amorphous selenium (a-Se) electrostatic-based detectors {{have been developed for}} portal imaging. The detectors consist of a-Se photoconductive layers of varied thicknesses deposited on plates of varying thicknesses of aluminum, copper, and stainless steel. The metal-plates of the detectors face the incident 6 MV and Co- 60 photon spectra during imaging. The sensitivity of the a-Se detectors to dose, electric field across the a-Se layer, plate type, and a-Se thickness is studied. A model showing a cubic relationship between the a-Se latent surface voltage and dose is derived and experimentally verified. A contrast-detail phantom is used to study the image quality and contrast-resolution characteristics of the metal/a-Se detectors. The metal/a-Se detectors produce better quality contrast-detailed images at a considerably lower dose than that offered by the other commercial available portal systems, mainly due to the low inherent noise of the novel detectors. A semi-automatic technique for the direct set-up alignment of radiosurgical circular fields from an isocentric linac to treatment room laser cross-hairs is described. Because film or a-Se is each sensitive to laser and ionizing radiation, they are used to acquire images of the positioning lasers superimposed directly onto the radiosurgical circular fields. An algorithm extracts the coordinates of the center of the collimator image and of the intersection of the laser cross-hair image and subsequently determines the deviation, to within a precision of ∼ 0. 04 mm. The technique is also used to perform quality assurance on a Clinac- 18 linac and shows a (0. 53 +/- 0. 05) mm wobble from the nominal isocenter of the linac...|$|E
