5|$|That week {{confined}} {{to my room}} actually saved my life. I {{had been scheduled to}} <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a gunnery flight the afternoon that I was confined. My roommate took the flight instead of me, in an aircraft I had been scheduled to fly. Shortly after he took off, while {{on his way to the}} gunnery range, he developed engine trouble and had to crash-land near the Hindenburg-Kattowitz railroad. He was killed in the crash.|$|E

According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen. They would go to concerts, and when these were over they would <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and delirium the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was even able to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and delirium, and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E

25|$|Barrett {{was talking}} to the second engineer, Mr. Hesketh, when the red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to the men in the boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight door into boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E

The music played from 10 p.m. Saturday night to 6 a.m. Monday morning. [...] "Celebrities, politicians, and tourists" [...] often arrived {{in the early morning}} hours after the clubs on the white side of town had closed, and white performers such as Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle, and Lenny Bruce would <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> stage.|$|E
500|$|The fight scene between Lisa and Myfanwy was {{difficult}} to shoot, as the actress had to interact with a visual effect creature {{that would not be}} added until post-production. The producers added a plastic green beak stuck {{on the end of a}} stick to be used as a guide. The scene where the team <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the invisible lift was made by making the platform stationary, but the camera below it would descend, giving the illusion the platform is ascending. The visual effect of the tools used to create Cybermen were reused from the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Age of Steel", while the UFO footage when the Torchwood team return from the drinks was a tin foil-covered frisbee on a fishing line.|$|E

It was the first script Meyer wrote on the show, {{and he thought he}} made [...] "quite a few mistakes, but it turned out really well overall." [...] The staff decided to do a Thanksgiving episode after they found out that an episode would air on Thursday, November 22, 1990, the date of Thanksgiving that year. The Simpsons had previously aired at 8:00p.m. EST on Sunday night but the Fox network switched its timeslot to the same time on Thursdays {{at the beginning of the}} second season.

2500|$|Cattle {{ranching}} {{is another}} traditional branch of Nakhchivan farming. Due {{to the dry}} climate, pastures in Nakhchivan are unproductive, therefore sheep breeding prevails over other livestock production. Winter pastures stretch on the PriAraz plain, on the foothills and mountain sides to the altitude of 1200m. But the summer pastures <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the high-mountain area to an altitude of 2300–3200m. The most widespread sheep variety is [...] "balbas". These sheep are distinguished by their productivity and snow-white silky wool which is widely used {{in the manufacture of}} carpets. Horned and small cattle are bred everywhere, especially in environs of Sharur and Nakhchivan. Buffaloes are also bred here.|$|E
2500|$|On July 16, {{two days}} after the first ascent and the catastrophe, Jean-Antoine Carrel set out to crown Whymper's victory by proving that the Italian side was not unconquerable. He was {{accompanied}} by Amé Gorret, a priest who had shared with him the first attempt on the mountain back in 1857. Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet completed the party. Giordano would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one's life. After hearing Sunday mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Amé Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: [...] "At last we crossed the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!" [...] On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall's flagstaff. [...] "We were about to enter unknown country," [...] wrote Gorret, [...] "for no man had gone beyond this point." [...] Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse {{to the west of the}} peak, and thence <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his recent defeat.|$|E
2500|$|The 1985 Wimbledon Championships final saw Evert play Navratilova for the fifth-time at the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC). [...] In {{the first}} set, Evert broke Navratilova {{in the third}} game of the set, which allowed her to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> serve. [...] This {{would not be an}} {{uncomplicated}} set though for Evert because at five game to four with her serving for the match she had many complications. [...] Evert took the first point of the game on a volley that her opponent hit into the net. [...] Evert would find herself in a bind on break point in the first set, which Navratilova hit a backhand volley, but Evert reached it with a forehand shot. [...] Then she had to stave off another break point with a speedy forehand. [...] On the first set point, Evert misplayed a forehand to deep, and lost the point. [...] The second set point was played out by a weakly lobbed shot by Evert was tracked down by Navratilova, and her opponent played another lob back, which Evert played horridly overhead smash shot. [...] This was still barely strong enough to force a measger return by Navratilova, which Evert volley the ball into the corner to take the opening set six games to four. [...] In the second set, Evert could not get her playing level back from the first set. [...] Evert was at one-all love-30 on Navratilova's serve, but was unable to get a break point off of her, which in the subsequent game her opponent would break her serve and the score line was one game to three instead of the other way around. [...] Evert now found herself at two games to four and love-30 down, and got lambasted by four Navratilova winners. [...] At five games to three, Evert had two break points, but could not convert, which Evert lost the second set three games to six. [...] In the decider set, Evert was quickly put on the defensive by Navratilova in the first game, which she was down 15 points to love. [...] At this juncture, Evert saved those two break point opportunities, but on deuce came to net and got passed, which set up a three-times-a-charm break point and her opponent capitalized on the opening. [...] Evert could not get back on track because of the relentless nature to Navratilova's game, which in the last game was plagued by bad line calls and lost the set two games to six. [...] In the end, Evert never won a final appearance at Wimbledon against her arch-enemy Navratilova in all five-time they pair played in them together.|$|E
