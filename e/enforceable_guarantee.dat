According to a report from 2008, housing accounts for 27% of carbon dioxide emissions in the United Kingdom. Action is being taken on new buildings through 2006 changes to the Building Regulations, and on existing housing through the Carbon Emission Reduction Target. The Government is introducing The Green Deal. It proposes tying low interest loans for energy efficiency improvements to the energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on. These debts would then be passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of the bills. It is proposed that the costs of the loan repayments would be less than the savings on the bills from the upgrades, however this will be a guideline and not legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>guarantee.</b> It is believed that energy bills like housing a cost people always meet those giving investors a secure return.|$|E
40|$|Policy {{engineering}} for access-control {{security has}} traditionally focused on specification and verification of safety properties (``nothing bad happens''). In most real systems however, resources and access mechanisms are regularly compromised, either maliciously by attackers, or inadvertently due to vulnerabilities caused by poor systems-engineering. I {{argue that the}} all-or-nothing nature of assurance provided by safety-engineering cannot describe or reason about systems that are secure and survivable [...] systems that can be engineered to proactively or reactively change their security policies and policy enforcement mechanisms, and thereby continue to provide assurance for critical resources, in spite of compromises and failures. In this thesis, I present a framework that extends traditional state-transition models of access control security, to describe timing guarantees and stochastic behavior, and show how we can introduce notions of information compromise, subsequent recovery (whenever possible) and flexible-response in a modular fashion. Our framework is also capable of describing insider attacks. I show how {{we need to focus}} on liveness properties (``something good eventually happens'') to explicitly capture the temporal and dynamic nature of <b>enforceable</b> <b>guarantees</b> required for survivability. I develop a new class of properties expressed as branching-time temporal logic formulas that focus on secure availability as a measure of survivability. For finite-state models, the validation of these formulas is decidable in polynomial time using automated model-checking techniques. To showcase the expressive power of our framework, I apply it to study network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and model resilience to such attacks as a survivability property. I show how we can systematically analyze the relative impact of different anti-DoS strategies by changing policies and mechanisms during an attack. Using our automated verification methodology, we formally prove for the first time whether strategies such as selective filtering, strong-authentication, and client-puzzles reduce the vulnerability of an example network to DoS attacks...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how Norwegian companies protect foreign investments against political and regulatory risk. It does so {{by looking at}} how the Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries (Norfund) protects its investments in Africa; particularly in coun-tries where Norway has no bilateral or multilateral investment treaties (BITs). According to the Norfund Act, Norfund’s purpose is to provide equity capital and other risk capital in or-der to assist in developing sustainable businesses and industry in developing countries. His-torically, when investors from developed countries such as Norway invest in developing countries in Africa, {{one of the main}} challenges is how to protect their investments against potential changes in local regulations and politics that might affect the value of their in-vestments. Investors have relied on, inter alia, investment agreements between their home government and the host country for <b>guarantee</b> of <b>enforceable</b> rights {{in the event of a}} poten-tial expropriation of their property. In the case of Norfund, Norway has not signed many BITs or investment agreements with the African countries where Norfund invests. To under-stand what a lack of a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>enforceable</b> rights mean for Norfund, I examine three pre-viously concluded investment disputes; Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania; Parkerings - Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania; and Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd v. Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana. I relate these cases to similar situations in which Norfund can find themselves in the course of their op-erations in Africa. This thesis concludes that: Norfund as a long-term investor in Africa may not need the protections of <b>enforceable</b> rights <b>guaranteed</b> by BITs and investment promotion acts be-cause Norfund has a different mandate than a private investor, which is to help those African countries build their industries. As such, Norfund does not need <b>guarantees</b> of <b>enforceable</b> rights before making long-term investments. The current investments protection regime does not fall into its interest. Norfund does not need to protect its investments because it does not have a profit motive...|$|R
40|$|Performance-hungry {{data center}} {{applications}} demand increasingly higher performance from their storage {{in addition to}} larger capacity memory at lower cost. While the existing storage technologies (e. g., HDD and flash-based SSD) are limited in their performance, the most prevalent memory technology (DRAM) is unable to address the capacity and cost requirements of these applications. Emerging byte-addressable, non-volatile memory technologies (such as PCM and RRAM) offer performance within {{an order of magnitude}} of DRAM, prompting their inclusion in the processor memory subsystem. Such load/store accessible non-volatile or persistent memory (referred to as NVM or PM) introduces an interesting new tier that bridges the performance gap between DRAM and PM, and serves the role of fast storage or slower memory. However, PM has several implications on system design, both hardware and software: (i) the hardware caching mechanisms, while necessary for acceptable performance, complicate the ordering and durability of stores to PM, (ii) the high performance of PM (compared to NAND) {{and the fact that it}} is byte-addressable necessitate rethinking of the system software to manage PM and the interfaces to expose PM to the applications, and (iii) the future memory-based applications that will likely employ systems coupling PM with DRAM (for cost and capacity reasons) must be extremely conscious of the performance characteristics of PM and the challenges of using fast vs. slow memory in ways that best meet their performance demands. The key contribution of our research is a set of technologies that addresses these challenges in a bottom-up fashion. Since the real hardware is not yet available, we first implement a hardware emulator that can faithfully emulate the relative performance characteristics of DRAM and PM in a system with separate DRAM and emulated PM regions. We use this emulator to perform all of our evaluations. Next we explore system software support to enable low-overhead PM access by new and legacy applications. Towards this end, we implement PMFS, an optimized light-weight POSIX file system that exploits PM's byte-addressability to avoid overheads of block-oriented storage and enable direct PM access by applications (with memory-mapped I/O). To provide strong consistency guarantees, PMFS requires only a simple hardware primitive that provides software <b>enforceable</b> <b>guarantees</b> of durability and ordering of stores to PM. We demonstrate that PMFS achieves significant (up to an order of magnitude) gains over traditional file systems (such as ext 4) on a RAMDISK-like PM block device. Finally, we address the problem of designing memory-based applications for systems with both DRAM and PM by extending our system software to manage both the tiers. We demonstrate for several representative large in-memory applications that it is possible to use a small amount of fast DRAM and large amounts of slower PM without a proportional impact to an application's performance, provided the placement of data structures is done in a careful fashion. To simplify the application programming, we implement a set of libraries and automatic tools (called X-Mem) that enables programmers to achieve optimal data placement with minimal effort on their part. Finally, we demonstrate the potentially large benefits of application-driven memory tiering with X-Mem across a range of applications. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to consider the}} intersection of gender and EU law. It does so {{in the context of}} the endeavour to go “beyond Article 119. ” In other words, it looks beyond the most obvious engagement of EU law with the legal status of women (and men) as actors within the market place for labour, which takes the form of a treaty-based and fully legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>guarantee</b> of equal pay for equal work, plus an associated legal framework for equal treatment in other aspects of employment and related matters. That is not to say that the whole realm of sex discrimination law should suddenly be dismissed as unimportant. On the contrary, inevitably the legal regulation of equality and the creation of a regime to guarantee non-discrimination on grounds of sex under the law will feature prominently in any analysis of the gendered nature of EU law. However, the basic proposition from which I start in this paper is that there is a substantial difference between, on the one hand, studying, analysing and presenting a field of law defined by reference to specified legal categories such as ‘non-discrimination’ or ‘the right to equality’ and, on the other hand, beginning an analysis with a non-legal category such as ‘gender. ...|$|E
50|$|Since 1978 he {{has been}} an {{attorney}} specializing in civil litigation and criminal defense. Halbrook defies all stereotypes about gun rights advocates. He did not come to the issue with a particularly abiding interest in guns, or even as a conservative. He has published several books and dozens of articles {{on the history of the}} right to bear arms, the historical background of the Second Amendment, modern gun control, Nazi gun control policies during World War II, and Switzerland's policy of armed neutrality during World War II. Halbrook first appeared on the Second Amendment scene with a 1981 article in the George Mason University Law Review, arguing that the Second Amendment guaranteed an individual right to arms, and that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to make that Second Amendment <b>guarantee</b> <b>enforceable</b> against the states. His dozens of articles in scholarly journals, as well as his books, played a major role in sparking great academic and judicial interest in the Second Amendment and firearms policy. He has argued that the Second Amendment, properly understood, protected both the states' right to maintain a militia and an individual right to bear arms for self-defense.|$|R
40|$|Critics of originalist {{approaches}} to constitutional interpretation often {{focus on the}} “intolerable” results that originalism would purportedly require. Although originalists have disputed many such claims, one contention {{that they have been}} famously unable to answer satisfactorily is the claim that their theory is incapable of justifying the Supreme Court’s famous 1954 decision in Bolling v. Sharpe. Decided the same day as Brown v. Board of Education, Bolling is the case that is most closely associated with the Supreme Court’s so-called “reverse incorporation” doctrine, which interprets the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as if it effectively 2 ̆ 2 incorporates 2 ̆ 2 the Fourteenth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s Equal Protection Clause against the federal government. The presumed inability of originalism to justify Bolling and reverse incorporation has left originalists open to the charge that their theory would leave the federal government with unfettered discretion to discriminate against racial minorities or anyone else it chooses. This article challenges the conventional wisdom regarding Bolling’s assumed originalist indefensibility by recovering the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which declares all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction to be citizens of the United States. Although sometimes viewed by modern commentators as an inconsequential “afterthought,” this article contends that the Citizenship Clause was widely perceived by members of the enacting generation as a central focus of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Section One and that the provision constitutionalized a longstanding American political and legal tradition linking the status of “citizenship” with the entitlement to equal treatment at the hands of government. Drawing on pre-Fourteenth Amendment understandings of “citizenship,” and the conceptions of citizenship reflected in the framing and ratification debates and in early interpretations of the Amendment, this article contends that the Citizenship Clause provides a historically and textually defensible basis for a legally <b>enforceable</b> equality <b>guarantee</b> applicable to federal conduct that is at least as broad as the equality guarantee made applicable to the states by the Equal Protection Clause...|$|R
40|$|The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) firmly {{enshrined}} a {{legal framework}} <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>enforceable</b> minimum intellectual property (IP) standards {{at the international}} level. But it also resulted in a greater inclusion of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in wider political debates between developing and industrialised countries – for instance on questions of global health and development. This paper argues that the increasing reach and efficacy of the IP regime {{has given rise to}} wider challenges to the IP system needing urgent conceptual analysis. The focus here is on IP’s increasing confrontation with the right to health, which is analysed not as an encounter of radically opposed legal systems, but as an ambivalent process in which the right to health operates as a challenge to the IP system – and, paradoxically, as an argument for its extension. To account for this ambivalence, the analysis develops a Foucauldian understanding of the right to health’s potential challenge, re-evaluating the right to health’s role {{as a part of a}} process of incremental realisation of governmental priorities, which negotiates tensions between guaranteeing the function of the economy and improving the health of populations. While this incremental process draws attention to the limitations of the right to health’s potential to challenge the IP regime, it also highlights this regime’s difficulty in accommodating a wider range of active entrepreneurial subject...|$|R
40|$|Transactional memory (TM) is {{a modern}} {{concurrency}} control paradigm that reduces the difficulty of parallel programming. TM also reduces some unnecessary program serialization by allowing operations from different critical sections, called transactions, to execute concurrently. Although allowing transactions to execute concurrently can increase throughput, care is needed to avoid memory access conflicts between transactions {{that can lead to}} incorrect program states. To prevent such incorrect program states, TM systems identify conflicts between transactions before such illegal states become part of the visible program state. To do this, when two or more transactions conflict, the TM stalls or rolls back some number of transactions to ensure the program state remains serializable, the main correctness criterion for TM systems. The process of identifying when transactions conflict is called conflict detection and is a significant source of overhead. To improve the performance of TM, researchers have found optimizations that reduce the cost of conflict detection. However, many of these TMs perform one aspect of conflict detection in the same manner. That is, they perform commit-time validation, where a transaction is analyzed for conflicts with previously committed transactions during its commit phase. While commit-time validation has certain benefits, it also has drawbacks that make it a suboptimal conflict detection strategy for certain environments. In this work we present a conflict detection strategy called full invalidation where the TM resolves all conflicts between a given transaction and all other active transactions before the given transaction commits. Full invalidation has a number of advantages over validation such as improved performance, <b>enforceable</b> execution <b>guarantees,</b> reduced conflict speculation, reduced conflict analysis space and time overhead, and simplified integration of optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control. We analyze full invalidation in the following ways. First, we compare and contrast InvalSTM, a software transactional memory (STM) that implements full invalidation, against TL 2, a state-of-the-art STM that uses commit-time validation. Next we present a new theoretical model for TM systems and use the model to prove that histories accepted by a full invalidation system are both conflict and view serializable. We then demonstrate that a full invalidation STM is notably more efficient (by upwards of 100 x) than a commit-time validation STM for programs where transactional priority must be respected. Last, we show that a full invalidation STM can reduce the TM implementation complexity and the TM operational overhead when using optimistic (transactions) and pessimistic (locks) critical sections in the same program...|$|R
