25|$|By taking {{nine and}} a half hours to make their 321 on winning the toss England could point to the {{difficulty}} of forcing the ball away from so turgid a pitch and so dusty an in-field and finally across a slow, lush, green carpet. Naturally suspicious of player's alibis, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> on their side this time - up to a point.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{surprised}} when Mill {{informed me that}} he had not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} here was a task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another. I thought that in philosophy, too, I knew what I wanted, and saw a road open in front of me.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Over and Over", Madonna sings about {{determination}} and picking yourself up from disappointments. The song consists of instrumentation from drums, synths {{and has a}} three-chord progression. An emotional moment occurred in the recording studio when Madonna covered the 1978 Rose Royce song [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore". Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, {{you go out there}} and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." [...] The song features Madonna's vocals supported by acoustic guitars and synth strings, with Thompson playing the drum in the second verse. Towards the end, Madonna emotes in the voice of a soul singer.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, Aronofsky bowed out of {{directing}} the film, {{saying in a}} statement, [...] "As I talked more about the film with my collaborators at Fox, {{it became clear that}} the production of The Wolverine would keep me out of the country for almost a year.... I was not comfortable being away from my family for that length of time. I am sad that I won't be able to see the project through, as it is a terrific script and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> looking forward to working with my friend, Hugh Jackman, again". Fox also decided to be [...] "in no rush" [...] to start the production due to the damage incurred in Japan by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, Jackman said the project was moving ahead. [...] "It's too early to call on Japan, I'm not sure where they're at. So now we're finding another director, but Fox is very anxious to make the movie and we're moving ahead full steam to find another director".|$|E
500|$|During this period, he billed {{himself as}} Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised {{the name to}} its {{backward}} spelling of Mot Snevets; the name {{did not last long}} and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of Dame Ellen Terry, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was [...] "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also [...] "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased [...] "the most irresistible holder in Dunhill's. It was slightly [...] because it was made of lacquered, black whangee... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a [...] "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that [...] "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> a conservative Englishman who {{would have loved to have}} been a genuine eccentric".|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} for [...] "TS-19" [...] transpired at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, {{which was}} depicted as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Producers {{of the show}} {{were not allowed to}} photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt {{that it was important to}} add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] "When Frank was pitching the idea to me, saying he wanted to bring them to the CDC and telling me all the different things that he felt would come out of that story, the science of it all and the being trapped in the small location, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> picturing a lot of Day of the Dead stuff," [...] stated creator Robert Kirkman.

The papers had been full of the wonders of Röntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until Röntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper & seen the photographs, he wrote Röntgen a letter saying that [...] "I need not tell you that when I read the paper <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made" [...] He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896. (See also N rays.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{factor in}} the change of the band's sound was due to Wilson's meeting of Israeli rock singer Aviv Geffen. The two met when Geffen, a fan of Wilson's music, invited Porcupine Tree on a tour in 2000 {{in support of the}} band's {{previous}} album, Lightbulb Sun. Touring together lead to a separate musical collaboration named Blackfield. Geffen, not being a fan of metal music, kept that project in more of a pop rock genre, sounding more like prior Porcupine Tree albums Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun. This gave Wilson an outlet for that side of his music, allowing him to concentrate on more metal sounds with Porcupine Tree without abandoning the prior genre altogether either. Rounding out the changes was the departure of drummer Chris Maitland, with the replacement being Gavin Harrison, who joined in early 2002. Maitland was unable to make a larger commitment with being signed to a major record label, and the band found Harrison's style more fitting to a more metal-sounding album. Wilson summarized the band's changes at the time as: In Absentia was all written before Gavin came on; even the drum parts were kind of programmed. But it’s one of those times sometimes in life when everything comes together. I’d written these songs and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> more interested at that time—having worked with Opeth—in the idea of combining a more kind of brutal or metal aspect back again into the fabric of the music. At the same time Gavin came along and Gavin was a very different drummer to our previous drummer, Chris Maitland. He was much more of a powerhouse and he was much more technical. He had more of a contemporary edge to his sound so {{it was just one of}} those really lucky things that he just came in and he played those songs and just blew everyone away and everything just kind of came together. And of course it was the first record we made for our new label and we got signed to a big American label for the first time [...] Gavin was the final piece of that equation in a way—he just totally raised the bar in terms of not just the drumming but just the musicianship right throughout the band. Everyone was listening to Gavin and saying, “Fuck, wow. We really need to step up our game.” ...|$|E
