5|$|The LS3/5A (each element {{pronounced}} separately, {{without the}} stroke) {{is a small}} studio monitor loudspeaker originated by the BBC for use by outside broadcast vans to ensure quality of their broadcasts. The speaker concept set out transparent and natural sound as the goal, and {{the achievement of the}} <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> widely acknowledged.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process, {{by which}} 1km planetesimals grow into 1,000km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which {{depend on the}} distance from the star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem.|$|E
25|$|The USSC {{mission is}} {{undefined}} and the desired <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> unclear.|$|E
25|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> {{that the}} Kurds were {{included}} in the territories of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{estimates}} were that between 100 and at most 1000 Galaksijas will <b>be</b> built. <b>End</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> at least 8,000.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff - No footage {{is shown}} of Jeff's installation, {{although}} his <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> {{similar to that}} of Jaime, Candace, and Terry.|$|R
25|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> an {{increase}} in truck traffic during the morning and evening rush hours when traffic is most dense, commuters exhibit the least patience, and safety is compromised.|$|E
25|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a rate, {{measured}} in terms of years or in terms of nucleotide substitutions per site, that a lineage in one region moves to another region {{over the course of the}} phylogenetic tree.|$|E
25|$|A bitters is {{traditionally}} an alcoholic preparation flavored with botanical matter {{such that the}} <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> characterized by a bitter, sour, or bittersweet flavor. Numerous longstanding brands of bitters were originally developed as patent medicines, but are now sold as digestifs and cocktail flavorings.|$|E
50|$|The second attack {{involved}} other Iranian mountain troops infiltrated {{and attempted}} to liberate Mehran. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> similar to the previous battle.|$|R
50|$|Hanson {{made his}} Wallabies debut at Suncorp Stadium Brisbane, Queensland on 20 October 2012. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> an 18-18 draw with the All-Blacks {{in the final}} Bledisloe Cup match.|$|R
50|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that al-Ma'mun {{became the}} new Abbasid Caliph. Yet, {{he would not}} arrive in Baghdad until 819 due to the {{destruction}} and continued disturbances in the city.|$|R
25|$|Harmonic scalpel: This {{medical device}} uses {{ultrasonic}} energy to vibrate its blade at 55kHz. Invisible {{to the naked}} eye, the vibration transfers energy to the tissue, providing simultaneous cutting and coagulation. The temperature of the surrounding tissue reaches 80°C. Proponents of this procedure assert that the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> precise cutting with minimal thermal damage.|$|E
25|$|Deliberate, {{productive}} {{struggle with}} mathematical ideas {{refers to the}} fact that when students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> greater learning. This {{has been shown to be}} true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an example}} of {{selection}} in action at the cellular level, using a selection pressure to target and differentiate between varying populations of cells. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> the extinction of one species or population of cells (endothelial cells), followed by the collapse of the ecosystem (the tumor) due either to nutrient deprivation or self-pollution from the destruction of necessary waste pathways.|$|E
5000|$|Soh Yun-Huei {{gave the}} film 1/2 out of 4 stars, writing the film meant to blend [...] "suspense, melodrama and romance together, but the <b>end</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> lumpy and unsatisfying".|$|R
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 11th century, Serbia waged a series of {{successive}} wars against the Byzantines. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> Serbia's territorial enlargement and its eventual advancement into a kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the war, Tengku Kudin {{brought in}} {{soldiers}} from Kedah and Pahang along with mercenaries and European {{officers from the}} Straits Settlements. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a victory for Tengku Kudin.|$|R
25|$|Very pure {{phosphoric acid}} is {{obtained}} by burning elemental phosphorus to produce phosphorus pentoxide, which is subsequently dissolved in dilute phosphoric acid. This route produces a very pure phosphoric acid, since most impurities {{present in the}} rock have been removed when extracting phosphorus from the rock in a furnace. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> food-grade, thermal phosphoric acid; however, for critical applications, additional processing to remove arsenic compounds may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Biofouling {{has strong}} {{negative}} impacts on aquaculture operations. Water flow and dissolved oxygen are inhibited due to clogged nets in fish pens. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> often diseased fish from infections, such as netpen liver disease, amoebic gill disease, and parasites. Other negative impacts include increased fish mortalities, decreased fish growth rates, premature fish harvesting, reduced fish product values and profitability, and an adversely impacted environment near fish farms.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} a refinery, the synthetic crude is processed {{and a significant}} portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable.|$|E
5000|$|Clear <b>end</b> <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{described}} {{to the reader}} (e.g.,"When the program is installed properly, an icon {{will appear in the}} left-hand corner of your screen and the LED will turn on...") ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> Factory Direct: New Haven, an {{exhibition}} of artwork that captured the history, community, materials, processes, and products of the host factories through sound, images, video, and interactive installations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a {{very limited}} access to lawful {{abortion}} which varied widely from one town or province to another. Many towns and cities {{did not have any}} hospital that provided abortions.|$|R
25|$|Cells {{reproduce}} {{through a}} process of cell division in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. For prokaryotes, cell division occurs {{through a process}} of fission in which the DNA is replicated, then the two copies are attached to parts of the cell membrane. In eukaryotes, a more complex process of mitosis is followed. However, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> the same; the resulting cell copies are identical {{to each other and to}} the original cell (except for mutations), and both are capable of further division following an interphase period.|$|E
25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as activin ß-A, which encodes a subunit of activin A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The activin molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the chance that they make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the presynaptic cell is increased. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} recognition {{motif of}} the AhR/ARNT complex, {{referred to as}} either the AhR-, dioxin- or xenobiotic- responsive element (AHRE, DRE or XRE), contains the core sequence 5'-GCGTG-3' within the consensus sequence 5'-T/GNGCGTGA/CG/CA-3' in the promoter region of AhR responsive genes. The AhR/ARNT heterodimer directly binds the AHRE/DRE/XRE core sequence in an asymmetric manner such that ARNT binds to 5'-GTG-3' and AhR binding 5'-TC/TGC-3'. Recent research suggests that a second type of element termed AHRE-II, 5'-CATG(N6)CTG-3', is capable of indirectly acting with the AhR/ARNT complex. Regardless of the response element, the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a variety of differential changes in gene expression.|$|E
50|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a {{successful}} raid into an unguarded portion of Andalusia, {{followed by the}} safe return of the raiders with plunder and captives. This convinced Tariq that Iberia could be successfully invaded.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} tapered {{toward the front}} and a huge {{half-moon}} tail light jutted out from a short fairing behind the radically stepped seat. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a mix of standard, sport, and cruiser features.|$|R
50|$|The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that he {{sided with}} the locally-elected Cape government, in {{opposing}} the imperial moves to enforce confederation, and was widely reviled by separatist leaders like Jock Paterson as having betrayed his political allies.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, Volkswagen premiered its BlueMotion range {{with the}} {{emphasis}} of lower emissions and high fuel economy. Volkswagen's first car under the BlueMotion range is a modified 1.4 litre VW Polo TDI with longer gear ratios, aerodynamic changes and lightweight alloys with low rolling resistant tyres. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a car capable of producing less than 100g/km of CO2 with a stated fuel economy of 74.3 mpg (3.8 l/100km) on a combined cycle. Volkswagen {{plans to use the}} platform set by the Polo on expanding their BlueMotion ranges which include the Volkswagen Golf and the Volkswagen Passat.|$|E
25|$|Any {{inflammatory}} process, such as trauma, {{surgery or}} infection, can cause {{damage to the}} endothelial lining of the vessel's wall. The main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system. Inflammatory and other stimuli (such as hypercholesterolemia) can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state. When this occurs, endothelial cells downregulate substances such as thrombomodulin, which is a key modulator of thrombin activity. The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a sustained activation of thrombin and reduced production of protein C and tissue factor inhibitor, which furthers the pro-thrombotic state.|$|E
25|$|The {{histogenesis}} of c-SCLC {{and other}} multiphasic forms {{of lung cancer}} appear to be complex and varied phenomena. In most cases of c-SCLC, genomic and immunohistochemical {{studies suggest that the}} morphological divergence of the separate components occurs when a SCLC-like cell is transformed into a cell with the potential to develop NSCLC variant characteristics, and not vice versa. Daughter cells of this transdifferentiated SCLC-like cell then repeatedly divide and, under both intrinsic genomic and extrinsic environmental influences, acquire additional mutations (a process known as tumor progression). The <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> that the tumor acquires specific cytologic and architectural features suggesting a mixture of SCLC and NSCLC.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009 {{a digital}} look-alike {{of a younger}} Arnold Schwarzenegger was made for the movie Terminator Salvation though the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> critiqued to be unconvincing. Facial {{geometry}} was acquired from an 1984 mold of Schwarzenegger.|$|R
2500|$|A season 2 clip show {{broadcast}} in October 2009 {{focused on the}} music of Phineas and Ferb, featuring a viewer-voted top-10 of songs from the series; the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown." ...|$|R
50|$|On 19 March 1898, Scott captained the Scotland {{national}} football team against Wales at Fir Park, {{as part of}} the 1897-98 British Home Championship. Scott played full back and the <b>end</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a 5-2 victory for Scotland.|$|R
