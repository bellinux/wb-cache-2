ADHD is the most frequent neuropsychiatric presentation of FASD throughout the lifespan and it is particularly difficult to manage because the underlying pathophysiology is related to prenatal neurotoxic brain injury.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{determined}} {{the characteristics of}} fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> in a South African community, and methodology was designed for the multidisciplinary study of fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> in developing societies. METHODS: An active case ascertainment, 2 -tier methodology was used among 992 first-grade pupils.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to construct a profile on the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> that can assist individuals working with these children. The focus of the study is the recognition of the emotional needs of the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Most studies done previously suggest that children with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> show behaviour similar to children with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. Although a child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> shows the same characteristics as a child with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, the manifestation of their emotional needs differ. The Child with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder does not necessarily show symptoms of cognitive developmental delay where the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> show symptoms of cognitive developmental delays. A Gestalt play therapy model has been used to show that through play therapy the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be guided to emotional awareness. These techniques are easy to use and applicable in class situations where the childcare worker, teachers or counselor work with the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The empirical research was done by means of quantitative research with was done by using the Conner symptom checklist to determine if the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> is hyperactive and impulsive and qualitative research with was done by means of participating observation Gestalt play therapy with the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The results show that the child with Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> is hyperactive, impulsive and inattentional.

5000|$|Although {{there have}} been reports that some farm workers still do receive partial payment in wine, the [...] "tot" [...] system has been largely eradicated. However, the legacy {{continues}} as alcoholism is still rife. A 2000 study of <b>Foetal</b> <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (FAS) in a community in the Western Cape Province shows that the “historical presence of the wine industry in the Western Cape and the drinking patterns that have developed have produced a high FAS rate.” Today some areas of the Western Cape have the highest incidence of FAS in the world.

In 2007, the South African Wine Industry banned the 'papsak' (an Afrikaans word meaning 'soft sack' referring to cheap wine sold in a foil-lined plastic bag), and NGOs such as Dopstop are striving to address alcoholism and other substance abuse problems that plague the poor rural communities of South Africa.|$|E

The authors also compared birth certificate information for 22 definite or probable cases in children born between 1989 and 1992 to birth certificate information for all Colorado births for that period.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{prevalence}} {{and characteristics of}} fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> cases and the usefulness of various data sources in surveillance were examined in Alaska to guide prevention and future surveillance efforts. METHODS: Sixteen data sources in Alaska were used to identify children with fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Medical charts were reviewed to verify cases, and records were reviewed to provide descriptive data. RESULTS: Fetal <b>alcohol</b> <b>syndrome</b> rates varied markedly by birth year and race, with the highest prevalence (4. 1 per 1000 live births) found among Alaska Natives born between 1985 and 1988. Screening and referral programs to diagnostic clinics identified 70 % of all recorded cases. The intervention program for children 0 to 3 years of age detected 29 % of age-appropriate cases, and Medicaid data identified 11 % of all cases; birth certificates detected only 9 % of the age-appropriate cases.
