40|$|This thesis {{will first}} explore current {{literature}} surrounding Attention <b>Deficit</b> Hyperactivity <b>Disorder.</b> Attention <b>Deficit</b> Hyperactivity <b>Disorder</b> {{is a common}} childhood condition which can continue through both adolescence and adulthood, up to three pupils in one British primary school class can be affected by it. Symptoms of Attention <b>Deficit</b> Hyperactivity <b>Disorder</b> can include; a lack of attention span, hyperactivity and acting impulsively. Studies main findings were that {{there appeared to be}} inconsistency in the way that these symptomatic behaviours of Attention <b>Deficit</b> Hyperactivity <b>Disorder</b> are recognised, particularly amongst teachers and parents. This was often due to lack of clarity of what aspects of child behaviour qualifies as symptoms of Attention <b>Deficit</b> Hyperactivity <b>Disorder...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{processing}} {{problems in}} children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> have {{been the focus of}} many studies in recent years. It is obvious that different aspects of sensory problems such as with tactile sensory are involved in attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder.</b> However, whether the sensory information process problems can be factors in decision making regarding pharmacological management of children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> has not been researched. This case report presents two children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder.</b> The mother of the first patient reported that her child’s ability for detecting, identifying, and discriminating smells was very high and more than the other children at this age. As she reported, the child also liked to touch everything and everybody. He experienced nail biting after taking 20 mg methylphenidate in single dosage. By decreasing of the dosage, nail biting disappeared in the three trials. The other patient started lip biting about half an hour after taking the first dosage of the medication. It continued for four hours. This report suggests that there is an association between methylphenidate and tactile sensory problems {{in children with}} attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder.</b> It is possible that methylphenidate induces or exacerbates tactile hyposensitivity. If this assumption is supported in controlled clinical trials, then tactile sensory assessment might help to make decisions for the pharmacological management of children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder.</b> Further studies should investigate whether attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> with sensory processing problems is a phenotype with an overlap between autistic <b>disorders</b> and attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> in which stimulants may exacerbate some sensory processing problems. Also, if this is the case, the diagnosis of attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> as an exclusionary criterion for pervasive developmental disorder needs to be revised...|$|R

25|$|Disruptions of PPI are {{studied in}} humans {{and many other}} species. The most studied are deficits of PPI in schizophrenia, {{although}} this disease {{is not the only}} one to be associated with such deficits. They have been noted in panic disorder (Ludewig, et al., 2005), schizotypal personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder(Swerdlow et al., 1993), Huntington's disease, nocturnal enuresis and attention <b>deficit</b> <b>disorder</b> (Ornitz et al. 1992), and Tourette's syndrome (Swerdlow et al. 1994; Castellanos et al. 1996). According to one study, people who have temporal lobe epilepsy with psychosis also show decreases in PPI, unlike those who have TLE without psychosis. Therefore, PPI deficits are not typical to specific disease, but rather tell of disruptions in a specific brain circuit.|$|E

Data about children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> and their families was collected by using a General Information Form and the visual perception of children was examined through the Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis was used to determine whether there was a difference of between the visual perceptions of children with normal development and those diagnosed with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> and to discover whether the variables of gender, preschool education and parents` educational status affected the visual perceptions of children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder.</b> The results showed that there was a statistically meaningful difference between the visual perceptions of the two groups and that the visual perceptions of children with attention <b>deficit</b> hyperactivity <b>disorder</b> were affected meaningfully by gender, preschool education and parents` educational status...|$|R

This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention <b>deficit</b> <b>disorder.</b> His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family.
