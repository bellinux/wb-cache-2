5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> {{the number of times}} a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Its {{position}} was formed through constitutional convention, making {{its status as}} de facto capital {{a part of the}} UK's unwritten constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation. More recently, Greater London <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a region of England and in this context is known as London.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool {{used to measure the}} impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|General {{aviation}} in the United Kingdom <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a {{civil aircraft}} operation {{other than a}} commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military aviation. Although the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated aviation from its definition, some commercial operations are often included {{within the scope of}} general aviation (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) aviation and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E

25|$|Sensation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the {{conscious}} perception of touch-position and pain-temperature information.

25|$|The total mean {{curvature}} of a polyhedral surface <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the sum over {{the edges of}} the edge lengths multiplied by the exterior dihedral angles.

25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church has {{differentiated}} between latria and dulia. A latria is the veneration due God, and latria {{to anyone}} or anything other than God is doctrinally forbidden by the Orthodox Church; however dulia <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> veneration of religious images, statues or icons which is not only allowed but obligatory. This distinction was discussed by Thomas Acquinas in section 3.25 of Summa Theologiae.|$|E
25|$|Regeneration in hydra <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> morphallaxis, {{the process}} where {{regeneration}} results from remodeling of existing material without cellular proliferation. If a hydra is cut into two pieces, the remaining severed sections form two fully functional and independent hydra, {{approximately the same}} size as the two smaller severed sections. This occurs through the exchange and rearrangement of soft tissues without the formation of new material.|$|E
25|$|According to Snorri Sturluson's Sagas the Jamts {{sometimes}} paid {{taxes to}} Norwegian kings such as Håkon Adalsteinsfostre and Øystein Magnusson for protection. The Sagas also mentions that the Jamts at one occasion also paid taxes to a king in Svealand. The Sagas reliability {{on the matter}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> low. In the oldest written source for Norway, Historia Norwegiæ, it is however clearly stated that Norway borders in the north-east to Jämtland.|$|E

25|$|A {{dominant}} suburban {{element in}} the Frankston area means its residential property mix is not as diverse as areas that are closer to the Melbourne city centre—as the suburb has minimal multi-storey development. However, as the economic hub as well as gateway to the Mornington Peninsula, Frankston <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> one of the nine activity centres {{in the metropolitan area}} of Melbourne in various Victorian state government planning policies—which aim to increase multi-storey property development in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD).|$|E

Two main pillars are identified for the doctrine: preemptive strikes against potential enemies and promoting democratic regime change.|$|E

Abnormal free light chain production has also been reported to be prognostic of a worse outcome in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. An abnormal light-chain ratio <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> a kappa/lambda chain ratio of less than 0.26 or more than 1.65.|$|E

25|$|Hyposalivation is a {{clinical}} diagnosis {{that is made}} based on the history and examination, but reduced salivary flow rates have been given objective definitions. Salivary gland hypofunction <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> any objectively demonstrable reduction in whole and/or individual gland flow rates. An unstimulated whole saliva flow rate in a normal person is 0.3–0.4 ml per minute, and below 0.1 ml per minute is significantly abnormal. A stimulated saliva flow rate less than 0.5 ml per gland in 5minutes or less than 1 ml per gland in 10minutes is decreased. The term subjective xerostomia is sometimes {{used to describe the}} symptom {{in the absence of any}} detectable abnormality or cause. Xerostomia may also result from a change in composition of saliva (from serous to mucous). Salivary gland dysfunction is an umbrella term for the presence of either xerostomia or salivary gland hypofunction.|$|E
