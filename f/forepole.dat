40|$|AbstractDue to {{advances}} in numerical modelling, {{it is possible}} to capture complex support-ground interaction in two dimensions and three dimensions for mechanical analysis of complex tunnel support systems, although such analysis may still be too complex for routine design calculations. One such system is the <b>forepole</b> element, installed within the umbrella arch temporary support system for tunnels, which warrants such support measures. A review of engineering literature illustrates that a lack of design standards exists regarding the use of <b>forepole</b> elements. Therefore, when designing such support, designers must employ complex numerical models combined with engineering judgement. With reference to past developments by others and new investigations conducted by the authors on the Driskos tunnel in Greece and the Istanbul metro, this paper illustrates how advanced numerical modelling tools can facilitate understanding of the influences of design parameters {{associated with the use of}} <b>forepole</b> elements. In addition, this paper highlights the complexity of the ground-support interaction when simulated with two-dimensional (2 D) finite element software using a homogenous reinforced region, and three-dimensional (3 D) finite difference software using structural elements. This paper further illustrates sequential optimisation of two design parameters (spacing and overlap) using numerical modelling. With regard to capturing system behaviour in the region between forepoles for the purpose of dimensioning spacing, this paper employs three distinctive advanced numerical models: particle codes, continuous finite element models with joint set and Voronoi blocks. Finally, to capture the behaviour/failure ahead of the tunnel face (overlap parameter), 2 D axisymmetric models are employed. Finally, conclusions of 2 D and 3 D numerical assessment on the Driskos tunnel are drawn. The data enriched case study is examined to determine an optimum design, based on the proposed optimisation of design parameters, of <b>forepole</b> elements related to the site-specific considerations...|$|E
40|$|Adequate heading {{stability}} {{is crucial to}} the safe construction of any tunnel. Insufficient support will lead to ground movements which have the potential to cause damage to existing infrastructure. Congested urban environments have led to a requirement to minimise these tunnelling-induced deformations. Forepoling Umbrella Systems (FUS) have proved to be a beneficial soil reinforcement measure for controlling ground movements due to NATM tunnelling in urban areas. However, there is limited understanding of the influence of tunnel geometry and FUS parameters on its reinforcing efficiencies. A series of centrifuge tests has been conducted to investigate the benefits of FUS using different arrangements of steel pipes placed in a model tunnel heading at various depths. The results show the importance of the steel pipes near the tunnel spring-line and the embedded lengths on the reinforcing effects of forepoles. In addition, relative benefits of <b>forepole</b> location and embedded length are shown to vary as the soil cover above the tunnel changes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>forepoles</b> on {{stability}} of tunnel face and unsupported length during tunnel excavation in clay beds. <b>Forepoles</b> were modelled using 1 mm diameter brass rods. The tests were conducted using 65 mm diameter model tunnels with a flexible face at 100 g centrifuge environment. The unsupported length of the tunnel varied between 1 and 1. 5 times the tunnel diameter in different tests. The results {{seem to suggest that}} <b>forepoles</b> influence to reduce the length of settlement trough ahead of the tunnel face. However, width of the settlement trough remained unaffected. Excess negative pore pressures after collapse were noted to decrease with distance ahead of the tunnel face and increase with depth from the surface up to the tunnel axis. However, scatter in the measured data points suggest that the tunnel stability depends not only on the unsupported length of the tunnel but also on the length of <b>forepoles.</b> It is difficult to include these effects in the simple plasticity solution framework wherein the soil structure interaction is ignored...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{in detail the}} construction process followed for site set-up, portal formation, tunnel excavation and primary lining of two tunnels {{in the presence of}} heavily fragmented cataclastic material. Excavation techniques used to secure the crown of the tunnel and to avoid extensive collapses included, inter alia, grouted <b>forepoles</b> of various types and density, down the hole drilling, the use of self-drilling anchors and fibre-reinforced shotcrete. The optimum set of measures was selected according to block size, interlocking of blocks and cohesion of each unit at the tunnel crown and sides. Attention is paid to the observational method applied, the treatment of special cases with novel techniques such as horizontal cement piles and the treatment of localised ground collapses, and to the production rates achieved during construction. A procedure applicable when mixed conditions at the tunnel face are encountered during excavation in tunnelling projects is proposed...|$|R

In particular, the technique has proved invaluable when investigating collapse mechanisms in small scale models that can be related to full scale events. A series of eight plane strain centrifuge model tests investigating the effect of inserting inclusions around the annulus of a single tunnel in over consolidated clay has been conducted using the geotechnical centrifuge at City University London. The model used a compressed air supported circular cavity to simulate the tunnel. Stiff resin inclusions embedded around its periphery were used to represent closely spaced <b>forepoles</b> forming grout umbrella arches. Image processing was used to obtain patterns of displacements at the subsurface and displacement transducers measured vertical settlement at the ground surface level. The investigation focused on how different arrangements of forepoling affected tunnel stability. The influence of forepoling on normally accepted plastic collapse mechanisms is discussed. An optimisation of the forepoling layout is uggested in accordance with the findings...|$|R
