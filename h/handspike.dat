2500|$|On the Calder and Hebble Navigation, some paddle gear is {{operated}} by repeatedly inserting a Calder and Hebble <b>Handspike</b> (length of 4" [...] by 2" [...] hardwood) into a ground-level slotted wheel and pushing {{down on the}} <b>handspike</b> to rotate the wheel on its horizontal axis.|$|E
2500|$|When Paine finally {{attained}} the quarterdeck, {{he described}} {{a scene of}} confusion:The Captain was bawling to square the yards and stop the Ship's way; but with very little attention from the Ship's Company who impressed {{with the idea of}} Chinese pirates were alone intent in cutting and slashing away upon the vessel's rigging and sail and preventing the China-men from coming on board... (The Chinese) clambered up the Fore-chains, impelled no doubt with the fear of their vessel sinking after receiving so violent a shock; this with the extreme darkness of the night and the confusion of voices crying out, [...] "a light, a light, a cutlass, a cutlass, a <b>handspike,</b> here they come!" [...] with the addition of the unintelligible jargon of the affrighted Chinese.|$|E
60|$|Instead of obeying, {{the captain}} raised the heavy <b>handspike,</b> {{and the man}} pulled the trigger. At the same instant Gaff struck up the muzzle with his hand; the ball passed over the captain's head, and the <b>handspike</b> descended on the seaman's crown felling him at once.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the White Act of 1898 [...] "'bully mates'...had {{relied on}} their fists, {{belaying}} pins, and <b>handspikes</b> to enforce discipline." ...|$|R
60|$|There were a dozen {{reckless}} whites, in {{the cluster}} of savages collected at the gate; and enough of these were placed at <b>handspikes</b> to effect the intended dislodgement. The plan was this: while poles were set against the upper portion of the leaf, to force it within {{the line of the}} suspended part, <b>handspikes</b> and crowbars, of which a sufficiency had been provided by Joel's forethought, were to be applied between the hinge edge and the wall, to cast the whole over to the other side.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said Nares, who {{had watched}} the {{breaking}} out of his signal with the old-maidish particularity of an American sailor, [...] "out with those <b>handspikes,</b> and let's see what water {{there is in the}} lagoon." ...|$|R
60|$|He saw at once {{what they}} meant to do, and, {{springing}} back, seized a <b>handspike.</b>|$|E
60|$|With a wistful {{glance at}} the <b>handspike,</b> the girl walked to the cabin, {{followed}} slowly by the skipper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I yield," [...] {{said the}} skipper, drawing himself up, and {{delivering}} the <b>handspike</b> {{with the air}} of a defeated admiral tendering his sword.|$|E
60|$|Thundering {{with the}} butts of three clubbed <b>handspikes</b> on the {{forecastle}} deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps {{that they seemed}} to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands.|$|R
60|$|When Harry {{brought it}} up he slipped the chain along toward its middle, though it cost the boys an effort to prize the mass up with their <b>handspikes,</b> after which he made {{one end of the}} chain fast on the {{opposite}} side of the row, around which he led the oxen. The other end he hooked to their yoke, so that it now led doubled across the row and around the trunk they wished to raise. He said that when the chain was pulled the log would roll up it. He next shouted to the oxen, who plodded forward straining at the yoke, while he and Frank slipped their <b>handspikes</b> under opposite ends of the log.|$|R
60|$|The {{clattering}} of <b>handspikes</b> {{preceded the}} mariners song. Then the heavy labour, {{by which the}} ponderous iron was lifted from the bottom, was again resumed, and, {{in a few more}} minutes, the ship was once more released from her hold upon the land.|$|R
60|$|As {{the rusty}} chain came in, an ominous {{growling}} came from below, and Bill snatched his <b>handspike</b> out and raised it aloft. The skipper gazed meditatively at the shore, and the dog, {{as it came}} bounding up, gazed meditatively at the <b>handspike.</b> Then it yawned, an easy, unconcerned yawn, and commenced to pace the deck, and coming {{to the conclusion that}} the men were only engaged in necessary work, regarded their efforts with a lenient eye, and barked encouragingly as they hoisted the sail.|$|E
6000|$|But darting {{forward the}} instant I had the helm, the old cook thundered on the {{forecastle}} with a <b>handspike,</b> [...] "Breakers! breakers close aboard!--'bout ship! 'bout ship!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hist! {{what sort}} o' brute's that?" [...] he exclaimed, seizing a <b>handspike</b> that chanced {{to be near}} him and hurling it {{at the head of}} the brute.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} having a row with the crew," [...] he said. [...] "I thought it was coming to fighting. Two or three of them took up <b>handspikes,</b> but I drew my pistols and things calmed down. What {{do you want me}} for?" ...|$|R
60|$|While {{this was}} {{transacting}} upon the quarter-deck, a chance-medley fight {{was going on}} throughout the ship. The crew fought desperately with knives, <b>handspikes,</b> and whatever weapon they could seize upon {{in the moment of}} surprise. They were soon, however, overpowered by numbers, and mercilessly butchered.|$|R
6000|$|This {{information}} {{seemed to}} give a renewed energy to all the native cupidity of the captain, who called the men from their suppers, and ordered them to commence heaving anew. The word was passed to the crew that [...] "it was now for doubloons," [...] {{and they went to}} the bars and <b>handspikes,</b> notwithstanding the sun had set, cheerfully and cheering.|$|R
60|$|For a {{few seconds}} dead silence ensued, while the men glanced at the empty cod-end, and at each other. Then a terrible oath burst from John Gunter, and a sort of sigh broke {{from some of the}} others, as if words were {{incapable}} of expressing their feelings--as, indeed, they were! The skipper was standing by the companion-hatch at the moment with a <b>handspike</b> in his grasp. A deep-toned curse issued from his lips when the fish went down, and he dashed the <b>handspike</b> to the deck with fearful violence.|$|E
60|$|That decided her, and {{slipping}} {{into her own}} room, she put on an old blanket coat, and went out quietly. She walked through the orchard to the little log stable where the working oxen stood, and, after patting the patient beasts, shackled a heavy chain to the yoke she laid upon their brawny necks. Then, picking up a <b>handspike,</b> she led them out, and for an hour walked beside them, tapping them with a long pointed stick, while they dragged the big logs out of the swamp. Now and then it taxed all her strength to lift the thinner end of a log on the chain-sling with a <b>handspike,</b> but she contrived to do it until at length one heavier than the others proved too much for her. She could hear the ringing of the hired man's axe across the clearing, {{but there was a}} great deal for him to do, and, taking up the <b>handspike</b> again, she strained at it.|$|E
60|$|He walked aft and {{disappeared}} below, while Private Bliss, still fondling the <b>handspike,</b> listened unmoved to a lengthy vituperation which Bill called a plain and honest opinion of his behaviour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, hold on, won't ye?" [...] cried Stubb to the body, [...] "don't be {{in such a}} devil of a {{hurry to}} sink! By thunder, men, we must do {{something}} or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your <b>handspikes,</b> and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains." ...|$|R
6000|$|This was abundantly evident. Within {{the circle}} of red light, {{they could see the}} raft and the boats {{floating}} close to it; the men in cork-jackets toiling in the water and on floating spars, with ropes, <b>handspikes,</b> and axes. It was not until the [...] "Trident" [...] herself came within {{the circle of}} light, and hove-to, with flapping sails, that the people in the boats became aware of her presence.|$|R
60|$|It {{was evident}} that Nasmyth was already doing all that {{reasonably}} could have been expected of him, and in another moment or two, four more men, who {{ran out of the}} Bush, fell upon the log with <b>handspikes,</b> as the beasts came to a long upward slope. They went up it savagely, and Wisbech was conscious of a growing amazement as he watched the floundering oxen and gasping men.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Mivins," [...] cried Tom Green, the carpenter's mate, [...] "if {{you were}} asked to say: `Hold on hard to this <b>handspike</b> here, my hearties,' how would ye go about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve wrote {{everything}} {{down with the}} time it happened," [...] continued {{the other in a}} voice of savage satisfaction; [...] "an’ I’ve locked that <b>handspike</b> up in my locker. It’s got blood on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Even {{then we have}} dangers, From meddlesome strangers, Who spy on our {{business}} and are not content To take a smooth answer, Except with a <b>handspike</b> ... And {{they say they are}} murdered by poor honest men! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{forgot to}} say, that the lads always took capstan-bars, or gunners' <b>handspikes,</b> or crows with them, to rap the beasts over the noses {{if they got}} to be troublesome. No, no, I have no liking for bears and wolves, though a whale, in my eye, {{is very much the}} same sort of fish as a red herring after it is dried and salted. Mabel and I had better stick to the canoe." ...|$|R
60|$|Then the big pipe sank {{with a soft}} splash, {{and shook}} out its loose half-coil, as if alive, while it swelled. It grew hard and rigid, and the dim, oily water swirled and seethed {{about the end of}} it. In another moment there was a rush of {{floating}} objects towards it from the shadows. Strips of bagging, <b>handspikes,</b> clots of oil, and dunnage wood, came thicker and thicker, and Jefferson raised his voice.|$|R
60|$|Three or {{four minutes}} had slipped by {{before the rest}} {{scrambled}} upon the ledge with <b>handspikes,</b> and then it cost them a determined effort before they moved the redwood log an inch or two. Gordon, kneeling by Nasmyth's side, drew the crushed arm from under it. Nasmyth raised himself on one elbow, and lifted a red and pulpy hand that hung from the wrist. With an effort that set his face awry, he straightened it.|$|R
60|$|Raising the <b>handspike,</b> Mr. Blunt {{struck the}} chains several violent blows. The effect was {{to cause the}} whole of the Arabs--for it could be no others--suddenly to cease advancing, and to seat {{themselves}} astride the chains.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a {{patch of}} the head clear. Two or three of you get a <b>handspike</b> on to it," [...] he said. [...] "No, shove it lower down. Mas abajo. Now, heave all together. Vamos. Toda fuerza!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scarcely {{were the}} words {{out of my mouth}} when I heard a {{stealthy}} footstep approaching. I promptly put the big nugget down and sat on it, and uncommonly hard it was. As I did so I saw a lean dark face poked {{over the edge of the}} claim and a pair of beady eyes searching us out. I knew the face, it belonged to a man of very bad character known as <b>Handspike</b> Tom, who had, I understood, been so named at the Diamond Fields because he had murdered his mate with a <b>handspike.</b> He was now no doubt prowling about like a human hyæna to see what he could steal.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{that they}} could work in safety, the Monterey's men got their <b>handspikes</b> under the grappling-irons, and {{wrenched}} them from their holes, and leaning over the side they cut the ropes which held them to the pirate ship. The two vessels now swung apart, and Captain Horn was {{on the point of}} giving orders to start the engines and steam ahead, when the maid, Sophia, seized him by the arm. [...] "Mrs. Horn wants you," [...] she said, [...] "and Mok's in the water!" ...|$|R
60|$|A sword-fish having {{penetrated}} {{seven or}} eight feet {{into the bottom of}} a ship, under the impression that he was quarrelling with a whale, was unable to draw out of the fight. The sailors annoyed him a good deal, by pounding with <b>handspikes</b> upon that portion of his horn inside; but he bore it as bravely as he could, putting the best possible face upon the matter, until he saw a shark swimming by, of whom he inquired the probable destination of the ship.|$|R
60|$|Whatever {{firearms}} were {{possessed by}} {{the men on the}} Monterey were used with good effect, but in this respect they were vastly inferior to the enemy. When they had fired their pistols and their guns, some of them had no more ammunition, and others had no opportunity to reload. The men of the Vittorio had firearms in abundance and pockets full of cartridges. Consequently it was not long before Captain Horn's men were obliged to rely upon their hatchets, their <b>handspikes,</b> their belaying-pins, and their numbers.|$|R
