5|$|Baugh invited some 100 {{players to}} the Titans' first {{training}} camp, which {{opened at the}} University of New Hampshire on July 9, 1960. As NFL teams cut players from their training camps, many were invited to the Titans' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35-man rosters. The franchise's first preseason game took place on August 6, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Titans kicked off to begin the game, and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105yards for a touchdown. New York lost, 27–7. On September 11, 1960, the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour, the remains of Hurricane Diana. Water poured off Coogan's Bluff, situated above the Polo Grounds, swamping the field, which had poor drainage. The Titans' offense was less affected by the mud {{than that of the}} visiting Buffalo Bills. The Titans won the game 27–3 before a crowd of 9,607 (5,727paid attendance). The following week New York played another home game, against the Boston Patriots. On the first of many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead, the Titans were ahead 24–7 in the second half. With the lead reduced to 24–21, the Titans punted from deep in their own territory with seconds left. The punter, Rick Sapienza, fumbled the snap, and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory. The following week, with the Titans playing at the Denver Broncos, New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game. In their fourth game, New York had a two-point lead when it <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> fifteen seconds left against the Dallas Texans. This set off a scramble for the ball, which the Titans recovered as time ran out. Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later, the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6:30p.m. Many viewers called to complain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, McCown had a pass intercepted by Chad Greenway, but an offsides penalty on Robert Blanton nullified the play; the drive would {{end with the}} only score {{of the first quarter}} via Robbie Gould's 30-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Cordarrelle Patterson's 33-yard {{touchdown}} run gave the Vikings the lead; Gould would subsequently kick a 40-yard field goal. Before the half ended, Christian Ponder suffered from symptoms of a concussion and left. On the Bears' first drive of the second half, McCown threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. After the Vikings responded with Blair Walsh's 32-yard field goal, Jeffery caught a 46-yard touchdown pass over Viking cornerback Chris Cook to give Chicago the lead 20–10; Cook would eventually be ejected from the game for shoving side judge Laird Hayes. On Minnesota's first possession of the final quarter, Matt Cassel threw an eight-yard touchdown to Greg Jennings, and on Chicago's next drive, McCown's flip pass for Kyle Long was deflected and stripped by Audie Cole, with Marvin Mitchell recovering. Despite starting the drive in the Bears' red zone and reaching the six-yard line, Cassel's pass for Rhett Ellison was tipped and intercepted by Khaseem Greene. After the Bears punted, Cassel fumbled on the first play, but recovered. Afterwards, the Vikings drove from their own six-yard line to the Bears' 12, where Walsh tied the game with a 30-yard field goal, making the score 20–20. On the final play of regulation, Gould's attempted 66-yard field goal fell short. In overtime, the Bears' opening drive ended after McCown was sacked by Jared Allen and <b>fumbled,</b> <b>with</b> Jermon Bushrod recovering, prompting the Bears to punt. On the Vikings' first drive of the period, Walsh's 39-yard field goal was overruled by Ellison's facemasking penalty; Walsh would miss the eventual 57-yarder. The Bears would reach the Vikings' 29-yard line, and on second down, Gould missed the 47-yard kick wide right. The Vikings would reach Chicago's 16-yard line, allowing Walsh to kick the game-winning 34-yard field goal.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won the toss and deferred. The {{first four}} drives {{of the game}} ended without scores, as the Packers turned the ball over on downs during their first drive and the ensuing series were punts. On the next drive, Tracy Porter intercepted Rodgers, but was penalized for illegal contact, and the play was nullified. Afterwards, Rodgers threw a 25-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Lacy. The Bears' woes continued with the following kickoff, when Marc Mariani and Deonte Thompson collided while attempting to catch the kick and the latter had to kneel in the endzone for the touchback. The next four possessions led to punts; on Green Bay's next drive, Lacy recorded a 15-yard run, but was hit from behind by Chris Prosinski and <b>fumbled,</b> <b>with</b> the ball being recovered by Lamarr Houston. Chicago {{took advantage of the}} takeaway when Jay Cutler threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller. However, on the next kickoff, nickelback Bryce Callahan missed a tackle and allowed Jeff Janis to record a 64-yard return; the Packers eventually converted it into a 22-yard field goal. Assisted by a 37-yard kickoff return by Thompson, the Bears offense scored with Cutler's 20-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson, but the play was overturned after he was downed at the one. Afterwards, Jeremy Langford's one-yard run gave the Bears the 14–10 lead. Mason Crosby kicked a 50-yard field goal to end the half. The third quarter featured no scores, though the Bears' last drive of the quarter (which lasted into the final quarter) ended with Robbie Gould's 21-yard field goal to extend the lead by four points. After two further punts, Rodgers' slant pass for Davante Adams was intercepted by Porter. However, the Bears were unable to capitalize, and punted. With 2:23 left in the game, the Packers drove from their own 20-yard line to the Bears' eight. Rodgers' passes to James Jones, Richard Rodgers and Adams all fell incomplete, and Cutler kneeled once to seal the win.|$|E

5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and elected to kick off. The Rams scored {{on the opening}} {{possession}} with Gurley's six-yard touchdown run, but the Bears tied the score on a two-play drive; after Jeremy Langford was stopped for a one-yard loss, Jay Cutler threw a short pass to Zach Miller, who managed to break free and score on the 87-yard play. The next drive for the Rams saw the offense go three-and-out, but on the punt return, Marc Mariani was quickly hit by Bradley Marquez and <b>fumbled,</b> <b>with</b> the ball being recovered by St. Louis' Maurice Alexander. On the first play since the turnover, Austin scored on a 17-yard reverse, but the touchdown was nullified by Greg Robinson's holding penalty; the Rams eventually {{had to settle for}} Zuerlein's 26-yard field goal. After the Bears punted, they regained possession on the first play of the Rams' next drive, when Shea McClellin stripped Tre Mason and recovered the ball. Robbie Gould eventually kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the score {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Rams punted on their next drive, and the Bears took the lead with Cutler throwing a two-yard touchdown pass to Miller. St. Louis later punted again, and Chicago's next series started at their own 14-yard line due to cornerback Alan Ball's holding penalty on the punt return. After Langford's three-yard run, Cutler held off a blitzing defense to throw a screen pass to Langford, who scored on the 83-yard play. The two teams exchanged punts for the remainder of the half; the first three drives of the second half also ended in punts. Afterwards, the two teams traded field goals, Zuerlein's being 38 yards and Gould's being 33 yards. On St. Louis' next drive, the team elected to try a fake punt, but Hekker's pass to Cody Davis fell short. The Bears increased the lead to 17 points with Gould's 36-yard field goal, and after the Rams' turned the ball over on downs again, scored on Langford's six-yard touchdown run. The next two drives ended with turnovers for both teams: Willie Young intercepted Foles, but runningback Ka'Deem Carey fumbled after being hit by Rodney McLeod, with the fumble being recovered by Aaron Donald. With 2:23 left in the game, the Rams reached the Bears' 28-yard line before time expired.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{during the}} season opener he <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> four {{seconds left in the}} first half, which led to a Washington Redskins' {{touchdown}} as time expired that proved to be the difference in the game. Although the call was heavily criticized, after the incident he would not see much action during the team's second worst start in franchise history (one win in their first eight games), that eventually cost the job of head coach Wade Phillips. His special teams shortcomings were also being criticized during the losing streak. On December 5 against the Indianapolis Colts when the season was already lost, he rushed 19 times for 100 yards and a touchdown in a win.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} {{started with the}} Aggies' offense advancing. They went from their own 25-yard line to midfield using the run game. The Aggies punted to Vanderbilt's 25-yard line. Wakefield netted a long punt over the Aggies' safety man back to their own 20-yard line. A pass of 15 yards had the Aggies' driving until stopped at the 43-yard line. On the next {{possession}} for Vandy, Reese lost 15 yards {{in an attempt to}} go around the right end. Vanderbilt was getting the upper-hand in field position from the series of punts, but Kuhn <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> the Aggies recovering at their own 40-yard line. On the next possession for Vanderbilt there was again another lost fumble, this time by Tom Ryan at Mississippi's 45-yard line.|$|E

25|$|Michigan 17, Iowa 14. Michigan (ranked No. 17 in the AP Poll) {{defeated}} Iowa (ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll) by a 17–14 score {{before a}} crowd of 58,137 at Iowa Stadium in Iowa City. The loss {{was the only one}} of the year for Iowa. Iowa had not beaten Michigan since 1924. Michigan took a 3–0 lead in the first quarter on a field goal by Ron Kramer. Iowa then scored two touchdowns and led, 14–3, at halftime. One of the Iowa touchdowns was set up when Michigan quarterback was sacked and <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> Alex Karras recovering the ball for Iowa. Michigan's third-string halfback, Mike Shatusky, scored two touchdowns in the second half, a three-yard run in the third quarter and a two-yard plunge with one minute and six seconds remaining in the game.|$|E

500|$|Lang did not {{disguise}} his {{relief that}} the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you say such a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop. [...] "I only wish it was beginning over again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Washington {{then gave}} a short but impassioned speech, {{now known as}} the , {{counseling}} patience. [...] His message was that they should oppose anyone [...] "who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood." [...] He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. [...] He gazed upon it and <b>fumbled</b> <b>with</b> it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: [...] "Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country." [...] This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. [...] Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. [...] He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. [...] Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. [...] Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed [...] "unshaken confidence" [...] in Congress, and [...] "disdain" [...] and [...] "abhorrence" [...] for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. [...] The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.|$|E
