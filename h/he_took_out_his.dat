5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{match was}} between Edge and William Regal for Edge's WWF Intercontinental Championship. In the {{beginning}} of the match, Edge had the advantage, showing his speed and agility. However, Regal threw Edge out of the ring, and knocked him against the barricade. In the ring, Regal hit Edge with a series of European uppercuts and reversed a sunset flip into a knee drop. Edge fought back and got several near-falls before Regal knocked Edge with a forearm smash but Edge kicked Regal to the outside. On the ring apron, Edge tried to hit Regal, a diving spear on the floor but Regal sidestepped and Edge crashed the ring steel steps. As the referee was distracted, Regal took out a pair of brass knuckles from under the ring and stuffed them into his tights. [...] In the ring, Regal hit Edge with a powerbomb and two double underhook suplexes. Regal then hit Edge with a series of brutal kicks and, when the referee turned around, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> brass knuckles. Edge immediately speared Regal to win and retain his title.|$|E
2500|$|Gates {{approved}} the address in advance. Alexander Hamilton also urged {{the army to}} take action against Congress. A second address appeared on the 12th that tried to co-opt Washington into the conspiracy. Washington moved quickly to quell the impending mutiny by calling an officers' meeting on 15 March. He also notified Congress that it needed to act soon on the army's grievances. At the officers' meeting Washington appealed to his audience not to carry out, [...] "any measures which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained." [...] At the end of his speech he took out a letter to read. Unable to read it, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> spectacles and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you must pardon me. I have grown gray in your service and now find myself growing blind". Some of his officers were reduced to tears. In a unanimous vote, the officers expressed confidence in Congress and repudiated the Newburgh Addresses. On 22 March Congress voted to adopt the compensation plan which the officers then accepted.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24 <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{first patent}} which was a {{portable}} alarm to attach to clocks and watches. [...] The purpose of this was to wake his French tutor to begin his lessons early. [...] After working for a time as manager at Ardwick Bridge in a factory owned by the Tennant Company, he set up his own business in Leamington trading in medicinal salts. [...] In about 1830 he went into partnership with a Mr. Farndon making alkali at The British Alkali Works, Stoke Prior, Worcestershire. [...] During this time Gossage experimented with a method of absorbing the hydrochloric acid gas released {{as a result of}} the Leblanc process of manufacturing alkali. [...] He filled a derelict windmill with gorse and brushwood, introduced the gas at the bottom, and water at the top, and found that little or no fumes remained at the top. He developed this technique into the Gossage tower, using a deep bed of coke in a high tower to absorb the gas. The Gossage condensing towers were eventually used almost universally by the Leblanc factories.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the film's controversy, The Birth of a Nation {{was very}} popular. At over three hours in length (including intermissions), {{the film was}} {{ground-breaking}} in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before. The Los Angeles Times in a review called The Birth of a Nation [...] "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed", going on to say [...] "it was beyond doubt the most extraordinary picture that has ever been seen". The Reverend Charles Henry Parkhurst defended the film against the charge of racism by saying the film [...] "was exactly true to history" [...] by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore the film was a [...] "compliment to the black man" [...] by showing how far black people had [...] "advanced" [...] since Reconstruction. The critic Dolly Dalrymple reported about an audience in Alabama [...] "when I saw it, {{it was far from}} silent...incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, grasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen".. One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid to being raped that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her. The American author Katherine DuPre Lumpkin in her 1947 autobiography The Making of a Southerner recalled watching the film as a 18-year old in 1915: [...] "Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time. Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered. And through it all the Klan rode. All around me people sighed and shivered, and now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity." [...] Dixon himself was well pleased with the reaction of white audiences to the film. In a letter sent on May 1, 1915, to Joseph P. Tumulty, the press secretary to President Wilson, Dixon wrote: [...] "The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!". In letter to President Wilson sent on September 5, 1915, Dixon boasted: [...] "This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy". Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson upon becoming president in 1913 had imposed segregation on federal workplaces in Washington D.C. while reducing the number of black employees through demotion or dismissal.|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
