25|$|Parthenogenesis is seen {{to occur}} {{naturally}} in aphids, Daphnia, rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, {{as well as in}} many plants. Among vertebrates, strict parthenogenesis is only known to occur in lizards, snakes, birds and sharks, with fish, amphibians and reptiles exhibiting various forms of <b>gynogenesis</b> and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis). The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932. Since then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other, usually sexual, species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically and Komodo dragons; the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous parthenogenetic vertebrates.

25|$|Doubled haploids can be {{produced}} in vivo or in vitro. Haploid embryos are produced in vivo by parthenogenesis, pseudogamy, or chromosome elimination after wide crossing. The haploid embryo is rescued, cultured, and chromosome-doubling produces doubled haploids. The in vitro methods include <b>gynogenesis</b> (ovary and flower culture) and androgenesis (anther and microspore culture). Androgenesis is the preferred method. Another method of producing the haploids is wide crossing. In barley, haploids can {{be produced}} by wide crossing with the related species Hordeum bulbosum; fertilization is affected, but {{during the early stages}} of seed development the H. bulbosum chromosomes are eliminated leaving a haploid embryo. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), wide crossing with Nicotiana africana is widely used. When N. africana is used to pollinate N. tabacum, 0.25 to 1.42 percent of the progeny survive and can readily be identified as either F1 hybrids or maternal haploids. Although these percentages appear small, the vast yield of tiny seeds and the early death of most seedlings provide significant numbers of viable hybrids and haploids in relatively small soil containers. This method of interspecific pollination serves as a practical way of producing seed-derived haploids of N. tabacum, either as an alternative method or complementary method to anther culture.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gynogenesis</b> {{is a form}} of {{parthenogenesis}} {{where an}} egg begins to divide only after being pricked by a sperm cell, but without the genetic material of the sperm being used.

50|$|Some {{fish species}} use {{internal}} fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or {{give birth to}} live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the guppy and mollies or Poecilia. Fishes that give birth to live young can be ovoviviparous, where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in seahorses, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young. Fishes can also be viviparous, where the female supplies nourishment to the internally growing offspring. Some fish are hermaphrodites, where a single fish is {{both male and female}} and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species. One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; Poecilia formosa is a unisex species that uses a form of parthenogenesis called <b>gynogenesis,</b> where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring.

40|$|<b>Gynogenesis</b> is {{a process}} in which the embryo genome {{originates}} exclusively from female origin, following embryogenesis stimulation by a male gamete.

Both phenomena are of great interest in plant breeding as haploidisation is an efficient tool to reduce the length of breeding schemes to create varieties. Although few inducer lines have been described, the genetic control of these phenomena is poorly understood. We developed genetic screens to identify mutations that would induce <b>gynogenesis</b> or androgenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ability of mutant pollen to induce either <b>gynogenesis</b> or androgenesis was tested by crossing mutagenized plants as males. Seedlings from these crosses were screened with recessive phenotypic markers, one genetically controlled by the female genome and another by the male genome. Positive and negative controls confirmed the unambiguous detection of both <b>gynogenesis</b> and androgenesis events.

40|$|Highly {{profitable}} {{black caviar}} {{market and the}} depletion of wild sturgeon stocks warrant improvements in sturgeon aquaculture. Therefore, chromosomal manipulations, particularly <b>gynogenesis,</b> are focused on for increasing the ratio of females over males in progeny. The present study focused on optimizing chromosomal manipulations in sturgeons, particularly <b>gynogenesis.</b> The reasons of low survival rates were analyzed and the critical steps of <b>gynogenesis</b> induction processes were optimized. In addition, alternative ways of DNA inactivation in sperms were investigated, {{as well as the}} influence of native light-dependent DNA repair mechanisms on <b>gynogenesis</b> induction. Methods of interspecific <b>gynogenesis</b> usage for simplifying gynogenetic progeny separation were also proposed. Spectrophotometry analysis was used to investigate the ability of UV light, as the most common DNA inactivating agent, to penetrate into sperm. In addition, investigation of UV-irradiated sperm motility and results of partial <b>gynogenesis</b> induction showed that low transparency of sperms for UV-light can cause significant heterogeneity of UV-irradiation. As a result, a proper dilution of sperm was suggested as a critical step for homogeneous UV-irradiation of samples. <b>Gynogenesis</b> in sterlet was induced with chemical agents that damage sperm DNA, as an alternative to UV irradiation for applied in large-scale production of gynogenotes. All tested substances showed ability to inactivate DNA in spermatozoa, and thus producing gynogenotes. Negative impact of treatments with chemical agents on the sperm motility was observed. Subsequently, these treatments had a low efficiency of <b>gynogenesis</b> induction. The highest percentage of produced gynogenetic larvae 19. 8 ? 8. 9 % was obtained by treatment with aminomethyl- 4, 5 ?, 8 -trimethylpsoralen (AMT) at 50 ?M followed by UV-A (360 nm) irradiation at dose of 900 J/m 2. Therefore, this treatment {{could be used as a}} substitute for commonly used UV-C irradiation, e. g., in the case of large volumes of sperm. Detailed investigation of photoreactivation in sturgeon sperm revealed a significant level of light-dependent DNA restoration in sperms irradiated with high doses of UV-C light. Induction of <b>gynogenesis</b> with UV-C irradiation followed by exposure to visible light resulted in significant deviations from the typical Hertwig effect. In contrast, the red light with a wavelength of more than 600 nm did not result in decreased DNA damage, instead a moderate increase in damage was observed, i. e., it did not induce photoreactivation. Therefore, the use of infrared light to illuminate work stations during the induction of <b>gynogenesis</b> is suggested. The use of interspecific <b>gynogenesis,</b> particularly gametes of sturgeon species with different ploidy levels, was suggested as a way to simplify the separation of gynogenotes. In addition, application of this method allowed studying the effectiveness of DNA-inactivation and ploidy restoration treatments separately, as well as evaluation of fitness parameters and survival rates in each group of progeny without the physical separation of fish. Finally, the protocol for tetraploidization in sterlet was optimized for the prospective using tetraploid individuals for the induction of <b>gynogenesis</b> and androgenesis with diploid eggs and sperm. In conclusion, the described methods and protocols allowed <b>gynogenesis</b> induction in sturgeons with a survival rate sufficient for aquaculture, taking into consideration their high fertility, although further studies of the consequences of this treatment on fish is required...|$|E

In order to optimize a <b>gynogenesis</b> induction protocol for leek, we carried out experiments by culturing immature flower buds on various tissue culture media. Among the media tested, BDS and MS-based media with various combinations of plant growth regulators provided gynogenic embryos. Frequencies of gynogenic plantlet development were generally low and plantlets were obtained from almost all media included in the experiments. A total of 48 gynogenic plants were produced from approximately 30 thousand immature flower buds from six donor materials included in the experiments. In the DNA amount measurements performed with flow cytometry, it was found that gynogenic A. ampeloprasum plants were mostly diploid (55. 56 %) and the others were tetraploid (44. 44 %).

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine a simple and reliable ploidy identification protocol for the rainbow trout (RT), Oncorhynchus mykiss, in the field condition. To evaluate the ploidy level and compare different detection protocols, triploid RT and <b>gynogenesis</b> were induced by UV irradiation and/or heat shock. The hatching rate at day 30 was 85. 2 % and the survival rate at day 90 was 69. 4 % (fingerling). The sex ratio of female RT was 93. 75 % in the <b>gynogenesis</b> group, illustrating that the UV irradiation inactivated the sperm DNA. The hatching rate and survival rate were 82. 0 and 74. 7 %, respectively, in the triploid-induced group. The triploid induction rate by heat shock procedure was 73. 9 %. Cytogenetic protocols for ploidy identification such as chromosome counting, erythrocyte nuclear size comparison, and analysis of nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) by silver staining were compared. Silver nitrate staining showed the greatest success rate (22 / 23 and 32 / 32 for the triploid-induced group and <b>gynogenesis</b> group, respectively), followed by erythrocyte nuclear size comparison (16 / 23 and 19 / 32 for the triploid-induced group and <b>gynogenesis</b> group, respectively) and, lastly, chromosome preparation (2 / 23 and 6 / 32 for the triploid-induced group and <b>gynogenesis</b> group, respectively) with the lowest success rate. Based on our findings, silver staining for RT ploidy identification is speculated to be highly applicable in a wide range of research conditions, due to its cost-effectiveness and simplicity compared to other numerous ploidy detection protocols...|$|E

A typical Hertwig effect was elicited with a dose of 30, 000 erg mm 2. The resulting embryos exhibited the typical ‘‘haploid syndrome’’ and died shortly after hatching. Application of a cold shock (1 to 0 jC for 25 min starting at 6. 5 min after fertilization) to activated eggs with UV-irradiated (30, 000 erg mm 2) and diluted (1 : 10) sperms restored diploidy and resulted in the production of gynogenetic diploids (2 n = 44 chromosomes). These conditions were used in a pilot-scale experiment and found effective in inducing <b>gynogenesis</b> in f 47, 000 eggs. The rate of <b>gynogenesis</b> induction was 100 % as verified by an analysis with microsatellite DNA markers. Survival of the gynogenetics was approximately 10 % of diploids at 6 months of age, although growth was similar during this period. If this species turns out to have female homogamety, {{as is the case in}} most pleuronectiformes examined so far, the method presented here is the first necessary step for the production of all-female populations of this economically important species.
