5000|$|The {{invasion}} and {{settlement of the}} Weald by Saxons seems to have brought a complete end to the Romano-British iron industry.

The date of this site has been established by radiocarbon and archaeomagnetic methods. The technology used there was similar to a slightly earlier furnace excavated in the eastern Netherlands, indicating that knowledge of Romano-British methods had been completely lost and replaced by the Saxons' own method. Evidence of forging of <b>iron</b> <b>blooms</b> in settlements close to the South Downs does indicate that smelting may have been going on at other undiscovered sites.

The meaning is usually given as 'the family (or followers) of Mucca' (Mucca most likely being a local chieftain). However, Margaret Gelling has suggested alternative interpretations - 'Mucca's place' or 'Mucca's stream'. Mucking's geographical location on flat marshland at the very mouth of the River Thames indicates that settlement in the area by Germanic invaders from the continent probably occurred at a relatively early date; indeed, an outline of a now abandoned nearby Saxon village, West Mucking, was discovered from aerial photographs in the 20th century. Mucking was host to a small iron smelting industry because of its workable deposits of iron ore.

40|$|The CROZet natural <b>iron</b> <b>bloom</b> and EXport {{experiment}} (CROZEX) investigated phytoplankton {{blooms in}} the vicinity of the Crozet Plateau in the polar frontal zone (PFZ) of the Southern Ocean. Peak chlorophyll concentrations reached during an intense bloom within naturally iron (Fe) -fertilised regions north of the plateau were an order of magnitude higher than those observed in deeper mixed layers and low-Fe waters to the south. To establish the factors influencing phytoplankton dynamics, a suite of in situ phytoplankton physiological measurements and shipboard Fe–light perturbation experiments was performed. Addition of Fe in experiments performed during bloom decline north of the plateau resulted in increased accumulation of phytoplankton biomass and changes in a number of phytoplankton physiological characteristics. In particular photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiencies (Fv/Fm) measured by fast repetition rate fluorometry increased above in situ values within 24 h of Fe amendment, suggesting that Fe stress had contributed to bloom termination. In contrast, responses to Fe amendment were minor within an experiment initiated in low-silicic acid, post-bloom waters south of the Plateau. Within the intense bloom in the north, light limitation due to self-shading may have constrained the peak phytoplankton standing stock. However, in the absence of Fe amendment, incubation at higher than in situ irradiance levels had little influence on phytoplankton biomass accumulation for declining bloom populations. Instead reduced Fv/Fm, reflecting increased photoinhibitory damage to PSII, was observed in high-light incubations and was also apparent in situ. Interactions between Fe and light availability thus influenced phytoplankton physiology and growth and potentially contributed to bloom longevity during CROZEX. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{phytoplankton}} bloom occurs {{north of}} the Crozet Plateau annually from September to January. The area, bounded to the north by the Sub-Antarctic Front, is the most northerly of the areas of regular high productivity in the otherwise high-nutrient low-chlorophyll Southern Ocean. Chlorophyll concentrations are at background values {{to the south and}} only slightly enhanced over the shallow plateau, producing three contrasting productivity regimes. The CROZet natural <b>iron</b> <b>bloom</b> and EXport experiment (CROZEX) project was aimed at testing the hypothesis that the bloom is caused by natural iron fertilisation from the sediments and islands of the Crozet Plateau. In this paper, the temporal and spatial progression of the bloom and the contrasting productivity regimes are investigated using SeaWiFS and MODIS chlorophyll-a (chl-a), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) from SeaWiFS, QuikSCAT wind-stress data, Argo float profiles and data from three research cruises to the region. Comparison of satellite chl-a data against in situ measurements showed that the satellite data were lower by a factor of approximately 2. Iron, light and grazing are all important in explaining the different productivity regimes. To the north, light is dominant in controlling the timing and location of the bloom initiation, but the spatial distribution of the peak chl-a values obtained through the season is associated with the flow pattern and their proximity to the plateau and so are likely driven by nutrient availability. Mixed-layer depths in Argo float density profiles show a shallowing of the mixed-layer depth to the north of 10. 8 ± 1. 0 m degree− 1 across the study area. This gradient, together with a latitudinal gradient in PAR, is sufficient to explain the observed spatial progression of the bloom...|$|E

40|$|The annual {{phytoplankton}} bloom occurring {{north of}} the Crozet Plateau provides {{a rare opportunity to}} examine the hypothesis that natural iron fertilization can alleviate high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) conditions normally associated with the Southern Ocean. Therefore, during CROZet natural <b>iron</b> <b>bloom</b> and EXport experiment (CROZEX), a large multidisciplinary study performed between November 2004 and January 2005, measurements of total dissolved iron (DFe 0. 2 ?m) were made on seawater from around the islands and atmospheric iron deposition estimated from rain and aerosol samples. DFe concentrations were determined by flow injection analysis with N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (DPD) catalytic spectrophotometric detection. DFe concentrations varied between 0. 086 and 2. 48 nM, with low values in surface waters. Enrichment of dissolved iron (> 1 nM) at close proximity to the islands suggests that the plateau and the associated sediments are a source of iron. Waters farther north also appear to be affected by this input of coastal and shelf origin, although dissolved iron concentrations decrease as a function of distance to the {{north of the}} plateau with a gradient of 0. 07 nM km? 1 at the time of sampling. Using lateral and vertical diffusion coefficients derived from Ra isotope profiles and also estimates of atmospheric inputs, it was then possible to estimate a DFe concentration of 0. 55 nM {{to the north of the}} islands prior to the bloom event, which is sufficient to initiate the bloom, the lateral island source being the largest component. A similar situation is observed for other Sub-Antarctic Islands such as Kerguelen, South Georgia, that supply dissolved iron to their surrounding waters, thus enhancing chlorophyll concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The CROZet natural <b>iron</b> <b>bloom</b> and EXport {{experiment}} (CROZEX) {{investigated the}} annual phytoplankton bloom {{that occurs in}} the vicinity of the Crozet plateau in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) of the Southern Ocean. Shipboard manipulation experiments designed to investigate potential responses of phytoplankton community structure and elemental stoichiometry to iron (Fe) and/or light perturbation are compared to in situ data collected during CROZEX. The outcome of individual experiments was strongly influenced by initial phytoplankton community structure. For example Fe amendment of high (> 8 ?M) silicic acid waters resulted in a strong response by medium-sized diatoms, including Eucampia antarctica. In contrast Phaeocystis antarctica dominated the community response to increased Fe within an experiment initiated during the early declining stage of the bloom. Conversely, small diatoms responded more strongly to increased irradiance, while the population of very large diatoms remained relatively static. Consistent with experimental results, the intense natural blooms north of the Crozet plateau were observed to be dominated by either P. antarctica or medium-sized diatoms while small phytoplankton and large diatoms dominated lower-chlorophyll waters in the south. In situ data and results from experiments supported previous observations of lower nitrate to phosphate removal ratios for diatoms compared to P. antarctica. Experimental and in situ data also supported previous work showing that silicic acid to nitrate removal ratios can be reduced under conditions of enhanced Fe availability. Higher irradiance decreased this ratio still further. Interactions between Fe and light were thus likely to have contributed to the observed decoupling of the major element cycles between the intense bloom that occurs north of Crozet and more typical PFZ conditions to the South. Specifically, silicic acid became exhausted in both systems, with drawdown in the south potentially resulting from co-limitation of diatom growth by Fe and light. In contrast, increased Fe supply in the north enhanced nitrogen, phosphorous and carbon drawdown in ratios that were dependent on the community composition of the resultant bloom. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The CROZet natural <b>iron</b> <b>bloom</b> and EXport {{experiment}} (CROZEX) {{was carried}} out around the Crozet Plateau (Southern Ocean) in late austral spring-early summer 2004 / 2005. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that natural Fe fertilisation from the islands enhanced primary production to the north of the plateau, leading to elevated carbon export. During the 12 -week shipboard study (November–January), size-fractionated chlorophyll-a (chl-a), primary productivity and phytoplankton pigments were determined at 20 stations around the Crozet Plateau, both inside and outside the expected bloom region. Satellite-derived chl-a data from August 2004 to April 2005 revealed that the cruise period covered the declining stage of a large phytoplankton bloom north of the Crozet Plateau. Productivity derived from satellite chl-a data showed a strong north–south gradient, with productivity reaching a maximum of 1. 9 g C m− 2 d− 1 in the north (late October), 0. 6 over the plateau (late March) and 0. 4 in the south (early December). From November to early December, measured chl-a and productivity were still relatively high northwest of the plateau (54 – 74 mg chl-a m− 2 and 0. 5 – 1. 1 g C m− 2 d− 1), the assemblage being dominated by Phaeocystis sp. and microplankton representing 50 % of total chl-a. Declining biomass and productivity to the northwest in mid-December was associated with a picoplankton (52 %) dominated community (19 – 38 mg chl-a m− 2 and 0. 1 – 0. 4 g C m− 2 d− 1). In contrast, at the north eastern edge of the plateau, a mixed diatom/Phaeocystis dominated bloom (229 mg chl-a m− 2 and 3 g C m− 2 d− 1) developed in mid-January. South of the plateau in the control high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) region, biomass and productivity were always significantly lower, with only a small chl-a peak in December, and a community composed of microflagellates, cyanobacteria and some giant diatoms. Particulate organic carbon (POC) :chl-a ratios provided physiological evidence for the impact of Fe fertilisation north of the plateau. The assimilation rate (i. e. integrated productivity normalised to integrated chl-a, ∫P/∫chl-a) did not show significant differences between the north and south, probably due to the late sampling period relative to the bloom peak. Overall, measurements of primary productivity during CROZEX supported the hypothesis of enhanced biomass and production due to natural iron enrichment of the region north of the Crozet Plateau, while south of the plateau, low biomass and productivity resulted primarily from Fe limitation...|$|E

40|$|The role of iron in the {{emergence}} of Iron Age states in North Africa and the Near East has been poorly understood due to a paucity of contemporary, diachronic ferrous archaeometallurgical data.

Analysis of the materials employing metallography, portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (pXRF), and variable pressure scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy x-ray dispersive spectroscopy (VPSEM-EDS) indicates that Carthaginian smiths were smelting and smithing wrought iron and steel as an exchange good or tribute commodity to Tyre and the Assyrian empire, as well as producing, refining, and consuming tin and arsenical bronzes, leaded bronzes, lead, and cobalt. Archaeological evidence demonstrates a state industry of iron production, including the commissioning, decommissioning, and outsourcing of metallurgical precincts. There is an overwhelming difference exhibited between output capacity at industrial and household production sites. Epigraphic evidence in Punic illustrates the inherent economic and familial affiliations between the Carthaginian state and metalworkers. Ironsmiths, bronze casters, and goldsmiths were privileged engineers of one of the state's most strategic industries, and were stratified in a hierarchy of technical specialties and ranks. In order to conserve fuel and succeed in properly vitrifying ore or bloom impurities into slag, they recycled industrial byproducts in the form of murex shells from purple dye production as a metallurgical flux and lined the furnaces with quartz-rich heat insulation.
