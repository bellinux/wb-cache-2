25|$|After having {{achieved}} this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead {{embarked on a}} life of travel, and saw little of her children. “If I arrived at a place and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise”. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E

[...] "I definitely wanted a new challenge because when you've been competing for a decade the increments of improvements are quite small. However, in wheelchair basketball I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make big improvements. I've been chosen for the women's national league team, which is great, so I'm actually getting somewhere, which is a surprise. But my heart is definitely in swimming and I think it always will be." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{newspaper}} article, trees blocked the way after the flight was in progress. Whitehead was quoted as saying, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not clear them by rising higher, and also that I had no means of steering around them by using the machinery." [...] The article said Whitehead quickly thought of a solution to steer around the trees: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> The {{woman who}} had been robbed was my only friend, and she was away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{indifferent}} about it, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did right, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do right}} under the same circumstances again." ...|$|R

2500|$|Morath {{was briefly}} {{married to the}} British {{journalist}} Lionel Birch and relocated to London in 1951. That same year, she began to photograph {{during a visit to}} Venice. [...] "It was instantly clear to me that from now on I would be a photographer", she wrote. [...] "As I continued to photograph I became quite joyous. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> express the things I wanted to say by giving them form through my eyes." [...] Morath applied for an apprenticeship with Simon Guttman, who was then an editor for Picture Post and running the picture-agency Report. When Guttman asked what Morath wanted to photograph, and why, she answered that [...] "after the isolation of Nazism I felt I had found my language in photography." [...] After Morath had spent several months working as Guttman's secretary, she had an opportunity to take photographs. [...] She sold her first photographs - of opening nights, exhibitions, inaugurations, etc. - under the pseudonym [...] "Egni Tharom", her name spelled backwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally," [...] he agreed, pausing for {{an instant}} and looking up at her. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust you or I would never have put such an idea into your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not, as a rule, despondent; and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> as a {{last resort}} fall back on you. This {{explains}} my call. I believe you want an agent to manage your office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know I am rich. I {{have enough}} for my little pleasures--I do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish for more--still {{no one is}} ever quite content." ...|$|R
60|$|MR. A. I am only {{afraid you}} are {{giving up a}} great deal. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> accept it--except for the parish and these poor children.|$|R
6000|$|Cheyne smiled. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> desire {{a higher}} tribute paid to me. Might one {{compliment}} you both on your evident {{desire to be}} fair to your enemies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you must}} not ask it," [...] she {{declared}} quietly. [...] "It is better for you not to know. I came to you because you were a man, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish {{we could}} shoot too; {{it would be a}} great amusement, and I should enjoy my rides a good deal more if I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take a shot in case a lion or a deer came out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I live on who am so shamed?" [...] {{he asked}} passionately. [...] "My friends <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not live, {{and that is}} why they wrapped a sword in yonder cloak and sent it me. Also Miriam, you say, is dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray excuse me," [...] {{she said}} imploringly, {{looking at her}} mother for support, [...] "indeed, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sit out a dinner! A number of people {{together}} make me so dizzy and confused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one point}} that rather puzzles me," [...] she said, after she had made it plain how he was to find the Radcliffe family. [...] "How did you <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you {{anything}} about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Roger," [...] he said, [...] "this will be {{the most}} {{dangerous}} business in which we have been concerned; and I should not venture to undertake it, did <b>I</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> rely, absolutely, upon you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I still hoped I {{might be}} able to help Sad-Eyes, Baas. Also I wanted to see what happened, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not bring you here in time to be any good. Yet it is true I thought of coming though I did not know the road." ...|$|E
6000|$|It's {{easy enough}} to command one's face. I learnt {{to do that in}} Africa when often my life {{depended}} on my seeming to have no fear. But in my heart ... I never <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel so bitter. And yet, after all, it's only your good opinion that I care for.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you're very good, Mr. Godolphin," [...] said Maxwell. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fully rely on {{your kind}} offer. Won't you come in?" [...] He offered the actor his hand, {{and they moved}} {{together}} towards the cottage; Louise had at once gone before, but not {{so far as to}} be out of hearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{let there}} be no ill feeling over this. It is an experiment, and a useful one; and had I, myself, been in your place, <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done aught more than you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} laugh, in which Richards joined. [...] "I could carry them about on my back, {{and pretend to}} be a horse," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> amuse them in any other way." ...|$|R
60|$|As for Marlin, <b>I</b> {{have always}} <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{take some of}} these roundbill {{swordfish}} on light tackle. But likewise {{there have been some}} that could not have been taken so, and these are the swordfish I have fished for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he cried, {{interpreting}} her {{glance to}} suit his ends, [...] "perish the thought, indeed! I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not be wrong. I knew that one so peerless in all else must be peerless, too, in her opinions; judging for herself, and standing firm upon her judgment in disdain of meaner souls--mere sheep {{to follow their}} bell-wether." ...|$|E
60|$|In this way, then, did I {{enter the}} metropolis; a strolling vagabond; {{on the top}} of a caravan with a crew of vagabonds about me; but I was as happy as a prince, for, like Prince Hal, I felt myself {{superior}} to my situation, and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> at any time cast it off and emerge into my proper sphere.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” {{she said}} with a curious little sparkle in her eyes, “there was another night I met you when I wasn’t got up like this, and you were dressed in rags. Still, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trust you. Do you believe that I should have been here, with {{everything}} that a woman could wish for, now, if I had not had that confidence?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something, perhaps," [...] replied Barker, [...] "but that {{something}} a mere barbarian dexterity. <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> chip flints {{as well as}} a primeval man, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> civilisation can make these knives which are better, and I trust to civilisation." ...|$|R
6000|$|John Morton, {{who was a}} man of business, went to work at {{once with}} his pencil and in two minutes had made out a total. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> put my hand on £14,000 even if I were minded to make the purchase." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, Percy,--I {{know and}} feel that; but <b>I</b> also feel <b>that</b> my {{decision}} is right, and not wrong. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not decide otherwise, and that whatever unhappiness it may cause us both, yet that, without your mother's consent, I {{can never be}} yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my {{old age and}} on my beam-ends," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Wiggett, [...] "I remembered them {{words of}} old Sol, and I knew if I could only find ’im my troubles were over. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> creep into ’is little harbour and lay snug. I knew that what Sol said he meant. I lost my leg saving ’is life, and he is grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, Jack, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{rely upon}} you; and now {{come in to}} tea, {{and there was one}} thing I wanted to say, I want you once a month to come over to me at Birmingham on Saturday {{afternoon}} and stay till Sunday evening. It will be a great pleasure to me; I shall see how you are getting on, and shall hear all the news of Stokebridge." ...|$|E
60|$|Running rapidly down {{first one}} and then another of them I soon became hopelessly lost and was {{standing}} panting against a side wall when I heard voices near me. Apparently they were coming from {{the opposite side of}} the partition against which I leaned and presently I made out the tones of Dejah Thoris. I could not hear the words but I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not possibly be mistaken in the voice.|$|E
2500|$|... "I don't suppose I shall ever be happy. Perhaps no {{one ever}} is. But the thing {{that would make me}} happiest just now would be to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get roaring drunk and wander about the loop for two days without anyone paying any {{attention}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{very well}} explain, sir,' was the answer. 'It 'ud come better from Mr. Pyecroft. He's on leaf at Portsmouth--staying with his uncle. His uncle 'ad the body all night. I'd defy {{you to find}} a scratch on her even with a microscope.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think,' {{said the}} gentleman in a subdued tone, 'I had best carry her {{straight}} to her room. Will you call to some one {{to bring a}} light?' addressing his companion, 'and to show the way? In this strange rambling place <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find it.' ...|$|R
