Given their growing importance for trade negotiators, {{the availability of}} statistics on the international supply of <b>services</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>by</b> <b>services</b> category, mode of supply and partner country is critically important for services trade policy making.

40|$|Abstract—Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) {{is a new}} {{transport}} protocol incorporated into FreeBSD 7. 0. It was first standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in October of 2000 in RFC 2960 and later updated by RFC 4960. SCTP is a message oriented protocol providing reliable end to end communication between two peers in an IP network. So, why would one want to use SCTP instead of just using TCP or UDP? This paper will try {{to answer that question}} <b>by</b> <b>detailing</b> <b>services</b> provided <b>by</b> SCTP, and illustrating how SCTP can be easily used with the socket API. I...|$|R
40|$|For a {{laboratory}} model of an interactive CATV system services are presented and classified. The problem of predicting usage parameter for non-existing {{services in a}} non-existing network is discussed. An approach to gain a first preliminary set of data describing the distribution of demands and requirements of the various services is presented. It starts from the contents offered {{by means of a}} service and from the way these contents are offered at present and tries to estimate {{the extent to which they}} might be taken over into a CATV system.

40|$|Working with a panel dataset of OECD {{countries}} {{over the}} decade 1994 - 2004, we examine linkages between cross-border trade and FDI {{in the services}} sectors. We first develop a consistent analytical framework {{for the application of}} the gravity model to both services trade and commercial presence (i. e. FDI), using a composite model of delivery that offers testable hypotheses about the roles of different modes of services supply as complements or substitutes. We further link our estimates to policy variables measuring market regulations that may act directly or implicitly as barriers to trade. We find robust evidence of complementary effects in the short run, which is reinforced in the long run by an increased potential for cross-border imports based on previous FDI inflows. A <b>detailed</b> analysis <b>by</b> individual <b>services</b> sectors highlights business, communication and financial services as showing the largest potential for cross-border trade when market regulations are reduced and when commercial presence increases.

40|$|Since the {{founding}} of the United States Army on the fourteenth day of June in the year 1775, the United States Military has had millions of noncombat-related casualties due to preventable illnesses and diseases transmitted through an arthropod vector. U. S. Military operations have been affected from the effects of the smallpox and malaria outbreaks as early as the Continental Army around 1775, as well as the Civil War period in the mid- 1860 s. In 1898, the U. S. Military was devastated with outbreaks of typhoid fever, yellow fever, and dengue fever during the months of the Spanish-American War (Artenstein et al., 2005). Infectious diseases became common in the U. S. Military, especially during overseas campaigns in tropical areas such as in the Philippines, South America, Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, and others.... Outbreaks of tick-borne diseases remain common in the temperate and tropical regions of the world and within the United States, and the U. S. Military continues to come into contact with these diseases during overseas deployments and domestic field exercises. The U. S. Military and all the collaborating agencies continue to research and develop ways to prevent further infection from these diseases at the laboratories and other U. S. Military facilities located around the world; these agencies and organizations continue to take measures in the operation for prevention and control, and the production of possible vaccines and prophylactic drugs. The CHPPM continues to track the tick-borne diseases within the United States and neighboring countries; the surveillance system helps with monitoring, prevention, control, and research efforts for the Rickettsial diseases. The Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) and United States Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC) continue to provide annual surveillance on vector-borne diseases, with <b>detailed</b> reports <b>by</b> <b>Service</b> Branch to include active component, National Guard, Reserve units, and other beneficiaries such as DoD civilians and contractors...|$|R

40|$|The type of {{relationship}} between different modes of trading services across international borders {{is of great}} interest, {{not only for the}} academic literature but also for the formulation trade liberalization offers under the GATS. Even more than for trade in goods, it is thus important to know whether cross-border trade and trade through commercial presence abroad act as complements or substitutes in services. The most commonly used analytical tool in the empirical analysis of this question is the gravity model of trade. This paper offers a consistent theoretical foundation for the application of the gravity model to services and to commercial presence, using a composite demand model with offers testable hypothesis about the complementary or substitutive relationship between different modes of supply. It further links the results to policy variables like market regulations which may act directly or implicitly as barriers to trade. Our empirical test for the sample of OECD countries over the decade 1994 - 2004 yields robust complementary effects in the short-run, which is reinforced in the long-run by an increased potential for cross-border imports based on previous FDI inflows.
