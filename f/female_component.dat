5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the <b>female</b> <b>component</b> of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E

Thirty populations of hybrids between Drosophila serrata and Drosophila birchii were established and maintained for 24 generations. At the fifth generation after hybridization, the mating success of hybrid individuals with the D. serrata parent was determined. The genetic correlation between male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> of the male recognition system, as a consequence of pleiotropy or tight physical linkage, was found to be significant but low (r = 0. 388). This result suggested that pleiotropy may play only a minor role in the evolution of mate recognition in this system. At the twenty-fourth generation after hybridization, the mating success of the hybrids was again determined. The evolution of male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> was investigated by analyzing the direction of evolution of each hybrid line with respect to its initial position in relation to the genetic regression.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a positive genetic correlation between male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> of mate recognition systems will result {{as a consequence of}} assortative mating and, in particular, is central to a number of theories of sexual selection. Although the existence of such genetic correlations has been investigated in a number of taxa, it has yet to be shown that such correlations evolve and whether they may evolve as rapidly as suggested by sexual selection models. In this study, I used a hybridization experiment to disrupt natural mate recognition systems and then observed the subsequent evolutionary dynamics of the genetic correlation between male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> for 56 generations in hybrids between Drosophila serrata and Drosophila birchii. The genetic correlation between male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> evolved from 0. 388 at generation 5 to 1. 017 at generation 37 and then declined to - 0. 040 after a further 19 generations. These results indicated that the genetic basis of the mate recognition system in the hybrid populations evolved rapidly. The initial rapid increase in the genetic correlation was consistent with the classic assumption that male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> will coevolve under sexual selection. The subsequent decline in genetic correlation may be attributable to the fixation of major genes or, alternatively, may be a result of a cyclic evolutionary change in mate recognition...|$|R

2500|$|They {{managed to}} be the only {{significant}} European population to populate the country during colonization, even though there were French and Dutch invasions. The Portuguese migration was strongly marked by the predominance of men (colonial reports from the 16th and 17th centuries almost always report the absence or rarity of Portuguese women). This lack of women worried the Jesuits, who asked the Portuguese King to send any kind of Portuguese women to Brazil, even the socially undesirable (e.g. prostitutes or women with mental maladies such as Down Syndrome) if necessary. The Crown responded by sending groups of Iberian orphan maidens to marry both cohorts of marriageable men, the nobles and the peasants. Some of which were even primarily studying to be nuns. The Crown also shipped over many Órfãs d'El-Rei of what was considered [...] "good birth" [...] to colonial Brazil to marry Portuguese settlers of high rank. Órfãs d'El-Rei (modern Portuguese órfãs do rei) literally translates to [...] "Orphans of the King", and they were Portuguese female orphans in nubile age. There were noble and non-noble maidens and they were daughters of military compatriots who died in battle for the king or noblemen who died overseas and whose upbringing was paid by the Crown. Bahia's port in the East received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551. The multiplication of descendants of Portuguese settlers also happened to a large degree through miscegenation with black and amerindian women. In fact, in colonial Brazil the Portuguese men competed for the women, because among the African slaves the <b>female</b> <b>component</b> was also a small minority. This explains why the Portuguese men left more descendants in Brazil than the Amerindian or African men did. The Indian and African women were [...] "dominated" [...] by the Portuguese men, preventing men of color to find partners with whom they could have children. Added to this, White people had a much better quality of life and therefore a lower mortality rate than the black and indigenous population. Then, even though the Portuguese migration during colonial Brazil was smaller (3.2 million Indians estimated at the beginning of colonization and 3.6 million Africans brought since then, compared to the descendants of the over 700,000 Portuguese immigrants) the [...] "white" [...] population (whose ancestry was predominantly Portuguese) was as large as the [...] "non white" [...] population in the early 19th century, just before independence from Portugal.|$|E

This paper evaluates experimentally whether direct and indirect eﬀects of herbivory on male and female ﬂower size and pollination success of the monoecious tropical shrub Cnidoscolus aconitifolius (Euphorbiaceae) remain consistent at three distant regions in Yucatan (southeastern Mexico). Plants were subjected to diﬀerent levels of leaf defoliation, and treatment eﬀects on ﬂoral traits (corolla area, corolla tube length, pollen production), and male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> of pollina- tion success (percent pollen removal, number of pollen tubes) were subsequently measured to evaluate the indirect eﬀect of herbivory on plant reproductive success via pollination. Defoliation had signiﬁcant direct eﬀects on ﬂoral traits, but its indirect eﬀects diﬀered between the male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> of pollination success. Moreover, the relationships between defoliation, ﬂoral traits and male and female pollination success varied spatially (i. e. between regions), although they were frequently more spatially-consistent for male success than for female success.

40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{transition from}} outcrossing to self-fertilization (selfing) through {{the loss of}} self-incompatibility (SI) {{is one of the}} most prevalent events in flowering plants, and its genetic basis has been a major focus in evolutionary biology. In the Brassicaceae, the SI system consists of male and female specificity genes at the S-locus and of genes involved in the female downstream signaling pathway. During recent decades, much attention has been paid in particular to clarifying the genes responsible for the loss of SI. Here, we investigated the pattern of polymorphism and functionality of the female specificity gene, the S-locus receptor kinase (SRK), in allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica. While its parental species, A. lyrata and A. halleri, are reported to be diploid and mainly self-incompatible, A. kamchatica is self-compatible. We identified five highly diverged SRK haplogroups, found their disomic inheritance and, for the first time in a wild allotetraploid species, surveyed the geographic distribution of SRK at the two homeologous S-loci across the species range. We found intact full-length SRK sequences in many accessions. Through interspecific crosses with the self-incompatible and diploid congener A. halleri, we found that the <b>female</b> <b>components</b> of the SI system, including SRK and the female downstream signaling pathway, are still functional in these accessions. Given the tight linkage and very rare recombination of the male and <b>female</b> <b>components</b> on the S-locus, this result suggests that the degradation of male components was responsible for the loss of SI in A. kamchatica.
