5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and food insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral {{of the interaction between}} population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous food insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, {{where the}} mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, {{which means that}} all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close {{enough for them to}} eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E

5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> ideasthesia. Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E

25|$|A platonic {{interpretation}} for {{the relationship}} between David and Jonathan has been the mainstream view found in biblical exegesis, as led by Christian writers.

Leaves can be reused three or four times before they become unresponsive to stimulation, depending on the growing conditions.|$|E

Dreyer, who notes that the Taizong Shilu does not distinguish the order of 250 ships from the treasure ships. As such the first fleet would have been around 250 ships including the treasure ships.|$|E
25|$|Galef popularized {{the concept}} of Straw Vulcan, the {{incorrect}} perception about rationality {{as a way of}} thinking that denies emotions such as love and lacks appreciations for beauty. It refers to the fictional character Mr. Spock (a half-Vulcan) in Star Trek, who is often seen as a poster child for this caricature of rationality. On the contrary, Galef argues that Mr. Spock's failure to adjust his thinking, even though he experiences that humans do not always make rational decisions, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> irrationality. In 2011, Galef gave a talk on this subject at Skepticon.|$|E

25|$|The {{expiration}} date of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency {{and safety of}} a drug.

A rare exception <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired tetracycline. A {{study conducted by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> {{cruelty to}} animals in the South Korean film The Isle (2000), {{according}} to its director Kim Ki-Duk. In the film, a real frog is skinned alive while fish are mutilated. Seven animals were killed for the camera in the controversial Italian film Cannibal Holocaust (1980). The images in the film include the slow and graphic beheading and ripping apart of a turtle, a monkey being beheaded and its brains being consumed by natives and a spider being chopped apart. Cannibal Holocaust was only one film in a collective of similarly themed movies (cannibal films) that featured unstaged animal cruelty. Their influences were rooted in the films of Mondo filmmakers, which sometimes contained similar content. In several countries, such as the UK, Cannibal Holocaust was only allowed for release {{with most of the}} animal cruelty edited out.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that romantic {{involvement}} in adolescence decreases aggression in males and females, but decreases {{at a higher rate}} in females. Females will seem more desirable to their mate if they fit in with society and females that are aggressive do not usually fit well in society, they can often be viewed as antisocial. Female aggression is not considered the norm in society and going against the norm can sometimes prevent one from getting a mate. However, studies have shown that an increasing number of women are getting arrested for domestic violence charges. In many states, women now account for a quarter to a third of all domestic violence arrests, up from less than 10 percent a decade ago. The new statistics reflect a reality documented in research: women are perpetrators as well as victims of family violence. However, another equally possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> improved diagnostics: it has become more acceptable for men to report female domestic violence to the authorities {{while at the same time}} actual female domestic violence has not increased at all. This can be the case when men have become less ashamed of reporting female violence against them, therefore an increasing number of women are arrested, although the actual number of violent women remains the same.|$|E
