50|$|Digital {{and film}} cameras share an optical system, {{typically}} using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device. The diaphragm and shutter admit {{the correct amount}} of light to the imager, just as with film but the <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Most digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.|$|R

5000|$|The {{electric}} cello {{is a type}} of cello {{that relies}} on electronic amplification (rather than acoustic resonance) to produce sound. An acoustic cello can be fitted with a bridge or body mounted contact pickup providing an electric signal, or a built-in pickup can be installed. A few pickups work by other principles like magnetic coil guitar type needing steel strings to work, or by an unusual pickup system [...] employing the string itself as a linear <b>pickup</b> <b>element,</b> thus avoiding any modification of tone-producing parts on an acoustic cello.|$|R

Results from the analysis of <b>pickup</b> <b>elements</b> are presented in a graphical form allowing comparison with a conventional (‘original’) pickup. The pickups were examined in unipolar and bipolar ICPT systems. Unlike the existing pickup, the proposed configurations utilize two components of the magnetic flux density, and are characterized by high-power transfer ability as well as much better response to the misalignment problem. Some recommendations and possible means for further improvements for higher power efficiency are also put forward...|$|R

A color multiplexed light signal is produced using an arrangement of dichroic filter stripes. In the particular system described, a two layer filter is used to color modulate external light which is then detected by an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> tube. The resulting time division multiplexed electronic signal from the pickup tube is converted by a decoder into a green color signal, and a single red-blue multiplexed signal, which is demultiplexed to produce red and blue color signals.

40|$|Stripline BPM sensors contain {{inherent}} non-linearities, as {{a result}} of field distortions from the <b>pickup</b> <b>elements.</b> Many methods have been devised to facilitate corrections, often employing polynomial fitting. The cost of computation makes real-time correction difficult, particulalry when integer math is utilized. The application of neural-network technology, particularly the multi-layer perceptron algorithm, is proposed as an efficient alternative for electrode linearization. A process of supervised learning is initially used to determine the weighting coefficients, which are subsequently applied to the incoming electrode data. A non-linear layer, known as an activation layer, is responsible for the removal of saturation effects. Implementation of a perceptron in an FPGA-based software-defined radio (SDR) is presented, along with performance comparisons. In addition, efficient calculation of the sigmoidal activation function via the CORDIC algorithm is presented...|$|R

40|$|A new torque {{transducer}} {{with high}} overload capability and direct frequency output is reported. It employs the recently developed metallic triple-beam resonators with thick-film printed {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) drive and <b>pickup</b> <b>elements.</b> The new torque transducer has been tested in a torque range of up to 20 Nm, resulting in a strain level of 400 microstrain on the measurement shaft surface and giving a large frequency-change output of 800 Hz. The strain level required by the new torque transducer can be much lower (~ 100 microstrain) than the level (~ 1800 microstrain) usually required by conventional metallic resistance-strain-gauge-based torque transducers, thus increasing the transducer overload capability by a large factor. Nevertheless, under such a low strain level, the new torque transducer can still output an adequately large frequency change of 200 Hz for measurement.

50|$|The Apollo TV Camera {{refers to}} several {{television}} cameras {{used in the}} Apollo program's space missions, and on the later Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project missions, in the late 1960s and 1970s. These cameras varied in design, with image quality improving significantly with each successive model. Two companies made these various camera systems: RCA and Westinghouse. Originally, these slow-scan television (SSTV) cameras, running at 10 frames-per-second (fps), produced only black-and-white pictures and first flew on the Apollo 7 mission in October 1968. A color camera — using a field-sequential color system — flew on the Apollo 10 mission in May 1969, and every mission after that. The Color Camera ran at the North American standard 30 fps. The cameras all used <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> tubes that were initially fragile, as one was irreparably damaged during the live broadcast of the Apollo 12 mission's first moonwalk. Starting with the Apollo 15 mission, a more robust, damage-resistant camera was used on the lunar surface. All of these cameras required signal processing back on Earth to make the frame rate and color encoding compatible with analog broadcast television standards.|$|R

The FDL-60 was designed and made in Darmstadt West Germany, {{this was the first}} all solid state Telecine. [...] FDL is short for Film Digital Line. The FDL-60 uses a three CCD single-line array system, whereby three lines, Red Green Blue (RGB) each with 1,024 pixels per line to record a single line of the film image. FDL60A uses three Fairchild Semiconductor CCD 133 CCDs for the <b>image</b> <b>pickup.</b> FDL60A released in 1979 used a 115 Volt lamp to light the film. The FDL60B released in 1982 added improve video quality features to the FDL60. The FDL60C released in 1987 used a Fairchild CCD 134 and a 24 volt light source. In 1983 an optional Grain Reduce was introduced by Bosch for the FDL-60, model FDGR 60. This was the first all digital noise reducer. The FDL 60 could operate stand alone or with a color grade system. Bosch made a scene by scene color corrector, model FRP 60, as an option for the FDL-60. About 568 FDL-60 telecines were manufacture from 1979 to 1989. FDL 60 were ordered in PAL or NTSC or Secam, a few were multi standard by changing a few electronic circuit cards.|$|R

40|$|Control of {{impurity}} {{elements in}} Al-based alloys is of increasing technological importance, both in {{primary and secondary}} alloy production. In primary alloy production, Ni and V concentrations in the coke are rising and this is increasing the level of impurities in the final products {{to the extent that}} they are out of specification. Impurity control is also of concern in recycling due to the <b>pickup</b> of <b>elements</b> such as Fe from contaminants in the scrap, which can detrimentally affect the alloy properties. Dissolved elemental impurities can be removed by a number of different processes including boron treatment for some of the transition metals. Other processes in the cast shop for removing impurities and inclusions from Al melts include fluxing, floatation, and filtration. Gas purging, vacuum treatment, filtration, the use of salts, and combinations of these presently find commercial applications. Ultra purity Al and its alloys can be obtained using zone refining and three-layer electrolysis methods. The demand for higher purity Al has been largely met by additional electrolytic refining processes. This paper reviews the tools that are currently available to the casthouse for removing impurities and inclusions from Al melts and suggests approaches that may be useful to meet future challenges...|$|R

40|$|Selective Laser Melting of Ti 6 Al 4 V {{has already}} transitioned to {{commercial}} exploitation, {{but is still}} coping with two major limitations that restrict a more widespread use. Residual stresses can cause a premature build failure by inducing cracks in bigger parts, and deformations of fine features during the build and of the whole part after removal from the build platform. On the other hand, the ductility of the martensitic α’ microstructure is relatively low. Preheating of the build platform may provide a solution for both problems. It reduces thermal gradients and thus limits the development of residual stresses, but also causes a transformation of the α’ microstructure to a more ductile mixture of α+β. In this research, preheating of the base plate up to 400 °C shows that residual stresses are reduced by 50 %, and a transformation of the microstructure to a α+α’+β mixture. However, <b>pickup</b> of interstitial <b>elements</b> at elevated temperatures during the process leads to an embrittlement, reducing the ductility.

Regarding general DVD player, the influence on pickup from structure designs of spindle motor and base, assembly accuracy etc. have already been solved. But for HD-NVD player, as the speed of spindle motor working in the range from 3000 to 7000 r/m, so the these influence on <b>pickup</b> above correlative <b>element</b> have to be solved by complicated analysis. Through using ALGOR to design and analyze Mecha, obtained the structure dimension of base and modal characteristic, found its material property effecting greatly on the vibration of Mecha.

As well as ITV company Television South (TVS) used the model in its Maidstone studios, which were still in use by those studios when they were sold off as an independent studio facility following the loss of TVS's franchise at the end of 1992.The 125 was a well thought out and well-built studio and OB camera developed from the Link 120 portable camera system. It also contained a comprehensive communications system and used a camera control unit (CCU) based around the 110's but updated with auto black, white, iris and centering functions.The BBC preferred to use a mid range Schneider-Kreuznach lens as it gave good zoom angles. Some believed it produced one of the best <b>images</b> for a <b>pickup</b> tube camera, others believed it could never match the quality of the EMI 2001. Many BBC users felt that the image was soft and not easy to focus, it also produced an unusual image effect that formed the shape of a 'teardrop'The Link 125 was the most successful of all of Links cameras and the last studio to use them was BBC Pebble Mill which decommissioned the last four in 1994 from the news studio having upgraded to Sony BVP-375's and Ikegami HL-55's a few years before.
