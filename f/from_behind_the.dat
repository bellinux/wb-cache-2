5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent out <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> third stone wall {{to see if}} the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E

In the aftermath, the Battalion devotes itself to saving any other survivors of the disaster, despite the shattered nations renewing their war against each other and an uncurable disease ravaging both sides.

5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
