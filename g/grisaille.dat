5|$|In his {{usage of}} <b>grisaille,</b> van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements {{so as not to}} crowd the central devotional image.|$|E
5|$|The {{chapter house}} has stained glass in its east window by Heaton, Butler and Bayne and <b>grisaille</b> {{windows in the}} north and south walls, dated 1882–83, by Blomfield. It {{contains}} an oak cope cupboard from the late 13thcentury. The front of the chapter house was rebuilt to a design by Hussey.|$|E
5|$|The {{two small}} upper {{register}} panels show a rather traditional Annunciation scene, {{with the usual}} dove representing the Holy Spirit near Mary. The two sets of panels, unlike those on the interior, are compositionally very different. The figures occupy distinctly separate niches and the colour schemes of the <b>grisaille</b> saints and donors contrast sharply.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold <b>grisaille</b> architectural spaces.|$|E
5|$|The show {{marked the}} first miniseries on the network, which {{commenced}} its production in March 2014. McHale first envisioned the show in 2004, and pitched it to the network in 2006. After working on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and Adventure Time, the network expressed interest in McHale pitching a pilot. That pilot became the catalyst for Over the Garden Wall. Production of the show was largely handled in Burbank, California, {{but many of the}} show's storyboard artists worked from other U.S. cities, while the program's animation was outsourced to South Korea. The series' environment evokes 19th- and 20th-century Americana, while its digital backgrounds are designed to resemble <b>grisaille</b> paintings.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{consists of}} the two donor wings, a pair of saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. The donors are on the outer wings, kneeling in front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in <b>grisaille</b> make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony {{the patron saint of}} skin diseases and ergotism, known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece, of which Rolin was a member.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} set in a shed {{enclosed}} by two pillars and an archway, rendered in sculpture-like <b>grisaille.</b> Each pillar is supported by a relief hunched figure (atlante) at the base, holding the weight on its shoulders. On each pillar stand statues of Adam and Eve– Adam on the left and Eve to the right. A marble threshold connects the two structures. On the top corners of the arch are two spandrels; the archivolts contain six biblical scenes in relief from the Book of Genesis, depicting the Fall of Man. Two are of Adam and Eve; their expulsion from paradise and Adam tilling the soil. The others are of Cain and Abel: their sacrifice to God; Cain slaying Abel; God appearing to Abel; Cain expelled to the Land of Nod.|$|E
5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in <b>grisaille</b> to imitate sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding an open book, and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in <b>grisaille</b> (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E
25|$|<b>Grisaille</b> – {{monochrome}} {{painting on}} glass using a mixture of ground glass, ground lead and other substances.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} church glazing {{followed the}} new band window style, with colored compositions in large rectangular fields surrounded by bright <b>grisaille</b> glass.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes {{utilizes}} {{a multitude}} of colors—unlike the limited palette often associated with early Cubism—ranging from large areas of ochre, red, white and blue, surrounding the <b>grisaille</b> figure.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, who typical painted exterior wings in <b>grisaille,</b> Memling shows the saints in a realistic manner. Although the donors in van Eyck's Ghent Altarpiece and van der Weyden's Beaune Altarpiece are also painted realistically, they are placed within architectural niches {{separate from the}} adjacent statue-like <b>grisaille</b> saints. Memling breaks with that tradition in these exterior panels, but the subdued palette he uses retains some sense of <b>grisaille.</b> The donors are dressed in their Augustinian habits; {{the two men in}} stark black and the two women in white on black. The saints are dressed in monochromatic clothing. St James wears a light blue cloak and St Anthony's is grey. St Agnes is dressed in drab green and St Clare is also in a dark habit. Although the figures seem to be in two niches, they are enclosed in a single shallow space, with stone walls behind, trefoil arches above, and two columns adorning the outermost edges. Where the wings open is a single column which has the appearance of two separate columns.|$|E
25|$|In {{a letter}} of November 1937, to art {{historian}} Gunnar Jungmarker (1902–1983) at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Billman reveals {{that he is in}} an artistic crisis. The black and white woodcut restricts his expression - too brutal contrasts between black and white surfaces. It was not until 1940 he was able to present a woodcut with several grey tones, developed from the ordinary black printing ink. Gunnar Jungmarker called this type of woodcut: <b>grisaille</b> woodcut. A time-consuming printing process, exclusively for handprinting, with several grey-wood blocks (1-4) aside from the black and white key block. These first free <b>grisaille</b> woodcuts (made before the work with Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in 1945) are based on self-perceived events for example from Billman's sailor years 1926-32, European travels 1936-39 and trips around Sweden during the war years. Some shining <b>grisaille</b> woodcuts are French Restaurant (1940), Artist Family (1941), Wilderness Kitchen (1942), Around a Guitar Player (1942), Stairway in the South (1942), Stormy Day, Dieppe sept. 1939 (1944) or Tropical Harbour (1945).|$|E
25|$|The {{figures in}} the four panels of the lower {{register}} are all positioned within uniform niches. The outer panels show the donors Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The inner panels contain <b>grisaille</b> paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint John the Evangelist. The <b>grisaille</b> is used to give the illusion of sculpture and imply that these are cult representations of the two saints before which the donors kneel, gazing into the distance with their hands clasped together in veneration. As with {{the most of the}} other panels on the inner and outer views, they are lit from the right. Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth, and bring realism to both the faux statues and painted niches.|$|E
25|$|Viollet le Duc dated {{the stained}} glass in the church to around 1295, but the {{ornament}} in its borders and <b>grisaille</b> is from an earlier tradition. It has a cross-hatched ground, as in Merton College, Oxford, but has a very simple leaded pattern and includes much natural foliage.|$|E
25|$|Above Adam is a <b>grisaille</b> {{depiction}} of Abel making a sacrifice {{of the first}} lamb of his flock and Cain presenting part of his crops as a farmer to the Lord. Above Eve is {{a representation of the}} murder of Abel by his brother Cain with an ass's jawbone.|$|E
25|$|When closed, the {{triptych}} shutters showed externally a <b>grisaille</b> painting, {{depicting the}} Mass of Saint Gregory {{in a single}} scene: it features Gregory the Great kneeling at an altar in front of Christ. The latter is surrounded by an arch with flying angels. The two characters in color are a later addition, and are the painting's donors.|$|E
25|$|The {{triptych}} The Last Judgment (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen), {{was commissioned}} by the almoners of the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp in 1525, {{is one of his}} best works in its originality and mastery. The paintings in <b>grisaille</b> on the back were executed by Peter de Kempeneer, who was, at that time, an apprentice in the van Orley's workshop.|$|E
25|$|Below {{this are}} smaller {{paintings}} of famous writers and philosophers watching the unfolding disaster above them with interest. Legend {{states that the}} writers depicted here are Homer, Empedocles, Lucan, Horace, Ovid, Virgil and Dante, but the identifications are disputed by modern scholars. Several small-scale <b>grisaille</b> medallions depicting images from their works, including the first eleven books of Dante's Purgatorio, Orpheus, Hercules, and various scenes from Ovid and Virgil, among others.|$|E
25|$|In The Murder of Lee Oswald and The Warren Commission Torsten Billman incisively commented {{events in}} the wake of the {{assassination}} of president John F. Kennedy. The Murder of Lee Oswald uncovers, in the condensed black satire, complex links people only could sense but, then, couldn't put into words. Two pictures – made when it happened – who went against the grain of mainstream media and which today has a prophetic force. Bertrand Russell wrote appreciatively to Torsten Billman about these two <b>grisaille</b> woodcuts.|$|E
25|$|In 1757, {{a number}} of changes {{were made to the}} {{interior}} to increase the visibility of the Mass, in accordance with changing religious customs. The jubé (choir screen) that separated the liturgical choir from the nave was torn down and the present stalls built (some of the magnificent sculpture from this screen was later found buried underneath the paving and preserved, though it is not on public display). At the same time, some of the stained glass in the clerestory was removed and replaced with <b>grisaille</b> windows, greatly increasing the illumination of the High Altar.|$|E
25|$|Eight Bells was the {{outgrowth}} {{of a series}} of oil paintings that Homer made using three wooden panels he found in the cabin of his brother's sloop at Prouts Neck, Maine. On two of the panels Homer painted scenes of mackerel fleets at Prouts Neck, one at dawn and the other at sunset; on the third he painted a <b>grisaille</b> study of the work that inspired Eight Bells, which depicted a ship's officer standing alone, taking an observation with an octant. Several years earlier, Homer had painted a watercolor on his voyage to England that also showed a sailor performing this activity.|$|E
25|$|The Dining Room (marked 8 {{on first}} floor plan) {{is one of}} the rooms most {{frequently}} changed since the completion of the mansion. Yet today it closely resembles its original form. Sited {{on the first floor of}} the corps de logis, some distance from the original kitchen (on the ground floor of the North Pavilion), the Dining Room is decorated in a neoclassical style inspired by the work of Robert Adam. The ceiling is divided into geometric panels by ornate plasterwork. Each panel originally contained a painted lunette or medallion by Theodore de Bruyn, depicting a classical scene in <b>grisaille.</b> The walls too have plaster panels which contained medallions, matching those of the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{distinctive}} feature of Chartres Cathedral {{is the extent}} to which architectural structure has been adapted to meet the needs of stained glass. The use of a three-part elevation with external buttressing allowed for far larger windows than earlier designs, particularly at the clerestory level. Most cathedrals of the period had a mixture of windows containing plain or <b>grisaille</b> glass and windows containing dense stained glass panels, with the result that the brightness of the former tended to diminish the impact and legibility of the latter. At Chartres, nearly all of the 176 windows were filled with equally dense stained glass, creating a relatively dark but richly coloured interior in which the light filtering through the myriad narrative and symbolic windows was the main source of illumination.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{measures}} 375 x 260cm {{when the}} shutters are closed. The upper panels contain lunettes showing prophets and Sibyls {{looking down on}} the annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors on the far left and right panels flanked by saints. The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; {{this is especially true of}} the faux stone <b>grisaille</b> statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer feel as if the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.|$|E
25|$|The {{panels are}} {{organised}} in two vertical registers, each with {{two sets of}} foldable wings with inner and outer panel paintings. The upper register of the inner panels contains form the central Deësis of Christ the King, Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. They are immediarly flanked, in the next panels by music playing angels, and, on the far outermost panels, the naked figures of Adam and Eve. The four lower-register panels are divided into two pairs; sculptural <b>grisaille</b> paintings of St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist, and on the two outer panels, donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints, sinners, clergy and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the Lamb of God. There are several groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Chartres' windows {{have been}} remarkably fortunate. The medieval glass largely escaped harm during the Huguenot iconoclasm and the {{religious}} wars of the 16th century although the west rose sustained damage from artillery fire in 1591. The relative darkness of the interior {{seems to have been}} a problem for some. A few windows were replaced with much lighter <b>grisaille</b> glass in the 14th century to improve illumination, particularly on the north side and several more were replaced with clear glass in 1753 as part of the reforms to liturgical practice that also led to the removal of the jubé. The installation of the Vendôme Chapel between two buttresses of the nave in the early 15th century resulted in the loss of one more lancet window, though it did allow for the insertion of a fine late-gothic window with donor portraits of Louis de Bourbon and his family witnessing the Coronation of the Virgin with assorted saints.|$|E

500|$|When the triptych's {{wings are}} closed, {{the design of}} the outer panels becomes visible. Rendered in a green–gray <b>grisaille,</b> these panels lack colour, {{probably}} because most Netherlandish triptychs were thus painted, but possibly indicating that the painting reflects a time before the creation of the sun and moon, which were formed, according to Christian theology, to [...] "give light to the earth". It was common for the outer panels of Netherlandish altarpieces to be in <b>grisaille,</b> such that their blandness highlighted the splendid colour inside.|$|E
500|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} borders separating the earthly and heavenly spheres are {{often seen in}} Netherlandish art, usually {{in the form of}} frames or arches. A boundary is achieved here with the <b>grisaille</b> archway, strongly reminiscent of van der Weyden's work. Art historians speculate Christus may have imitated his c. 1455 [...] Instead of merely imitating, Christus innovated and extended the use of van der Weyden's arch motif; his arch is meant to be an opening, or a screen, for the viewer to see into the holy space, instead of a simple framing device in which figures are placed directly in-line or under the arch. [...] The multi-hued threshold stones at the bottom emphasize its function says Upton, who writes: [...] "it is an opening through which one passes: a true frame or doorway to the picture... Yet, since this arch is painted in <b>grisaille,</b> distinct {{from the rest of the}} panel, it must also be seen as a separate entity, much like an elaborate border around an illuminated manuscript page." [...] The shadows cast by the <b>grisaille</b> figures stress [...] "its function as a diaphragm between real and illusory space".|$|E
500|$|The Casket of the Sybyls is an {{elaborate}} small locking casket with {{a framework of}} silver-gilt and gems, set with <b>grisaille</b> panels with touches of gold and flesh-tints. It represents the sophisticated court taste of about 1535, and was probably intended for a lady's jewels. [...] Most such sets of enamel inserts have lost the settings they were intended for.|$|E
500|$|The Nativity conveys {{both the}} Old Testament themes {{of sin and}} {{punishment}} and the New Testament doctrine of sacrifice and redemption. Although Adam and Eve {{to either side of}} the arch are suggestive of those in van Eyck's [...] Ghent Altarpiece, they differ significantly. Here they are painted as <b>grisaille</b> statues in contrast to van Eyck's lifelike versions; and, unlike van Eyck's, here Adam and Eve stand in shame hiding their nudity. Earthly sin and strife, anger and revenge, are represented in the warriors in the corner spandrels, and signify that which Christ's birth would bring to an end.|$|E
500|$|In the {{entrance}} hall is a frieze of the armorials used by past earls of Sutherland. The main stairway, decorated with portraits of the Leveson-Gower family, is around [...] wide and [...] high. The panelled dining room, [...] long and [...] wide, has a wall-top Italian <b>Grisaille</b> frieze and a Khorassan carpet, as well as chairs containing the needlework of the 5th Duke's wife. The drawing room, made from two previous rooms by Lorimer during his restoration of the castle, {{looks out over the}} gardens and sea, and contains large Canalettos and 18th-century tapestries, as well as portraits by Hoppner and Reynolds. Housing over 10,000 books, the library features a painting by Philip de László of Duchess Eileen, as well as a mahogany Chippendale table.|$|E
500|$|The {{companion}} {{pieces in}} the Guicciardi collection (Annunciation, Adoration of the Kings, and Resurrection) were similar works in glue-size, though of lesser quality; Eastlake's notebooks mention that they were [...] "not so good (not so well preserved)". Their style and size are similar to The Entombment, suggesting that they were probably pieces that would have formed {{part of the larger}} polyptych. The Entombment was attributed to Lucas van Leyden at the time, though Eastlake thought that, given its emotional power, it might be a van der Weyden. Bouts studied under van der Weyden, and was strongly influenced by his work. Davies proposed in 1953 that the figuration and pose in The Entombment may have been informed by a small <b>grisaille</b> relief in the arch of the central panel of van der Weyden's Miraflores Altarpiece.|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the Virgin Mary and Archangel Gabriel in an Annunciation scene painted in <b>grisaille,</b> which because of their near-monochrome colouring {{give the impression that}} the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the Christ Child on her lap. On the left hand wing Archangel Michael presents a kneeling donor, while on the right St. Catherine of Alexandria stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering. [...] The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the assumption, while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.|$|E
