PepsiCo had sued Coca-Cola, charging that {{the enforcement of the}} program violated Sherman Act § 1's per se rule against boycotts, but the court granted summary judgment because it found that PepsiCo failed to prove a <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> among IFDs to boycott PepsiCo. PepsiCo offered no evidence of direct communications among the IFDs; it offered only to prove that Coca-Cola assured the IFDs that the loyalty policy would be uniformly enforced and encouraged them to report violations.

50|$|Under European Union {{competition}} law, some agreements infringing Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty) {{are considered}} to be de minimis and therefore accepted. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>agreement,</b> that is one between competitors, will usually be de minimis where the parties' market share is 10% or less, and a vertical agreement, between undertakings operating at different levels of the market, where it is 15% or less.|$|E

We think, however, that in the absence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> among licensees, or any plan aimed at or resulting in industry wide price fixing, licenses with price fixing provisions fall within the orbit of the patent and need not run afoul of the antitrust laws.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{pointed to}} precedent: FOGA {{involved}} [...] "a group boycott {{in the strongest}} sense: A group of competitors threatened to withhold business from third parties unless those third parties would help them injure their directly competing rivals." [...] Klor's [...] "also involved a <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> among those threatened, namely, the appliance suppliers, to hurt a competitor of the retailer who made the threat." [...] Because the case before the Court [...] "concerns only a vertical agreement and a vertical restraint, a restraint that {{takes the form of}} depriving a supplier of a potential customer," [...] it was not within existing boycott precedent.|$|E
5000|$|The dissent {{says that}} there is a <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> between Philips and Sony to {{suppress}} the Lagadec technology.

[...] That is incorrect, Judge Bryson argued: Princo's real grievance is just that [...] "the Lagadec patent has not been made available for non-Orange-Book uses. And that is not patent misuse under any court's definition of the term." [...] It may be an antitrust violation but it is not patent misuse.|$|E

5000|$|PepsiCo {{argued that}} it had shown a per se illegal {{hub-and-spoke}} conspiracy. But the Second Circuit said the cases on which PepsiCo relied were price-fixing hub-and-spoke cases, such as Interstate Circuit and Parke, Davis, which were based on per se illegal conduct. But vertical exclusive dealing agreements are not per se illegal, so that hub-and-spoke conspiracies to establish exclusive dealing are mot per se illegal. To be per se illegal as a boycott, the IFDs must agree together not to deal with PepsiCo. [...] "A <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreement</b> is a prerequisite in a group boycott case."

Also, <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreements</b> have not resolved day-to-day problems EU carriers face on the operational level in countries such as Azerbaijan, Armenia or Ukraine.

In order to get access to the otherwise unobtainable evidence about their existence, the leniency program exists since 1996. Its European adaptation is compared to the version adopted in the Czech Republic and in the USA. The legal and economic effectiveness of this tool is analysed.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) The {{thesis is}} aimed to study <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreements</b> generally, with {{specific}} reference to Australian experience. It thus takes the basic arguments proposed by industry and evaluates these. In this regard the arguments {{put forward by}} the Associated Chamber of Manufacturers of Australia in vehemently opposing strong Trade Practices control are taken as the clearest articulated presentation of general arguments against Trade Practices legislation. Examples are taken of Australian industry as compared with evaluated industries overseas. Also studied are Australian political attitudes and the 1965 Trade Practices Act is evaluated. The thesis is written on material available up to about March 1972 although some annotations have been made since that date. Trade Practices are a continuing phenomena {{and it is not}} possible to be continually up to date in view of the changes occurring. At the time of writing there were only four reports of the Commissioner for Trade Practices available. The text was written prior to the announcement of the Attorney-General (Senator Greenwood) to Federal Parliament on 24 th May 1972 on future governmental intentions in the Trade Practices field and does not attempt to evaluate the merits of the Government's intentions in this regard. The thesis is restricted to <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreements</b> in the Commonwealth and, at the State level, deals primarily with New South Wales.

5000|$|The court noted [...] "one key {{difference}} between a rimless hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of purely vertical agreements) and a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of vertical <b>agreements</b> joined by <b>horizontal</b> agreements)." [...] The {{key difference}} was that [...] "courts analyze vertical agreements {{under the rule of}} reason, whereas <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreements</b> are violations per se." [...] The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs to plead a horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy). The prospect of establishing a violation per se is much more appealing to plaintiffs than the potential difficulty and costliness of proving a § 1 claim under the rule of reason.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the background, contents and airpolitical {{consequences of the}} so-called 'Horizontal Agreements ("HA"),' concluded by the European Union ("EU") with third countries {{to give effect to}} the European Court of Justice's ("Court"/"ECJ") decision of November 2002 in the 'Open Skies' cases brought by the European Commission ("EC"/"Commission") against certain EU Member States. The Court's decision outlaws the nationality or 'ownership and control' clause in the bilateral ('Open Skies') agreements concluded with the United States by those Member States. As this clause is a standard provision in all bilateral air services agreements, the Court's decision actually obliges the Member States to amend those agreements and replace the said clauses by provisions which do not discriminate on the basis of nationality. The Member States have in the meantime mandated the Commission to engage in such negotiations on their behalf {{on the basis of a}} jointly developed Model <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreement</b> ("MHA"), containing a non-discriminatory so-called Community clause and some other provisions on matters within the exclusive competence of the Community. This research thus examines the legal and airpolitical implications of these Horizontal Agreements, which the Commission has concluded in the meantime and continues to propose to third countries. In this connection, attention is given to the scenario of the anticipated <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Agreement</b> negotiations between the EU and the Republic of Korea...|$|E

The Net Book Agreement had been in existence substantially unchanged, for close on 100 years.

The Restrictive Practices Court in 1962 had accepted that the abandonment of the Agreement would deprive the public of a substantial benefit and that, therefore, it could be retained. By the late 1990 s, however, the Court was persuaded {{that there had been}} a material change of circumstances in the industry (in production costs, in the length of economic production runs, and in the structure of retailing) and that as a result, the arguments accepted in 1962 were no longer valid.

40|$|Naked market division, {{price fixing}} {{agreements}} and mergers which result in dominant positions {{have long been}} opposed by {{the courts and the}} government because of the high likelihood that they will result in a reduction in output and an increase in price. We show that the opposite may be true if the market is characterized by marketing spillovers. When marketing investment is required to educate consumers about the general capabilities or qualities of a product, marketing efforts by one producer will benefit rival producers. A theoretical model of these types of markets shows that marketing spillovers can forestall entry altogether or force incumbent firms to engage in 'limit marketing' that leaves the market underserved from a welfare-maximizing perspective. Under these circumstances, market output and social welfare are potentially raised not only through <b>horizontal</b> <b>agreements</b> among competitors, but also through cost-raising strategies and commitments to predatory behavior by incumbent firms.
