Upon returning to Belgrade, she decided to become a flight attendant after seeing one of her friends in a flight attendant's uniform.

500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and go and go. I've had to learn to be OK with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took a lot of hard work".|$|E

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for [...] "Heart of Glory", saying [...] "When I had a problem, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> in and we could sit there, close the door, yell and scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We had a wonderful time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|E
500|$|The {{gift for}} vivid characterisation, which Mitford {{developed}} in her fiction, {{was used to}} full effect in her four biographical works. In the first of these, Madame de Pompadour, she followed Waugh's advice not to write for experts but to fashion [...] "a popular life like Strachey's Queen Victoria", with [...] "plenty of period prettiness". This remained her yardstick in her subsequent biographical writings. Her own description of Voltaire in Love is [...] "a Kinsey report of his romps with Mme de Châtelet and her romps with Saint-Lambert and his romps with Mme de Boufflers... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on for pages". Acton thought The Sun King the most entertaining introduction to the subject in the English language. Mitford's informal style was remarked on by the literary critic Cyril Connolly, who wrote that her facility for transforming unpromising source material into readable form was a skill that any professional historian might envy. The historian Antonia Fraser considered Mitford an important contributor to the [...] "remorseless process by which historical and biographical sales have soared since 1950".|$|E
500|$|The musical {{style of}} Slipknot is a {{constantly}} contested {{issue and the}} genres that the band are categorized in {{vary depending on the}} source, however, this album is generally regarded as nu metal, while showing influences of many different genres. The influence of death metal on the album is clear, and on the subject Jordison stated; [...] "the roots are death metal, thrash, speed metal, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on and on about all those bands." [...] The album also shows influences from alternative metal and even rap metal. Critics have also noted an industrial influence. polarimagazine.com |last=Beck |first=Walter |date=January 17, 2013 |website=Polari Magazine |accessdate=July 4, 2013}} Due to the band's large line-up consisting of additional percussionists and electronics, the album has a very dense, layered sound. Alternative Press stated that the album used [...] "inventive sampling, creative guitar work and an absolute percussive overload", while Q magazine described the album as [...] "a terrifying racket". Slipknot also includes melody, most notably in the single [...] "Wait and Bleed".|$|E

500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{tentatively}} set to be Hot Like Fire, later changed to Imagination, before being confirmed to be Irresistible on March 16, 2001. In the United States, Irresistible was initially slated for release on March 20, 2001. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the release was pushed to June 5, 2001. A listening party was arranged by AOL on June 4, 2001, a day before the album's release date. The album's release was celebrated with a release party at the New York Water Club. Simpson rode down Manhattan's East River on a yacht decorated with banners for the celebration, which included a water ski show, a fireboat spraying water, and fireworks. Simpson said the album's release was a critical moment in her career, one [...] "which could send her to stardom or obscurity." [...] In an interview, she said [...] "I'm right there ready to explode." [...] "Or <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> pfft [...] No one could ever hear from me again," [...] she added. In the United Kingdom, Irresistible was released on July 16, 2001, and in Japan on May 25, 2001.|$|E
500|$|U2 hired Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno {{to produce}} the album, based on the duo's prior work with the band on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. Lanois was {{principal}} producer, with Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis as engineer. Eno took on an assisting role, working with the group in the studio for {{a week at a}} time to review their songs before leaving for a month or two. Eno said his role was [...] "to come in and erase anything that sounded too much like U2". By distancing himself from the work, he believed he provided the band with a fresh perspective on their material each time he rejoined them. As he explained, [...] "I would deliberately not listen to the stuff in between visits, so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> in cold". Since U2 wanted the record to be harder-hitting and live-sounding, Lanois [...] "push the performance aspect very hard, often to the point of recklessness". The Lanois–Eno team used lateral thinking and a philosophical approach—popularised by Eno's Oblique Strategies—that contrasted with the direct and retro style of Rattle and Hum producer Jimmy Iovine.|$|E

500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend that when <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much {{it might as well have}} been a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
