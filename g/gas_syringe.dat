5000|$|There are {{plastic and}} glass {{syringes}} used for blood gas samples. Most syringes come pre-packaged and contain {{a small amount}} of heparin, to prevent coagulation. Other syringes may need to be heparinised, by drawing up {{a small amount of}} liquid heparin and squirting it out again to remove air bubbles. Once the sample is obtained, care is taken to eliminate visible gas bubbles, as these bubbles can dissolve into the sample and cause inaccurate results. The sealed syringe is taken to a blood gas analyzer. If a plastic blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> is used, the sample should be transported and kept at room temperature and analyzed within 30 min. If prolonged time delays are expected (i.e., greater than 30 min) prior to analysis, the sample should be drawn in a glass syringe and immediately placed on ice. [...] Standard blood tests can also be performed on arterial blood, such as measuring glucose, lactate, hemoglobins, dys-haemoglobins, bilirubin and electrolytes.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Heparin binds {{positively}} charged electrolytes. In blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes,</b> electrolyte-balanced heparin {{is used to}} prevent a negative bias in electrolyte concentrations. The potential pre-analytical errors introduced by blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> are largely unknown. Here, we evaluate electrolyte concentrations in non-anticoagulated blood compared with concentrations measured in electrolyte-balanced blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes.</b> METHODS: Venous blood was collected into plain tubes. Ionized calcium, potassium, sodium and hydrogen ions were analyzed directly using a blood gas analyzer and the remaining blood was collected into different blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> in random order: Preset (Becton Dickinson), Monovette (Sarstedt) and Pico 50 - 2 (Radiometer). RESULTS: Ionized calcium and sodium concentrations were significantly lower in blood collected in Becton Dickinson and Sarstedt syringes compared to non-heparinized (NH) blood. The mean bias exceeded biological variation-based total allowable error, which in most cases leads to clinically misleading individual results. In contrast, ionized calcium concentrations in blood collected in Pico 50 - 2 syringes were identical to values obtained from NH blood. Sodium showed a minor, yet statistically significant, bias. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> now contain electrolyte-balanced heparin, one {{should be aware of}} the fact that these syringes can introduce pre-analytical bias in electrolyte concentrations. The extent of the bias differs between syringes...|$|R

50|$|Liquids {{drawn up}} into a <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> can {{optionally}} be sparged with inert gas before dispensing into a reaction vessel such as a Schlenk flask. This is done by drawing the liquid into the syringe via a needle, inserting the needle into the septum sealing a flask under a positive pressure of an inert gas, removing the glass plunger, and allowing the gas to bubble through the liquid in the syringe for several minutes. The glass plunger is then re-inserted and the liquid {{is added to the}} reaction flask. Other techniques such as cannulation {{can also be used to}} transfer liquids instead.|$|R

At each sampling occasion, two separate samples were simultaneously collected from each chamber: (1) a 1 -mL sample that was analysed by direct injection on a gas chromatograph with a mass-spectrometer detector (GC–MS) to determine the concentration of HCN and (2) a 3 -mL sample that was analysed on a gas chromatograph with a flame ionisation detector (GC–FID) with a 250 -μL sample loop to determine the concentration of EDN. The MS detector was used to quantify HCN because the amounts of this compound in the samples were small and the MS detector was more sensitive than the GC–FID detector.|$|E

Methoxyphenols as well as 1, 6 -anhydroglucose were released in amounts as large as 10 mg kg(- 1) of dry biomass at 90 % combustion efficiency. Wood, twigs, bark and needles from the conifers Norway spruce and Scots pine emitted 12 reported 2 -methoxyphenols in similar proportions. Grass, heather and birchwood released the same 2 -methoxyphenols but also the corresponding 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenols which are characteristic of angiosperms. The methoxyphenols are formed from lignin and differ in structure by the group in para position relative to the phenolic OH group. Prominent phenols were those with trans- 1 -propenyl and ethenyl groups in that position.

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} the methane generation potential and digestibility of different (normal and three high-quality protein maize [HQPM]) varieties of maize fodder with goat rumen liquor in vitro. Materials and Methods: Methane production potential and digestibility of different varieties of maize fodder {{were tested in}} in vitro gas production test. Seven varieties of maize, four normal (HTHM 5101, DHM 117, HM 5, and Shaktiman/ 900 M Gold), and three high-quality protein (HQPM 5, HQPM 7, and HQPM 9 /Vivek) were grown in different plots under the same environmental and agro-climatic conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Arterial blood gas {{analyses}} {{provide information}} about the patient’s oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion. Studies have shown that most errors occur during the pre-analytical phase (the processes prior to the actual analysis of the sample). 1 st Automatic is an extra module to the existing blood gas analyzer and a partial automation of the pre-analytical phase {{which is designed to}} reduce these errors. The objective was to investigate whether 1 st Automatic is compatible to the conventional method. Quantitative measurements of pH, pCO 2, pO 2, Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, cGlu, cLac and tHb were performed on 21 paired whole blood specimens collected into the standard blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> and safePICO syringes, both designed for the ABL 800 FLEX. During the collection the pre-analytical errors were minimised. No clinically significant differences were observed in the nine blood gas parameters. The differences were statistically insignificant, with the exception of cNa+, cCa 2 + and tHb. There was a good consistency between the results using the new automated procedure and the conventional method. It was not possible to show any clinically significant difference between the two procedures...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Although plastic {{arterial}} sampling syringes are now commonly used, {{the effects}} of sample storage time and temperature on blood gas tensions are poorly described for samples with a high oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2) taken with these high density polypropylene syringes. METHODS [...] Two ml samples of tonometered whole blood (PaO 2 86. 7 kPa, PaCO 2 4. 27 kPa) were placed in glass syringes and in three brands of plastic blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes.</b> The syringes were placed either at room temperature or in iced water and blood gas analysis was performed at baseline and after 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. RESULTS [...] In the first 10 minutes measured PaO 2 in plastic syringes at room temperature fell {{by an average of}} 1. 21 kPa/min; placing the sample on ice reduced the rate of PaO 2 decline to 0. 19 kPa/min. The rate of fall of PaO 2 in glass at room temperature was 0. 49 kPa/min. The changes in PaCO 2 were less dramatic and at room temperature averaged increases of 0. 47 kPa for plastic syringes and 0. 71 kPa for glass syringes over the entire two hour period. These changes in gas tension for plastic syringes would lead to an overestimation of pulmonary shunt measured by the 100 % oxygen technique of 0. 6 % for each minute left at room temperature before analysis. CONCLUSIONS [...] Glass syringes are superior to plastic syringes in preserving samples with a high PaO 2, and prompt and adequate cooling of such samples is essential for accurate blood gas analysis...|$|R

Smoke samples {{were taken by}} a <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> from wood burning under varying but more or less choked conditions in laboratory pot experiments. Retention index data for a methylsilicone column and basic mass spectral data are given for all compounds. Retention index in combination with molecular mass and structure-specific fragment ions greatly facilitates qualitative analysis. The syringyl and guaiacyl analogues differ by 240 units in retention index and the matching structure-specific ions in their mass spectra by 30 mass units. The identified methoxyphenols differ {{in the structure of}} the sidechain, which may be lacking, an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, a carbonyl-containing group or an alcoholic moiety. The proportions between these groups of compounds varied strongly with combustion conditions whereas the proportions of phenols within them were quite specific for each group.

40|$|Kuwait {{experiences}} desert climatic weather. Due to {{the extreme}} hot and dry conditions in this country, some analytical phenomena have been discovered. Therefore, a systematic study of sampling and analyzing volatile organic compounds in air by using GC-MS with a cryogenic trap is reported in this paper. This study included comparisons of using different sample containers such as Tedlar bags and SUMMA canisters, and different cryogenic freezing-out air volumes in the trap. Calibration curves for different compounds and improvement of replicated analysis results were also reported here. The study found that using different sample containers produced different results. Analysis of ambient air samples collected in Tedlar bags obtained several volatile organic compounds with large concentrations compared to using SUMMA canisters. Therefore, to choose a sample container properly {{is a key element}} for successfully completing a project. Because GC-MS with a cryogenic trap often generates replicated results with poor agreement, an internal standard added to gas standards and air samples by using a <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> was tested. The study results proved that it helped to improve the replicated results...|$|E
40|$|Solid-phase dynamic {{extraction}} (SPDE) {{belongs to}} the most innovative sample preparation and enrichment techniques. However, {{there is still a}} lack of knowledge on the fundamentals of SPDE and its applicability in the field of environmental monitoring. A homemade sampling device is constructed to make a detailed study of SPDE kinetics for toluene extraction. It proved that at least 50 aspirating and dispensing cycles were necessary to obtain toluene equilibration between gas and coating phase. A mechanistic model is proposed to explain that in every dispensing step during SPDE, significant losses of retained analytes (up to 48 %) occur due to desorption processes. A new accelerated solid-phase dynamic extraction procedure (ASPDE) has been developed that avoids dispensing stages during extraction. The resulting extraction time proves to be 1. 7 min, being a reduction by a factor of 37 compared with the SPDE extraction time. ASPDE proved to have high potential in ambient/indoor air monitoring. The limit of detection for toluene was determined to be 56 ppb(v), i. e. a factor of respectively, 6 and 35 lower than obtained with SPME and conventional headspace sampling with <b>gas</b> <b>syringe.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Blood gas {{analysis}} {{is much more}} commonplace nowa-days, thanks to the availability of relatively inexpensive portable analysers such as the IDEXX VetStat or the Epoc (Figs 1 and 2) with disposable cartridges. Most blood gas analysers also measure electrolytes and many measure ionised calcium and lactate. Electrolytes {{will be discussed in}} more detail in the second article in this series. Commercial blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> are also available. Acid-base status is determined by the hydrogen ion concentration (pH). The body’s pH is regulated both by the lungs, which regulate the production of carbon dioxide, and by the kidneys, which regulate bicarbo-nate. The definitions of terms used in blood gas analy-sis are shown in Box 1. Arterial blood gases are preferred when assessing respiratory status, but venous samples also yield useful information regarding metabolic status. Venous blood tends to have a slightly lower pH and higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) than arterial blood because of local tissue metabolism. Peripheral venous samples will not be representative in low flow states and arterial samples may not always be representative of changes occurring in peripheral tissues.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} lambda cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and dimethoate residues in cowpea haulm on microbial fermentation using <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> as incubators. The lambda cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and dimethoate were applied at the vegetative, flowering and podding stages of the cowpea {{at the rate of}} 2. 66 mg/L, 5. 14 mg/L and 6. 68 mg/L of water, respectively. Dimethoate was detected in the cowpea haulm at the highest concentration of 1. 38 mg/kg. The haulm with no pesticide treatment was incubated with media containing rumen fluid, and pesticides were added at concentrations of 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg. In vitro gas production was measured at 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h to estimate the rate of gas evolution. Gas production in general was influenced by pesticide application. In general, gas evolution was reduced by increasing levels of lambda cyhalothrin up to 80 mg/kg. However, an increase in gas accumulation was observed with increasing levels of dimethoate, while the application of cypermethrin yielded no noticeable change in gas production. The study indicates that pesticide residues may function as toxins at concentrations greater than those encountered in the field or lethal dose (LD 50) and may inhibit the growth of rumen microbes...|$|R

The live grain at the lowest moisture level showed an elevated rate inconsistent with the exponential increase in rate of CO 2 evolution with increasing moisture found for maize with moisture contents from 4 to 12. 6 %. At the lowest moisture level, rates of CO 2 evolution from dead-sterile grain were greater than for live grain. Moisture {{had no effect on}} CO 2 evolution from dead-sterile grain. Increasing temperature and increasing levels of O 2 in the storage atmosphere resulted in increased rates of CO 2 evolution from both live and dead-sterile maize. CO 2 production rates from live and from dead-sterile grain decreased with increasing storage time, even though respirometer CO 2 concentrations were less than 1 % {{at the end of the}} experiment. Our results indicate that CO 2 production is not a dependable measure of respiration in dry seeds. Other experiments indicate that oxygen absorption also is not reliable in maize grain...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} storage temperature, storage {{duration}} {{and the type}} of syringe on blood gas and acid–base values in blood of newborn calves were investigated using commercial blood gas syringes coated with heparin (Monovette blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringe,</b> Mono) or heparinised injection syringes (HS). The pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2), base excess (BE), bicarbonate concentration, oxygen saturation (sO 2), total carbon dioxide (TCO 2) and l-lactate concentration were determined immediately after blood collection. In addition, venous blood from 30 calves collected immediately after birth was stored for 12 h at 4 and 18 °C. Means that differed from baseline by more than ± 3 SD of the intraserial precision of the blood gas analyser were considered effects of blood storage. There were very strong correlations between the two syringe types for pH, BE, bicarbonate concentration, TCO 2 and l-lactate concentration in blood assessed immediately after collection. The difference between the mean and baseline of pO 2 exceeded ± 3 SD after 20 min of storage at 4 °C and after 180 min at 18 °C. At those time points, the means of pH and l-lactate concentration were also outside the ± 3 SD range. In blood stored in HS, means exceeded the ± 3 SD range after 120 min for l-lactate, after 180 min for pH and after 360 min for the pCO 2, pO 2, BE and bicarbonate concentration. Storage of venous blood samples at 4 °C preserved blood gas values except for pO 2. With the exception of l-lactate measurement, heparinised syringes are useful for storage of the blood at room temperature for up to 3 h...|$|E
30|$|Static HS-GC {{was applied}} to detect {{bacteria}} contamination in various samples, such as food, household requisites, and medical specimens. For each of these selected applications, one typical example is presented. Natural substances with biocide properties were compared with chemical antibiotics for their suitability as alternative antibiotics. The described method, however, cannot identify each bacterium at a genus or species level. The HS-GC technique has the unique advantage that the whole procedure is carried out in hermetically closed vials, this already beginning with the sample preparation. When the samples are inserted into the nutrient medium, the headspace vials are capped with PTFE-lined septa and sealed with a crimped closure. The septum is then pierced with the needle of a <b>gas</b> <b>syringe,</b> and about 0.3 [*]ml of the headspace gas is withdrawn and injected into the gas chromatograph. The septum remains tight, and several gas samples can be analyzed at given time intervals, thus enabling kinetic measurements. After analysis, the closed vials with their contents can be sterilized at the necessary high temperature and then safely discarded. Thus, the personnel in a lab never {{come into contact with}} pathogens. With commercially available instruments for automated HS-GC, up to 100 samples can be processed automatically with high throughput due to the short analysis time of 3 [*]min. This technique is thus particularly suited for screening purposes to analyze a large number of samples, such as food, for potential contamination by microorganism or to search for alternative antibiotics in case of antibiotic resistance. Contaminated samples then may be taken for further investigations to identify the related microorganism. The electrical signal generated by such an automated headspace instrument lends itself to automated computer evaluation and documentation.|$|E

The gas produced was recorded at 8 and 24 h of inc ubation. In vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), metabolizable energy (ME), truly digestible organic matter (TDOM), partitioning factor (PF), and EMBP were calculated using appropriate formulae. Ammonia nitrogen and total volatile fatty acids (TVFAs) production were analyzed in RL fluid-media mixture after 24 h of incubation. Results: In vitro gas production (ml) at 24 h incubation, IVOMD, ME, TDOM, TVFA concentration, and ammonia nitrogen production were increased (p< 0. 01) {{in proportion to the}} increase in the level of concentrate in the diet.

Methods: Blood from six leukaemic patients was collected into seven primary sample tubes (Monovette, Sarstedt) : sample A, heparinized blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> (potassium reference value); sample B, plasma Li-heparin without separator gel; sample C, plasma Li-heparin with separator gel; and sample D, serum with separator gel. The primary sample tubes designated B, C and D were transported to the laboratory manually. Duplicates of the same sample tubes, BPT, CPT and DPT, were sent to the laboratory by pneumatic tube. Results: In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), there was no increase in the concentration of potassium in samples B, C and D when compared to the reference value. Transport of the samples by pneumatic tube led to a pronounced increase in potassium concentration in samples BPT and CPT, whereas there was no increase in sample DPT when compared to the reference value. In the patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), an increase in potassium concentration occurred in sample D and in samples BPT, CPT and DPT.

A sample was then taken from the line into a blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> for analysis of the sodium concentration by the 860 Blood Gas Analyzer (Chiron Diagnostics, Bayer, Scoresby). Control samples were taken from the beaker. In-vivo study: A 22 gauge intravenous catheter was inserted into a vein of an adult male volunteer. The dead space was also 0. 6 mL. The line was flushed with 5 mL of half-normal saline immediately before sampling. Draw-up volumes of 0. 6, 0. 9, 1. 3, and 1. 6 mL were withdrawn and discarded. 10 mL was used as a control.

40|$|In a rumen {{simulation}} technique (RUSITEC), {{the availability}} and timing of energy (maltose) supply to amino acids/peptides from thawed (frozen) grass was examined {{in order to determine}} if continuous (synchronous), rather than transient (asynchronous, with maltose infused 6 h prior to, or 6 h after feeding RUSITEC with grass), availability of energy was required for optimum ruminal fermentation.   The addition and pattern of energy supply (synchronous or asynchronous) did not influence either fibre (DM) degradation or microbial numbers, although there was an indication of increased total volatile fatty acids (TVFA) and acetate production in the continuous (synchronous) maltose supply.   However, the supply of energy (maltose), irrespective of the pattern of supply, improved the capture of ammonia. The effects of amino acid supplementation on mixed microorganisms fermenting a range of substrates (maize and grass silages, barley straw, avicel and xylan) that usually form part of ruminant diets were examined using <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> incubations.   Gas production, measured at 4, 6, 8, 12 and 18 h incubation, increased by 15. 6, 18. 7, 18. 9, 15. 0 and 5. 4 % respectively, in the xylan substrate, suggesting xylan fermentation was stimulated by amino acids supply.   This implied xylanolytic organisms within the mixed population benefited more from the amino acids.   A subsequent in vitro (syringe) experiment was conducted to identify amino acids that may be simulatory, using a deletion approach where individual amino acids were deleted from a complete mixture of all 20 amino acids normally found in protein.   Amino acid additions, either as the complete mixture or with single amino acid deletions, stimulated microbial growth and fermentation rate compared to only ammonia as the N source.   Although the individual deletion of aromatic amino acids (notably tyrosine and tryptophan), as well as leucine, seemed to decrease fermentation rate, microbial yield was not affected.   The mixed microbial population achieved the highest growth rate and fermentation when complete mixtures of amino acid were provided.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} in-house reference intervals (RIs) for venous blood analysis with the RAPIDPoint 500 blood gas analyser using blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes</b> (BGSs) and to determine whether immediate analysis of venous blood collected into lithium heparin (LH) tubes can replace anaerobic blood sampling into BGSs. METHODS: Venous blood was collected from 24 healthy cats and directly transferred into a BGS and a LH tube. The BGS was immediately analysed on the RAPIDPoint 500 followed by the LH tube. The BGSs and LH tubes were compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test, Bland-Altman and Passing-Bablok analysis. To assess clinical relevance, bias or percentage bias between BGSs and LH tubes was compared with the allowable total error (TEa) recommended for the respective parameter. RESULTS: Based on the values obtained from the BGSs, RIs were calculated for the evaluated parameters, including blood gases, electrolytes, glucose and lactate. Values derived from LH tubes showed no significant difference for standard bicarbonate, whole blood base excess, haematocrit, total haemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose and lactate, while pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, actual bicarbonate, extracellular base excess, ionised calcium and anion gap were significantly different to the samples collected in BGSs (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, extracellular base excess, ionised calcium and anion gap exceeded the recommended TEa. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Assessment of actual and standard bicarbonate, whole blood base excess, haematocrit, total haemoglobin, sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose and lactate can be made based on blood collected in LH tubes and analysed within 5 mins. For pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxygen, extracellular base excess, anion gap and ionised calcium the clinically relevant alterations have to be considered if analysed in LH tube...|$|R

METHODS: Ninety-two exudative pleural aspirates were collected in commercially available blood <b>gas</b> <b>syringes.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Samples were analyzed immediately using a blood gas analyzer. The effects of residual air, lidocaine, heparin, and delay in analysis (24 h) on pH and glucose measurement accuracy were assessed. Pleural fluid pH was significantly increased by residual air (mean +/- SD, 0. 08 +/- 0. 07; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 06 to 0. 09; P < 0. 001) and significantly decreased by residual lidocaine (0. 2 ml; mean change in pH, - 0. 15 +/- 0. 09; 95 % CI, - 0. 13 to - 0. 18; P < 0. 001) and residual heparin (mean change in pH, - 0. 02 +/- 0. 05; 95 % CI, - 0. 01 to - 0. 04; P = 0. 027). Pleural fluid pH was stable {{at room temperature for}} 1 hour and significantly increased at 4 (mean +/- SD, 0. 03 +/- 0. 07; 95 % CI, 0. 01 to 0. 04; P = 0. 003) and 24 hours (0. 05 +/- 0. 12; 95 % CI, 0. 03 to 0. 08; P < 0. 001). Pleural fluid glucose concentration was not clinically significantly altered by residual air, lidocaine (up to 0. 4 ml), or 24 -hour analysis delay. CONCLUSIONS: Accuracy of measured pleural pH is critically dependent on sample collection method. Residual air, lidocaine, and analysis delay significantly alter pH and may impact on clinical management. Pleural fluid glucose concentration is not significantly influenced by these factors.

30|$|Each {{experiment}} included six anaerobic batch reactors, 250 ml serum bottles (Scientific Instrument Services, NJ, US), for incubating the feedstock. One {{hundred fifty}} ml of feedstock was transferred into each reactor, {{and then the}} reactors were sealed with a rubber septum (Sigma-Aldrich, sleeve stopper, MW 09194, St. Louis, MO, US). Before starting each experiment, an anaerobic environment at the reactor's headspace were created. The reactors were placed in an orbital water bath shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Classic Series C 7, 400768741, Edison, New Jersey, USA). During each experiment, the water bath shaker speed was maintained at 150 rpm. For analyzing E. coli, we collected incubated liquid slurry from three out of six reactors (randomly selected) using a 35 ml <b>gas</b> tight glass <b>syringe</b> (Micro - Mate, Popper & Sons Inc, New Hyde Park, NY). The biogas at each reactor was measured using a 35 ml <b>gas</b> tight glass <b>syringe</b> (Micro - Mate, Popper & Sons Inc, New Hyde Park, NY). To measure the biogas, the needle of the syringe was inserted into the septum, and the gas pressure in the bottle displaced the syringe plunger. The displaced volume indicated the amount of biogas produced, which was analyzed for CH 4 content.|$|R
40|$|Oral malodour (Halitosis) is a {{socially}} excluding condition which {{can result in}} low self esteem and continual worry. Oral malodour results from the putrefactive action of mainly Gram- negative anaerobic bacteria resident on the tongue dorsum biofilm degrading proteinacious substrates from food debris, shedded epithelial cells and stagnant saliva. The gasses suspected in contributing the majority to oral malodour are the volatile sulphur compounds (VSC), hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) and methylmercaptan; with H 2 S forming {{the majority of the}} bouquet of oral malodour. Sorbarod tongue biofilms were prepared by inoculating a tongue dorsum scrape sample onto a sorbarod cellulose matrix which were perfused with 1 / 5 th strength brain heart infusion media (plus supplements) until biofilm growth rates reached the quasi-steady state. A portable sulphide gas chromatograph was calibrated using diluted 2000 ppb H 2 S and used to calculate generation of H 2 S from the biofilm by using a <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> dilution method. Initial model development experiments were conducted to validate the sorbarod perfusion system. Sorbarod biofilms reached quasi-steady state growth rate and H 2 S generation rate after 48 h of media perfusion. Comparisons between air and anaerobic gas (10 % CO 2 in N 2) perfused biofilms showed a significant difference (p 0. 05, unpaired t-test) was seen in the recovery of Fusobacteria/Veillonella species in eluate recovery, or between any group in biofilm recovery. A perfusion media flow rate experiment on three sorbarod biofilms matured to steady state at a 20 ml/h flow rate and then perfused at 10, 40 or 100 ml/h for 48 h. H 2 S analysis conducted at 0, 24 and 48 h showed an increase in H 2 S generation as flow rate increased from 20 ml/h to 40 and 100 ml/h and a H 2 S decrease as flow rate decreased to 10 ml/h. Extrapolation of gas phase flow rates to 'average' breathing rates (6 Llmin) revealed that in vitro biofilm H 2 S concentration was similar to the oral cavity concentration found in the volunteer donating the sample. Pulsing in vitro tongue biofilms with metronidazole (25 mg/ml) significantly reduced recovery of strict an aerobes in eluate (p= 0. 0084) and reduced the generation of H 2 S. Pulsinq with vancomycin (20 mg/ml) significantly reduced facultative anaerobic recovery in eluate (p= 0. 0051). Metronidazole and vancomycin showed no significant reduction (p> 0. 05) in strict and facultative anaerobes (respectively) in the total biofilm. Sorbarod biofilms developed over a pH range (pH 5. 5, 6. 0, 6. 5, 7. 0, 7. 5 and 8. 0) revealed the greatest yields of facultative and strict an aerobes were supported between pH 6. 5 and 7. 0 with greater proportions of Gram- negative organisms supported between pH 7. 0 - 8. 0 and greater proportions of Gram-positive organisms supported between pH 5. 5 - 6. 0. In addition, community level physiological profiling also demonstrated the greatest metabolic diversity at pH 6. 5 and 7. 0 (H= 1. 99 and 1. 98 respectively). Qualitative and quantitative 16 S rRNA analysis by the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM) revealed the majority of suspected malodour producing organisms was supported between pH 6. 5 and 8. 0. Analysis of H 2 S by Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry revealed biofilms supported at pH 7. 5 generated the greatest concentrations of VSC. In addition, the specific activity for H 2 S generation also calculated that strict anaerobes supported at pH 7. 5 generated the greatest amounts of H 2 S. The sorbarod perfusion system demonstrated the ability to support quasi-steady state in vitro tongue biofilms which responded to challenges in a similar way to findings conducted in vivo and was able to identify some of the effects of pH on microbial yields, metabolic diversity and generation of malodorous compounds.

40|$|Gas {{composition}} and analysis forms a large {{field of research}} whose requirements demand that measurement equipment be as affordable, uncomplicated and convenient as possible. The precise quantitative composition of an atmospheric, industrial or chemically synthesised sample of gas is of utmost importance when inferring the properties {{and nature of the}} environment from which the sample was taken, or for inferring how a prepared sample will react in its application. The most popular and widely used technique to achieve this is Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) and, without a doubt, this technique has set the standard for gas analysis. Despite the accuracy of the GCMS technique, the equipment itself is bulky, expensive and cannot be applied readily to field work. Instead, most field work is conducted using a single gas detector, capable only of detecting one particular molecule or element at a time. Presented here is an interferometric technique that theoretically, has the ability to address all three issues of bulkiness, affordability and convenience, whilst not being limited to one particular element or molecule in its analysis. Identifying the unknown constituents of a gaseous mixture using the proposed method, employs the optical refractive properties of the mixture to determine its composition. A key aspect of this technique is that the refractive index of an arbitrary mixture of gases will vary depending on pressure and wavelength 1. The Lorentz-Lorenz formula and the Sellmeier equations form the foundation of the theoretical background. The optical refractive properties of air and other atmospheric gases have been well established in the literature. The experimental investigations described here have been conducted based on this, insofar as no analysis has been conducted on gases that do not naturally occur in reasonable abundance in the atmosphere. However this does not in any way preclude the results and procedure developed from applying to a synthesised gas mixture. As mentioned, the platform of this technique relies on the pressure and wavelength dependence of the refractivity of the gas. The pressure dependence of the system is easily accounted for, in making this claim however it is still imperative the mixture be impervious to contamination from the wider atmosphere. Wavelength dependence however is perhaps slightly more difficult to accommodate. Multiple lasers, of differing wavelength form the radiative sources which underpin the method developed. Laser sources were chosen because of their coherence, making it easy to produce interference, when combined with the inherent stability of the Sagnac interferometer, provides for a very user friendly system that is able to quickly take results. The other key part of the experimental apparatus is the gas handling system, the gas(es) of interest need to be contained within an optical medium in the path of one of the beams of the interferometer. Precise manipulation of the pressure of the gas is critical in determining concentration, this has been achieved {{through the use of a}} <b>gas</b> <b>syringe</b> whose plunger is moved on a finely threaded screw, and measured on a digital manometer. The optical setup has also been explored, specifically in ruling out the use of such radiative sources as passing an incandescent source through a monochromator or the use of LED's to produce interference before settling on lasers to produce the required interference. Finally, a comprehensive theoretical background has been presented using classical electromagnetic theory as well as confirmation from a quantum perspective. The theoretical background for this study relies upon the Lorentz-Lorenz formula. It is commonly presented either from a classical or quantum perspective, in this work both classical and quantum mechanical treatments are given whilst also showing how each confirms the other. Furthermore, a thorough investigation into the dispersion functions of each of the major components of the atmosphere has been compiled from the study of refractivity on individual gases from other authors, in some cases, where no work has been done previously, this has been derived. The technique developed could be considered an ample addition to gas analysis techniques in certain circumstances in terms of expense, convenience and accuracy. The system can predict relative quantities of constituents of the atmosphere to at least 3 %. The method described here would allow researchers more time to concentrate on actual results and more resources to allocate to broadening intellectual horizons. This would certainly justify further development...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare ileal and faecal digestibilities to <b>gas</b> {{production}} in <b>syringes,</b> preceded or not by an in vitro enzymatic digestion of two pig diets containing different amounts of non starch polysaccharides (NSP). In vivo, only nitrogen faecal digestibility differed between the two diets. Their enzymatic pre-digestion led to a higher gas production after 16 h of incubation in syringes for the diet with the lowest N faecel digestibility but not without pre-digestion. We may conclude that an in vitro pre-digestion before incubation in syringes is necessary to evaluate feed fermentescibility in pig large intestine. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{involving}} concurrent headspace solvent microextraction combined with continuous hydrodistillation (HD-HSME) for the extraction and pre-concentration {{of the essential}} oil of Lavandula angustifolia Mill. into a microdrop is developed. A microdrop of n-hexadecane containing n-heptadecane (as internal standard) extruded from the needle tip of a <b>gas</b> chromatographic <b>syringe</b> was inserted into the headspace above the plant sample. After extraction for an optimized time, the microdrop was retracted into the syringe and injected directly into a GC injection port. The effects {{of the type of}} extracting solvent, sample mass, microdrop volume and extraction time on HD-HSME efficiency were investigated and optimized. Using this method, thirty-six compounds were extracted and identified. Linalool (32. 8 %), linalyl acetate (17. 6 %), lavandulyl acetate (15. 9 %), α-terpineol (6. 7 %) and geranyl acetate (5. 0 %) were found to be the major constituents. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report on the use of continuous headspace solvent microextraction coupled with hydrodistillation for investigation of essential oil components...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} method is presented for determination of n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol and isoamyl alcohol, which are decomposition products of alkyl nitrites in body fluids, using capillary gas chromatography (GC) with cryogenic oven trapping. After heating a blood or urine sample containing each alkyl alcohol and t -butyl alcohol (IS) in a 7 -ml vial at 55 ℃ for 15 min, 5 ml of the headspace vapor was {{drawn into a}} <b>gas</b> tight <b>syringe</b> and injected into a GC port. All vapor was introduced into an Rtx-BAC 2 middle-bore capillary column in the splitless mode at 0 ℃ of oven temperature to trap entire analytes, and then the oven temperature was programmed up to 240 ℃ for GC measurements by flame ionization detection. The present conditions gave sharp peaks of each compound and IS, and low background noises for whole blood or urine samples. Isobutyl alcohol and methemoglobin in human whole blood, after inhalation of isobutyl nitrite gas for 2 min, could be actually determined. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R
