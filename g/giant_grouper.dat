25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the <b>giant</b> <b>grouper,</b> which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red lionfish, all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
500|$|Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), and {{possibly}} also silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), though they usually occur at depths {{greater than those}} favored by whitetip reef sharks. An [...] long whitetip reef shark has also {{been found in the}} stomach of a <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus lanceolatus), though these groupers are unlikely to be significant predators of this species due to their rarity. Known parasites of the whitetip reef shark include the copepod Paralebion elongatus and the praniza (parasitic) larvae of the isopod Gnathia grandilaris. While resting during the day, these sharks have been observed being cleaned by the wrasse Bodianus diplotaenia and the goby Elacatinus puncticulatus. Unusually, there is also a report of seven whitetip reef sharks adopting a cleaning posture (mouth agape and gills flared) {{in the midst of a}} swarm of non-cleaning hyperiid amphipods; the mechanical stimulation from the moving amphipods are thought to have evoked this behavior through their similarity to actual cleaner organisms.|$|E

40|$|Ninety-three <b>giant</b> Queensland <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus lanceolatus (Bloch), {{were found}} dead in Queensland, Australia, from 2007 to 2011. Most dead fish {{occurred}} in northern Queensland, with a peak of mortalities in Cairns in June 2008. In 2009, sick wild fish including giant sea catfish, Arius thalassinus (Ruppell), and javelin grunter, Pomadasys kaakan (Cuvier), also occurred in Cairns. In 2009 and 2010, two disease epizootics involving wild stingrays occurred at Sea World marine aquarium. Necropsy, histopathology, bacteriology and PCR determined {{that the cause of}} deaths of 12 <b>giant</b> Queensland <b>grouper,</b> three wild fish, six estuary rays, Dasyatis fluviorum (Ogilby), one mangrove whipray, Himantura granulata (Macleay), and one eastern shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata (Shaw), was Streptococcus agalactiae septicaemia. Biochemical testing of 34 S. agalactiae isolates from <b>giant</b> Queensland <b>grouper,</b> wild fish and stingrays showed all had identical biochemical profiles. The 16 S rRNA gene sequences of isolates confirmed all isolates were S. agalactiae; genotyping of selected S. agalactiae isolates showed the isolates from <b>giant</b> Queensland <b>grouper</b> were serotype Ib, whereas isolates from wild fish and stingrays closely resembled serotype II. This is the first report of S. agalactiae from wild <b>giant</b> Queensland <b>grouper</b> and other wild tropical fish and stingray species in Queensland, Australia...|$|R

5000|$|Since it opened, the {{aquarium}} has featured live shark feeds throughout the week. Scuba divers feed whitetip reef sharks, nurse sharks and zebra sharks, {{as well as}} the whiptail stingray and <b>giant</b> <b>groupers</b> by hand inside the main tank of {{the aquarium}}. The divers wear three sets of gloves including one cotton pair, a chainmail glove and one layer of Kevlar. The grey reef shark and blacktip reef shark population is fed from a floating platform above the main tank, as they are too dangerous and unpredictable to be fed by hand.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{threatened}} species which include sea turtles like hawksbills, olive ridleys, and green turtles; humphead wrasses, <b>giant</b> <b>groupers</b> and <b>giant</b> clams {{are present in}} the Verde Island Passage. However, there are no enforcement of ordinances and over-fishing is common. A short-lived 'park fee' scheme for the Verde Island drop-off dive site was soon dropped when it was discovered that the revenue was being used to buy better fishing gear and hence removing fish at a higher rate. Humphead wrasses are especially threatened and divers often go years without spotting a single individual. It was particularly noted the rare red fin wrasse (Cirrhilabrus rubripinnis) thrives in Verde Island. I have personally experienced in 2014 that the tourist levy was in full operation when I landed at Puerto Galera though it is a small amount. The municipalities collect the fee and are responsible for its administration that includes support to community infrastructure around the area.|$|R

40|$|The lack {{of genetically}} {{improved}} strains {{capable of producing}} high quality seed is consistently identified as the most widespread and persistent technical obstacle to the sustainable development of aquaculture both nationally and internationally. We, at USC, have been focussing on the development and application of new genetic and reproductive technologies to develop improved strains and enhance quality seed production for national Australian industries and to support regional efforts to meet this need. Here we provide examples of the technologies that we have recently developed, namely DNA markers for parentage assignment, desired gain selection index theory and modern genetic evaluation and mate allocation systems, which have been applied to improve quality and productivity of yellowtail kingfish and banana prawn. The ‘genetic package’ developed is to be implemented in selective breeding programs for Oysters and <b>Giant</b> <b>groupers</b> {{as well as other}} new emerging species in Australia and overseas, starting with DNA investigations to verify the integrity of the base populations in terms of inbreeding levels, genetic variability and species purity. In this presentation, we also discuss potential future research programs being developed in collaboration with neighbouring countries in the region and with the industry partners in Australia...|$|R
50|$|Mackerel scad {{are fairly}} {{important}} both to fisheries and to sportfishing. They {{can be used}} as food, but are known to carry ciguatera, and are more often used as bait, since large gamefish such as the blue-spotted <b>grouper,</b> <b>giant</b> trevally, and the onespot snapper are all known to feed on them.|$|R
50|$|The {{ocean sunfish}} is the {{heaviest}} bony {{fish in the}} world, while the longest is the king of herrings, a type of oarfish. Specimens of ocean sunfish have been observed up to 3.3 m in length and weighing up to 2303 kg. Other very large bony fish include the Atlantic blue marlin, some specimens {{of which have been}} recorded as in excess of 820 kg, the black marlin, some sturgeon species, and the <b>giant</b> and goliath <b>grouper,</b> which both can exceed 300 kg in weight. In contrast, the dwarf pygmy goby measures a minute 15 mm.|$|R
50|$|Eight aquariums {{ranging in}} {{capacity}} from 1,000 litres to 18,000 litres. A {{wide variety of}} seawater species are exhibited, including blacktip reef sharks, bamboo sharks, moray eels, <b>giant</b> <b>grouper,</b> stingrays, scorpion fish and seahorses. The aquarium also exhibits many species of corals, and many reef fish, such as clownfish.|$|E
50|$|This giant fish {{is similar}} to the Malabar grouper, and its colour changes with age. The <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> has a large mouth and a rounded tail. Juveniles have {{irregular}} black and yellow markings, while adults are green-grey to grey-brown with faint mottling, with numerous small black spots on the fins.|$|E
5000|$|The Serranidae are a {{large family}} of fishes {{belonging}} to the order Perciformes. The family contains about 450 species in 65 genera, including the sea basses and the groupers (subfamily Epinephelinae). Although many species are small, in some cases less than 10 cm, the <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus lanceolatus) {{is one of the}} largest bony fishes in the world, growing to 2.7 m in length and 400 kg in weight. [...] Representatives of this group live in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Like most <b>groupers,</b> <b>Giant</b> {{groups are}} protogynous hermaphrodites (all are born female, but some become male when few males are present). They spawn on a lunar cycle, with spawns lasting {{approximately}} seven days. They are aggregative broadcast spawners, usually with several females per male. Studies in captive populations {{suggest that the}} dominant male and female begin the spawning event as nearly the only spawners {{for the first day}} or two, but other members of the aggregation fertilize more eggs as the event progresses, with even the most-recently-turned males fathering offspring. Unlike males, where one male is dominant across spawns, the dominant female of an aggregation seems to change from month to month.|$|R
50|$|Groupers are teleosts, {{typically}} {{having a}} stout {{body and a}} large mouth. They are not built for long-distance, fast swimming. They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon , though obviously in such a large group, species vary considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. They do not have many teeth {{on the edges of}} their jaws, but they have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Some species prefer to ambush their prey, while other species are active predators. Reports of fatal attacks on humans by the largest species, the <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus lanceolatus), {{also known}} as the brindlebass, brown spotted cod, or {{bumblebee}} grouper, and as the Queensland grouper in Australia, is the largest bony fish found in coral reefs, and the aquatic emblem of Queensland. It is found from near the surface to depths of 100 m at reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, {{with the exception of the}} Persian Gulf. It also enters estuaries, such as the lowermost part of the Brisbane River. It reaches up to 2.7 m in length and 400 kg in weight; unconfirmed reports of it growing much bigger exist, up to 4.26 m and 598 kg. Giant groupers feed on a variety of marine life, including small sharks and juvenile sea turtles. Due to overfishing, this species has declined drastically in many regions, and as of the mid-1990s, it is considered Vulnerable by the IUCN.|$|E
5000|$|Chumbe Island and the {{surrounding}} area display an exceptional amount of biodiversity in both plant and animal life. For example, at least 90% of all hard coral species that have been recorded in Eastern African reefs have been found near Chumbe Island. In addition to coral, around 400 fish species that are part of 50 fish families have been documented, including more rare species of fish like the <b>Giant</b> <b>Grouper,</b> Epinephelus lanceolatus. Seabirds, such as the Roseate Terns, terna dougalli, have been successfully bred on Chumbe Island, as well the rare species of Robber or Coconut crab, which are frequently seen on the island [...] The creation of this protected area has allowed for the free breeding of fish, coral and other marine species that have begun to repopulate the over exploited nearby areas such as directly off the coast of Zanzibar.|$|E
50|$|Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis), and {{possibly}} also silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), though they usually occur at depths {{greater than those}} favored by whitetip reef sharks.

According to the 2009 Census, the local {{population}} consists of 42,380 individuals, 17,775 of whom are nomads.Arta was established {{after the end of}} the Djiboutian Civil War in 1994. In 2000, peace talks between various factions of the Somali Civil War were held in Arta city, resulting in the establishment of the Transitional National Government of Somalia.The Region's coast is noted for its marine life, including like turtles, dolphins, whale sharks, manta rays, <b>giant</b> <b>grouper,</b> blue spotted rays and other varieties of sharks. Nestled on the heights of the Arta mountains, more than 700 meters, Arta is the biggest potential in the region, especially thanks to the mild and invigorating climate of the city located only 20 minutes from Djibouti city with a spectacular view of the Gulf of Tadjoura. Moreover, the range of Arta and the surrounding coastline has an undeniable tourist future, thanks, especially whale shark who regularly live from October to March. Issue size and weight, the whale shark is the largest fish that inhabit the seas and oceans of the world. Completely harmless, this behemoth easily 18 meters and can weigh 10 tons.

40|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>grouper,</b> {{also known}} as the iconic Queensland groper, indeed grows to be a giant, and does so very fast. Groupers are a very high value {{aquaculture}} species, and have an important niche in the lucrative live fish trade into Hong Kong and China. USC is the lead agency on a large ACIAR funded project aimed at developing a sustainable <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> aquaculture in Australia, Vietnam and the Philippines. The project covers aspects concerning reproduction, larval rearing, genetics, surrogate technology and drug delivery. The groupers all develop first as females, and a few years into their life some change sex into males, in response to social cues. For giant groupers this can happen when the fish are close to 100 kg, which makes the weighing or the handling of the fish somewhat of a challenge. Therefore one of our research questions is - how early can we change <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> females into males? Handling the fish is also a challenge, so spawning induction via implantation of slow release hormone devices, while effective, is logistically complex. Therefore another question we are addressing is - can we develop effective oral delivery system to overcome the need of manual handling? Genetic management {{is an essential part of}} any aquaculture operation, and developing tools for efficient management and setting up the basis for a genetic program is another important aspect of the project. Larval rearing is a common bottleneck in aquaculture, as nutritional requirements can be very specific for each species. NFC already established the benefit of copepods for grouper larvae survival and quality. We are using new generation sequencing technologies to determine the differences in the transcriptomes of <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae that have been fed copepods vs. those raised on rotifers to elucidate what are the changes induced in the larvae that support better growth and survival...|$|E

40|$|Parental {{contributions}} of <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> to communal spawns in captivity {{is important for}} establishing genetic management of the species. In this study, we have followed the spawning dynamics of three males and three females over six to eight consecutive days, over three time periods. Polymorphic microsatellite markers were validated and utilised to successfully determine parentage in 574 offspring from 20 nights of spawns. Variation of both maternal and paternal contributions between nights in batches of spawns were significant (P < 0. 001). Most paternal assignments were attributed to one dominant male who initiated each spawning batch, however, all males and females successfully mated over the spawning period. There was a significant (P < 0. 01) trend towards a polygamous reproductive mode for giant grouper: {{in two of the}} three batches of spawns, where on some nights, eggs from all females were fertilised by multiple males. Genetic variation was assessed between parents and offspring. There was a loss of alleles on each spawning night, however, if offspring from a series of consecutive nights were combined, most or all of the genetic variation would be maintained in the F 1 generation. This research validates the use of molecular tools for genetic monitoring of <b>giant</b> <b>grouper</b> and improves the understanding of spawning dynamics of protogynous hermaphroditic communal spawners over time in an aquaculture setting...|$|E
