25|$|This {{implies the}} <b>extreme</b> <b>value</b> theorem: a {{continuous}} real-valued function on a nonempty compact space is bounded above and attains its supremum.

25|$|Taking {{derivatives}} {{and solving}} for critical points is therefore often {{a simple way}} to find local minima or maxima, which can be useful in optimization.

25|$|This {{can either}} be an {{advantage}} or a drawback: if extreme values are real (not measurement errors), and of real consequence, as in applications of <b>extreme</b> <b>value</b> theory such as building dikes or financial loss, then outliers (as reflected in sample extrema) are important. On the other hand, if outliers {{have little or no}} impact on actual outcomes, then using non-robust statistics such as the sample extrema simply cloud the statistics, and robust alternatives should be used, such as other quantiles: the 10th and 90th percentiles (first and last decile) are more robust alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Another {{motivation}} for using local alignments {{is that there}} is a reliable statistical model (developed by Karlin and Altschul) for optimal local alignments. The alignment of unrelated sequences tends to produce optimal local alignment scores which follow an <b>extreme</b> <b>value</b> distribution. This property allows programs to produce an expectation value for the optimal local alignment of two sequences, which is a measure of how often two unrelated sequences would produce an optimal local alignment whose score is greater than or equal to the observed score. Very low expectation values indicate that the two sequences in question might be homologous, meaning they might share a common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|In economics, the Laffer {{curve is}} a {{theoretical}} {{representation of the}} relationship between government revenue raised by taxation and all possible rates of taxation. It is used to illustrate the concept of taxable income elasticity (that taxable income will change in response to changes in the rate of taxation). The curve is constructed by thought experiment. First, the amount of tax revenue raised at the extreme tax rates of 0% and 100% is considered. It is clear that a 0% tax rate raises no revenue, but the Laffer curve hypothesis is that a 100% tax rate will also generate no revenue because at such a rate {{there is no longer any}} incentive for a rational taxpayer to earn any income, thus the revenue raised will be 100% of nothing. If both a 0% rate and 100% rate of taxation generate no revenue, it follows from the <b>extreme</b> <b>value</b> theorem that there must exist at least one rate in between where tax revenue would be a maximum. The Laffer curve is typically represented as a graph which starts at 0% tax, zero revenue, rises to a maximum rate of revenue raised at an intermediate rate of taxation and then falls again to zero revenue at a 100% tax rate.|$|E

40|$|Addressing {{the needs}} of understudied and {{vulnerable}} populations first and foremost necessitate correct application and interpretation of research {{that is designed to}} understand sources of disparities in healthcare or health systems outcomes. In this brief research report, we discuss some important concerns and considerations in handling “outliers” when conducting disparities-related research. To illustrate these concerns, we use data from our recently completed study that investigated sources of disparities in cancer pain outcomes between African Americans and Whites with cancer-related pain. A choice-based conjoint (CBC) study was conducted to compare preferences for analgesic treatment for cancer pain between African Americans and Whites. Compared to Whites, African Americans were both disproportionately more likely to make pain treatment decisions based on analgesic side-effects and {{were more likely to have}} <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> for the CBC-elicited utilities for analgesic “side-effects. ” Our findings raise conceptual and methodological consideration in handling <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> when conducting disparities-related research. <b>Extreme</b> <b>values</b> or outliers can be caused by random variations, measurement errors, or true heterogeneity in a clinical phenomenon. The researchers should consider: 1) whether systematic patterns of <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> exist and 2) if systematic patterns of <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> are consistent with a clinical pattern (e. g., poor management of cancer pain and side-effects in racial/ethnic subgroups as documented by many previous studies). As may be evident, these considerations are particularly important in health disparities research where <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> may actually represent a clinical reality, such as unequal treatment or disproportionate burden of symptoms in certain subgroups. Approaches to handling outliers, such as non-parametric analyses, log transforming clinically important <b>extreme</b> <b>values,</b> or removing outliers may represent a missed opportunity in understanding a potentially targetable area of intervention...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} random wave loading in the ocean environment and hence the probability distribution of the <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> of their response to wave loading is required for their safe and economical design. Wave loading on slender members of bottom-supported jacket structures is frequently calculated by Morison's equation. Due to nonlinearity of the drag component of Morison wave loading and also due to intermittency of wave loading on members in the splash zone, the response is often non-Gaussian; therefore, simple techniques for derivation of their extreme response probability distributions are not available. To this end, the conventional time simulation technique (CTS) is frequently used for predicting the probability distribution of the <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> of response. However, this technique suffers from excessive sampling variability and hence {{a large number of}} simulated response <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> (hundreds of simulated response records) are required to reduce the sampling variability to acceptable levels. In this paper, a more efficient version of the time simulation technique (ETS) is introduced to derive the probability distribution of response <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> from a much smaller sample of simulated <b>extreme</b> <b>values.</b> The ETS procedure is found to be many times more efficient than the CTS method...|$|R
