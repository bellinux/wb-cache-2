500|$|Although Stockhausen and Piene's planned {{multimedia}} project, titled Hinab-Hinauf, {{was developed}} in detail , the World Fair committee rejected their concept as too extravagant and instead asked Stockhausen to present daily five-hour programs of his music [...] Stockhausen's works were performed for 5½ hours every day {{over a period of}} 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners [...] According to Stockhausen's biographer, Michael Kurtz, [...] "Many visitors felt the spherical auditorium to be an oasis of calm amidst the general <b>hubbub,</b> and after a while it became one of the main attractions of Expo 1970" [...]|$|E
500|$|The Port lies in {{the extreme}} south near the sea, and is portrayed as a place full of strangers. Here ships load their cargo, which is {{verified}} by the customs officer, Alice Nettles (deceased). A dangerous coven called the Port Witch Coven can lure strangers into a trap or turn them into toads. There is a short cut from the Port to Zelda's house in the Marram Marshes. The author created the Port because of her love of the <b>hubbub</b> accompanying the arrival of boats. According to Sage, she sees the Port as full of [...] "beginnings and adventuresand endings too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{entire staff}} agrees to pool their points towards Andy's butt tattoo, {{and the office}} {{suddenly}} becomes a <b>hubbub</b> of activity, with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) even giving up his nap-time to make sales calls for Sabre's new Pyramid tablet. To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have anything else to do with each other.|$|E
2500|$|The Upper Midwest was {{not immune}} to the Fourierist <b>hubbub</b> that had begun to {{percolate}} in the United States in 1843. In the fall of that year the Franklin Lyceum of Southport (today known as Kenosha) began taking up discussion of Fourier's ideas {{in a series of}} public discussions. On November 21 the society debated the proposition [...] "Does the system of Fourier present a practicable plan for such a reorganization of society as will guard against our present social ills?" [...] After a week's pause, two more successive weekly meetings of the lyceum were dedicated to the Fourier program.|$|E
2500|$|Mekas {{presented}} another multimedia event by USCO {{the following}} month, {{for a week}} in January 1966. Titled <b>Hubbub,</b> the event was promoted in the Village Voice in an ad that described it as [...] "Expanded Cinema! Psychedelic Cinema! Media Mix! Marshall McLuhan! Timothy Leary! Film, oscilloscopes, stroboscopes, computerized, kinetic and live images. A visual feast." [...] Mekas, in his Village Voice column of spring 1966, interviewed Steve Durkee about USCO's use of strobe lights. Mekas asked, [...] "What is the strobe light all about?," [...] and Durkee replied, [...] "Strobe is the digital trip." [...] USCO's strobe environments, which relied on electronic modulation of fluorescent tubes, invoked the more complex emerging technology of the digital computer. Mekas also wrote about USCO in a 1966 review of their Riverside Museum show, comparing their work to the Exploding Plastic Inevitable and stating USCO went after the mystical experience in a more conscious way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first night}} {{was not as}} {{successful}} as the other Savoy opera premieres because of controversy over the title and the revivification of the ghosts, and reservations about the plot and music. [...] According to the St James's Gazette, [...] "The first act was well received by the audience. Number after number was rapturously encored, and every droll sally of dialogue was received with a shout of appreciative mirth." [...] The interval was long (a half hour) as the elaborate picture gallery needed to be set up, but D'Oyly Carte had anticipated this and had printed indulgence slips which were distributed. [...] It was marked by noisy <b>hubbub</b> when Lord Randolph Churchill was spotted in the crowd, but a loud shout of [...] "No politics!" [...] brought relative calm. [...] The second act, however, ended badly. [...] On 23 January 1887, under the heading [...] "Their First Flat Failure; The First Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Not a Success", The New York Times reported, [...] "When the curtain finally fell there was hissing – the first ever heard in the Savoy Theatre. [...] The audience even voiced sentiments in words and there were shouts and cries such as these: 'Take off this rot!' 'Give us The Mikado!'" [...] The paper added, [...] "(T)he name is decidedly against it." ...|$|E
60|$|Another <b>hubbub</b> {{threatened}} {{in the big}} tent. Some one yelled for quiet.|$|E
60|$|The {{conductor}} clanged the gong, and the {{two couples}} separated in a sudden <b>hubbub</b> of farewell.|$|E
60|$|Directly Miss Penfold {{had gone}} upstairs a <b>hubbub</b> of talk burst {{out from the}} female servants.|$|E
60|$|At {{once there}} was a <b>hubbub.</b> White Buffalo was the first to step to the trader's side.|$|E
60|$|Loud shouts {{were heard}} from the men above, and a <b>hubbub</b> of cries from the guard house.|$|E
60|$|A commotion at {{the front}} part of the train, more {{pronounced}} than the general <b>hubbub,</b> attracted their attention.|$|E
60|$|And {{then there}} arose a great <b>hubbub.</b> The {{ordinary}} <b>hubbub</b> at this spot {{is worse than}} the worst confusion of any other Babel. For the traffic over the Nile is great, and for every man, woman, and child, for every horse and every ass, for every bundle of grass, for every cock and for every hen, a din of twenty tongues is put in motion, and a perpetual fury rages, as the fury of a hurricane. But the <b>hubbub</b> about the missionary's piastres rose higher {{than all the other}} hubbubs. Indeed, those who were quarrelling before about their own affairs came and stood round in a huge circle, anxious to know how the noble reis and his clerical opponent would ultimately settle this stiff financial difficulty.|$|E
60|$|The village constable hurried up, {{his thin}} neck {{stretching}} {{out of his}} tunic, and demanded {{the cause of the}} <b>hubbub.</b>|$|E
60|$|These {{considerations}} {{made him}} a little anxious, and helped to keep his mind in the <b>hubbub</b> which has been mentioned.|$|E
60|$|At this moment, {{they noticed}} {{that there was a}} great <b>hubbub</b> in the camp. Half an hour later, the chiefs entered.|$|E
60|$|A <b>hubbub</b> followed, all {{speaking}} at once, until the King banged the table, and reminded them that his cabinet {{was not a}} fish-market.|$|E
60|$|The dog, with a {{satisfied}} air, sat down panting by his chair, listening quietly to the subdued <b>hubbub</b> which sounded from the companion.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the midst}} of this <b>hubbub</b> came the voice of Agnes through the hole: [...] "Oh, Mr. Cuthbert, what has happened? Are you alive?" ...|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's rather queer silence. The music {{rose above}} the <b>hubbub</b> of voices and died away again. Louise rose to her feet.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Julian gasped. If Spain {{made such}} a <b>hubbub</b> about the depredations of a runagate adventurer like Captain Blood, what could not England answer now? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{answer was}} a general <b>hubbub.</b> [...] "He surely will not sail in a sea like this?" [...] asked the {{trembling}} Captain of my companions.|$|E
60|$|And now {{such was}} the general <b>hubbub</b> {{provoked}} by these unprecedented prices that the dalal was forced to raise his voice and cry for silence.|$|E
60|$|FATHER BOURNE in the pulpit. A CROWD. MARCHIONESS OF EXETER, COURTENAY. The SIEUR DE NOAILLES and his man ROGER {{in front}} of the stage. <b>Hubbub.</b>|$|E
60|$|There {{was a great}} <b>hubbub,</b> in {{the midst}} of which Mr. Dodsworth {{consulted}} with Andrew Dale, who was assistant referee. Then Mr. Dodsworth came forward.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} explain to him that the cause of all the <b>hubbub</b> was a very {{remarkable}} and interesting echo, but he would not believe it.|$|E
60|$|An {{approximate}} silence followed, {{broken only}} by the mewing of a café cat and the <b>hubbub</b> and uproar of a few million citizens and transportation facilities outside.|$|E
60|$|She {{spoke in}} a whisper, trusting that in the general <b>hubbub</b> of the crowd her words would remain unheeded by all, save the man at her side.|$|E
60|$|The {{song of the}} men broke {{suddenly}} {{and there was a}} <b>hubbub</b> of many voices as he whirled the old woman roughly to her couch of skins.|$|E
6000|$|Chauvelin {{said nothing}} for the moment. He {{appeared}} wrapped in his own thoughts, listened {{for a while to}} the confused <b>hubbub</b> about the house, then he resumed abruptly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Citizen Carrier!" [...] cried Chauvelin {{at the top}} of his voice, {{trying to}} {{dominate}} the <b>hubbub,</b> [...] "one minute ... I have excellent news for you.... The English spy...." ...|$|E
60|$|Many groans and shrieks {{were heard}} below; {{then there was}} a sound of persons being carried out, and for awhile, quiet below, while outside the <b>hubbub</b> became greater.|$|E
60|$|Meantime, what a <b>hubbub</b> {{was raised}} by this scheme! Rub-a-dub-dub! Rub-a-dub-dub! The rattle of drums, beaten out of all manner of time, was heard above every other sound.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{no mistaking}} it. His voice, which his enemies said was his one {{parliamentary}} asset, silenced the <b>hubbub</b> as toothache silences mere singing in the ears. He said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blow me tight, Bill," [...] some vulgar little hedge-sparrow would chirp out, in {{the midst}} of the <b>hubbub,</b> [...] "if I don't believe the gent thinks 'e's a- singing." ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{ten feet}} in the lead, the black-haired one breasted the tape in a <b>hubbub</b> of cheers. Yet yells of disapproval could be distinguished. Bert hugged himself with joy.|$|E
