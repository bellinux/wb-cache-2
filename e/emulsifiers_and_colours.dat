40|$|Abstract. We have {{synthesized}} highly charged, crosslinked poly (styrene-co-divinylbenzene-co-sulfopropyl methacrylate) copolymer {{colloidal particles}} using emulsion polymerization. The effects of {{concentration of the}} <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> the initiator on the particle size and the charge density of the colloidal particles are studied. Colloidal particle size is highly dependent upon the concentration of the <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> the initiator. The col-loidal particle diameter decreases with increasing concentration of the <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> increases with increas-ing concentration of the initiator in the polymerization mixture. Number of particles, surface charge density and charges per particle are also functions of both the <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> the initiator concentration. The surface charge density {{and the number of}} charges per sphere increase with increasing particle diameter. These copolymer colloid particles self assemble readily and diffract visible light. Polymer hydrogel imbibed with these colloids shows the light diffraction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of pH of emulsified asphalt, the kinds <b>and</b> content of <b>emulsifiers</b> <b>and</b> stabilizers on asphalt-aggregate adhesion {{have been investigated}} in this paper.

Effect of emulsifiers on asphalt-aggregate adhesion is complex, the best dosage is at 0. 2 %. The addition of organic stabilizers are superior to inorganic stabilizers to improve the asphalt-aggregate adhesion, the best dosage is at 0. 4 %.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the influence of different emulsifiers or xanthan-emulsifier systems on the release of aroma compounds. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and GC-MS were used to study the effects of varying concentrations of xanthan gum, sucrose fatty acid ester, Tween 80 and soybean lecithin on the release of seven aroma compounds. The effects of the emulsifier systems supplemented with xanthan gum on aroma release were also studied in the same way. The results showed varying degrees of influence of sucrose fatty acid ester, soybean lecithin, Tween 80 and xanthan gum on the release of aroma compounds. Compared with other aroma compounds, ethyl acetate was more likely to be conserved in the solution system, while the amount of limonene released was the highest among these seven aroma compounds. In conclusion, different <b>emulsifiers</b> <b>and</b> complexes showed different surface properties that tend to interact with different aroma molecules. The present studies showed that the composition <b>and</b> structure of <b>emulsifiers</b> <b>and</b> specific interactions between <b>emulsifiers</b> <b>and</b> aroma molecules have significant effects on aroma release...|$|R

50|$|Incorporation is {{one thing}} that needs to be {{considered}} in formulation of SLN. Concentration of the lipid, <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> co-emulsifier solution is a key factor on this conversion of the SLN. If the amount of <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> co-emulsifier are increased but the lipid amount is constant the surface of the SLN which is formed will be too small to adsorb all the surfactant and co-surfactant molecules, and a formation of curcuminoids solution micelles will be created. This will then increase the water solubility of the curcuminoids and they could partition from the SLN into the micelles that were formed during a wash procedure. This will reduce the final incorporation efficacy {{on the surface of the}} SLN.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A feed {{production}} trial {{was conducted to}} study the effect of synthetic <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> natural biosurfactant the process and quality of pelletized broiler feed. A corn-soy based broiler diet was formulated with fixed ratio 2 : 1 of oil-to-water with two types of emulsifiers, namely glyceryl polyethylene glycol ricinoleate synthetic <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> lysophosphatidylcholine natural biosurfactant. T 1 : Basal diet with no water and no emulsifier; T 2 : Basal diet with water and no emulsifier; T 3 : Basal diet with water <b>and</b> synthetic <b>emulsifier</b> glyceryl polyethylene glycol ricinoleate; T 4 : Basal diet with water and a natural biosurfactant lysophosphatidylcholine as comparative treatment. The treatment diets were manufactured by a commercial feed mill. The electricity cost and meal temperature were measured {{during the process of}} milling. Composite samples were collected from different processed points, tested for physical properties, chemical stability and biostability of pelletized feed. Pellet quality of emulsifier supplemented diets was significantly (p< 0. 05) improved in crumble and pellet intact form. Correlation between <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> pelletize processed cost was not observed in this present study. No deteriorate effect was observed in hydrolytic rancidity (AV), oxidation rancidity (PV), mold count, moisture content and water activity. However, percentage of starch gelatinization on pelletized feed was significantly (p< 0. 0001) improved in both types of emulsifier treated diets. These results demonstrated that the addition of emulsifier to broiler diet improved pellet quality to some extent although significant difference between synthetic <b>emulsifier</b> <b>and</b> natural biosurfactant was not observed.
