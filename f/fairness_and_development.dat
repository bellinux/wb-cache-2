The Police and the media are two institutions that are aimed at ensuring that the society lives well based on lawful and orderly conduct in the interest of justice, <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> of the society. The two institutions require information from the public to perform their duties prudently and diligently. However, they differ in orientation, operational techniques, platforms and public perception. A typical scenario for instance, if there is an uprising, attack, disaster or any such unfortunate occurence, members of the public will be running to safer areas. It is common see the Police and the media are pushing their way forward into that ‘danger zone ’ to perform their individual responsibilities. Both the Police and the media depend on sources for information to facilitate their work, though they differ significantly in approaching the subject matter; thus the Police interrogate to get information, the journalist on the otherhand, interviews to secure information. It is undeniable fact that, the two institutions require each other in the performance of their responsibilities and therefore need to develop a harmonious and cordial relations. One fact is that the Police have bags of information that the media require, likewise, the Police require the visibility and bridge that the media provide to link them with the society in a positive manner {{in order to have a}} goodwill from the public.

Reformas que recambiam a noção de direito público à educação, ao conhecimento, à função do Estado, aos financiamentos, regidas pela agência Banco Mundial (BM). Nesse movimento, a terminologia sociedade do conhecimento emerge como fundamento epistemológico condicionando à universidade o papel de produtora de conhecimentos de valor econômico e de consenso. Mobiliza-se, assim, um conjunto de orientações e discursos de agentes nacionais e internacionais para darlegitimidade às reformas tornando a Educação Superior objeto crescente de disputa de mercados e de espaços de resolução de problemas da pobreza e do desenvolvimento. Analisamos documentos nacionais e internacionais e literaturas especializadas para compor nosso debate. Partimos de dados documentais buscando compreender oconjunto das orientações às políticas para o Ensino Superior e as implicações em termos de reformas no País. Defendemos a hipótese de que os conhecimentos são orientados para produzir consenso socialpor meio de discursos de equidade e desenvolvimento, discursos que encobrem a verdadeira natureza dasreformas que se caracterizam pelo monopólio do conhecimento e perpetuação da exclusão social. Palavras-chave: Conhecimento. Educação Superior. Reforma. Consenso. Abstract: The decade 90 and {{beginning}} of century XXI {{are marked by}} reforms that also reach the structures of the Brazilian State {{and with it the}} high education. Reforms that exchange again the notion of public law to the education, knowledge, the function of the State, financings, conducted for the World Bank agency. In this movement the terminology “society of the knowledge” emerges as conceptual bedding conditioning the university the paper of producer of knowledge of economic value and consensus. It is mobilized thus, a set of directions and speeches of national and international agents to give to legitimacy to the reforms becoming the high education increasing object of dispute of markets and space of resolution of problems of the poverty and the development. We analyze national and international documents and specialized literatures to compose our question. We leave of the documentary data searching to understand the set ofthe directions to the politics for high education and the implications in terms of reforms in the country.

40|$|Introduction: Companies {{today are}} forced to {{function}} in a world full of change and complexity, and {{it is more important}} than ever to have the right employees in order to survive the surrounding competition. It is a fact that a too high turnover rate affects companies in a negative way and retention strategies should therefore be high on the agenda. When looking at this problem area we found that there may be actions and tools that companies could use {{to come to terms with}} this problem. Research told us that leadership, remuneration and elements like participation, feedback, autonomy, <b>fairness,</b> responsibility, <b>development</b> <b>and</b> work-atmosphere is important for job satisfaction and retention. Object: The main objective is to increase the understanding regarding employee’s retention in relation to leadership style, remuneration and elements such as participation, feedback, autonomy, <b>fairness,</b> responsibility, <b>development</b> <b>and</b> work-atmosphere in the Swedish financial sector. Method: We wanted to investigate how employee of the Swedish financial sector prefers to be retained, and how they consider and react to the chosen areas. The survey has a quantitative approach with a web based questionnaire and includes 129 respondents from banks, insurance and finance companies. The theoretical framework includes leadership and leadership style, financial as well as non-financial remuneration and research done in later years regarding participation, feedback, autonomy, <b>fairness,</b> responsibility, <b>development</b> <b>and</b> work-atmosphere connected to retention. Conclusion: The result shows that regarding leadership the respondents prefer leadership based on relations were they feel appreciation. Both appreciations from the closest manager as well as the company management influences employee job satisfaction in a positive way. More money was the most common reason for wanting to change jobs, and when asking how the remuneration system should be designed, base pay with additional bonus and benefits were preferred. But also non financial factors such as participation, feedback, autonomy, <b>fairness,</b> responsibility, <b>development</b> <b>and</b> work-atmosphere must be taken in consideration to satisfy since they seem to increase employees’ willingness to stay in the company...|$|R

The literature on the measurement of line-up fairness began with the report by Doob and Kirschenbaum (1973) of their attempt to measure the bias contained in an identi®cation process brought to their attention by a defence attorney. The verbal description of the o€ender was extremely vague. She stated only that the criminal was `rather good looking'. The possibility existed that the witness had simply chosen the best-looking person from the line-up, whether he was the o€ender or not. To test this conjecture, Doob and Kirschenbaum gave the description of the criminal and a photograph of the line-up to a set of persons who had never seen the criminal. The...|$|R

40|$|In {{the setting}} of secure multiparty computation, a set of parties wish to compute a joint {{function}} of their private inputs. The computation should preserve security properties such as privacy, correctness, independence of inputs, <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery. In the case of no honest majority, <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery cannot always be obtained. Thus, protocols for secure multiparty computation are typically of two disparate types: protocols that assume an honest majority (and achieve all properties including <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery), and protocols that do not assume an honest majority (and achieve all properties except for <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery). In addition, in the two-party case, <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery are equivalent. As a result, the properties of fairness (which means that if corrupted parties receive output then so do the honest parties) and guaranteed output delivery (which means that corrupted parties cannot prevent the honest parties from receiving output in any case) have typically been {{considered to be the}} same. In this paper, we initiate a study of the relation between <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery in secure multiparty computation. We show that in the multiparty setting these proper-ties are distinct and proceed to study under what conditions fairness implies guaranteed output delivery (the opposite direction always holds). We also show the existence of non-trivial func-tions for which complete fairness is achievable (without an honest majority) but guaranteed output delivery is not, and the existence of non-trivial functions for which complete <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery are achievable. Our study sheds light on the role of broadcast in <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> guaranteed output delivery, and shows that these properties should sometimes be considered separately...|$|R

However, empirical research on ethical leader behaviour is limited and to date multilevel research is hardly found in this area. This study examines the relationships of two forms of perceived ethical leader behaviour (<b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> integrity and empowering behaviour) with subordinates' trust and commitment from a levels-of-analysis perspective, using within and between analysis (WABA). In total, 503 employees in 79 work groups rated their leader's <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> integrity and empowering behaviour. Trust in management and co-workers, and subordinates' affective, continuance, and normative organizational commitment were also measured. As expected, perceived ethical leader behaviour {{was positively related to}} trust as well as affective and normative commitment and negatively to continuance commitment. Perceived empowering behaviour was more strongly related to affective commitment than perceived <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> integrity. Perceptions of empowering behaviour in relation to trust and commitment vary both within and between groups. This suggests an individual differences perspective in which subordinates' views of empowering behaviour develop independently. <b>Fairness</b> <b>and</b> integrity shows several between-groups effects with limited within-group variation, suggesting that people within groups tend to share perceptions of leader's <b>fairness</b> <b>and</b> integrity.
