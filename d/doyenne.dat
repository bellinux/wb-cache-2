25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1830 Revolution, Gautier's family experienced hardship and was forced to move to the outskirts of Paris. Deciding to experiment with his own independence and freedom, Gautier chose to stay with friends in the <b>Doyenné</b> district of Paris, living a rather pleasant bohemian life.|$|E
25|$|Duke married twice, {{the first}} time in 1935 to James H. R. Cromwell, the son of Palm Beach society <b>doyenne</b> Eva Stotesbury. Cromwell, a New Deal {{advocate}} like his wife, used her fortune to finance his political career. In 1940 he served several months as U.S. Ambassador to Canada and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate. The couple had a daughter, Arden, who died one day after her birth. They divorced in 1943.|$|E

25|$|In 1907 the Archaeological Institute of America gave Hewett an {{additional}} platform, by establishing the School of American Archaeology, later the School of American Research, in Santa Fe. Hewett's friend Alice Fletcher, {{by then the}} <b>doyenne</b> of American archaeology, {{was one of the}} prime backers of the School; Hewett became its first director, a position he would hold until his death in 1946. The School would provide Hewett not only with a mouthpiece, but also a base for his increasingly professional (if still controversial) research activities and students and collaborators to do the work.|$|E
25|$|He went {{one better}} the {{following}} Sunday, winning the sprint {{of a small}} group of riders to impose himself on Liège–Bastogne–Liège. It was the third time in his career Valverde had won La <b>Doyenne.</b> It was also the second time that he had won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and La Flèche Wallonne in the same year, becoming only the second rider to have achieved this double twice, after Ferdinand Kübler. In June, he won the National Road Race Championship. At the Tour de France, Valverde finished on the podium in 3rd place, his first podium finish at the Tour; achieving a lifelong dream of a top 3 finish at le Tour. With that finish he has one career goal left, a World Championship.|$|E
500|$|After {{turning around}} at the Rond-point La <b>Doyenne</b> (named after the race itself), the peloton left Bastogne to the north-east.

Another fairly flat section followed: the route {{continued}} north for approximately [...] on fairly major roads through Gouvy and Vielsalm. At this point, with [...] to the finish line, there were still eight categorised climbs remaining.|$|E
500|$|The {{news that}} Streep {{would meet with}} Frankel was celebrated at Fox. But while Streep, for her part, knew the movie could be very successful, she felt the pay she was being offered for playing Miranda was [...] "slightly, if not insulting, not perhaps {{reflective}} of my actual value to the project." [...] The producers doubled it to around $4 million, and she signed on, allowing Fox to greenlight the film. According to Frankel, Streep saw the film {{as a chance to}} [...] "skewer the <b>doyennes</b> of the fashion world." [...] She has three daughters, and as an ardent feminist, felt that fashion magazines [...] "twisted the minds of young women around the world and their priorities. This was an interesting way to get back at them." [...] Also, she said, the film passed the Bechdel test.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt {{attitudes and behaviors}} toward those groups. According to Susan Douglas: [...] "Since the early 1990s, much of the media have come to overrepresent women as having made it-completely-in the professions, as having gained sexual equality with men, and having achieved a level of financial success and comfort enjoyed primarily by Tiffany's-encrusted <b>doyennes</b> of Laguna Beach." [...] These images may be harmful, particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. For example, a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of African American women often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter-skinned, thinner African American women (images African American women describe as objectifying). In a recent analysis of images of Haitian women in the Associated Press photo archive from 1994 to 2009, several themes emerged emphasizing the [...] "otherness" [...] of Haitian women and characterizing them as victims in need of rescue.|$|R
500|$|In 1727 Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan, {{bishop of}} Strasbourg since 1704 and {{cardinal}} since 1712, commissioned the architect Robert de Cotte {{to design the}} palace; deCotte provided initial plans the same year. Seven years prior, in 1720, Cardinal deRohan had already charged deCotte with renovation and embellishment works on his castle in Saverne, the predecessor of the current Rohan Castle. DeCotte had also previously designed the Hôtel du grand <b>Doyenné,</b> the first hôtel particulier in Louis Quinze style built in Strasbourg. The Palais Rohan {{was built on the}} site of the former residence of the bishop, the [...] "bishop's demesne", which is recorded since at least 1262. The area itself is near the heart of the ancient Argentoratum, first mentioned in 12BC. Diverse archaeological excavations on Place du Château, the square facing the palace, have unearthed many remains of the Roman camp.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David was the <b>doyenne</b> of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should {{be put in a}} dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.|$|E

2500|$|Volumes II and III of the History broadly {{followed}} the path prepared by Clark's earlier work and ideas. Volume II (launched in 1968) took {{the story to}} the 1830s, and dwelt on the conflicts between the colonial governors and their landowning allies with the emerging first generation of native-born white Australians, many of them the children of convicts. It prompted Russel Ward to praise Clark as [...] "the greatest historian, living or dead, of Australia". Even Leonie Kramer, <b>doyenne</b> of conservative intellectuals and {{closely associated with the}} Quadrant group, named Volume II as her [...] "book of the year". The appearance of Volume III in 1973 aroused little controversy – commentators of all political views apparently felt there was nothing new to say about Clark's work.|$|E
2500|$|For several decades, Gunness was {{allegedly}} seen {{in cities and}} towns throughout the United States. [...] A local delivery boy who had brought some groceries {{to the home of}} Elizabeth Smith, Gunness' closest friend in La Porte, three days after the fire at her farm, later said he saw Belle standing in Smith's kitchen. Terrified, he didn’t tell anyone for years, and his story was never verified. [...] Friends, acquaintances, and amateur detectives apparently spotted her on the streets of Chicago, San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. [...] As late as 1931, Gunness was reported alive and living in a Mississippi town, where she supposedly owned a great deal of property and lived the life of a <b>doyenne.</b> For more than 20 years, Smutzer received an average of two reports a month about alleged sightings. Gunness became part of American criminal folklore, a female Bluebeard.|$|E
6000|$|Dureau de la Malle {{states that}} the flowers on some trees of an ancient variety, the <b>doyenne</b> galeux, were {{destroyed}} by frost: other flowers appeared in July, which produced six pears; these exactly resembled in their skin and taste the fruit of a distinct variety, the gros <b>doyenne</b> blanc, but in shape were like the bon-chretien: it was not ascertained whether this new variety could be propagated by budding or grafting. The same author grafted a bon-chretien on a quince, and it produced, besides its proper fruit, an apparently new variety, of a peculiar form with thick and rough skin. (11/14. 'Comptes Rendus' tome 41 1855 page 804. The second case is given on the authority of Gaudichaud ibid tome 34 1852 page 748.) ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{of these}} gaps in Mrs. Assingham's {{completeness}} was her want of children; {{the other was}} her want of wealth. It was wonderful how little either, in the fulness of time, came to show; sympathy and curiosity could render their objects practically filial, just as an English husband who in his military years had [...] "run" [...] everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like the rose. Colonel Bob had, {{a few years after}} his marriage, left the army, which had clearly, by that time, done its laudable all for the enrichment of his personal experience, and he could thus give his whole time to the gardening in question. There reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend, almost too venerable for historical criticism, that the marriage itself, the happiest of its class, dated from the far twilight of the age, a primitive period when such things--such things as American girls accepted as [...] "good enough"--had not begun to be;--so that the pleasant pair had been, as to the risk taken on either side, bold and original, honourably marked, for the evening of life, as discoverers of a kind of hymeneal Northwest Passage. Mrs. Assingham knew better, knew there had been no historic hour, from that of Pocahontas down, when some young Englishman hadn't precipitately believed and some American girl hadn't, with a few more gradations, availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt; but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder, since she was in fact pretty well the <b>doyenne,</b> above ground, of her transplanted tribe, and since, above all, she HAD invented combinations, though she had not invented Bob's own. It was he who had done that, absolutely puzzled it out, by himself, from his first odd glimmer-resting upon it moreover, through the years to come, as proof enough, in him, by itself, of the higher cleverness. If she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should have full credit. There were moments in truth when she privately felt how little--striking out as he had done--he could have afforded that she should show the common limits. But Mrs. Assingham's cleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at last said to her: [...] "I don't think, you know, that you're treating me quite right. You've something on your mind that you don't tell me." ...|$|E
