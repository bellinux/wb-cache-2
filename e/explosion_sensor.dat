40|$|A {{standard}} problem in large tanks at oil refineries and petrol stations is that water and fuel usually occupy the same tank. This is undesirable and causes {{problems such as}} corrosion in the tanks. Normally, the water level in tanks is unknown, with the problems that this entails. We propose herein a method based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect in real time the interfaces in a tank which can simultaneously contain water, gasoline (or diesel) and air. The plasmonic sensor is composed of a hemispherical glass prism, a magnesium fluoride layer, and a gold layer. We have optimized the structural parameters of the sensor from the theoretical modeling of the reflectance curve. The sensor detects water-fuel and fuel-air interfaces and measures the level of each liquid in real time. This sensor is recommended for inflammable liquids because inside the tank there are no electrical or electronic signals which could cause <b>explosions.</b> The <b>sensor</b> proposed has a sensitivity of between 1. 2 and 3. 5 RIU− 1 and a resolution of between 5. 7 × 10 − 4 and 16. 5 × 10 − 4 RIU...|$|R

40|$|Large sensor {{networks}} in {{applications such as}} surveillance and virtual classrooms, {{have to deal with}} the <b>explosion</b> of <b>sensor</b> information. Coherent presentation of data coming from such large sets of sensors becomes a problem. Thus there is a need to summarize events while retaining the spatial relationship between sensors. Also, such systems are prone to routine failures influenced by hardware, software, or the environment. To recover from such failures, fault containment can be achieved by using redundant sensors. In this paper, we define Fault Containment Unit (FCU), which has built-in alternative actions in the event of failures. However, the combinatorial explosion of alternatives in large scale sensor networks dictates that the design of FCU is hard. Our strategy is to provide an augmented virtual reality interface to a human user by projecting the current state of the system, including camera orientation and objects being tracked, onto a virtual 3 D world. We present an interface that: (i) offers different levels of detail when presenting information to user, (ii) allows the user to maintain a good spatial sense during sensor transitions, (iii) enables the user to dynamically assemble Fault Containment Units in response to emergencies, (iv) adapts to the current bandwidth availability, (v) provides mobility to the user, and (vi) allows shared interaction among users by immersing them in the same virtual workspace. Finally, we demonstrate three scenarios highlighting the above mentioned features. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} {{summarizes}} prior work related to low frequency (< 100 Hz) EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse) observed from explosions. It focuses on how EMP signals might, or might not, {{be useful in}} monitoring underground nuclear tests, based on the limits of detection, and physical understanding of these signals. In summary: (1) Both chemical and nuclear explosions produce an EMP. (2) The amplitude of the EMP from underground explosions is at least two orders of magnitude lower than from above ground explosions and higher frequency components of the signal are rapidly attenuated due to ground conductivity. (3) In general, in the near field, that is distances (r) of less than 10 s of kilometers from the source, the amplitude of the EMP decays approximately as 1 /r{sup 3 }, which practically limits EMP applications to very close (<{approx} 1 km) distances. (4) One computational model suggests that the EMP from a decoupled nuclear explosion may be enhanced over the fully coupled case. This has not been validated with laboratory or field data. (5) The magnitude of the EMP from an underground nuclear explosion is about two orders of magnitude larger than that from a chemical explosion, and has a larger component of higher frequencies. In principle these differences {{might be used to}} discriminate a nuclear from a chemical <b>explosion</b> using <b>sensors</b> at very close (<{approx} 1 km) distances. (6) Arming and firing systems (e. g. detonators, exploding bridge wires) can also produce an EMP from any type of explosion.

New optical fibres of plastic materials, high core diameter up to 12. 6 mm transmit light with little attenuation in the visible spectrum but there is no an efficient and controlled way to extract the light during the fibre path. Side extracting fibres extracts all the light on 2 π angle so is not well suited for controlled lighting. In this paper we present an extraction system for mono-filament optical fibre which provides efficient and controlled light distribution. These lighting parameters can be controlled with an algorithm that set the position, depth and shape of the optical extraction system. The extraction system works by total internal reflection in the core of the fibre with high efficiency and low cost.

40|$|Abstract — Improvements in {{electronic}} and computer technologies have tiled the path for <b>explosion</b> of wireless <b>sensor</b> networks (WSN). A fundamental component of resource management in WSN is transmitter power control and an efficient power control technique {{is essential to}} support system quality and efficiency. The data transmitted from the sensor nodes is highly susceptible to error in a wireless environment which increases the transmit power. Error control coding (ECC) schemes can improve the system performance and {{has an impact on}} energy consumption. Further the adverse impacts caused by radio irregularities and fading increases the energy consumption and thereby reduces the WSN lifetime. To reduce the fading effects in wireless channel, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) scheme is utilised for sensor network. This paper proposes a power control solution considering Multivariate Interpolation Decoding RS (MIDRS) Code in Virtual MIMO (VMIMO) WSN using game theoretic approach. The game is formulated as a utility maximizing distributed power control game while considering the pricing function. VMIMO utilising space time block code (STBC) along with MIDRS code enables to achieve higher energy savings and longer network lifetime by allowing nodes to transmit and receive information jointly. The performance of the proposed power control scheme with MIDRS code for the virtual MIMO wireless sensor network is evaluated in terms of utility, power efficiency, energy consumption and network lifetime...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in electronic and computer technologies have {{paved the way}} for <b>explosion</b> of wireless <b>sensor</b> networks. Sensor network usually consists {{of a large number of}} ultra small autonomous devices. The resource constraint nature of these ultra small devices poses an immediate need for resource management. A fundamental component of resource management is transmitter power control and an efficient power control technique is essential to support system quality and efficiency in wireless sensor networks. The data transmitted from the sensor nodes is highly susceptible to error in a wireless environment which increases the transmit power. Error control coding (ECC) schemes can improve the system performance and has an impact on energy consumption as node energy is sturdily influenced by the modulation and error correction coding used. This paper proposes a power control solution for wireless sensor network (WSN) considering ECC in the analytical setting of a game theoretic approach. The game is formulated as a utility maximizing distributed power control game while considering the cost function and the existence of Nash equilibrium is studied. With the help of this equilibrium a distributed power control algorithm is devised. From the analysis it is evident that the system is power stable only if the nodes comply with certain transmit power. The utility of nodes employing ECC and without ECC is compared; the results show that the proposed algorithm employing ECC achieves the best response for the sensor nodes by consuming less power...|$|R
40|$|Seismic Tomography and Smoothing Filters Seismic Tomography is a {{technique}} used by geologists to map the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s crust. Seismic Tomography is an iterative process that develops a model based on travel times of waves from <b>explosion</b> sites to <b>sensors.</b> First, travel times are gathered by using shot points and sensors. Then an optimization process begins with an initial simple model (velocity increasing monotonically with depth), is used to predict the travel times. These predictions are compared to the observed travel times, and the model is refined {{so that it can}} better match the observed data until a satisfactory solution is found. A key component in tomography that takes a great amount of time is the smoothing process. Smoothing is when velocity perturbations are calculated and are spread throughout the model so the difference between the calculated model and observed data is decreased. Recent research has proposed an efficient smoothing algorithm called the Box Filter, or formally the Mean Filter. However, the downside is the simplicity results in need for more smoothing iterations. Our research focuses on developing an alternative and faster overall filter algorithm, the Tent Filter, which will give efficiency just as the mean filter but improve the quality output. An importance of using a Tent Filter is that it will give more weight to what is believed to have more importance, unlike the Box Filter, resulting in a reduced number of smoothing iterations. With the improvement of smoothing algorithms, models will be computed faster and with greater accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen years {{worth of}} Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data is {{presented}} {{and used to}} quantitatively assess processes occurring at Bezymianny. This andesitic volcano is one of Kamchatka's most dangerous volcanoes with 16 eruptions {{in the last decade}} that have dispersed ash into North Pacific air routes. All known episodes of increased activity for which data were available were detected in band 3 (3. 53 – 3. 93 μm) AVHRR thermal data. Twenty-three peaks {{can be seen in the}} data; nineteen peaks correspond to known explosions, while the remaining three peaks correspond to known phases of dome growth that were not believed to have been accompanied by explosive activity. Start and end dates of extrusive phases defined by the thermal data are presented. Repose times between phases of extrusion vary from four months to just over two and half years with an average of just less than a year. Using rank-order statistics a ‘maximum’ time interval between consecutive explosions of 1288 ± 170 days is determined; this could serve as a cut-off time for declaring the current dome-growth activity over. The calculated cumulative erupted volume (0. 28 km 3) and time-averaged extrusion rate (0. 6 m 3 s − 1) from 1993 to 2008 corresponds to values found at Bezymianny from 1956 to 1976, showing that the satellite-based methodology provides a good way of quantitatively assessing dome growth. Three different types of precursors to explosive behavior have been identified at Bezymianny: (1) values that cluster around the mode of the data set prior to explosion, potentially due to endogenous dome growth, (2) upward trends that commence 15 – 20 days prior to <b>explosion</b> and reach <b>sensor</b> saturation levels are due to significant extrusion, and (3) a gradual upward trend that starts 5 days prior to explosion, probably due to ramping up of extrusion. This work shows that retrospectively analyzing and modeling of a volcano's thermal signal provides increased insight into its characteristic behavior. The methods used in this paper can be used at other dome-building volcanoes around the world. The insights presented here can be used to improve monitoring capabilities to aid in providing early warnings to large explosions at Bezymianny...|$|R
