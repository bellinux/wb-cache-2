It is not certain, however, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians were speaking Arabic {{by the time the}} Ayyubids took power there.|$|E

He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>the</b> defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E

5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do}} with the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. In the 2010 Tour, any hors catégorie, first-, or second-category climb awarded double points <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last of the stage. In 2011, only the summit stage finishes awarded double points, specifically stages 12, 14, 18 and 19. Pre-race analysis speculated that the winner would be more likely, under this system, to be a general classification contender than in years past. This speculation proved accurate, as Samuel Sánchez, who finished sixth in the general classification, won the mountains classification, and the top three finishers in the general classification were in the top five of the mountains classification. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} the Forcade-Biaix branch is {{complicated}} by the publication of false information concerning its origins in several affluent publications on the topic of nobility in Prussia and Europe. The first known publication of such information was in 1767, about 80 years after immigration in Prussia. The same information was reproduced in various forms in publications {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. One can only speculate if the information was knowingly furnished as false, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> innocent result of confusing names that had been handed down verbally from two earlier generations already deceased. Claims published in the same publications that they held the rank of Marquis were, however, deliberately false.|$|E
25|$|A {{major issue}} {{at all levels}} was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's {{practice}} of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> former, Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his pager messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so {{what he said was}} irrelevant. And even if it was, it did not matter since the pager messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.|$|E

60|$|As usual we {{are driven}} back upon a {{literary}} judgment.

25|$|The band {{began its}} tour for One Hot Minute in Europe on September 27, 1995 and played 16 shows. A US tour was to follow but was {{postponed}} after Chad Smith broke his wrist. The band considered carrying {{on with the}} tour even at one point considering Jack Irons {{as a replacement for}} Smith but there just was not enough time to rehearse with anyone new and the dates were rescheduled for early 1996. The band spent most of 1996 playing shows in the United States and Europe. By 1997, for the first time, the band cancelled many shows. Most of this was again due to problems within the band. Flea at that point was exhausted, tired of playing the same songs each night and was seriously talking about quitting the band while Kiedis had recently been involved in a motorcycle accident which left one arm in a sling and created yet another drug relapse due to his use of painkillers. Even Navarro was back to using drugs. 1997 saw the band playing just one show. This was at the very first Fuji Rock Festival on July 26, 1997. A massive typhoon hit that day but the band played anyway. They played through an 8-song set before having to cut the show short due to the storm. This would be the final show with Navarro and due to Flea's previous comments left many speculating <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> end of the band.|$|E

500|$|Guy Hamilton {{was invited}} to direct, but {{considered}} himself worn out and [...] "creatively drained" [...] after the production of Goldfinger. Terence Young, director {{of the first two}} Bond films, returned to the series. Coincidentally, when Saltzman invited him to direct Dr. No, Young expressed interest in directing adaptations of Dr. No, From Russia with Love and Thunderball. Years later, Young said Thunderball was filmed [...] "at the right time", considering that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first film in the series, the low budget (Dr. No cost only $1 million) would not have yielded good results. Thunderball was the final James Bond film directed by Young.|$|E

500|$|Another theory {{connected}} the video to popular electronic musician Skrillex. In May, when the video had first been posted to the Internet, he released {{a song called}} [...] "Red Lips". Shortly after Krahbichler's original post, he tweeted [...] "#REDLIPS #REDLIPS #REDLIPS". It was speculated {{that it could be}} viral marketing for his work—other musicians in that genre have been known to hide images in spectrograms—or from some CDs of unreleased work that he said had been stolen from his hotel room. But <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> former possibility, Krahblicher noted, [...] "the problem is that the hints towards the works being promoted are fairly weak".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad {{reported}} that this episode {{was an odd}} one produced by the show. [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> off-balance tone the episode had because {{two of the three}} plots took place outside, but it just wasn't as good as most episodes." [...] Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student called Jenna and Kenneth's plot a travesty, commenting that the two along with Grammer scamming Carvel was [...] "diabolical, and definitely not funny enough to justify the horribleness". In regards to the episode, itself, Sanders wrote that it was [...] "mostly awful".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for PopMatters, music critic Tim O'Neil called the song [...] "an odd track" [...] that [...] "doesn't really sound like {{anything}} [...] ever heard before." [...] He continued: [...] "I wouldn't be surprised <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> next single , because its [...] {{not the kind}} of track you forget." [...] John Bush from AllMusic listed the track as one of his album track picks while Michaelangelo Matos from Spin called it one of the album's best moments that were [...] "less about the successive climaxes than steady-state flow." [...] Jack Smith from BBC Music described the song as [...] "cutting edge" [...] and [...] "hook-laden", while highlighting it as [...] "a welcome return" [...] for Burgess.|$|E

500|$|The Undiscovered Countrys cast {{includes}} the final group {{appearance of the}} main actors from the original television series. Casting director Mary Jo Slater loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by Christian Slater, her son, as an Excelsior officer; Cinefantastique considered the cameo a likely attempt to lure younger audiences. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup. Producer Ralph Winter said, [...] "We were not {{looking for someone to}} say 'Okay, I'll do it', but people who were excited by the material [...] and would treat it as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> biggest picture ever being made." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1839, Januário da Cunha Barbosa and Araújo Porto-Alegre, {{on behalf}} of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute (IHGB), {{undertook}} the first official study of the structure. They later published an article entitled [...] "Relatório Sobre a Inscrição da Gávea" [...] ("The Report on the Inscription of Gávea") in the which they examined the markings more closely. Barbosa and Porto-Alegre argued that there were only two viable hypotheses that could explain the markings: either that [...] "the inscription was made by ancient people who landed on the Brazilian coast, or it was the result of mere chance."
