40|$|Field {{measurements}} of wave overtopping over a rubble mound breakwater {{have been carried}} out at Zeebrugge, Belgium, during the period 1999 - 2003. The overtopping volumes of water are collected in an overtopping tank located on the breakwater crest behind the access road. A short side of the tank is made of a weir, allowing the collected water to flow out continuously, and allowing measurements to be made for long duration. Calculation of the inflow discharge is based on the outflow discharge over the weir and the volume in the tank. This calculation requires an accurate measurement of the water depth inside the tank. The water depth is measured indirectly using a pressure sensor near the bottom. The measurement setup for wave overtopping at the breakwater is described in detail. Eight-wave records with wave propagation normal to the breakwater have been used in the analysis of the field data. Wave heights range between 2. 6 and 3. 9 in (i. e., up to 63 % of the design wave height) for wave records with a typical duration of 1 - 2 h. The measured average overtopping rate q has been determined for all records using three methods (q< 1 l/s m). Average overtopping rates from the field data have been compared with predicted values from prediction formulae by van der Meer et al. [van der Meer, J. W., Tonjes, P., de Waal, H., 1998.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the optimal design of gender pay equity regulation in Australian labour law. The examination is {{framed by a}} weakening in Australia’s gender pay equity performance since the industrial breakthroughs of 1969 and 1972, an outcome at odds with a policy apparatus that directs {{more attention to the}} needs of women in waged labour. This inquiry is advanced by a case study <b>examination</b> of industrial <b>proceedings</b> that provide a unique opportunity to assess three stages of pay equity reform: the adoption of federal equal pay principles in 1969 and 1972; a legislative entitlement to equal remuneration, introduced to federal labour law in 1993; and distinct initiatives developed in two state industrial jurisdictions. The project of gender pay equity reform in Australia, following the end of the long post-war boom, has been accompanied by a series of competing discourses. This has comprised both a right to equal remuneration and a series of institutional arrangements and relationships that compromise this right. The basis of Australia’s class settlement has been recast in favour of capital {{in a way that is}} prejudicial to gender pay equity being achieved. In this brave new world capital remains resistant to revaluing the price of feminised labour. Thus this recast settlement has gendered consequences which are evident also in the masculinist construction of labour law institutions and their processes. It is these dimensions that underpin the resistance to redressing the institutional and cultural determinants of rates of pay and the weakness of measures directed nominally to this task. If federal labour law is to be effective, the right to equal remuneration for work of equal value is a key starting point and remains an important foundation in capturing feminist claims on the state and the market. It requires accompanying institutional measures that enable examination and remedy of the undervaluation of women’s waged labour and which do not necessarily test the validity of those rates of pay through reference to embedded, masculinised norms and practices. It was measures akin to these that emerged from developments in state jurisdictions, developments that were swept away by the latest phase of neo-liberal reform. To enable collective and aggregate reform the right to equal remuneration needs to be conjoined to wage determination in industry settlements...|$|R

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 186, item 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act the polvgraph examination is a separate activitv within the police proceedings which differs from the activitv called information gathering. The Article 46 of the Police Act allows for the polvgraph examinations of persons outside the criminal investigation in cases of reported missing persons, suspicious death and the like. The paper introduces the distinction between the adequacy and sufficiencv of the legal regulation of polvgraph examinations as criminal investigation activitv which would guarantee the correct usage of polvgraph during preliminarv investigation proceedings, after it has been explained and accepted that the polvgraph examinations can be used by the police as an efficacious supportive device in criminal investigation.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{introduction}} to The Proceedings of the Provisional Government Meetings Vol 2 - 3 (1 to 16 June 1948) and gives a review of its main contents, the Arab question. As a follow-up to my previous papers published in this journal in March 2014 and March 2015, it is also {{intended to be a}} preliminary step toward revisiting the formative years of Israel, this time focusing on the first half of June 1948. It was during this time that the United Nations Security Council resolution of the First Truce (11 June to 8 July) was accepted by the Israeli provisional government, that various problems surrounding the Truce were seriously discussed, and most importantly, that a consensus crystallized in the cabinet meeting on 16 June 1948 about a possibility of change in Israeli borders designated in the United Nations Partition Resolution of 29 November 1947 and a policy of blocking the repatriation of Palestinian Arab refugees. A close <b>examination</b> of the <b>proceedings</b> brings us to the following two main conclusions. First, as far as these two weeks are concerned, any {{answer to the question of}} whether an expulsion policy existed belongs to a grey zone due to the fact that numerous parts of the proceedings were censored. Second, the cabinet meeting on 16 June 1948 was a turning point not in policies, as the traditional wisdom suggests, but in political thinking. As to the policies, the consensus crystallized on 16 June was virtually a logical extension of previous cabinet meetings. However, what Shertok, Ben- Gurion, and Zisling said respectively in their lengthy speeches about the justification for blocking the return of refugees did, in fact, become the official view of history adopted by Israeli governments, right or left, for more than half a century when denying refugees’ right of return. "Palestinian Arabs," according to this official view, "became refugees voluntarily of their own will; they just fled and abandoned their villages. Therefore, Israelis are not responsible whatsoever for their becoming refugees. " This historical view, which over time became the national narrative, was for the first time publicly and extensively narrated and shared among the top echelon of the Israeli government on 16 June. At the same time, the concept of a "civil state," which was still a viable option for the provisional government until the end of May 1948, waned and collapsed, while territorial "Judaization" rapidly became a top political priority during the First Truce, when "abandoned" Arab villages were demolished and new Jewish settlements were built on those same sites on a massive scale. The cabinet meeting on 16 June 1948 was crucial, in retrospect, in that it became the watershed of Israeli national political thinking by precipitating the eventual crystallization of nationally-held historical views concerning the justification for Palestinians’ loss of homeland...|$|R
40|$|The 1928 law of {{criminal}} procedure previously regulating proceedings {{in cases of}} juveniles did not clearly define the judicial status of parents and guardians in that proceedings. The scope of rights of those persons {{was considered to be}} narrow. They were supposed to be summoned before a court, provided that the service of the documents was not creating particular difficulties. Yet, the court was entitled to demand the obligatory appearance at the hearing, in case of evading that obligation coercive measures provided for witnesses were applied. At the trial, those persons wese vested with the right to make statements and motions. The new act of Oct, 26, 1982 bestowed those persons with the status of litigant parties and extended their rights in a considerable way. The rights of parents and guardians as parties in litigation are autonomous, resulting from the fact of a defined consanguinity or from excercising a guardianship upon a juvenile, established judicially or existing factually. They are not resulting from the statutory representation of a juvenile. Parents and guardians as the litigant parties act in their own name and not {{in the name of a}} juvenile, they do not also have to act on his behalf although they usually do so, the results of their acts do not have to concern a juvenile, as parents and guardians can act in the proceedings in their own favor. It is a different question that usually there is a commutation observed m the roles of a litigant party and a statutory representative of a juvenile whose case is under trial. Applying new judicial provisions is not simple though, as the judicial status of parents and guardiand as the litigant parties is presently determined by the three normative acts. Apart of the mentioned act of 1982 on proceedings in cases of juveniles the regulations provided in Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure has also to be applied. Provisions of civil law procedure of nonlitigious mode are employed in case of <b>examination</b> and clarification <b>proceedings,</b> in guardian's and educational proceedings, in cases of applying medical and educational measures and partly in appeal proceedings. But if the evidence taking acts are performed by the Citizens' Militia provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure must be applied then, irrespectively of the stage and mode of the proceedings. Provisions of that Code also apply in reformatory proceedings and partly in appeal proceedings if the decision of reformatory measure is being appealed against or if the appeal demands applying that measure, as well as in criminal proceedings when it is conducted against a juvenile on exceptional bases in cases defined in the act. The detailed discussion of the scope of rights and obligations of parents and guardians in the proceedings in cases of juveniles as well as various complexities observed in the new regulation can be found in the published article. The author discusses, among the other things, the acceptable direction of parents' and guardians' acts in the proceedings in cases of juveniles, concurrence with the status of injured party, measures to be applied directly to the parents as eg. imposition of a duty to redress the damage, caused by a juvenile, burdening with costs of the proceedings, etcDigitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
