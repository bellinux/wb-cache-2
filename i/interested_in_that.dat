5|$|In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth {{mission to}} Moscow {{to propose a}} union with the Russian state, {{patterned}} after the Polish–Lithuanian Union, with the boyars granted rights comparable {{with those of the}} Commonwealth's nobility. A decision on a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current king or tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged in negotiations with Charles of Sweden, wasn't <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge. Chairs were {{pulled up to the}} ledge and food was served from bowls floating on the water. It was sheltered by a wisteria-covered arbor supported by 12 stone piers. In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation to reforest some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> species since it was the dominant tree in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 he {{presented}} his cableway in Switzerland, a country very <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> transport owing to its geography {{and which was}} already coming to use cable cars for bulk transport, but Torres's project was dismissed, allowing certain ironic commentary from the Swiss press. In 1907, Torres constructed the first cableway suitable for the public transportation of people, in Monte Ulía in San Sebastián. The problem of safety was solved {{by means of an}} ingenious system of multiple support cables. The resulting design was very strong and perfectly resisted the rupture of one of the support cables. The execution of the project was the responsibility of the Society of Engineering Studies and Works of Bilbao, which successfully constructed other cableways in Chamonix, Rio de Janeiro, and elsewhere. But it is doubtless the Spanish Aerocar in Niagara Falls in Canada which has gained the greatest fame in this area of activity, although from a scientific point of view it was not the most important. The cableway of 580 meters in length is an aerial cable car that spans the whirlpool in the Niagara Gorge on the Canadian side, constructed between 1914 and 1916, a Spanish project from beginning to end: devised by a Spaniard, constructed by a Spanish company with Spanish capital (The Niagara Spanish Aerocar Co. Limited); a bronze plaque, located on a monolith at the entrance of the access station recalls this fact: Spanish aerial ferry of the Niagara. Leonardo Quevedo Torres (18521936). It was inaugurated in tests on 15 February 1916 and was officially inaugurated on 8 August 1916, opening to the public the following day; the cableway, with small modifications, continues to run to this day, with no accidents worthy of mention, constituting a popular tourist and cinematic attraction.|$|E

Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> because they said that 1992 was ISY.

500|$|In 1986, the {{character}} of Nancy Drew was used in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, which lasted until 1997. The Nancy of the Files series is also interested in romance and boys, a fact which led to much criticism of the series: [...] "Millie [...] purists tend to look askance upon the Files series, in which fleeting pecks bestowed on Nancy by her longtime steady, Ned Nickerson, give way to lingering embraces in a Jacuzzi." [...] Cover art for Files titles, such as Hit and Run Holiday (1986), reflects these changes; Nancy is often dressed provocatively, in short skirts, shirts that reveal her stomach or breasts, or a bathing suit. She is often pictured with an attentive, handsome male in the background, and frequently appears aware of and <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> male. Nancy also becomes more vulnerable, being often chloroformed into unconsciousness, or defenseless against chokeholds. The books place more emphasis on violence and character relationships.|$|E
500|$|In several {{interviews}} {{around the}} release, Carter {{said that if}} the X-Files: I Want to Believe film proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the ninth-season finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but did not know if he would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X-Files film is [...] "looking pretty good". As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 10–13, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying “If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> then I guess that's what it would be.” ...|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} partially by Foote's nephew, who struggled {{to succeed in}} the country music business. Foote was initially interested in writing a film based on his nephew's efforts to organize a band, which he saw as paralleling his own youthful attempts to find work as an actor. During his research, however, he met an experienced musician who had offered to help his nephew's band, and Foote found himself growing more interested in a story about him, rather than the band itself. Foote said, [...] "This older man had been through it all. As I thought about a storyline, I got very <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> type of character." [...] The moment in the film where a woman asks, [...] "Were you really Mac Sledge?" [...] and he responds, [...] "Yes ma'am, I guess I was," [...] was based on an exchange that Foote overheard between a washed-up star and a fan. Foote said the entire film pivots on that statement, which he believed spoke volumes about Mac's personality and former status.|$|E
500|$|Peter Buck's {{style of}} playing guitar has {{been singled out}} {{by many as the}} most {{distinctive}} aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's [...] "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" [...] style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American folk rock band The Byrds. Buck has stated [...] " [...] Roger McGuinn was a big influence on me as a guitar player", but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including Big Star and The Soft Boys, that inspired him more. Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of Johnny Marr of alternative rock contemporaries The Smiths. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr, whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M. Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, [...] "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it." [...] Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by Paul McCartney of The Beatles and Chris Squire of Yes; Mills has said, [...] "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways [...] [...] [...] I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the kick drum, root note bass work." [...] Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said [...] "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Littlemore {{was born}} on 6 May 1978 in Sydney and was raised in Wahroonga with his older brothers, James (later a music video director) and Sam Littlemore (born February 1975, later a {{musician}} and producer). In 2011 Littlemore recalled, [...] "y parents didn't push us but led us towards creative endeavours. Early on, my brothers and I were naturally <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that.</b> In school holidays we were doing pottery classes or life drawing. I wasn't very sporty".

2500|$|After {{taking a}} five-month break from writing and touring, the Wallflowers {{set out to}} make their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan was very diligent in the songwriting process; he rented a studio near his home and would {{routinely}} go there to write songs for the album. [...] However, Dylan was not satisfied with the first batch of songs he came up with. [...] He decided to scrap them and start over. [...] The songs that did make it to the studio were considered to be far more personal than any of the songs the Wallflowers had released in the past. [...] Dylan explained; [...] "I think all my songs are personal, but I just made them a little more dense before, made 'em real thick so that I didn't feel exposed. A lot of younger writers do that. [...] Before, I haven't really wanted anybody buying my records looking for information about myself or my family, but at this point, the group has a lot of people buying the records who aren't <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that,</b> so it gives me more freedom." [...] By the end of 1999, the Wallflowers were ready to begin recording. [...] The bulk of the album was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles. [...] The Wallflowers' longtime manager, Andrew Slater co-produced the album with Michael Penn. [...] The band took their time in the studio. [...] Like Bringing Down the Horse, (Breach) took about eight months to record. [...] (Breach) also featured an array of guest artists including Elvis Costello, Mike Campbell and Frank Black.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{was known}} for his {{technical}} ability, speed, acceleration, dribbling and vision, possessing an awareness of his teammates' positions as an attack unfolded. Despite his unimpressive stature and strength, Cruyff's tactical brain and reading of the game were exceptional. “Football consists of different elements: technique, tactics and stamina,” he told the journalists Henk van Dorp and Frits Barend, in one of the interviews collected in their book Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff. [...] "There are some people who might have better technique than me, and some may be fitter than me, but the main thing is tactics. With most players, tactics are missing. You can divide tactics into insight, trust and daring. In the tactical area, I think I just have more than most other players." [...] On the concept of technique in football, Cruyff once said: [...] "Technique is not being able to juggle a ball 1,000 times. Anyone can do that by practising. Then you can work in the circus. Technique is passing the ball with one touch, with the right speed, at the right foot of your team mate." [...] As Van Basten noted, “Johan is so technically perfect that even as a boy he stopped being <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> aspect of the game. He could do everything when he was 20. That’s why he’s been very interested in tactics since he was very young. He sees football situations so clearly that he was always the one to decide how the game should be played.” In 1997, Dutch journalist Hubert Smeets wrote, [...] "Cruyff was the first player who understood that he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sports." [...] Sports writer David Miller believed Cruyff superior to any previous player in his ability to extract the most from others. He dubbed him [...] "Pythagoras in boots" [...] for the complexity and precision of his passes and wrote, [...] "Few have been able to exact, both physically and mentally, such mesmeric control on a match from one penalty area to another." ...|$|E
