Patients and methodsThe study included 120 Egyptian RA patients and 120 healthy controls that were genotyped for the three SNPs by real time/polymerase chain reaction for the first SNP and restriction fragment length polymorphism/PCR (RFLP/PCR) {{in the last two}} SNPs. The disease activity score (DAS 28) was assessed in the patients. ResultsThe studied patients had a mean age of 42. 5 ± 13. 4 years, a disease duration of 5. 2 ± 3. 5 years and consisted of 22 males and 98 <b>females.</b> <b>Joint</b> deformities were present in 35 and 66 patients had swollen joints. The rheumatoid factor (RF) was positive in 78. 3 % and the DAS 28 was 3. 2 ± 1. 2. Our data emphasize that the AA genotype of rs 11209026 was significantly associated with RA patients compared to the controls (p= 0. 001). We did not find any significant association between either rs 2201841 or rs 10889677 and the development of RA (p= 1, p= 0. 56 respectively). The AA allele in the 3 SNPs were remarkable frequent in those with deformities and positive RF. ConclusionOur results suggest that IL 23 receptor AA genotype variant of rs 11209026 contributes to the aetiology of RA and may be considered a genetic marker and shared the susceptibility gene. We need to address the subgroup of patients who will benefit from the selective suppression of the IL- 23 signalling which would represent new perspectives towards a personalized therapy of RA patients by further studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the influence of sex, age and individual physical and occupational factors on the distribution of radiographic features of hip joint osteoarthritis (OA), and to determine the inter-relationships between the primary radiographic OA discriminator of reduced joint space width (JSW), and secondary radiographic OA features. MethodThe study was a cross-sectional survey. Radiologic features of hip OA were recorded from standardized, standing pelvic radiographs of 3686 subjects (1397 M/ 2289 F). OA features were investigated for inter-relationships and correlations to age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and occupational exposure to repeated lifting. ResultsOverall, subchondral sclerosis, cysts and osteophytes were more frequently recorded in male hip <b>joints</b> compared to <b>female</b> hip <b>joints,</b> while a decrease in minimum JSW by age was more pronounced and progressive in women after the fifth decade compared to men. Applying logistic regression analyses, only age was found to be significantly associated to pathologically reduced minimum JSW (cut off value set at ≤ 2. 0 mm), and the presence of osteophytes and subchondral cysts in both sexes (P ranging from 0. 00 to 0. 03). Minimum JSW ≤ 2. 0 mm was recorded in 105 male hip joints, and in 167 <b>female</b> hip <b>joints.</b> In these joints, subchondral cysts, osteophytes and sclerosis were found to be significantly inter-related to minimum JSW ≤ 2. 0 mm according to logistic regression analysis. The presence of subchondral cysts had the highest predictive sensitivity in regard to pathologically reduced minimum JSW compared to subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes. ConclusionsWe believe that an accurate radiologic case definition of hip OA will rest on a combination of features. Only studies of the distribution of features, singularly and in combination, applied to clinically evaluated large cohorts may provide the optimum answer to the best possible clinical case definition of hip OA...|$|R
40|$|Arthropathy is an invalidating {{complication}} of acromegaly, also in long-term controlled patients, and is radiographically characterized by osteophytes and preserved joint spaces. However, joint space narrowing (JSN) is {{observed in the}} minority of patients. It is unknown whether JSN is the end-stage of acromegalic arthropathy or whether this feature develops independently of acromegaly. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of acromegalic arthropathy, and, more specifically, {{in the process of}} JSN, risk factors for radiographic JSN were studied in a cross-sectional study. We studied hips and knees of 89 well-controlled acromegaly patients (mean age 58. 3 yr, 51 % <b>female).</b> <b>Joints</b> were divided into two groups based on the presence of JSN, defined as an Osteoarthritis Research Society (OARSI) score ≥ 1. Potential risk factors for JSN were assessed, and its relationship to joint complaints. Individual knees and hips were analyzed in a Generalized Estimating Equations model, adjusted for age, sex, BMI and intra-patient effect. In controlled acromegaly, JSN was found in, respectively, 10. 3 % and 15. 4 % of the hips and knees. Increasing age and female sex were associated with more JSN; acromegaly-specific risk factors for JSN were joint-site specific. In the hip, JSN was related to more active disease: higher pre-treatment GH/IGF- 1, longer and more severe GH exposure and immediate postoperative cure was less frequently achieved. In the knee, especially previous knee surgery, not acromegaly-specific characteristics, was associated with JSN. The presence of JSN was associated with more joint complaints. JSN is an infrequent finding in patients with acromegalic arthropathy, but it is associated with more symptoms. This study indicates that, at least in the hip, early and ongoing GH/IGF- 1 activity play a role in JSN developmen...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- This paper {{describes}} a three part analysis {{to characterize the}} interaction between the female upper extremity and a helicopter cockpit side airbag system and to develop dynamic hyperextension injury criteria for the <b>female</b> elbow <b>joint.</b> Part I involved a series of 10 experiments with an original Army Black Hawk helicopter side airbag. A 5 th percentile female Hybrid III instrumented upper extremity was used to demonstrate side airbag upper extremity loading. Two out of the 10 tests resulted in high elbow bending moments of 128 Nm and 144 Nm. Part II included dynamic hyperextension tests on 24 <b>female</b> cadaver elbow <b>joints.</b> The energy source was a drop tower utilizing a three-point bending configuration to apply elbow bending moments matching the previously conducted side airbag tests. Post-test necropsy showed that 16 of the 24 elbow joint tests resulted in injuries. Injury severity ranged from minor cartilage damage to more moderate joint dislocations and severe transverse fractures of the distal humerus. Peak elbow bending moments ranged from 42. 4 Nm to 146. 3 Nm. Peak bending moment proved to be a significant indicator of any elbow injury (p = 0. 02) as well as elbow joint dislocation (p = 0. 01). Logistic regression analyses were used to develop single and multiple variate injury risk functions. Using peak moment data for the entire test population, a 50 % risk of obtaining any elbow injury was found at 56 Nm while a 50 % risk of sustaining an elbow joint dislocation was found at 93 Nm for the female population. These results indicate that the peak elbow bending moments achieved in Part I are associated with a greater than 90 % risk for elbow injury. Subsequently, the airbag was re-designed in an effort to mitigate this a...|$|R

50|$|The {{specific}} Kaltenborn {{mobilization of}} posterior-anterior gliding with distraction in grade 3 of the CMC joint; the Convex/Concave Rule was applied in each case. In brief, Kaltenborn described these mechanics {{in terms of}} the convex-concave rule; the direction of decreased joint gliding in a hypomobile joint and, thus, the appropriate treatment can be deduced by this rule. With movement of a concave joint partner, the glide occurs in the same direction. The form of the joint surface has been considered to induce its gliding/sliding movement; a <b>female</b> (concave) <b>joint</b> surface glides {{in the same direction as}} the bone movement, whereas a male (convex) surface glides in the opposite direction of the bone movement. Traction is the technique that distracts 1 articular surface perpendicular to the other, and the glide technique describes the translational gliding of 1 articular surface parallel to the other. Traction in grade 3 has been defined as an additional force, which is applied in the parallel axis. This results in surrounding soft tissues and joint stretching, separating the joint surfaces.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} heterogeneous {{impacts of}} gendered household headship {{and control of}} resources on food security in rural Tanzania (as measured by a World Food Programme score based on {{quantity and quality of}} food consumed in the household over a 7 day period). Analysis with minimal attention to heterogeneity in gender considerations indicates no differences in household food security between male and female-headed households. But with a more differentiated household headship variable (reflecting heterogeneity in household composition) and accounting for gendered differences in resource ownership, the results differ markedly. Using more gender-disaggregated variables, our results show significant differences between female-headed and male-headed households. In these results we find support for the claim that gender norms in the study villages often restrict women’s access to resources, resulting in more vulnerable female-headed households. Female-headed households with no male adults present are particularly vulnerable. The study also points to specific opportunities for enhanced food security with attention to <b>female</b> and <b>joint</b> ownership of livestock. These results represent a hopeful sign that efforts to enhance female livestock ownership could be a useful strategy to address lower levels of food consumption in these Tanzanian villages.
