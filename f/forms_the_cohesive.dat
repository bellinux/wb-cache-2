40|$|Sentences in a well-formed text are {{connected}} to each other via various links to <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>cohesive</b> structure of <b>the</b> text. Current neural machine translation (NMT) systems translate a text in a conventional sentence-by-sentence fashion, ignoring such cross-sentence links and dependencies. This may lead to generate an incohesive and incoherent target text for a cohesive and coherent source text. In order to handle this issue, we propose a cache-based approach to document-level neural machine translation by capturing contextual information either from recently translated sentences or the entire document. Particularly, we explore two types of caches: a dynamic cache, which stores words from the best translation hypotheses of preceding sentences, and a topic cache, which maintains a set of target-side topical words that are semantically related to the document to be translated. On this basis, we build a new layer to score target words in these two caches with a cache-based neural model. Here the estimated probabilities from the cache-based neural model are combined with NMT probabilities into the final word prediction probabilities via a gating mechanism. Finally, the proposed cache-based neural model is trained jointly with a state-of-the-art neural machine translation system in an end-to-end manner. On several NIST Chinese-English translation tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed cache-based model achieves substantial improvements over several state-of-the-art SMT and NMT baselines.

40|$|The growing role of {{communication}} using computers in people’s everyday lives is {{reflected by the}} debates about massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMOs) like World of Warcraft and the Internet as a whole. While people may be driven by the same psychological drives that have spurred interaction between people in the past, this interaction is increasingly facilitated {{with the use of}} computer mediated communication (CMC). Can strong relations form between people that are separated by great distances in space using CMC? The presence of strong relations in MMOs could open the possibility for MMO communities to thrive. A social network analysis of a MMO guild with 50 members was conducted using an online survey, which produced a non-response rate of 50 percent. Participants were asked about their age, the time they had spent in the guild and their gender in order to explain the social structure of the networks.

The social network analysis program Pajek was used to investigate the characteristics of the social network using so called sociograms.

40|$|International audienceModeling the {{fracture}} of a material can take two different approaches. A first solution consists in using models which preserve a continuous {{description of the}} material throughout {{the fracture}} process. These models are often regularized {{in order to deal}} with the softening part of the material's behavior properly. Another solution consists in introducing discontinuity surfaces into the structure along with the possibility of taking into account <b>cohesive</b> forces between <b>the</b> two sides of the discontinuity. Many works have been devoted to the establishment of a relation between these two families of models. The present work is based on the equivalent crack concept, which states that a localized damage zone can be replaced by a crack as long as the energy dissipated by the structure is preserved when switching models. In a first paper, we introduced a method of construction of a cohesive law based on an elastic-damageable reference model. For a given test case, <b>the</b> <b>cohesive</b> model was built incrementally from the known solution given by the continuous reference model.

40|$|Recent {{discovery}} of perfect two-dimensional crystals [1] revealed {{a new way}} for obtaining the strong materials. The conventional wisdom dictates that the rise in a material hardness {{can be achieved by}} the increase in the internal energy density by transition to the high mass density phase state with shorter bond length under high pressure-temperature conditions. In 2 D crystals the transition to high modulus state occurs in seemingly counter-intuitive way by the diminishing the effective volume per atom due to decrease in the layer thickness down to atomic level, the natural limit of compressibility. It appeared that stiffness of graphene is higher than that of diamond [2]. More than decade ago it was demonstrated that the Young modulus of graphitc monolayer exceeds that for bulk graphite [3]. Simultaneously the modulus of carbon nanotube then was obtained as that for the rolled-up monolayer in agreement with experiments [4]. In what follows the Young (bulk) modulus of a graphitic monolayer is derived from the semi-empirical inter-atomic pseudo-potential for covalently bounded 2 D carbon with new experimental evidence taken into account [1, 2].

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{comparison}} between the prediction of crack propagation through an adhesive interface based on a fracture mechanics approach and a cohesive zone approach is presented. Attention is focussed on predicting {{the shape of the}} crack front and the critical stress required to propagate the crack under quasi-static conditions. <b>The</b> <b>cohesive</b> zone model has several advantages over the fracture mechanics based model. It is easier to generalise <b>the</b> <b>cohesive</b> zone model to take into account effects such as plastic deformation in the adherends, and to take into account effects of large local curvatures of the interface crack front. The comparison shows a convergence of the results based on <b>the</b> <b>cohesive</b> zone model towards the results based on a fracture mechanics approach in the limit where the size of <b>the</b> <b>cohesive</b> zone becomes smaller than other relevant geometrical lengths for the problem...|$|R
