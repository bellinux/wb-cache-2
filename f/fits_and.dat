5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical <b>fits</b> <b>and</b> platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E

Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five.

5|$|The Cardinals {{began their}} second drive {{of the quarter}} at their own 25-yard line. In <b>fits</b> <b>and</b> starts, the Louisville offense {{advanced}} down the field. Kolby Smith ran for a yard, Michael Bush for two, then six yards, and Cantwell completed two passes of seven yards each. The Cardinals were also helped by a defensive pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, which gave Louisville a first down by penalty. As Louisville began to enter Tech territory in earnest, however, the Cardinals suffered their first turnover of the game. Facing third down and three yards from the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, Cantwell was sacked and fumbled the ball. Tech defender Xavier Adibi scooped up the loose ball, and Tech gained the initiative. Following the fumble, the Hokies began a drive at their 47-yard line. On the first play, Tech was aided by a pass interference penalty on Louisville. The penalty {{was followed by a}} three-yard Cedric Humes rush and yet another pass interference penalty against Louisville. Humes rushed twice more for five yards, and Vick completed a 16-yard pass to David Clowney before Vick completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Jeff King. The score and subsequent extra point gave Virginia Tech a 28–24 lead—its first of the game—with 6:03 remaining.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} employees’ {{experiences}} of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit at work. Despite {{a wealth of}} empirical studies in the PE fit field studying various aspects of individuals’ fit with their work environment, there are significant gaps in knowledge, {{one of which is}} that there is scant research as to how employees experience <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit. A second gap is that little is known about misfit and how this differs from organizational fit. This study focused on these gaps in the literature and took a qualitative, exploratory approach to gain in-depth understanding of the factors affecting individuals’ fit in organizations. Causal mapping techniques were used to allow the study’s participants to express their <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit perceptions without being prompted in particular directions. The resulting data were coded using extant PE fit measures to explore whether these adequately captured people’s experiences and to also assess whether there were differences between <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit. It was found that extant PE fit measures explained participants’ experiences of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit well, but that an additional dimension – fit to factors outside the organization such as people’s links with their communities – was needed to categorize all experiences of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit. It seems that the majority of individuals experience some degree of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit. Misfit <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> are shown to differ, but whereas fit is a positive experience, misfit is a negative one and a state to be avoided...|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in <b>fits</b> <b>and</b> starts before The Jazz Singer, and the film's success {{did not change}} things overnight. Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios (PDC {{had dropped out of}} the alliance), along with United Artists and others, sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film. Initially, all ERPI-wired theaters were made Vitaphone-compatible; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well. However, even with access to both technologies, most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own. No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part-talking feature until the low-budget-oriented Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17, 1928, eight months after The Jazz Singer. FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor, General Electric's RCA division, which was looking to market its new sound-on-film system, Photophone. Unlike Fox-Case's Movietone and De Forest's Phonofilm, which were variable-density systems, Photophone was a variable-area system—a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard. (In both sorts of systems, a specially-designed lamp, whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input, is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines. In a variable-density process, the lines are of varying darkness; in a variable-area process, the lines are of varying width.) By October, the FBO-RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood's newest major studio, RKO Pictures.|$|E

Results of this phase revealed seven distinct, interrelated themes, encompassing both offline and online shopping.;In Phase 2, based on the findings from Phase 1, two concerns with <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> size of garment scales were developed for offline and online shopping. As a result of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, five dimensions, including 22 items, were identified for each of the offline and online shopping contexts. It appeared that both offline and online shopping contexts generated similar concerns with <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> size of garments to some extent, but at the same time, the concerns with <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> size in the two different shopping formats were explained by somewhat different dimensions.;In Phase 3, a hypothesized model, examining the relationships among body image self-discrepancy, body dissatisfaction, enduring and situational fashion involvement, concerns with <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> size of garments, and loyalty intentions, was tested using a SEM technique. The results showed that body image self-discrepancy was positively related to body dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction was positively related to enduring and situational fashion involvement. Body dissatisfaction was positively associated with five concerns with <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> size of garment dimensions. However, the relationships between enduring and situational fashion involvement and five concerns with <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> size of garment dimensions were not significant. Finally, concerns with overall appearance and concerns with unavailability of size did not influence loyalty intentions; whereas, concerns with imagining fit/size in online shopping negatively affected loyalty intentions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a study into the nature of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit as experienced by individual employees. In particular, attention is focused on how misfit differs from fit as a psychological construct. What makes some people feel that they fit in at work whilst others feel they misfit? Their paper outlines a study exploring individuals' perceptions of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit at work. In the person-organization <b>and</b> person-environment <b>fit</b> literatures, <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit tend to be shown as two ends of a spectrum, with an underlying assumption being that the two states are polar opposites. While this seems intuitively logical, there has been no empirical test of this core assumption in the literature. This paper describes a qualitative study that used causal mapping to identify the factors affecting employees' misfit perceptions at work, contrasting these with perceptions of fit. The results show that while <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit share many characteristics, there are also some differences. Both <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit appear to be `caused' by similar dimensions of fit (e. g. person-organization (PO), person-job (PJ), person-supervisor (PS)) and that person-vocation (PV) and person-individual (PI) forms of fit are relatively insignificant. Another shared feature of the two constructs, <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit, is that they are both broader than previously thought with non-work issues such as community ties and family links influencing perceptions of <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit. The differences include the different ways that `fits' and `misfits' talk about organizational fit. Fits describe values, missions and other high-minded virtues, whereas misfits talk about what the organization is `doing' to them. The results also show that both <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> misfit are psychological rather than demographic constructs and that people experiencing misfit see it as a negative and undesirable stat...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{research was}} to explore the links between complementary and supplementary dimensions of Person-Organization fit (P-O fit), organizational identification (OI) and negative (WHI-) versus positive (WHI+) work-home interactions. It was assumed that both complementary <b>and</b> supplementary P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> OI were positively related to WHI+ and negatively to WHI-. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on a large sample of Polish blue and white collar workers. The subjects were interviewed by means of questionnaires measuring: supplementary and complementary dimensions of P-O <b>fit,</b> OI <b>and</b> WHI. General work ability and demographic variables were also controlled in the study, and statistical analysis of ANOVA, pairwise comparison as well as regression were performed. Results: P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> OI differentiated the subjects in terms of WHI. For women supplementary fit {{was a significant predictor}} of WHI- and explained 12 % of its variance, for men it was complementary fit with the number of working days per week and the level of education, which explained 22 % of variance. Supplementary <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> OI explained 16 % of WHI+ variance in women; OI, tenure at the main place of employment and the level of education explained 8 % of WHI+ variance in men. Conclusions: It has been proven that not only are the effects of P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> OI limited to the work environment but they also permeate boundaries between work and home and influence private life - good level of P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> good OI play facilitating role in the positive spillover between work and home. Gender differences in the significance and predictive values of P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> OI for WHI were also found. The innovative aspect of the work is the inclusion of P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> OI in the range of significant predictors of work-home interaction. The results can serve as rationale for employers that improvement of P-O <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> employees' organizational identification should be included in work-life balance programs...|$|R
