500|$|The {{difference}} between using linen, rather than leather is that linen soaks easily, and the inhabitants will drown, whereas a watertight leather sack will effect <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation</b> {{due to lack}} of air (or death by a drawn-out drowning process, relative to a comparatively quick one), rather than death by drowning. In a 1548 case from Dresden, the intention was to suffocate the culprit (who had killed his mother), rather than drown him. With him into the leather sack was a cat and a dog, and the sack was made airtight by coating it with pitch. However, the sack chosen was too small, and had been overstretched, so as the sack hit the waters after being thrown from the bridge, it ripped open. The cat and the dog managed to swim away and survive, while the criminal (presumably bound) [...] "got his punishment rather earlier than had been the intention", that is, death by drowning instead.|$|E

[...] It was caused by four days of heavy rainfall that was equivalent to almost half the city's average annual rainfall of [...] [...] The slide buried the house of Ma Shuk-fong, the 73-year-old caretaker of the temple who had assumed the position exactly a year before. [...] She was reported missing that same day, and though the Fire Services Department requested the Government Flying Service to dispatch a helicopter as part of the rescue bid, the plan was subsequently abandoned due to darkness. [...] A helicopter carrying a small digger was deployed to the site the following day, but the area's challenging terrain – namely the unstable mud and the narrow path encompassing the Monastery – severely hindered rescue efforts. [...] Ma's body was finally retrieved four days later. [...] A coroner later ruled that her <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation</b> under the mud was accidental, but expressed unease over the condition of slopes and pushed for stricter laws to be implemented.|$|E

As to the other form of death which is also possible (I mean <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation),</b> I must own as an honest man that I know no more about it than you do.' After considering a little, she made a sensible remark, and followed it by an embarrassing request. 'A great deal,' she said, 'must depend on the executioner. I am not afraid of death, Doctor. Why should I be? My anxiety about my little girl is set at rest; I have nothing left to live for. But I don't like pain. Would you mind telling the executioner to be careful? Or would it be better if I spoke to him myself?' I said I thought it would come with a better grace from herself. She understood me directly; and we dropped the subject.

50|$|A {{refrigerator}} {{death is}} <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation</b> in a refrigerator or similar device {{such as a}} freezer. Because, by design, such devices are air-tight when closed, a person trapped inside will have a limited supply of oxygen. Early refrigerators could only be opened from the outside, making accidental trappings—particularly of children playing with discarded devices—a possibility, and several such deaths have been recorded. Modern designs close with a magnetic mechanism that can be opened from the inside, reducing the danger of accidental trappings.|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, even the larger species do not crush their prey to death; in fact, prey {{is not even}} noticeably {{deformed}} before it is swallowed.

50|$|All these {{symptoms}} {{are due to}} a combination of all the toxic peptides the crude venom of the Black Mamba contains. The symptoms are related to calciseptine because is also works as a smooth muscle relaxant, thus explaining the early onset of having difficulties breathing, limb paralysis and even <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation.</b> Calciseptine is known to have a hypotensive effect.It cannot clearly be established which peptide is most responsible for which symptom, since combinations of different toxins can have various effects.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{symptoms}} {{after being}} {{bitten by a}} Black Mamba include the rapid onset of dizziness, drowsiness and coughing and having difficulties breathing. Other likely symptoms include convulsions, neuromuscular symptoms, shock, loss of consciousness, hypotension, ataxia, excessive salivation, limb paralysis, nausea and vomiting, fever, and severe abdominal pain. Permanent limb paralysis is very likely if the bite remains untreated. In the most severe case, if untreated, the bite of the Black Mamba can lead to <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation,</b> resulting from the paralysis of respiratory muscles.|$|E
5000|$|These newts are {{poisonous}} in the wild, but animals bred {{in captivity}} may lose their toxicity.

It is a neurotoxin with no known antidote, and can cause <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation</b> in as quickly as six hours after ingestion. [...] The toxin could be formed by environmental bacteria, so could be the reason why some newts in captivity have a lower toxicity than their wild counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|Often, when {{unloading}} grain from {{an auger}} or other {{opening at the}} bottom of the silo, another worker will be atop the grain [...] "walking it down", to ensure an even flow of grain out of the silo. Sometimes unstable pockets in the grain will collapse beneath the worker doing the walking; this is called grain entrapment as the worker can be completely sunk into the grain within seconds. Entrapment can also occur in moving grain, or when workers clear large clumps of grain that have become stuck on the side of the silo. This often results in <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{mutation}} in {{the gene for}} the activin receptor ACVR1 results in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a fatal disease that causes muscle and soft tissue to gradually be replaced by bone tissue. This condition {{is characterized by the}} formation of an extra skeleton that produces immobilization and eventually <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation.</b> The {{mutation in}} ACVR1 causes activin A, which normally acts as an antagonist of the receptor and blocks osteogenesis (bone growth), to behave as an agonist of the receptor and to induce hyperactive bone growth. On 2 September 2015, Regeneron announced that they had developed an antibody for activin A that effectively cures the disease in an animal model of the condition.|$|E
50|$|After {{the chase}} winds through {{the ruins of}} the redoubt, and after Strasser tries and fails (with Mildred's intervention) to kill Ryan with a {{long-range}} sniper rifle, Cort convinces Ryan to agree to a fight to the death, armed only with knives, to bring the pursuit to a final end. The fight takes place on a rapidly decaying wire bridge over perilous terrain riddled with quicksand, which greatly hampers both fighters. Finally Ryan deliberately causes the bridge to snap, dropping the two men to the ground below. Strasser lands in a quicksand pit, and as Ryan watches from relative safety Cort demands he be shot to end it quickly; Ryan refuses. Rather than face <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation,</b> Strasser slits his own throat.|$|E

50|$|The {{main line}} of the house Grandson {{remained}} close to the House of Savoy and possessed {{the confidence of the}} Count. At the end of the 14th century the Lords of Grandson began to decline. Hugo of Grandson was sentenced to death for allegedly forging documents, but fled to England, where he mysteriously died. Otto III was accused of having killed Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy in a fight. In Bourg-en-Bresse in 1397 he agreed to a judicial duel to prove his innocence. He was beaten by his opponent, Gerhard von Estavayer. John II of Grandson was convicted of forgery and sedition against the Duke of Burgundy and sentenced to <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation.</b> When John II died, the power of the family died with him.

50|$|Palliative {{sedation}} {{is often}} initiated at the patient's request. It {{can also be}} initiated by the physician who would discuss the option with the patient and family. Palliative sedation {{can be used for}} short periods with the plan to awaken the patient after a given time period, making terminal sedation a less correct term. The patient is sedated while symptom control is attempted, then the patient is awakened to see if symptom control is achieved. In some cases, palliative sedation is begun with the plan to not attempt to reawaken the patient. One such common example is a patient with an enlarging cancer in the throat that compresses the trachea in a patient who does not want intubation or a tracheostomy, so that eventually symptom control is impossible. Instead of experiencing <b>death</b> <b>by</b> <b>suffocation,</b> once symptoms are intolerable some patients will request palliative sedation to ease their symptoms as death approaches.|$|E
