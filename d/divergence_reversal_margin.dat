We will show that the swell band offshore component of energy flux is rather insignificant during the periods of interest, and as such we will neglect it during the ensuing analysis. The data presented will verify that the greatest flux <b>divergence</b> <b>reversal</b> is seen with winds from the East to Southeast, {{which is consistent with}} theories which suggest shoreward energy flux as well as estuarine sediment transport and resuspension prior to passage of a cold front. Employing the results of theoretical calculations and numerical modeling we will confirm that a plausible explanation for this phenomena can be found in situations where temporally varying wind input may locally balance or overpower bottom induced dissipation, which may also contravene the hypothesis that dissipation need increase shoreward due to nonlinear wave-wave interactions and maturation of the spectrum. Lastly, we will verify that the data presented is consistent with other measures collected during the same deployment in the Atchafalaya Bay during March - April 2010. by Shmuel G. Link. Thesis (S.

40|$|Modern {{aircraft}} tend to {{be light}} and slender. The high aspect ratio reduces the induced drag, increase fuel efficiency, and provide enough lift a low speeds. Therefore such wing types are used for long endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). A drawback of these wings {{is that they are}} more vulnerable for aeroelastic phenomena like <b>divergence,</b> aileron <b>reversal,</b> and flutter. To increase the dynamic pressure, at which one of these phenomena occurs, the stiffness of the wing needs to be increased leading to an increase of the wing weight. Instead of increasing the wing weight, the flexibility of the wing can be used to change the shape of the wing to optimize flight performance or to control the rolling motion of the aircraft. This research area of Active Aeroelastic Wings has grown in the recent years. With this concept, very little control surface motion is used to employ the energy of the airstream to achieve the desirable wing twist. In this thesis work, an Active Aeroelastic Wing is designed, built and tested in a low-speed wind tunnel. After testing, the possibility to predict the performance accurately with a state-of-the-art modeling tool is verified. First, a qualitative background overview is given about the three most important aeroelastic phenomena. These phenomena are torsional <b>divergence,</b> control <b>reversal,</b> and classical flutter and are described to understand the effects of the different wing parameters on the deformations. Secondly, an overview is given of the techniques that have been used to change the shape of the wing. From these concepts, the sweepable spar method has been chosen. This method uses the ability to change the position of the elastic axis, so that the twist deformations can be increased or decreased. Based on this method, a test article has been built that has similar planform shape as the Global Hawk. Instead of ailerons for roll control, the test article is equipped with an aeroelastic outer wing segment that can change its elastic axis. With this aeroelastic outer wing part, the wing is able to provide a rolling moment. Afterwards, its performance has been tested in the Open Jet Facility of the TU Delft. The results of the bench tests showed that the moveable spar is able to change the position of the elastic center at the wing tip. With the main spar at different positions, a change in the torsional stiffness of the wing has been observed. During the wind tunnel test the influence of the sweep angle on the rolling moment has been analyzed. The results did not clearly indicate a beneficial effect of the sweep angle on the rolling moment coefficient. Therefore the wing configuration is set to sweep angle of zero degrees to continue the testing. For this configuration, the main spar moved aft on the left and forward on the right wing, the maximum achievable roll helix angle {{is similar to that of}} a Boeing 747 - 200 during cruise. However, the roll performance of the Global Hawk is about five times larger than the test article. Note that aeroelastic effects have been neglected for the Global Hawk, which reduces the aileron control effectiveness. Finally, the results of the wind tunnel experiments are compared with the simulation results of Proteus. Proteus is an analysis and design framework that uses a non-linear beam model combined with lifting line theory to determine the aeroelastic effects. To analyze the test article some structural and aerodynamic modifications have been made in Proteus, to integrate the effects of a sweepable elastic axis and cambered airfoils. With these modifications the predicted rolling moment coefficient was about 40 % smaller compared to the wind tunnel results. Therefore it is concluded that Proteus is currently not able to predict the results accurately. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the wing weight estimation of strut-braced wing aircraft in conceptual design. The method is simple to implement while still capturing important effects for early design estimates. Static aeroelastic loads, aeroelastic <b>divergence</b> and aileron <b>reversal</b> criteria are calculated directly with small matrices suitable for implementation in spreadsheet software. Maneuver, gust and ground cases are considered. A direct non-iterative method {{is used for the}} strut and wing internal loads calculation. The wing and strut load-carrying structures are sized with analytical box-beam equations for strength, buckling and fatigue criteria. Aluminum or composite laminates can be considered. Semi-empirical methods are presented for non-optimal mass components and the secondary structure. The aeroelastic effects and strut reaction estimations are compared {{for a wide range of}} design parameters with Nastran validating the proposed method. The weight estimations are verified with conventional aircraft data and strut-braced wing studies available in the literature, showing good accuracy. Design trade studies are presented illustrating typical applications of the method. A potential to reduce the wing mass in about 18 % or to increase the aspect ratio from 10 to 16 compared to a cantilever wing is identified...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} subject of {{holographic}} renormalization for asymptotically AdS spacetimes. For many applications of holography, one has to handle the divergences associated with the on-shell gravitational action. The brute force approach uses the Fefferman-Graham (FG) expansion near the AdS boundary to identify the <b>divergences,</b> but subsequent <b>reversal</b> of the expansion is needed to construct the infinite counterterms. While in principle straightforward, the method is cumbersome and application/reversal of FG is formally unsatisfactory. Various authors have proposed an alternative method based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. However, this approach {{may appear to be}} abstract, difficult to implement, and in some cases limited in applicability. In this paper, we clarify the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation of holographic renormalization and present a simple algorithm for its implementation to extract cleanly the infinite counterterms. While the derivation of the method relies on the Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity, the actual application of our algorithm does not. The work applies to any $D$-dimensional holographic dual with asymptotic AdS boundary, Euclidean or Lorentzian, and arbitrary slicing. We illustrate the method in several examples, including the FGPW model, a holographic model of 3 d ABJM theory, and cases with marginal scalars such as a dilaton-axion system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design tool based on computational methods for the aerostructural analysis and optimization of aircraft layouts at the conceptual design stage. The whole methodology {{is based upon}} the integration of geometry construction and aerodynamic and structural analysis codes that combine depictive, computational, analytical, and semiempirical methods validated in an aircraft design environment. The main module for structural sizing and numerical aeroelastic analysis, named NeoCASS (next-generation conceptual aerostructural sizing suite), is presented here. The numerical kernel handling the aerostructural interaction enables the creation of efficient low-order high-fidelity models that are particularly suitable within a multidisciplinary design optimization framework to drive the optimization tool in the most appropriate direction. This makes it possible to address adverse aeroelastic issues, such as <b>divergence,</b> control surface <b>reversal,</b> flutter, and increased drag at cruise speed due to structural deformation. All of these issues generally lead to considerable changes in the structural design, which in turn might pose limitations on the flight envelope or weight penalties. The late discovery of these types of issues may result in significant cost increases and, in some cases, it may lead to the termination of the project. To overcome and remove these issues, the influence of structural deformation on flight and handling performances, of weight, and of design costs needs {{to be taken into account}} as early as possible in the design process...|$|R
40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} {{of the work}} done by other investigators {{on the effects of}} inertia couplings in producing flutter in control surfaces that are not mass balanced. The conclusion is reached that for the prevention of such flutter complete dynamic balance should always maintain. Flexural-torsional flutter is investigated in considerable detail from the consideration of the dynamical equations for steady state forced oscillations of the two dimensional case. A complete set of response curves for two typical cases are included to show the types of responses that should be observed in flight with vibration pick-up equipment. The important fact is brought out that the response and behavior of the wing at its natural bending frequency has little or no correlation with the behavior of the wing at the stability limit of flutter. Curves are presented to show that, for normal airplanes, the most important parameters which determine flutter in this mode are (a) the position of the inertia axis, (b) the torsional frequency, end (c) the radius of gyration of the wing mass about the inertia axis. The dynamical equations are set up for the cases of flexural-aileron, torsional-aileron, and flexural-torsional-aileron flutter in the two-dimensional case and an example is given of the determination of the stability limit of a specific example of the first of these modes. An extension of the two-dimensional case to the three-dimensional case is presented with particular reference to determining the flexural-torsional flutter speed of a tail surface with vertical surfaces on the tips of the horizontals. The method of attack is outlined for the calculation of natural frequencies at zero airspeed to use in determining the flutter speed. Statistical data in a graphical form show the variations of natural frequencies of the various components of airplanes with the size of such airplanes. The conclusion is reached that the speed of airplanes should be restricted to two-thirds of the critical speed for any mode of flutter, <b>divergence,</b> or aileron <b>reversal...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{a market}} for Unmanned Aerial Aircrafts (UAV) {{exploding}} and in an age were composite materials are used to construct light and flexible structures it is of importance to have the knowledge of how the choiceof material and model of plane will act together. UAV missions can varywith different flying conditions and loads and with high launching costs for satellites and the increasing amount of space debris, long endurance, high altitude UAVs might come to replace some of the functions that were previously handled by satellites. This thesis will study the influence of aeroelastic effects on an electric flexible tailless flying wing design UAV. A flying wing is chosen due to its efficiency, since less control surfaces means less drag and are therefore suitable for long endurance missions. Endurance of such plane can be enhanced by fitting of equipment such as piezo electric devices and solar panels. Different design options consists of, for example, choosing the optimum location {{of the center of}} gravity and the use of morphing control surfaces instead of conventional hinged ones. Due to lack of longitudinal stability compared to a conventional aircraft, aeroelastic effects such as flutter will have large consequences to the whole plane instead of just the wings. Long slender wings means lessdrag but more flexibility. Therefore, a flutter suppression system is the key to reach higher speeds with more efficient designs. Other aeroelastic effects such as <b>divergence</b> and control <b>reversal</b> also requires investigation since these effects cannot be suppressed and can have critical effects on the plane. Since UAVs are remote controlled, a flight control system (FCS) is often used in order to have it fly autonomous and stable during different maneuvers. Therefore a aero-servo-elastic analysis will be made to test the interaction between a FCS with the aeroelastic effects. The analysis may show whether {{it would be possible to}} suppress flutter and how themodel handles wind gusts and turbulence. Validerat; 20150915 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractArchean cratons have map {{patterns}} and rock associations {{that are diagnostic}} of the Wilson Cycle. The North China Craton (NCC) consists of several distinctly different tectonic units, but the delineation {{and understanding of the}} significance of individual sutures and the rocks between them has been controversial. We present an actualistic tectonic division and evolution of the North China Craton based on Wilson Cycle and comparative tectonic analysis that uses a multi-disciplinary approach in order to define sutures, their ages, {{and the nature of the}} rocks between them, to determine their mode of formation and means of accretion or exhumation, and propose appropriate modern analogues. The eastern unit of the craton consists of several different small blocks assembled between 2. 6 and 2. 7 Ga ago, that resemble fragments of accreted arcs from an assembled archipelago similar to those in the extant SW Pacific. A thick Atlantic-type passive margin developed on the western side of the newly assembled Eastern Block by 2. 6 – 2. 5 Ga. A > 1300 km-long arc and accretionary prism collided with the margin of the Eastern Block at 2. 5 Ga, obducting ophiolites and ophiolitic mélanges onto the block, and depositing a thick clastic wedge in a foreland basin farther into the Eastern Block. This was followed by an arc-polarity reversal, which led to a short-lived injection of mantle wedge-derived melts to the base of the crust that led to the intrusion of mafic dikes and arc-type granitoid (TTG) plutons with associated metamorphism. By 2. 43 Ga, the remaining open ocean west of the accreted arc closed with the collision of an oceanic plateau now preserved as the Western Block with the collision-modified margin of the Eastern Block, causing further deformation in the Central Orogenic Belt. 2. 4 – 2. 35 Ga rifting of the newly amalgamated continental block formed a rift along its center, and new oceans within the other two rift arms, which removed a still-unknown continental fragment from its northern margin. By 2. 3 Ga an arc collided with a new Atlantic-type margin developed over the rift sequence along the northern margin of the craton, and thus was converted to an Andean <b>margin</b> through arc-polarity <b>reversal.</b> Andean <b>margin</b> tectonics affected much of the continental block from 2. 3 to 1. 9 Ga, giving rise to a broad E-W swath of continental margin magmas, and retro-arc sedimentary basins including a foreland basin superimposed on the passive northern margin. The horizontal extent of these tectonic components is similar to that across the present-day Andes in South America. From 1. 88 to 1. 79 Ga a granulite facies metamorphic event was superimposed across the entire continental block with high-pressure granulites and eclogites in the north, and medium-pressure granulites across the whole craton to the south. The scale and duration of this post-collisional event is similar to that in Central Asia that resulted from the Cenozoic India-Asia collision. The deep crustal granulites and volcanic rocks on the surface today, interpreted to be anatectic melts from deep crustal granulites, are similar to high-grade metamorphic rocks and partial melts presently forming at mid-crustal levels beneath Tibet. Structural fabrics in lower-crustal migmatites related to this event reveal that they flowed laterally parallel to the collision boundary, in a way comparable to what is speculated to be happening in the deep crust of the Himalayan/Tibetan foreland. We relate this continent-continent collision to the collision of the North China Craton with the postulated Columbia (Nuna) Continent. The NCC broke out of the Columbia Continent between 1753 – 1673 Ma, as shown by the formation of a suite of anorthosite, mangerite, charnockite, and alkali-feldspar granites in an ENE-striking belt along the northern margin of the craton, whose intrusion was followed by the development of rifts and graben, mafic dike swarms, and eventually an Atlantic-type passive margin that signaled the beginning of a long period of tectonic quiescence and carbonate deposition for the NCC during Sinian times, which persisted into the Paleozoic. The style of tectonic accretion in the NCC changed at circa 2. 5 Ga, from an earlier phase of accretion of arcs that are presently preserved in horizontal lengths of several hundred kilometers, to the accretion and preservation of linear arcs several thousand kilometers long with associated oceanic plateaus, microcontinents, and accretionary prisms. The style of progressively younger and westward outward accretion of different tectonic components is reminiscent of the style of accretion in the Superior Craton, and may signal the formation of progressively larger landmasses at the end of the Archean (perhaps like the Kenorland Continent), then into the Paleoproterozoic, culminating in the assembly of the Columbia (Nuna) Continent at 1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga...|$|R

The North China Craton (NCC) consists of several distinctly different tectonic units, but the delineation and understanding of the significance of individual sutures and the rocks between them has been hampered by inappropriate definitions of orogens, cratonic blocks, arcs, trapped plateaus, sedimentary basins, accretionary prisms and orogens, and different generations and types of magmatic rocks. The most widely used tectonic division of the craton has been based nearly entirely on the interpretation of metamorphic P-T-t paths and recrystallized zircon morphology, and ignores other familiar elements of the Wilson Cycle. We propose an actualistic tectonic division of the North China Craton based on Wilson Cycle analysis that uses a multi-disciplinary (geology, geochemistry, geochronology, and geophysics) approach to define sutures, their ages, {{and the nature of the}} rocks between them, to determine their mode of formation and means of accretion or exhumation, and to propose appropriate modern analogues.
