However, he relapsed in 2013, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about 10 days in May of that year.|$|E
500|$|Gomez {{was out of}} {{the ring}} for almost a year {{following}} the Alvarez fight and was next due to fight Willie Limond for the WBU lightweight title, but turned down the opportunity for a chance to fight for an Irish title. Gomez then signed up to fight fellow English-based Irishman, Peter McDonagh, for the Irish lightweight title on the undercard of a Bernard Dunne fight on 28 January 2006 at the National Stadium, Dublin. After the fight was signed Gomez stated [...] "I just can't wait to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> that Irish title because I've been desperate to fight in Ireland for years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following a pitch {{invasion}} by fans after the 2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final, the GAA {{confirmed that the}} presentation of the Sam Maguire Cup would take place in Croke Park's Hogan Stand. The GAA insisted that it still remained worried about {{the health and safety of}} fans and expects an accident to happen [...] "one of these days". Kerry captain Darren O'Sullivan expressed his indifference about the location: [...] "If they give [...] out in the car park around the back, I just want to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> it". During the presentation, Tadhg Kennelly did his dance which he previously did when he won the AFL Grand Final with the Sydney Swans in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I could <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lamar {{also said}} that the album will {{showcase}} the influence of his hometown: [...] "The kid that's trying to escape that influence, trying his best to escape that influence, has always been pulled back in because of circumstances that be". Before the album's title was officially revealed, fans had already been calling Lamar's major label debut Good Kid, Mad City or Good Kid in a Mad City, as it was a nickname Lamar had given himself. The album's title mainly refers to Lamar's childhood innocence, and how Compton affected his life. After keeping the album title's acronym concealed, Lamar later revealed M.A.A.D is an acronym with two meanings: [...] "My Angry Adolescence Divided" [...] and [...] "My Angels on Angel Dust", with Lamar stating: [...] "That was me, it's the reason why I don't smoke.

40|$|This note {{primarily}} follows Nielson et al’s in [5], which cites [4, Chapter 4] {{as one of}} the {{few other}} decent introductions to coinduction. I haven’t <b>gotten</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the latter reference yet. 1 Specification Nielson et al. [5] use a coinductive specification to describe acceptability of a static analysis (notably, 0 CFA). We will start with a simpler coinductive specification; the property in English that we want to talk about is “A finite database G is an acceptable analysis of x if at(y) ∈ G for all y less than x. ” We will start using a similar notation to Nielson: G | = x, where G is a (finite) database of facts and e is a term, means that G is an acceptable analysis of x. 1. 1 Inductive specification In the first example, we will give a specification that makes sense as an inductive specification by using unary natural numbers n:: = z | s(n). Then, we can define G | = n by structural induction on n. • G | = z always. • G | = s(n) iff at(n) ∈ G and G | = n...|$|R

5000|$|Wood told another viewer, however, {{that they}} did use a body double's hands in some scenes: [...] "I also had a {{counterpart}} who could 'be' my left or <b>my</b> right <b>hand</b> because I couldn't always use both hands in a natural way, depending on where the camera was. So we literally held things together and handed things off {{as if it were}} the same person. It was a lot of choreography!... Most of the time I couldn't <b>get</b> both of <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> either side of the camera, because the rig was too big. So there'd be times when I'd be on one side with <b>my</b> right <b>hand,</b> and then <b>my</b> double would be on the left side with his left hand, so we'd have to work together a lot, like moving an object from one hand to another. And if you're trying to do that with two different hands, it's pretty challenging to make that look pretty natural." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “17 January {{was a heavy}} day for me. The {{radar station}} picked up the {{approach}} {{of a group of}} ground attack aircraft on their way to Anju. Our regiment was sent out to repulse them. Arriving in the area of combat operations, we just spotted the last group of Thunderjets sliding along above the clouds to our south. Vishnyakov went to go after them, but {{we were not able to}} attack as the Thunderjets went into a cloud and we found ourselves over the coastline. Not seeing the usual Sabre escort, we made a left turn and began a level climb and had just turned around when I spotted two groups of Sabres diving down to attack Vishnyakov. We were engaging under the most unfavorable conditions, but nevertheless we beat off the first attack of the Sabres and, by using maneuver, climbed back up to about 9000 meters. At that moment another group of Sabres showed up, and moved to come down to attack the regimental commander’s group from above. As for me, as I virtually had no speed due to the climb, managed to increase my climb angle and at 600 meters I opened fire on the Sabre group leader. His aircraft ran through my tracers, and I saw several explosions on it. He increased his dive and angle and headed down. Turning around, I saw that my group was also being attacked from above by a group of Sabres. I gave the command: “Everybody break!” and we turned under the Sabres, but now I saw that my rear wingman, Senior Lieutenant Voronoy, was being fired on by two Sabres. Voronoy went into a sharp dive and headed down. I returned to the battle. At that moment my third pair came under attack from two Sabres coming down from above which, as they opened fire, cut through them and headed out directly towards above me. I followed them, firing at the wingman. He, evidently damaged, turned and banked over into a dive. I was not able to go after the damaged aircraft, as I suddenly felt a sharp blow and the aircraft around me began to rapidly spin. I kicked hard left rudder, but the controls did not respond. It was so sudden that one wing suddenly broke off. I made the decision to bail out of the uncontrollable aircraft, as it was now in a vertical spin downward. With a great deal of difficulty - as I was rammed into the left side of the aircraft - I managed to <b>get</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the ejection seat control lever and pull it. A sharp blow momentarily pressed down on my eyes, so I have no idea how I flew out of the aircraft. As I came back to life I was falling together with the seat, I released the harness and kicked out of the seat with my legs. I could see that the clouds below me were coming up rapidly, so I pulled on the parachute ripcord ring, and after I yanked it the canopy opened. I came to a sharp halt, and now I was floating under the parachute. Above me was the blue sky, below me the clouds. They were about 800 meters below. I glanced around and saw a Sabre coming at me very quickly. He came on for a few more seconds, and suddenly I saw the smoke and tracers that he was firing his six machine guns. Death was coming for me, and all I could do was wait as he came after me. Fortunately, the Sabre was about 800-1000 meters away, and the tracers flew by tens of meters below me. But for those very few seconds the tracers began to head up towards my legs and only stopped a few meters away.Perhaps at the last second I could pull my legs up at the moment that I felt the bullets were about to hit my legs. But at that precise moment the tracers stopped. I could see the Sabre bank away sharply when 500 meters away, and passing about 50 meters away from me, make a quick turn. I got nauseous from his jet exhaust as he passed. I saw the Sabre make another turn and come back to attack me again. Now I understood that he wanted to get even for the death of his leader, but then I didn’t want to think about that so silently waited for the end to come. The second time, I thought, he won’t miss.I looked down. The cloud was now much closer - perhaps 50-100 meters away. I thought: ‘What will happen first - will I go into the cloud or will his tracers hit me? If the Sabre opens fire, he won’t miss.’ But when the Sabre closed to 800 meters and new tracers flew from it, I poked into the cloud. It immediately became quite dark, humid, but it was a beautiful sensation that I was safe, as he could not see me and I did not see the approaching Sabre and his tracers." ...|$|R
