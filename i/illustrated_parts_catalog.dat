Larry Albedi Motors (Lincoln-Mercury) in Vallejo, California serviced the vehicle a couple of times before it was returned to Ford {{at the end of the}} year.

50|$|This engine being {{based on}} British/American Rover V8/Buick 215 block {{is a common}} misconception, as the Rover/Buick V8 (although quite similar in {{appearance}} and size) had five cylinder-head studs per cylinder (14 studs per head with six shared studs in-between-cylinders) configuration that cannot accommodate the six stud (18 studs per head with six shared studs between cylinders) Repco RB620 heads. The difference in block design originated in Oldsmobile's intention to produce the higher power, turbo-charged Jetfire version. GM's later use of parts diagrams drawn for Oldsmobile in Buick <b>parts</b> <b>catalog</b> showing a six-stud cylinder block further fueled the confusion.|$|R
