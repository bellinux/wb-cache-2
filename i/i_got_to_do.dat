The music video for Avril Lavigne's 2013 song [...] "Rock n Roll" [...] was heavily influenced by Tank Girl. During her interview included on the Blu-ray release of the film in 2013, Petty was asked why she thinks the film still resonates with fans, and replied: [...] "There's no formula as to why Tank Girl was so fabulous and why people love it so much... It was unique, it was new, it was fresh, it was way ahead of its time, and I'm happy that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it and that I'll always have her." [...] Luke Buckmaster from the BBC included the film in his 2015 list of the [...] "ten weirdest superhero films", asserting that: [...] "at its best, director Rachel Talalay captures an ostentatious steampunk vibe that proves weirdly addictive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{features}} multiple post-credit scenes. The first {{gives the}} Vulture {{a chance at}} redemption, showing him protect Parker from another villain. Watts said this [...] "was a really interesting thing {{in the development of}} the story. You couldn’t just rely on the tropes of the villain being a murderer and killing a bunch of people. He had to be redeemable in some capacity in the end and that he believes everything he said, especially about his family." [...] The second post-credits scene is an additional Captain America PSA, where he talks about the value of patience—a joke at the expense of the audience, who have just waited through the film's credits to see the scene. This was a [...] "last-minute addition" [...] to the film. Watts completed work on Homecoming at the beginning of June 2017, approving the final visual effects shots. He stated that he had never been told that he could not do something by Marvel or Sony, saying, [...] "You assume you’ll have to fight for every little weird thing you wanna do, but I didn’t really ever run into that. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> kind of everything I wanted to." [...] That month, Starr explained that he was playing the academic decathlon coach at Parker's high school, and Marshall-Green was said to be portraying another Shocker.|$|E

What <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> before all other things, is to trace out {{the meaning of this}} paper, {{for the sake of the}} Good Name that has no one else to put it right. And still for the sake of the Good Name, and my father's memory, not a word of this writing must be breathed to my mother, or to Kitty, or to any human creature. You agree in this?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You say truth, Big Tim," [...] {{returned}} the preacher, [...] "and {{that is also}} all that <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with; but you and I take different methods of correcting the evil." ...|$|R

6000|$|Well, I {{just felt}} sick. But I says, <b>I</b> <b>GOT</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it--I can't get OUT of it. Right then along comes a skiff {{with two men}} in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's no {{laughing}} matter," [...] the constable said. [...] "If you {{are innocent}} you have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> prove it; that ain't no business of mine. All <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> arrest you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{just the}} same. Nobody thinks {{anything}} {{about that kind of}} thing. Now, what is it <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> We had better turn back again as soon as we can, because I must go up to the house before I go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't got no {{business}} with that," [...] said the policeman. [...] "I'm {{not one to}} argue. All <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is {{to carry out the}} Law." [...] And he brought his second leg over the wall and seemed disposed to get down. Other policemen appeared behind him.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no one. I {{am not a}} {{thing to}} be looked at in that light. I mean {{eventually}} to take to women's rights, and to make myself generally odious.
