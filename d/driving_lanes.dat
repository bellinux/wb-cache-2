In this circumstance, we have difficulty {{to keep the}} <b>driving</b> <b>lane.</b> For the purpose of safety driving, we develop the vehicle navigation system with Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Radio Frequency Identification (RF-ID) to keep the <b>driving</b> <b>lane.</b> MethodsWe obtain a vehicle location on the <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> using UHF RF-ID system. The vehicle position in <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> is written on RF-ID tags in advance and these tags are buried in an asphalt road. Our experimental vehicle equips RF-ID antenna which communicates with RF-ID tags and gets vehicle location on the <b>driving</b> <b>lane.</b> This position information is given to a driver by Liquid Cristal Display.

40|$|In {{military}} transportation, {{the use of}} wide trailer for transporting {{the large}} and heavy weight equipments such as tank, armoured vehicle, and mobile gunnery is quite common. So, the vulnerability of causing traffic accidents for these wide military trailer to bump or collide with another car in adjacent lane is very high due to its broad width in excess of its own lane's width. Also, the possibility of these strayed accidents can be increased especially by the careless driver. In this paper, the recognition system of lane and vehicle headway direction is developed to detect the possible collision and warn the driver to prevent the fatal accident. In the system development, Kalman filtering is used first to extract the border of <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> from the video images supplied by the CCD camera attached to the vehicle and the <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> detection is completed with regression analysis. Next, the vehicle headway direction is recognized by using neural network scheme with the extracted parameters of the detected <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> feature. The practical experiments for the developed system are also {{carried out in the}} real traffic road of Seoul city area and the results show us the more than 90 % accuracy in recognizing the <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> and vehicle headway direction...|$|R

30|$|In {{the present}} paper, we have {{presented}} a vehicle navigation system that uses UHF RF-ID system {{to keep the}} drivinglane. Our navigation system gives vehicle position on the <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> by GUI on LCD and the direction to the center ofdriving lane by GUI on LCD and the voice instruction. In our residential area, heavy snow fall makes low visibility condition and we cannot drive around the legal speed. In our driving experiment, such low visible condition is simulated by the bubble wrap on the windshield {{in front of the}} driver’s seat. However, drivers feel the same difficulty of the heavy snow fall with wrapped windshield, our navigation system helps them to keep the <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> safely. From several starting points on the <b>driving</b> <b>lane,</b> both a daily driver and a novice driver have done well with our navigation system using RF-ID system. In this paper, the low visible condition is assumed tobe caused by the heavy snow fall, but same condition may be occurred in the dense fog and so on. Our navigation system with RF-ID system still has problems to put into practical use. Most important issue iscost in spreading RF-ID tags broadly on general road. From this point, we need {{to reduce the number of}} RF-ID tags. We might go on to more optimize the arrangement of RF-ID tags and work on multi-antenna system.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEstimations of {{parameter}} {{values of}} car-following models show considerable differences between individuals and experiments. These differences {{may be caused}} by a different effect of external circumstances on mental workload of drivers. This effect may especially play a considerable role in case of driving under adverse conditions (e. g. evacuations, adverse weather conditions, road works and incidents on the freeway). These adverse conditions have shown to have a substantial impact on traffic flow operations. In this regard a driving simulator experiment was performed as to what extent an incident in the other <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> influences physiological indicators as well as subjective estimates of mental workload as well as longitudinal driving behavior. Also was investigated whether current car-following models, represented by the Intelligent Driver Model and the Helly model, adequately incorporate longitudinal driving behavior under these circumstances using a calibration approach for joint estimation. From the results followed that perception of incidents in the other <b>driving</b> <b>lane</b> lead to significant changes in physiological indicators of mental workload as well as in longitudinal driving behavior.

Many APS utilize a steel framework (some use thin concrete slabs) rather than the monolithic concrete design of the multi-story parking garage. These factors contribute to an overall volume reduction and further space savings for the APS.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2016 the Alex Fraser Bridge {{along with}} the Port Mann Bridge dropped [...] "ice bombs," [...] also called [...] "slush bombs" [...] on {{vehicles}} causing damage to windshields.
