40|$|The 116 -C- 3 waste site {{consisted}} of two underground storage tanks designed to receive mixed waste from the 105 -C Reactor Metals Examination Facility chemical <b>dejacketing</b> process. Confirmatory evaluation and subsequent characterization of the site determined that the southern tank contained approximately 34, 000 L (9, 000 gal) of <b>dejacketing</b> wastes, and that the northern tank was unused. In accordance with this evaluation, the verification sampling and modeling results support a reclassification of this site to Interim Closed Out. The results of verification sampling demonstrate that residual contaminant concentrations do not preclude any future uses and allow for unrestricted use of shallow zone soils. The results also show that residual contaminant concentrations are protective of groundwater and the Columbia River...|$|E
40|$|Tungsten and {{graphite}} are unsuitable {{materials of}} construction for a UF/ sub 6 / inlet nozzle {{in a continuous}} DRUHM reactor. Preparation of feed was completed for an extended Fluorox test. Difficulties were experienced {{in the operation of}} a fluidized bed TbNT denitrator. Flame denitration of UNH and TbNO produced mixed oxides of 1 to 14 micron mean particle size. The chloride capacity of Dowex 21 K was measured, and equilibria measurements of uranium sorption from sulfate solutions were continued. Siliceous deposits in the stripping column caused the termination of a Darex run with a prototype APPR fuel element. Hot runs were begun on the chemical <b>dejacketing</b> of irradiated PWR blanket pins. The addition of formaldehyde to neutralize " 25 " waste reduced the recovery of nitrate from the calciner off-gas from 76 % to 23 %. (For preceding report see CF- 58 - 9 - 62.) (auth...|$|E
40|$|A gamma {{scintillation}} spectrometer {{was used to}} measure diffusivity of uranyl nitrate in water during preliminary capillary experiments. During Fluorox run FBR- 22, 90. 4 % of the theoretical amount of UF/sub 6 / formed was collected in cold traps and chemical traps. Toroid tests of flame calcined mixed Th-U oxide showed low corrosion rates, small changes in particle size and a low solubilization of uranium, while denitration of uranyl nitrate in a fluidized bed resulted in particle growth with uniform layers of uranium oxide. A half-time of 30 min for uranium anion exchange was measured in differential bed studies of uranium sorption on Dowex 21 K. The Darex Reference flowsheet operation resulted in chloride removal to less than 50 ppm in solvent extraction feed from APPR head- end treatment. Unirradiated prototype Consolidated Edison pins were dejacketed with 6 M H/sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / with uranium losses to the <b>dejacketing</b> solution of approximately 0. 2 %. An optimum procedure was developed for clarifying large batches of solvent extraction feed by sand bed filtration. Sheared sections of stainless steel clad UO/sub 2 / were completely leached in onehalf the time required for equal lengths of stainless tubes containing uncrushed pellets. Abrasive disc wheel to metal removal ratios were measured at cutting rates from 10 to 60 in. /min. Dissolution of Zircaloy- 2 dummy fuel elements in an INOR- 8 dissolver with the NaF-LiF salt system resulted in vessel wall corrosion rates of 1 - 2 mils/run (approximately 8 hr of HF exposure). At a heat generation rate of 60 Btu/hr/gal of solid wastes, the maximum temperature rise in a 0. 75 ft radius infinite cylinder (k = 0. 1 Btu/hr sq ft ction prod- F) was 1270 ction prod- F in soil, 1150 ction prod- F in rock, and 1020 ction prod- F in salt.
