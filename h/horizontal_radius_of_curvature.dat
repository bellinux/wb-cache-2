40|$|The study {{investigated}} the central and peripheral corneal characteristics of groups of subjects from 20 to 90 years of age to assist the understanding of ageing changes in the cornea, and to see whether relationships between ocular parameters were revealed. After age 45 the corneal <b>horizontal</b> <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> gradually decreased with age. This trend was shown by the Aston University subjects (group B). The effect was very significant for the hospital patients undergoing biometry before cataract extraction operation (group D). Vertical radius of curvature showed a slight decrease with age after age 45, but similar to corneal eccentricity, this showed no significant age effect. Corneal astigmatism progressed from with the rule towards against the rule, particularly after age 60. The shift seemed mainly due to the decreasing horizontal corneal curvature. In biometry no significant age relation was found for axial length, but a significant relation was found between curvature and axial length in the larger group D. Lens thickness showed a very significant relation to age and to axial length, but no significant relation to corneal curvature. Anterior chamber depth showed a very significant relation to age, lens thickness and axial length, but no significant relation to corneal curvature. A significant age effect was found for corneal thickness decreasing with age for the central, nasal and temporal regions of the right eye. Analysis of the biometry results indicated the influence of two major factors. Firstly, the natural growth of the eye in youth, leading to greater values of axial length, radius of corneal curvature, lens thickness and anterior chamber depth. Secondly, the typical ageing changes where the increasing lens thickness caused a reduction in anterior chamber depth. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
30|$|The {{lines as}} links {{connecting}} particular stations as the nodes of HSR network are mainly characterized by their three-dimensional layout and geometry of tracks. The most relevant parameters of geometry of tracks are {{the distance between}} their centers, gauge, the maximum axle load, gradient, the minimum <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> the maximum cant and the maximum cant gradient, {{and the length of}} transition curves corresponding to the minimum curve radius. For example, in Europe, except track gauge (1, 435  mm), all other parameters are dependent on the maximum design speed. In addition, the HSR tracks can be broadly ballasted and ballast less [7, 8]. The former are present at the most already built HSR lines, while the latter have been considered particularly for the lines with long segments of tunnels and/or bridges such as those in Japan. 1 In addition, they have been expected to increase the capacity of HSR lines, operating speed, reduce the maintenance costs through reducing the frequency of maintenance operations, and consequently increase the level of safety.|$|R
30|$|Tilting trains, {{currently}} gaining {{popularity in}} the railway market has been a concept considered ever since the late 1930 s. Individuals have pondered on ways of improving rail speeds without compromising passenger ride comfort and possible derailment of the train vehicles. Previously, trains remained limited in speed by the <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> rail tracks. Trains generally need to slow down to an acceptable speed in other to successfully negotiate curves. A fitting example of disasters caused by over-speeding in curves is the 2013 Spanish high-speed rail disaster [1] where the train derailed due to over-speeding. Despite these incidents, there are still paramount demands on railways to deliver high-speed transportation for their passengers in order to compete effectively with other modes of transportation. A tilting train refers to a train capable of negotiating a bend or curve at speeds greater than that limited by the curve {{through the use of}} active or passive tilting mechanisms. When a bicycle or motorcycle negotiates a curve at high speeds, the driver or rider tilts the vehicle at an angle that is a function <b>of</b> <b>horizontal</b> speed and <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the curve thus reducing the magnitude of lateral acceleration on the vehicle. This behaviour is also seen in speeding bodies from animals, track athletes, ice skaters and many more. Automobile and rail vehicles cannot mimic the tilts achievable by two wheel vehicles most specifically because they (automobiles and rail vehicles) are four or more wheel vehicles. In the automotive industry for example, {{attempts have been made to}} increase speeds around curves through the use of canted roads. Canted roads can most commonly be seen in the racing industry and most commonly in a NASCAR High-speed track. The railway industry can also use cants, but the angles achievable are relatively small and do not necessarily meet with growing high-speed demands. In the automobile industry, road cants or super-elevations can reach angles of 30 ° or more whilst in railway, cant levels only reach about 3 °. Tilting trains use their mechanisms in increasing the angle of tilt hence increasing the amount of speed the train can use in negotiating the curve. Tilting trains are seen as a cost-effective way to meet passenger demands without spending valuable funds on reconstruction of high-speed straight line tracks. The design of a tilting train is shown below. A component called the tilting bolster is mounted on the bogie and the car body is in turn mounted on the bolster. The bolster is connected to swing links which are in turn connected to an actuator. Actuators may be in the form of a hydraulic cylinder using hydraulic oil as its working fluid, an air cylinder using compressed air as its working fluid or an electromechanical actuator. Controls, sensors and programmes are put in place to ensure smooth transitions of the train as it approaches, negotiates and exits the curve. Apart from the benefits of high speed, improved ride comfort is also achieved as the extra cylinders and air springs act as secondary dampers reducing the amount of vibration transmitted from the track, through the bogies to the passengers.|$|R

A curve with a monotone <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> distribution is considered as a fair curve in the area of Computer Aided Aesthetic Design (CAAD).

For laser forming of cylindrical surfaces with arbitrary <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> a new {{and comprehensive}} method is proposed in this paper. This method contains simple linear irradiating lines and using an analytical method, required process parameters for laser forming of a cylindrical surface with a specific <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> is proposed. In this method, laser output power, laser scanning speed and laser beam diameter are selected based on laser machine and process limitations.

50|$|The {{growth and}} decay of {{wavelengths}} {{can be determined}} by examining the change in pressure a perturbation wavelength imposes on {{the interior of the}} fluid thread. Changes to the internal pressure of the thread are induced by capillary pressure as the free surface of the thread deforms. Capillary pressure is a function <b>of</b> the mean <b>curvature</b> <b>of</b> the interface at a given location at the surface, meaning the pressure is dependent on the two <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> that give the shape of the surface. Within the thinned area of a fluid thread undergoing breakup, the first <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> is smaller than the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> in the thickened area, leading to a pressure gradient that would tend to force liquid from the thinned to thickened areas. However, the second <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> remains important to the breakup process. For some perturbation wavelengths, the effect <b>of</b> the second <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> can overcome the pressure effect <b>of</b> the first <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature,</b> inducing a larger pressure in the thickened regions than the thinned regions. This would push fluid back toward the thinned regions and tend to return the thread to its original, undisturbed shape. However, for other perturbation wavelengths, the capillary pressure induced by the second <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature</b> will reinforce that <b>of</b> the first <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>curvature.</b> This will drive fluid from the thinned to the thickened regions and further promote thread breakup.|$|R
