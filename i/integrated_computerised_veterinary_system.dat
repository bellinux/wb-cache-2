Studies showed that diagnosis can considerably reduce the inefficiency, so one of the most important tasks in achieving greater hospital efficiency is to optimise the diagnostic process. For the best of the patient the diagnostic process has to be optimised regarding the number of the examinations and individualised in the manner to maximise accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. In addition the duration of the diagnostic process has to be minimised and the process has to be performed on the maximal reliable equipment. The main contribution of our paper is the introduction of the <b>integrated</b> <b>computerised</b> environment DIAPRO enabling the diagnostic process optimisation.

40|$|Repeat and {{redundant}} {{procedures in}} medical imaging {{are associated with}} increases in resource utilisation and labour costs. Unnecessary medical imaging in some modalities, such as X-Ray (XR) and Computed Tomography (CT) is an important safety issue because it exposes patients to ionising radiation which can be carcinogenic and is associated with higher rates of cancer. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the impact of implementing an <b>integrated</b> <b>Computerised</b> Provider Order Entry (CPOE) /Radiology Information System (RIS) /Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS) system on the number of XR and CT imaging procedures (including repeat imaging requests) for inpatients at a large metropolitan hospital. The study found that patients had an average 0. 47 fewer XR procedures and 0. 07 fewer CT procedures after the implementation of the integrated system. Part of this reduction was driven by a lower rate of repeat procedures: the average inpatient had 0. 13 fewer repeat XR procedures within 24 -hours of the previous identical XR procedure. A similar decrease was not evident for repeat CT procedures. Reduced utilisation of imaging procedures (especially those within very short intervals from the previous identical procedure, which are more likely to be redundant) has implications for the safety of patients and the cost of medical imaging services. 6 page(s...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} the study is to develop a {{framework}} for the implementation of <b>integrated</b> <b>computerised</b> management systems that addresses the needs and problems unique to the South African construction industry. The literature study critically analyses international studies about system implementation in the construction industry. Thereafter, the unique needs of the South African construction industry are analysed. The social-cultural, organisational and management aspects of system implementation also come under the spotlight. Various implementing models and attributes of successful, problematic and failed system implementations are analysed. From the analysis of 312 orders that were placed for construction management systems and sixty-four interviews and questionnaires that were completed by South African construction companies, the following have been determined: • The expectations regarding software for the construction industry have been identified. • The main indicators for implementation success and failure have been identified. • The profile for a construction company where a successful implementation is likely has been identified. The framework for the implementation of management systems for the South African construction industry consists of the following elements and phases: • Pre-project phase: client orientation, introduction and contracting • Analysing phase: Determine outcomes, diagnose current state of affairs, project scope declaration, priorities, work allocation, risk analysis, organisational analysis. • Formalising phase: Appointment of the team leader and team members, planning, assign responsibilities, implementation plan. • Implementation phase: Control process; install the programs, training, adjustments, data migration, project status, feedback, unforeseen happenings {{and the creation of a}} learning organisation. • Evaluation of: implementation, client, service provider and software The framework was implemented on a trial basis. It has been determined that the framework can be implemented in practice and that it delivers positive implementation results. However, it has been found that in practice the formalising and analysing phases are so close that it should form one phase in the framework. Master...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{changes in}} the cervical screening service since {{the introduction of the}} new general practitioner contract on 1 April 1990. DESIGN [...] Analysis of computerised records of cervical screening both before and after introduction of the new contract. SETTING [...] General practices in Perth and Kinross Unit, Tayside. PATIENTS [...] A total of 30, 071 women aged 21 - 60 on 26 general practitioner partnership lists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Percentage average of target population for cervical screening in each practice for first three quarters on introduction of the contract. RESULTS [...] Perth and Kinross Unit completed a computerised cervical screening call programme in July 1989, which produced an increase from 71 % to 78 % in the mean percentage of women aged 20 - 60 who had had cervical smear tests within 5. 5 years. Six months after the introduction of the new general practitioner contract the mean population coverage was increased to 85 % in women aged 21 - 60 and only four practices had not attained the 80 % upper target compared with 10 on 1 April 1990. Detailed examination of randomly selected practices immediately before the new contract was introduced showed an average artificial list inflation of 4. 3 % in health board records when compared with practice records, a hysterectomy rate of 6. 2 %, and an additional 3 % of women who were considered to be ineligible for smear testing due to putative virginity or illness or infirmity, or both. There was a considerable shift away from use of well woman clinics (2. 7 % of smears in 1990 compared with 5. 6 % in 1988) for taking cervical smears, potentially threatening the long term viability of the clinics. CONCLUSION [...] The introduction of the new contract for general practitioners has brought about a further sustained increase in population coverage for cervical screening in a small Scottish unit with a stable population, well motivated general practitioners, and a fully <b>integrated</b> <b>computerised</b> call and recall system based on the community health index. To optimise the screening service revision of the targets levels is necessary...|$|R

We report of a presumptive case of human rabies whose survival was a rare occurrence in rural Ghana. Lessons from this case study provides a critically needed focus in helping improve rabies surveillance and case management in Ghana. We report of the survival of a 36 year old man who developed clinical rabies three weeks after he was bitten by his dog while restraining the dog with a chain. Prior to this he did not observe any abnormal or rabid behaviour in the dog. Following the bite, he did not immediately resort to hospital treatment, but rather to traditional application of herbs to the laceration he sustained after the bite. Reason given for not seeking immediate hospital treatment was that the dog was not rabid and lack of funds to seek hospital care. However, he began to show symptoms consistent with rabies virus infection after 10 days and was subsequently {{rushed to the hospital}} by relatives. At the hospital, he was administered human immune tetanus immunoglobulin, diazepam, ceftriaxone, paracetamol and intravenous fluids. No rabies vaccine was administered. Six days after commencing treatment patient became well, showed no signs of confused state of mind, hydrophobia nor photophobia. He was discharged home after 13 days of commencing treatment. This study provides insight on a presumptive case of Human rabies case that survived despite non-administration of rabies vaccine during esposure.

However, not all healthcare organization in Malaysia implementing the information <b>system</b> such as <b>veterinary</b> clinic. The problems had been identified based on the interview session with the staff of the Family Veterinary Clinic and the researcher successful resolve the problem. All of the problem facing by the stakeholder is due to the manual system that handle the clinic daily operation. Hence, the problem faced by the clinic are difficulty in organize patient’s information as the patients need to fill up the registration form manually and the data are kept on file and stored in the cabinet. Another problem facing by the clinic are difficulty in checking the availability of the appointment which the staff need to record the appointment information in the appointment book. The last problem faced by the clinic is difficulty in calculating medicine stock as the staff need to manually count the quantity of the medicine. When the certain medicine reached a minimum quantity the staff need to order with the supplier. Therefore, one of the solutions is to develop the clinic management system for the Family Veterinary Clinic. In other to develop a system, there are four objectives that need to be achieve which are to gather and analyze requirements from the Family Veterinary Clinic, to design the <b>veterinary</b> clinic management <b>system</b> with SMS notification for Family Veterinary Clinic, to develop the <b>veterinary</b> clinic management <b>system</b> with SMS notification for Family Veterinary Clinic and to test the functionality of the web based the <b>veterinary</b> clinic management <b>system</b> for Family <b>Veterinary</b> Clinic.
