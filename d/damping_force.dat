25|$|The damper, {{instead of}} storing energy, dissipates energy. Since the <b>damping</b> <b>force</b> is {{proportional}} to the velocity, the more the motion, the more the damper dissipates the energy. Therefore, there is a point when the energy dissipated by the damper equals the energy added by the force. At this point, the system has reached its maximum amplitude and will continue to vibrate at this level as long as the force applied stays the same. If no damping exists, there is nothing to dissipate the energy and, theoretically, the motion will continue to grow into infinity.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{practitioners}} with further insight into spurious <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> that can be generated in nonlinear seismic response history analyses (RHA). The term 'spurious' is used to refer to <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> that are not present in an elastic system and appear as nonlinearities develop: such <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are not necessarily intended and appear as a result of modifications in the structural properties as it yields or damages due to the seismic action. In this paper, two types of spurious <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are characterized. Each type has often been treated separately in the literature, but each has been qualified as 'spurious', somehow blurring their differences. Consequently, in an effort to clarify the consequences of choosing a particular viscous damping model for nonlinear RHA, this paper shows that damping models that avoid spurious <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> of one type do not necessarily avoid <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> of the other type...|$|R

2500|$|When rnbsp&≫nbsp&1 the {{amplitude}} of the vibration is actually {{less than the}} static deflection [...] In this region the force generated by the mass (Fnbsp&=nbsp&ma) is dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, X, is reduced in this region, the force transmitted by the spring (Fnbsp&=nbsp&kx) to the base is reduced. Therefore, the massndash&springndash&damper system is isolating the harmonic force from the mounting base – referred to as vibration isolation. Interestingly, more damping actually reduces the effects of vibration isolation when rnbsp&≫nbsp&1 because the <b>damping</b> <b>force</b> (Fnbsp&=nbsp&cv) is also transmitted to the base.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{new technique}} that reproduces a stable cloth without introducing excessive damping artifacts. Semi-implicit integration methods {{have been widely used}} in cloth simulations for their high stability and speed. Artificial internal <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are derived from the linearization process of semi-implicit integration. This makes the system highly stable. However, the artificial internal <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are generated with respect to not only internal deformations but also rotational rigid motions. This damping artifact significantly degrades the realism of the cloth simulation. Hence, we propose a new implicit integration method to decrease this artifact. The artificial internal <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are computed by considering the pure internal deformations alone, and are stably incorporated into the dynamical system. As a result, our simulator could reproduce a wide range of cloth materials without the excessive damping artifacts in realtime...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a magnetorheological (MR) damper is well portrayed using a Bouc-Wen hysteresis model. This model estimates <b>damper</b> <b>forces</b> based on the inputs of displacement, velocity, and voltage.

In such cases, it is beneficial to develop an inverse dynamic model that estimates the required voltage to be input to the damper so that a desirable <b>damper</b> <b>force</b> can be produced. In this study, we explore such a possibility via the neural network (NN) technique. Recurrent NN models will be constructed to emulate the inverse dynamics of the MR damper. To illustrate the use of these NN models, two control applications will be studied: one is the optimal prediction control of a single-degree-of-freedom system and the other is the linear quadratic regulator control of a multiple-degree-of-freedom system.

40|$|A physics based {{methodology}} for modeling of hydraulic devices within multibody-based comprehensive models of rotorcraft systems is developed. The proposed models are developed in two stages. At first, models are developed for three basic hydraulic elements: the hydraulic chamber, the hydraulic orifice {{and the pressure}} relief valve. These models consist of nonlinear differential equations involving empirical parameters. Next, these basic elements are combined to yield device models for linear hydraulic actuators, simple hydraulic dampers, and hydraulic dampers with pressure relief valves. The proposed hydraulic device models are implemented in a multibody code and calibrated by comparing their predictions with test bench measurements for the UH- 60 helicopter lead-lag damper. While predicted peak <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> {{are found to be}} in good agreement with measurements, the model does not predict the entire time history of <b>damper</b> <b>force</b> to the same level of accuracy. The validated model of the UH- 60 lead-lag damper model is coupled with a comprehensive model of the vehicle. Measured aerodynamic loads are applied to the blade and predicted <b>damper</b> <b>forces</b> are compared with experimental measurements. A marked improvement in the prediction is observed when using the proposed model rather than a linear approximation of the damper behavior.

40|$|International audienceRayleigh <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are {{commonly}} {{introduced in the}} numerical simulations of nonlinear structures run to assess structural performance {{in case of an}} earthquake. Their purpose is to account for energy dissipative mechanisms not otherwise explicitly represented in the model. When caused by interactions between the structure and its surrounding environment, energy dissipation is external to the structure, whereas it is internal when resulting from energy absorption mechanisms activated in the structure. In this paper, the concept of discrepancy forces is introduced in the framework of computational dynamics. Then, <b>damping</b> <b>forces</b> are presented as a model of these so-called discrepancy forces to represent internal energy dissipation. On the other hand, the discrepancy forces are identified from a set of experimental data recorded during shaking-table test of a ductile moment-resisting frame, which provides the rationale for a critical look into Rayleigh <b>damping</b> <b>forces.</b> It is in particular observed that, for the structure tested, the Rayleigh damping model used is inaccurate as a representation of the discrepancy forces. Besides, while the knowledge of the discrepancy forces allows for rationally discussing the capabilities of the inelastic structural model to represent the actual behavior of the structure, this is only possible to a limited extent with the Rayleigh damping model used...|$|R
