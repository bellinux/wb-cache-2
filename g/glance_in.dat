5|$|Edrich then {{relieved}} Coxon, who had bowled {{his first}} seven overs in Test cricket {{for the loss}} of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to the leg side, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the leg trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted leg <b>glance</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.|$|E

25|$|The greasepaint {{mustache}} and eyebrows originated spontaneously {{prior to a}} vaudeville performance in the early 1920s {{when he did not}} have time to apply the pasted-on mustache he had been using (or, according to his autobiography, simply did not enjoy the removal of the mustache every night because of the effects of tearing an adhesive bandage off the same patch of skin every night). After applying the greasepaint mustache, a quick <b>glance</b> <b>in</b> the mirror revealed his natural hair eyebrows were too undertoned and did not match the rest of his face, so Marx added the greasepaint to his eyebrows and headed for the stage. The absurdity of the greasepaint was never discussed on-screen, but in a famous scene in Duck Soup, where both Chicolini (Chico) and Pinky (Harpo) disguise themselves as Groucho, they are briefly seen applying the greasepaint, implicitly answering any question a viewer might have had about where he got his {{mustache and}} eyebrows.|$|E

500|$|To {{listen to}} {{it is to be}} [...] "plunged into a maelstrom of {{conflicting}} emotions. Songs are drenched in strings and sweet sentiment one minute, starkly played and downcast the next. No pop song has ever bottomed out more than [...] "Holocaust", an anguished plaint sung at a snail's pace over discordant slide-guitar fragments and moaning cello [...] On the up side, there's the delicious pop minuet [...] "Stroke It Noel," [...] the anticipatory magic of [...] "Nightime" [...] ("Caught a <b>glance</b> <b>in</b> your eyes and fell through the skies," [...] Chilton rhapsodizes) [...] Big Star's baroque, guitar-driven pop reaches its apotheosis on songs like [...] "Kizza Me," [...] "Thank You Friends" [...] and [...] "O, Dana".

500|$|An {{editorial}} by {{the staff}} of The Hindu highlighted a different narrative in India and the Indian diaspora regarding her win and colorism. The editorial suggested that rather than hold a pageant title in India, [...] "the dark complexioned 24-year-old [...] would not have stood a chance…had she been in India, far from entering a beauty contest, {{it is more likely}} that Ms Davuluri would have grown up hearing mostly disparaging remarks about the colour of her skin; she would have been — going by the storyline of most “fairness” cream advertisements — a person with low self-esteem and few friends." [...] Dean Asha Rangappa (Yale Law School) echoed these sentiments when she stated that [...] "Davuluri is following in the footsteps of other darker-skinned Indian women who have been recognized in America for their talent and beauty, like The Office’s Mindy Kaling or ER's Parminder Nagra — women who’d never get a second <b>glance</b> <b>in</b> India." [...] Similar remarks appeared in social media and in numerous editorials. Davuluri also discussed the subject with reporters in the American media, stating that she was interested in becoming involved in the [...] "Dark is Beautiful" [...] campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The Moskowitz–Violante crime {{produced}} more witnesses {{than any of}} the other Son of Sam murders; there was one direct eyewitness who was not an intended victim. During the shooting, 19-year-old Tommy Zaino was parked with his date three cars in front of Violante's vehicle. Moments before the shooting, Zaino caught a peripheral glimpse of the shooter's approach and happened to <b>glance</b> <b>in</b> his rear view mirror just in time to see the actual shooting. Zaino clearly saw the perpetrator for several seconds due to the bright street light and full moon and later described him as being 25 to 30 years old, of average height— to —with shaggy hair that was dark blond or light brown. Zaino said that the shooter's hair [...] "looked like a wig." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a young girl, sixteen-year-old Elisabeth was {{considered}} as a possible bride for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom, known as Bertie). His mother, Queen Victoria, strongly favored her as a prospective daughter-in-law, and urged her daughter Princess Vicky to look further into her. Elisabeth was spending the social season at the Berlin court, where her family hoped she would be tamed into a docile, marriageable princess. Vicky responded, [...] "I do not think her at all distinguée looking—certainly the opposite to Bertie's usual taste", whereas the tall and slender Alexandra of Denmark was [...] "just the style Bertie admires". Bertie was also shown photographs of Elisabeth, but professed himself unmoved and declined {{to give them a}} second <b>glance.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Alexandra was selected for Bertie.|$|E
