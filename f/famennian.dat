5|$|The site {{consists}} of an old quarry of sandstone dated to the <b>Famennian</b> stage in the Late Devonian epoch. It was backfilled in the 1970s with marl. The new soil was re-colonized by pioneer species, which coexist alongside an established afforestation, forming a mosaic of habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone that}} was quarried is arkose of the <b>Famennian</b> stage. Approximately 360 million years ago, {{the thrust of}} forming Gondwana plates raised the seabed. Meanwhile, an ice age {{occurred}} in regions near the poles. Marine regression allowed sedimentation of detrital sand and clays which left large shoals of hard sandstone with ripple marks, alternating with levels more or less shaley according to their clay's content.|$|E
5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} as the Late Devonian extinction; one at the end of the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following <b>Famennian</b> stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance of primitive tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Those <b>Famennian</b> strata {{represent}} {{the top of}} the Paleozoic series pleated with north dipping. Above, the transgressive Upper Cretaceous overlies horizontally with unconformity. It includes from the bottom to the top a paleozoic boulder conglomerate mixed with a sandy and glauconitic marl matrix, coarse clayey and glauconitic sands, containing Chlamys asper, Ostrea diluviana, Praeactinocamax plenus and finally marl with Terebratulina gracilis. These strata belong to the Cenomanian-Turonian and were deposited between 90 and 100 million years ago, during a transgressive phase.|$|E
500|$|The Paleozoic folded {{outcrops}} of the Bavay-Saint-Waast {{area are}} {{the bedrock of}} the eastern flank of the Mélantois' anticline, where the transgressive Cretaceous (Turonian and Cenomanian chalk) thins, and may eventually disappear by erosion. Strata of Hercynian basement, raised in the East by an important structural horst-type accident, then appear locally. In these Paleozoic strata, the Devonian presents as a sandstone base of the Lower <b>Famennian,</b> where the levels were quarried ...|$|E
500|$|Under the <b>Famennian,</b> the Frasnian consists, {{from top}} to bottom, of nodular gray shale, and mica rich in fossils such as Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Spirigera concentrica, Atrypa reticularis, Orthis striatula, Productus subaculeatus, and Acervularia pentagona. Below this are gray limestone-built beds, rich in corals such as Phacellophyllum caespitosum, Thamnopora boloniensis, {{alternating}} with black shale and nodular limestone containing Cyrtospirifer verneuilli and Phacellophyllum caespitosum. These beds issue from siltation of the [...] present in the Frasnian epoch, 370 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|Non{{vascular}} land {{plants are}} embryophytes that lack the vascular tissues xylem and phloem. They include mosses, liverworts and hornworts. Pteridophytic vascular plants with true xylem and phloem that reproduced by spores germinating into free-living gametophytes evolved during the Silurian period and diversified into several lineages {{during the late}} Silurian and early Devonian. Representatives of the lycopods have survived to the present day. By {{the end of the}} Devonian period, several groups, including the lycopods, sphenophylls and progymnosperms, had independently evolved [...] "megaspory" [...] – their spores were of two distinct sizes, larger megaspores and smaller microspores. Their reduced gametophytes developed from megaspores retained within the spore-producing organs (megasporangia) of the sporophyte, a condition known as endospory. Seeds consist of an endosporic megasporangium surrounded by one or two sheathing layers (integuments). The young sporophyte develops within the seed, which on germination splits to release it. The earliest known seed plants date from the latest Devonian <b>Famennian</b> stage. Following the evolution of the seed habit, seed plants diversified, giving rise to a number of now-extinct groups, including seed ferns, as well as the modern gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms produce [...] "naked seeds" [...] not fully enclosed in an ovary; modern representatives include conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and Gnetales. Angiosperms produce seeds enclosed in a structure such as a carpel or an ovary. Ongoing research on the molecular phylogenetics of living plants appears to show that the angiosperms are a sister clade to the gymnosperms.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, the Late Devonian {{started with}} the Frasnian, , during which the first forests took shape on land. The first {{tetrapods}} appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing <b>Famennian</b> subdivision, {{the beginning and end}} of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian, [...]|$|E
2500|$|A major {{extinction}} {{occurred at}} the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the <b>Famennian</b> faunal stage (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about [...] Mya, when all the fossil agnathan fishes, save for the psammosteid heterostraci, suddenly disappeared. A second strong pulse closed the Devonian period. The Late Devonian extinction was one of five major extinction events in the history of the Earth's biota, and was more drastic than the familiar extinction event that closed the Cretaceous.|$|E
2500|$|The Late Devonian {{extinction}} {{occurred at}} the beginning of the last phase of the Devonian period, the <b>Famennian</b> faunal stage, (the Frasnian-Famennian boundary), about [...] Ma. Many fossil agnathan fishes, save for the psammosteid heterostracans, make their last appearance shortly before this event. The Late Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef-systems.|$|E
2500|$|Onychodus ( [...] , from Greek meaning [...] "claw-tooth") is a genus {{of prehistoric}} lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period (Eifelian - <b>Famennian</b> stages, around 374 to 397 million years ago). It {{is one of}} the best known of the group of onychodontiform fishes. Scattered fossil bones of Onychodus were first {{discovered}} in 1857, in North America, and described by John Strong Newberry. Other species were found in Australia, England, Norway and Germany showing that it had a widespread range.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} {{found the first}} complete insect in the Late Devonian period (...) , in the Strud (Gesves, Belgium) environment from the Bois des Mouches Formation, Upper <b>Famennian.</b> It had unspecialized, 'orthopteroid' mouthparts, indicating an omnivorous diet. This discovery reduces a previous gap of 45 million years in the evolutionary history of insects, part of the arthropod gap (the 'gap' still occurs in the early Carboniferous, coinciding and extending past the Romer's gap for tetrapods, {{which may have been}} caused by low oxygen levels in the atmosphere). Body segments, legs and antennae are visible; however, genitalia were not preserved. The new fossil was named Strudiella devonica; it represents a new species as well. The insect has no wings, but it may be a juvenile.|$|E
2500|$|Placoderms, class Placodermi (plate skinned), are extinct {{armoured}} prehistoric fish, {{which appeared}} about 430 Ma in the Early to Middle Silurian. They were mostly wiped {{out during the}} Late Devonian Extinction event, 378 Ma, though some survived and made a slight recovery in diversity during the <b>Famennian</b> epoch before dying out entirely {{at the close of}} the Devonian, 360 mya; they are ultimately ancestal to modern vertebrates. Their head and thorax were covered with massive and often ornamented armoured plates. The rest of the body was scaled or naked, depending on the species. The armour shield was articulated, with the head armour hinged to the thoratic armour. This allowed placoderms to lift their heads, unlike ostracoderms. Placoderms were the first jawed fish; their jaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches. The chart on the right shows the rise and demise of the separate placoderm lineages: Acanthothoraci, [...] Rhenanida, [...] Antiarchi, [...] Petalichthyidae, [...] Ptyctodontida and Arthrodira.|$|E
2500|$|The Catskill Formation (Upper Devonian, <b>Famennian</b> Stage), {{located in}} Tioga County, Pennsylvania, {{is the site}} of a large sample of small {{individuals}} of Bothriolepis. The sample was collected from a series of rock slabs that consisted of partial or complete, articulated, external skeletons. More than two hundred individuals were found packed closely together with little to no overlap. From this sample, much information regarding characteristics of juvenile Bothriolepis can be determined. A morphometric study performed by Jason Downs and co-authors highlights certain characteristics that indicate juvenility in Bothriolepis, including a moderately large head and moderately large orbital fenestra—both of which are characteristics also recognized by Erik Stensio in 1948 in the smallest B. canadensis individuals. Several other features that Stensio marked indicative of young individuals can also be seen exhibited in the Catskill sample. These features include [...] "delicate dermal bones with ornament consisting of continuous anastomosing ridges rather than tubercles, a dorsal trunk shield narrower than long and with a continuous and pronounced dorsal median ridge, and a pre-median plate that is wider than it is long".|$|E
