5|$|Locking {{multiple}} variables using non-atomic locks {{introduces the}} possibility of program <b>deadlock.</b> An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to lock the same two variables using non-atomic locks, {{it is possible that}} one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and <b>deadlock</b> results.|$|E

Detecting and breaking <b>deadlocks</b> in the network is expensive in terms of latency and resources. So an easy and inexpensive solution is to avoid <b>deadlocks</b> by choosing routing techniques that prevent cyclic acquisition of channels.|$|R
40|$|We will {{formulate}} {{the problem}} of resolving spatial (space occupancy and support-stability) interactions in terms of tools developed in Operating Systems for the problems of <b>deadlocks</b> and synchronization. We show how to construct state graphs and to detect resource contentions and <b>deadlocks</b> from these state graphs. We describe an algorithm, called CONTAC, to deal with <b>deadlocks</b> where 'processes' represent the ordered motions of parts. The algorithm is a monitor-like process using preventative preemptive protocol to resolve higher-degree <b>deadlocks.</b> We develop the representation for knowledge about current allocations, pending requests, and synchronization constraints, to generate a contention-free sequence of actions. In this paper we focus on modeling <b>deadlocks</b> which are manifestations of spatial interactions...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which prevents place/transition systems with finitely many states (boundedness) from running into dead markings. The algorithm determines supplementary places which protect structural <b>deadlocks</b> from becoming insufficiently marked. All steps, {{the determination of}} minimal <b>deadlocks,</b> the test whether <b>deadlocks</b> can be emptied, {{the determination of the}} supplementary places and their initial markings etc., consist in solving systems of linear homogeneous inequalities and equations. The {{algorithm is}} optimal in that the dynamic behaviour of the nets is limited only as far as it is really necessary to prevent undermarking the <b>deadlocks...</b>|$|R

5|$|Further, the Court {{disapproved of}} the judge's having asked the jury for the {{proportions}} of their <b>deadlock</b> (even {{though he did not}} ask how many were for conviction and how many were for acquittal).

5|$|In the {{scheduled}} March 1965 elections, Tshombe's Convention Nationale Congolaise (CONACO) won {{a large majority}} of the seats, but a large part of his party soon defected to form the new Front Démocratique Congolais (FDC) making the overall result unclear as CONACO controlled the Chamber of Deputies while the FDC controlled the Senate. Kasa-Vubu, attempting to use the situation to block Tshombe, appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, Évariste Kimba of the FDC, to be prime minister-designate in November 1965 but the largely pro-Tshombe Parliament refused to ratify the appointment. Instead of seeking a compromise candidate, Kasa-Vubu again unilaterally declared Kimba to be Prime Minister, which was again rejected, creating a political <b>deadlock.</b> With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup, ostensibly to stop the political <b>deadlock,</b> on 25 November 1965.|$|E
5|$|Frederick III's war on Sweden gave Charles X Gustav {{a reason}} to abandon the Polish–Lithuanian <b>deadlock</b> and fight Denmark instead. After marching his army {{to the west and}} making a {{dangerous}} crossing of the frozen straits in the winter of 1657/58, he surprised the unprepared Frederick III on the Danish isles and forced him into surrender. In the Treaty of Roskilde, Denmark had to abandon all Danish provinces in what is now Southern Sweden. The anti-Swedish allies meanwhile neutralized the Transylvanian army and Polish forces ravaged Swedish Pomerania.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} dynamic analysis for finding a broad class of <b>deadlocks,</b> including the well-studied lock-only <b>deadlocks</b> {{as well as}} the less-studied, but no less widespread or insidious, <b>deadlocks</b> involving condition variables. Our analysis consists of two stages. In the first stage, our analysis observes a multi-threaded program execution and generates a simple multi-threaded program, called a trace program, that only records operations observed during the execution that are deemed relevant to finding <b>deadlocks.</b> Such operations include lock acquire and release, wait and notify, thread start and join, and change of values of user-identified synchronization predicates associated with condition variables. In the second stage, our analysis uses an off-the-shelf model checker to explore all possible thread interleavings of the trace program and check if any of them <b>deadlocks.</b> A key advantage of our technique is that it discards most of the program logic which usually causes state-space explosion in model checking, and retains only the relevant synchronization logic in the trace program, which is sufficient for finding <b>deadlocks.</b> We have implemented our analysis for Java, and have applied it to twelve real-world multi-threaded Java programs. Our analysis is effective in practice, finding thirteen previously known as well as four new <b>deadlocks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{sketch a}} {{data-centric}} approach to avoid <b>deadlocks</b> {{of a business}} process. If dependencies between data values are neglected or modelled incorrectly, {{this can lead to}} errors in the control flow of the business process. We address the problem of detecting <b>deadlocks</b> which are caused by the improper handling of data. We show by example, how these <b>deadlocks</b> can be detected by means of a symbolic reachability graph. Under certain conditions, we can derive the correct dependency between the involved data values. This allows to modify the business process in a way so that the detected <b>deadlocks</b> will not be reachable. ...|$|R

Looking to resolve the <b>deadlock</b> with Ajax, Babangida returned to Amsterdam to continue negotiating a termination of his contract with the club. On 30 April 2003, three years since Babangida played his last game for the club, it was announced that both sides had come to an agreement and the player's contract was finally terminated.|$|E
5|$|In 1885 the Democrats redistricted the Indiana state legislature, which {{resulted}} in an increased Democratic majority in 1886, despite an overall Republican majority statewide. In 1887, {{largely as a result}} of the Democratic gerrymandering of Indiana's legislative districts, Harrison was defeated in his bid for reelection. Following a <b>deadlock</b> in the state senate, the state legislature eventually chose Democrat David Turpie as Harrison's successor in the U.S. Senate. Harrison returned to Indianapolis and resumed his law practice, but stayed active in state and national politics.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, Barcelona's opponents were Bayern Munich, {{winners of}} the 2013–14 Bundesliga. They hosted the first leg on 6 May, {{breaking}} the <b>deadlock</b> with two late goals from Messi in a three-minute spell, and an added-time addition by Neymar. Six days later at the Allianz Arena, Bayern took the lead through Medhi Benatia, and Neymar put Barcelona into the lead by half time. Second-half goals by Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller gave Bayern a 3–2 win on the night, but Barcelona advanced 5–3 on aggregate.|$|E

50|$|In {{debugging}} {{of parallel}} computer programs, sometimes failures (such as <b>deadlocks)</b> are not present when debugger's code (which {{was meant to}} help finding a reason for <b>deadlocks</b> by visualising points {{of interest in the}} program code) is attached to the program. This is because additional code changed timing of the execution of parallel processes, and because of that <b>deadlocks</b> were avoided. This type of bug is known colloquially as a Heisenbug, by analogy with the observer effect in quantum mechanics.|$|R
5|$|Noted for the {{extensive}} interference of European powers, the conclave {{was to determine}} whether and on what terms the Council of Trent would reconvene (supported by Charles V and opposed by Henry II) and the fate of the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza (claimed by both Charles V and the House of Farnese). Although the conclave nearly elected Reginald Pole, the late arrival of additional French cardinals pushed the conclave back into <b>deadlock,</b> and eventually Giovanni del Monte was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1975, Whitlam {{intended}} {{to call a}} half-Senate election {{in an attempt to}} break the <b>deadlock.</b> When he went to seek Kerr's approval of the election, Kerr instead dismissed him as Prime Minister and shortly thereafter installed Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware of the change of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and Kerr dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority in the election held the following month.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel dynamic {{analysis}} technique that finds real <b>deadlocks</b> in multi-threaded programs. Our technique runs in two stages. In the first stage, we use an imprecise dynamic analysis technique to find potential <b>deadlocks</b> in a multi-threaded program by observing an {{execution of the}} program. In the second stage, we control a random thread scheduler to create the potential <b>deadlocks</b> with high probability. Unlike other dynamic analysis techniques, our approach has the advantage {{that it does not}} give any false warnings. We have implemented the technique in a prototype tool for Java, and have experimented on a number of large multi-threaded Java programs. We report a number of previously known and unknown real <b>deadlocks</b> that were found in these benchmarks...|$|R
5|$|The {{tank was}} {{designed}} to break the <b>deadlock</b> of trench warfare. In their first use on the Somme, they were placed under command of the infantry and ordered to attack their given targets in groups or pairs. They were also assigned small groups of troops, who served as an escort while providing close defence against enemy attacks. Only nine tanks reached the German lines to engage machine gun emplacements and troop concentrations. On the way, 14 broke down or were ditched, another 10 were damaged by enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|When United States Senator Morton died in 1878, the Republicans {{nominated}} Harrison {{to run for}} the seat, but {{the party}} failed to gain a majority in the state legislature, which at that time elected senators; the Democratic majority elected Daniel W. Voorhees instead. In 1879, President Hayes appointed Harrison to the Mississippi River Commission, which worked to develop internal improvements on the river. As a delegate to the 1880 Republican National Convention the following year, he was instrumental in breaking a <b>deadlock</b> on candidates, and James A. Garfield won the nomination.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a <b>deadlock</b> between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the <b>deadlock</b> by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E

50|$|Database locks {{can be used}} as a {{means of}} {{ensuring}} transaction synchronicity. i.e. when making transaction processing concurrent (interleaving transactions), using 2-phased locks ensures that the concurrent execution of the transaction turns out equivalent to some serial ordering of the transaction. However, <b>deadlocks</b> become an unfortunate side-effect of locking in databases. <b>Deadlocks</b> are either prevented by pre-determining the locking order between transactions or are detected using waits-for graphs. An alternate to locking for database synchronicity while avoiding <b>deadlocks</b> involves the use of totally ordered global timestamps.|$|R
