2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
60|$|During the long, slow {{journey in}} the {{carriage}} {{to the cemetery}} my mother did not raise her veil. It was not until {{she reached out and}} seized my hand, convulsively, that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> was still a part of my existence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I said {{everything}} I could say {{as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> was {{trying to avoid the}} topic. I said, 'It is no use your telling me about this walk and pretend I've been told about the ball, because you haven't. Your father has forbidden you to go!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Barbara, quietly, [...] "there is a {{good deal}} that you must never remember, too. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that"--and <b>she</b> stopped with a little shiver--"when you were lying in the Vancouver hospital." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was looking," [...] he answered, [...] "for the child, {{the little}} black-frocked child, you know, {{with the hair}} down her back, and the tearful eyes. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> had {{vanished}} so completely." ...|$|R
60|$|With a shock, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> {{spoke only}} the plain truth. Indeed, her thin eager face {{contracted}} then, and ever afterward I {{was glad that}} moved by some impulse I stooped and reverently kissed the fragile hand.|$|R
5000|$|Hollcraft {{was born}} in Portland, Oregon. She began singing and writing songs {{at a young age}} and started playing guitar when she was 10 years old. When she was 13, a family friend {{recorded}} her at a choir event in school. The tape found its way to Meredith Brooks, who had been looking for a new artist to develop. [...] "Bec has a powerhouse voice, and when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> could write songs, too… I was sold,” said Meredith.|$|E
5000|$|Mike Weatherford of Las Vegas Review-Journal {{stated that}} [...] "Newton-John said herself in an {{interview}} that she’s not a 'razzmatazz' performer. But not long into this by-the-numbers retrospective, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> is an entertainer" [...] and [...] "If you expect anything more ambitious from the forever 'nice girl' at this point, well that would just be mean". Steve Bornfeld of Vegas Seven described Summer Nights as a show which [...] "reflects what Newton-John has always been: a lovely woman with a pretty voice singing sweet ballads and catchy pop tunes without an ounce of artifice or affectation". Sam Masseur of Vegas Chatter wrote: [...] "For anyone who’s ever enjoyed an Olivia Newton-John song, Summer Nights will be a perfect evening of entertainment".|$|E
5000|$|Director Bogdanovich was {{initially}} reluctant {{to produce a}} biopic, because he was unsatisfied about being {{the subject of a}} biopic himself, in Star 80 (1983). He explained: [...] "I didn’t know if I wanted to do it, because I knew the people a little bit. I’d met Natalie a few times, nodded at her at parties, and same thing with Robert Wagner. I also knew I didn’t like being portrayed in the films about Dorothy Stratten. But then I decided: Somebody’s gonna do this, and I thought I’d be more sensitive because of my experiences. Besides, by then I {{had fallen in love with}} Natalie and her work. In Love With the Proper Stranger, Inside Daisy Clover, This Property Is Condemned, her performances are brilliant, really brilliant. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> was really underrated as an actress — and that, up until then, I had been one of the people who underrated her." ...|$|E
60|$|I started violently at {{the sound}} of my name, at the new note in her voice, at the change in the woman as I turned. And then before <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> what <b>she</b> had done she had come to me swiftly and laid her hand upon my arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as {{a matter}} of fact," [...] said Halibut, [...] "she refused me, but so nicely and so gently that I {{scarcely}} minded it. In fact, at first <b>I</b> hardly <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> had refused me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But please remember, sir," [...] {{he begged}} apologetically, [...] "that I {{had never seen}} the lady. I sent the cables, {{confidently}} anticipating that she would disclaim all knowledge of Mr. Bundercombe. When <b>she</b> arrived, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> was actually his wife, I forgave him freely for all the small annoyances he had caused me: my visit to you this morning, in fact, is entirely in his interests." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter in 2009, [...] Daryl Hall recalled,John had written a prototype of [...] "Maneater"; he was banging it around with Edgar Winter. It was like a reggae song. I said, [...] "Well, the chords are interesting, but I think we should change the groove." [...] I changed it to that Motown kind of groove. So we did that, and I played it for Sara Allen and sang it for her…Sings [...] "Oh here she comes / Watch out boy she’ll chew you up / Oh here she comes / She's a maneater… and a…" [...] I forget what the last line was. She said, [...] "drop that shit {{at the end and}} go, 'She's a maneater,' and stop! And I said, 'No, you’re crazy, that's messed up.'" [...] Then I thought about it, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> was right. And it made {{all the difference in the}} song.|$|E
5000|$|Cooper started boxing in 1996, {{after meeting}} trainer James Pena at the Nevada Partners gym in Las Vegas.Pena recalls {{that at first}} he {{did not realize that}} Cooper was a girl, because she was with three boys and the hood of her coat was over her head. [...] "There were a group of kids there, and I asked them all if they wanted to box, but no one really wanted to. Then I asked Melinda, 'How about you?' and she said she'd try it. It wasn't until the next day <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> was a girl.""I told her, `Oh, sweetheart, I can't let you box. You're a girl. I can't let you box with the boys.' But she said she wanted to try and box them."She lasted four rounds that first day, and made an {{impression}} on Pena, who had never trained a female before. [...] "I told her, `If you want to box, show up at 3:30 and don't be late. Every day since, she's showed up at 3:30." [...] Pena later became Cooper's legal guardian.|$|E
5000|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} the annual ASA conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions.

5000|$|Camren Bicondova as Selina [...] "Cat" [...] Kyle - In March 2014, Bicondova was {{confirmed}} to {{have joined the}} shows cast. According to Bicondova, [...] "The main word that I can think of to characterize Selina is that shes just surviving. Shes very mischievous and very challenging to play at times, because she feels emotions but <b>she</b> hides them. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> isnt just a street thief and a survivor; shes actually a normal girl." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently Aunt Olivia {{came down}} the long {{twilight}} arcade. Her bright hair was uncovered and she looked slim and queen-like in her light dress. We thought Aunt Olivia very pretty then. Looking back from a mature standpoint <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> that <b>she</b> {{must have been an}} unusually beautiful woman; and she looked her prettiest as she stood under the swaying boughs in the last faint light of the autumn dusk and smiled down at our woebegone faces.|$|R
60|$|Eve {{sat down}} and began to laugh softly to herself. She {{had a habit of}} {{laughing}} almost altogether with her eyes in a way that expressed more genuine enjoyment than anything <b>I</b> have ever <b>realized.</b> <b>She</b> rocked herself gently backward and forward. Mr. Moss looked at us both a little suspiciously.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was a great}} {{surprise}} for everyone that, after elected, Lula chose Rousseff as the incumbent Minister. The President elect declared: [...] "Already near 2002, it appears there a comrade with a little computer in her hand. We started debating and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> had a differential characteristic from the others who were there, because she came in with the practicality of the assignment of running the Secretary of Energy of Rio Grande do Sul. Then I was like: I think I found my Minister here." [...] Another factor which would have weighed heavily on Lula's choice was the sympathy that Antonio Palocci had for Rousseff, recognizing {{that she would have}} a much easier dialogue with the private sector than Pinguelli, in addition to her support of the Carta aos Brasileiros (Letter to the Brazilian People), agreeing with several market friendly changes in the Workers' Party. Dutra said he was consulted by Lula, and praised Rousseff's technical merits while Secretary of Energy during his administration. [...] "I could have weighted the scale in her favor at that time, but from the transition government forward the merit is all hers," [...] he recalled. After her appointment, she became very close to José Dirceu, appointed by Lula as the new Chief of Staff of Brazil.|$|E
5000|$|A sweet, soft-spoken {{young woman}} {{of black and}} American Indian ancestry, whose {{marriage}} to Richard violated the state's anti-miscegenation law. During 2013, while preparing for Midnight Special, casting director Francine Maisler suggested Negga to Jeff Nichols and Sarah Green. Negga {{was the first person}} director Nichols auditioned for the role and he revealed that he thought she was too petite when he first met her, but her acting abilities changed his mind, wherein he stated, [...] "She spoke in Mildred's voice. She held her mouth like Mildred ... I wasn't looking for star power. I was looking for great actors." [...] After she successfully auditioned for the role of Mildred, Nichols sent Negga excerpts of his yet-to-be-finished screenplay and a copy of Nancy Buirski's The Loving Story (2011). Of Negga's audition, Nichols stated, [...] "Ruth had the voice, she had the posture, the facial expressions. It wasn't until after we were done and I started to speak with her that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> had an Irish accent ... She was Mildred. When she left the room I turned to Green and Maisler and said, ‘Well, do we really have to see anyone else?’" [...] On what attracted her to Nichols' film, and the part of Mildred, Negga stated, [...] "I've never seen that kind of story told in this manner before. You know, the screenplay is so beautiful and I wanted very much to be part of that. Having become familiar with them, I think their story needs to be told and shared and honored and celebrated." [...] On the character of Mildred, Negga stated, [...] "Mildred was the spine of the couple. She saw what maybe Richard didn’t want to see, that they weren't {{going to get out of}} this by running away or putting their heads in the sand. She was a very astute woman. After those five days in jail, she realized that the fairy tale was over." [...] Negga spoke of the personal connection she felt to the Lovings' story, because of her own background as a mixed-race person. Nichols invited Negga and Edgerton to Virginia for two weeks to visit the various locations, do prep work, and visiting special places related to Richard and Mildred, two weeks prior to post-production. Negga deeply identified with Mildred’s sense of connection to a place, with her drawing comparisons to Limerick, Ireland and Richmond, Virginia, by her stating that: [...] "Virginia isn't that different from Ireland ... Land and home and community are super important. When I was playing her, I tried to imagine I couldn't go home again because of whom I married. It must have drained the lifeblood from her." [...] On the unassuming couple, Negga stated, [...] "They were poor, relatively uneducated. Mildred was a bit more educated than he was, but I think everyone else underestimated their tenacity, their belief in themselves, their love for each other, and their respect for each other." [...] In an interview with The Boston Globe, Negga spoke of having [...] "already been gifted, personally" [...] by playing Mildred and getting to know her surviving family, to which she later remarked, [...] "She's my hero. But what's important is that people are coming out of this movie genuinely moved because what they see is kindness. In many ways, Mildred would have been uncomfortable the attention but their legacy is important ... I think schoolchildren will know their names." ...|$|E
40|$|Twelve years ago, I hiked through Haleakala Crater with my rifle. Early Friday afternoon, the day I {{was to meet}} {{three friends}} that evening at the Waikamoi Preserve in the Koolau Gap for an {{overnight}} camp, I walked into a small herd of goats just off the non-maintained trail. As part of my duty in the crater was to eradicate these "threats to indigenous lifeforms," I killed maybe three ofthem. Because {{it was a short}} trip I carried a meat sack; I would carry the goat meat out the next day. I approached the most easily reached carcass, lay my rifle and backpack on the ground, and drew out my knife. When I touched the nanny, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> bore keiki. Although the National Park considered it a bonus to kill a hapai nanny, I viewed it as an aborted celebration...|$|E
60|$|That {{day was the}} longest, bitterest, I {{had ever}} known, for the reason that, mixed with my grief, my sense of remorse, was a feeling of utter helplessness. In desperate desire for haste I could only lumpishly wait. Another day of agony, another interminable night of pain must pass before I could reach the shadowed Homestead. Nothing could shorten the interval. Then, too, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> whom <b>I</b> would comfort had already gone beyond my aid, beyond any comfort I could send.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it cloaks {{a deeper}} feeling. One of the noblest women I ever knew used to laugh merrily when she foozled a short putt. It was only later, when I {{learned that in}} the privacy of her home she would weep bitterly and bite holes in the sofa cushions, that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> did but wear the mask. Continue to {{encourage}} your fiancee to play the game, my boy. Much happiness will reward you. I could tell you a story----" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first thing}} his manager did was {{get me in}} my bedroom, which was also the office, and corner me about the 1,500 bucks. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that if <b>she</b> was in here, then DOOM was with Madlib, and the longer I kept up this charade with her, the longer they’ll vibe and maybe it all might work out.|$|R
60|$|Of all the ingenuous {{declarations}} I {{have ever}} heard, this one copped the proverbial bun. It {{struck me as}} so funny that, {{even in the face}} of death, I laughed. Death, I may remark here, had, however, lost much of his terror for me. I had become a disciple of Lys' fleeting philosophy of the valuelessness of human life. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> was quite right--that we were but comic figures hopping from the cradle to the grave, of interest to practically no other created thing than ourselves and our few intimates.|$|R
6000|$|I agreed. A new and indescribable note {{had come}} into Mrs. Scherer's voice, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she,</b> too, was aware of that flaw in the redoubtable Mr. Scherer which none of his {{associates}} had guessed. It would have been strange {{if she had not}} discovered it. [...] "She is beautiful, yes," [...] the lady continued critically, [...] "but she is not to compare with your wife. She has not the heart,--it is so with all your people of society. For them it is not what you are, but what you have done, and what you have." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jon Hamm {{elaborated}} on {{the difficulty}} of filming the heavy emotional scenes with Elisabeth Moss in which Jon Hamm breaks down after learning of Anna's death, saying that [...] "Episode eight, everyone is starting to get exhausted. When we had those lines together, just looking at Elisabeth’s face, when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she’s</b> heard this entire phone call, how completely awash with emotion she was, {{it seemed like the}} only response to that was to just completely break down and let it all go. It’s a remarkable alchemy between writing, acting, directing, lighting, and everything else for them to make that a really nice moment." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} Thelma, on {{the other}} hand, was first written as a character who [...] "had kids and stuff like that, but <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> couldn’t have kids. The idea that Darryl wanted her to wait, because the kids would be a sacrifice for him financially, fit perfectly. And, of course, she’s really a child herself. I had {{to set it up}} that way. I love to laugh, and I wanted this to be a movie you were enjoying and having a good time with because you were watching these women get their lives. Even though they would lose them, they were becoming more and more themselves. It was a beautiful experience, a liberating experience to watch that." ...|$|R
40|$|On a {{visit to}} the Mesquakie Settlement during May of this year, one elder told me that there were too many distractions for the {{children}} to fully comprehend the traditions as she had learned them as a child. As I reflected on her comments, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> truly had cause for alarm: Although Mesquakies have contended with many, many great pressures since their removal and return to Iowa during the last century, they have only in recent history had to contend with the all-pervasive power of television to create, destroy, distort, form, mold, and shape images of reality [...] although television is less brutalizing than some educational experiences many Mesquakies had in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools...|$|R

60|$|I was silent. Her {{point of}} view, eminently {{sensible}} as it was, exasperated me. We were {{leaning over the}} parapet of a little-stone bridge. Her face was turned away from me, but presently <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> was crying. Men and women, villagers, passing across the bridge, looked at us curiously. I was miserable, and somewhat appalled; resentful, yet striving to be gentle and conciliatory. I assured {{her that she was}} talking nonsense, that I loved her. But I did not really love her at that moment; nor did she relent as easily as usual. It was not until we were together in our sitting-room, a few hours later, that she gave in. I felt a tremendous sense of relief.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{looked as}} if she had been moulded into her gown. The Parisian robe and the hair piled high, were fast--undeniably theatric, but her little face was sweet and girlish, almost childish. Well, she had glamour, largely {{physical}} as you say. But like the heroes of E. P. Roe's novels, I aspired to awaken her soul. She was pleased with me apparently. I called soon after the reception--I always follow up each case of glamour. I knew she was rich but <b>I</b> did not <b>realize</b> <b>she</b> commanded such an establishment.|$|R
5000|$|While {{starring}} {{in a play}} in Los Angeles, titled The Seventh Year, Burgess was approached by Jack Murton, a talent scout for Paramount Pictures. While visiting the studio, she was approached by Cecil B. DeMille, {{who at the time}} was looking to cast a supporting part in The Plainsman (1936). Burgess auditioned for the part of Louisa Cody, opposite James Ellison, and was cast by DeMille. DeMille was quoted on his casting of Burgess: [...] "I broke a rule of 25 years' standing when I chose Miss Burgess for the part of Louisa Cody. It {{was the first time that}} I have cast a player without previous screen experience in an important role. But, as soon as I saw Miss Burgess, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that <b>she</b> had the making of a strong and appealing screen personality." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] said Harriet, after Elizabeth had gone, [...] "she really feels worse {{over her}} past {{attitude}} toward you than she does over Harold's death? <b>I</b> think <b>she</b> <b>realizes</b> now what <b>I</b> {{have told her}} from the first, that she never really loved him. Of course, her pride has suffered terribly, but she will get over that quickly enough.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the fair}} opened, {{a few minutes}} before 5 p.m., Leona Rostenberg {{wondered}} out loud what we had all wondered silently: would our fair attract any visitors at all? Then, before <b>I</b> had <b>realized</b> it, <b>she</b> had ducked outside to see whether anyone had come. When she returned, her face reflected radiance and disbelief. ‘They're standing in line to get in! There are crowds outside!’ Despite rain and storm, the jams of people on opening night filled us with incredulity and exuberance.|$|R
50|$|Little Pipö was {{not only}} my last family link to the past. She was also the {{organizer}} of the day-to-day details of my life, the sharer of my innermost feelings. She knew with an uncanny instinct when to keep me free from interruption when I was immersed in scientific work, and when to open the gate to entertainment and gaiety. <b>I</b> never <b>realized</b> until <b>she</b> was gone how close we were {{to each other and}} how much I depended on her.|$|R
