5000|$|Planing hulls - These are hulls with a {{shape that}} allows the boat to rise higher and higher {{out of the water}} as the speed increases. They are {{commonly}} fine bowed. Sail boats that plane are flat-bottomed aft. Because sail boats sail heeled over, the flat surface can be achieved with v or arc bottom shapes. Hydroplanes are very light, flat bottomed, high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water but quickly become unstable in any waves. Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V-bottomed with a <b>deadrise</b> <b>angle</b> of about 20-23 degrees. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved, and are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. They require more energy in the form of large sails or high power motors plus light weight to achieve these speeds.|$|E
