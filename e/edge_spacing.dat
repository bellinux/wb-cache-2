The electron gun was designed to satisfy the stringent injection specifications required for the linac to demonstrate a 20 MeV beam with a bunch current of 100 A and a normalized emittance of 5 mm-mradian. Fine mesh simulations of the electron gun optics revealed that, to minimize geometric contributions to the source emittance, a very tight tolerance (± 25 µm) was required for the <b>edge</b> <b>spacing</b> between the cathode and focus electrode. Means of accurately locating the gun electrodes are discussed; and the vacuum demountable features that enable convenient field replacement of the anode, focus electrode and cathode/heater are described. ...|$|E

The angular grinding is first classified into three basic types, an external, a surface and an internal angular grinding, depending on the axis angle between the wheel and the work axes. The undeformed chip shape, which {{is characterized by the}} interference angle, the maximum chip thicknes and the chip length, is then analyzed in each type of angular grinding. The effects of grinding conditions such as the axis angle, the speed ratio, the radius ratio and the successive cutting <b>edge</b> <b>spacing</b> upon the geometry of undeformed chip are discussed to make clear the relations between the basic boundary conditions and the working conditions in angular grinding...|$|E

40|$|Recurrent {{bursts of}} toroidicity-induced Alfvén {{eigenmodes}} (TAE) are studied using a self-consistent simulation model. Bursts of beam ion losses {{observed in the}} neutral beam injection experiment at the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor are reproduced using experimental parameters. Only co-injected beam ions build up to a significant stored energy even though their distribution is flattened in the plasma center. They are not directly lost as their orbits extend beyond the outer plasma edge when the core plasma leans on a high field side limiter. The time evolution of the beam ion density during a burst and the particle loss mechanism are presented. In the simulation, {{the distance to the}} limiter is decreased after the stored beam energy saturates. We show that the co-passing beam particles may not readily reach the limiter even if the orbit width of edge-located particles is larger than outer <b>edge</b> <b>spacing</b> between the limiter and plasma. For the parameters of this run the stored energy of the co-injected beam density only drops rapidly, after the gap width from the plasma edge to the limiter becomes less than 0. 3 of the minor radius. The existence of KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) surfaces of the edge mode even at large field amplitudes apparently inhibits energetic co-passing particles from being lost to the limiter at larger gap widths.

"May 2011 "This thesis describes the design, modeling, fabrication and characterization of a micromachined array of high density 3 -dimensional microposts (100 × 100) made of flexible material (silicone elastomers) for use to measure quantitatively the cellular traction force generated by vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) with high sensitivity and accuracy. The micropost arrays were then fabricated with diameters ranged from 3 to 10 μm, with edge to <b>edge</b> <b>spacing</b> of 5 and 7 μm, and with a height to diameter aspect radio up to 13 using microfabrication techniques and replica molding. The mechanical properties of the Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microposts with various geometries used in the cell culture experiment were determined experimentally including detailed measurements of Young's modulus (E) and the corresponding spring constant. We have found that microposts with different sizes and geometries have different Young's. Vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured on top of the micropost arrays and incubated for 2 days before an image acquisition experiment. The micropost arrays with different geometries were used to study VSMCs. We have found that the traction force exerted by VSM cell increases as the stiffness of the micropost increases. It demonstrates that VSM cell tends to adjust its traction force to adapt to its physical environment. VSMCs with integrin-linked kinase enzyme (ILKE), referred to as CK 4 cell, and without ILK module, referred as ILK cell, were also studied using PDMS micropost array. This study indicates that the function of ILK molecule is involved to the VSMC contraction and the control its traction force. Finally, high temporal resolution analysis of CK 4 cells was performed on PDMS micropost array...|$|E
