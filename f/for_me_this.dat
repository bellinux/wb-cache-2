I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E

Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody else would be the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. <b>For</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> {{is not something that}} can be swept under the rug and forgotten in the interest of enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E

He continued, saying that [...] "I saw two rows of windows and knew that this was a Boeing. I knew this was a civilian plane. But <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> meant nothing. It is easy to turn a civilian type of plane into one for military use."

[...] Volk started the season strong, intercepting a pass in the season opener against the New York Jets. [...] In the second game of the season, the Dolphins played the Colts in Baltimore. [...] Volk intercepted two passes against Baltimore quarterback Bill Troup and helped the Dolphins to a 420 win. [...] After the game, Volk told reporters, [...] "I wanted to have a good game in Baltimore, and I couldn't have asked for anything better than the way it turned out." [...] While Volk began the 1978 season as a starter, he was replaced by Charlie Babb for the final four games. [...] After the Dolphins lost the AFC wildcard game to the Oilers, Volk announced his retirement. Volk told reporters he had wanted to end his career with a championship team and added, [...] "When the game's over, you can't worry about it. [...] For most of the guys, there'll be another season. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> is it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some media sources {{proposed}} that the dress {{could be interpreted as}} anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable {{as long as it was}} a social or political statement, and not just a [...] "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations. <b>For</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> evening, if we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat." [...] She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an 'A', saying [...] "Community is going {{away for a}} while, but it's going away with an episode that reminds me why I love the show so much. This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey. Of course, that could well have been the point." ...|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} generally {{positive response}} from critics. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Road to the North Pole" [...] a positive review, stating {{that it is}} [...] "a satisfying episode of Family Guy all around, filled with funny gags and nice moments." [...] He especially praised the musical segments, and the portrayal of the North Pole, writing that [...] "the way the episode kept piling more and more ridiculous horrors {{on top of each}} other kept the whole thing funny." [...] He rated the episode an [...] "A-". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the songs and the depiction of Santa's factory, though he found the delivery of the episode's message [...] "heavy-handed." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.6 out of 5 stars. She said, [...] "I had mixed feelings about this one, despite its clever moments and hopeful ending. [...] While I normally have no problems about Family Guys shocking or offensive themes, I felt bit disconcerted about the direction of this Christmas episode." [...] She went on to say, [...] "Perhaps it was the way that the series stomped on something as innocent as Santa and his elves and twisted them all around. Or perhaps it was the cannibalistic reindeer. [...] Whatever the specific reason, the irreverent nature of Family Guy seemed just a little too graphic <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> time around." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number twelve on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "Christmas comedy gold", praising the 'Christmastime is Killing Us' song and Boreanaz's cameo.|$|E

[...] {{in response to the}} light departure from the band's previous works. He praised the album as a singular piece writing that [...] "From start to end the album is a solid listening experience, offering more with every additional spin.

2500|$|In 1974, after {{a sabbatical}} of several years, Harrison {{attempted}} {{to return to}} her career. She desperately wanted the role of Roy Scheider's wife in Jaws, and urged her husband to give it to her. Zanuck asked director Steven Spielberg if he would consider Harrison, but Spielberg preferred actress Lorraine Gary, whom he had seen in a TV movie, The Marcus Nelson Murders, and cast her instead of Harrison [...] "because she was right for the part." [...] Harrison was upset over Spielberg's preference for Gary, feeling that her husband should have gotten her the part. [...] "I really wanted Dick to go to bat <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> one time." [...] As a consolation, Universal chief Sid Sheinberg, Lorraine Gary's husband, got Harrison a part in Airport 1975 as Gloria Swanson's personal assistant, Winnie. Though the movie starred Harrison's long-time idol, Charlton Heston, Harrison had no scenes with him, and [...] "would have much rather had Jaws on my resume." [...] Years later, in an April 2012 interview, Harrison offered a reason she had lost the role because [...] "They said Roy Scheider couldn't get a girl as beautiful as me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>this</b> is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E

2500|$|Khouri is a screenwriter, director, producer, feminist, lecturer, {{and author}} of non-fiction. She also worked as an actress, lecturer, and waiter in Nashville. While working {{for a company that}} made {{commercials}} and music videos, she began writing Thelma & Louise, her first produced screenplay. Thelma & Louise won Khouri the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, a Golden Globe Award, and a PEN Literary Award, as well as the London Film Critics Circle Award for Film of the Year and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. According to an interview done by David Konow, a scholarly author and journalist, Callie Khouri mentioned her experience filming her first major film, Thelma & Louise. “While I was writing Thelma and Louise, it was the most fun I had ever had in my life, bar none,” she says. “It was such a pure experience. There was no self-censorship there, there was no second guessing. From a creative standpoint, it was the freest I had ever been in my life. I loved every moment I got to spend time with those characters. Nothing came close to it, including winning all the awards and everything else. As much fun as all that was, it wasn’t as much fun as sitting alone in a crummy office on Vine at 2 in the morning writing that screenplay.” At the Oscar ceremony she said, [...] "for everyone who wanted to see a happy ending for 'Thelma and Louise', <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>this</b> is it," [...] brandishing the statue high. After winning the Academy Awards for her best screenplay, she felt motivated enough to continue on with her career and express [...] "her feelings about the lack of female directors in Hollywood", not to mention that most of her career began because of her stand on women's rights. In an interview done by The Huffington Post, she addressed that adult women [...] "are a market that I feel is underserved in the entertainment population at large. I don’t see the kind of women represented that I know or that I’m attracted to.
