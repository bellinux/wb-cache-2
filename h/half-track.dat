5|$|The M9 <b>Half-track</b> was a <b>half-track</b> {{produced}} by International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies. It {{was designed to}} provide a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car. It had the same body and chassis as the M5 <b>Half-track</b> (also built by International Harvester for lend-lease) but had the same stowage and radio fit as the M2 Half Track.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} supply U.S. allies, much more {{production}} was required than was possible through the firms producing the M2 (and the larger M3 <b>Half-track).</b> International Harvester (IH) could produce half-tracks, but some differences {{had to be}} accepted due to different manufacturing methods and components. This led to IH producing for lend-lease the M5 <b>Half-track</b> and M9 as equivalents for the M3 and M2 respectively.|$|E
5|$|M14 <b>Half-track</b> – This variant had {{the same}} {{armament}} as the M13 but used the slightly different M5 <b>Half-track</b> chassis built by International Harvester for the Lend-Lease Program. The M14 was mostly supplied to Britain, where they were converted back to regular half-tracks. A total of 1602 were produced by International Harvester.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, the Germans {{used these}} {{captured}} <b>half-tracks</b> extensively {{under the name}} Leichter Zugkraftwagen 37.With German <b>half-tracks</b> in short supply, Major Alfred Becker of the 21. Panzerdivision (which in 1944 was stationed near Caen in Normandy) suggested converting captured French vehicles. He ordered the conversion of several hundred Unic <b>half-tracks</b> into U304(f) light armoured personnel carriers.|$|R
50|$|The larger {{force of}} eight Centurion Tanks, {{followed}} by 400 paratroopers mounted in 40 open-topped <b>half-tracks</b> and 60 engineers in 10 more <b>half-tracks,</b> headed for Samu; while a smaller force of three tanks and 100 paratroopers and engineers in 10 <b>half-tracks</b> headed towards two smaller villages: Kirbet El-Markas and Kirbet Jimba. According to Terrence Prittie's Eshkol: The Man and the Nation, 50 houses were destroyed, but the inhabitants had been evacuated hours before.|$|R
50|$|<b>Half-tracks</b> were {{extensively}} used after World War II {{until the}} late 1960s, mostly in form of surplus World War II vehicles. <b>Half-tracks</b> would see combat with the French Army in the First Indochina War and the Algeria War, in the Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts, and the early wars of the Arab-Israeli conflict. <b>Half-tracks</b> were in use by the Israeli Army until recently, where they were deemed to outperform fully tracked and fully wheeled vehicles for non-combat payload tasks such as carrying telecommunications equipment.|$|R
5|$|M16 – A T1E2 with a M45D Quad-mount and a M3 <b>Half-track</b> chassis.|$|E
5|$|T1E4/M13 – The Martin turret was {{replaced}} by the M33 and was based on the M3 <b>Half-track.</b> It was accepted as the M13 <b>Half-track</b> in July 1942. A total of 139 examples of this variant saw action at Anzio as a ground support weapon used to repel heavy German attacks. It {{was replaced}} by the M16 in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The chassis {{was derived}} from the T1E2 chassis, an earlier version of the M13. Based on an M3 <b>Half-track</b> chassis, it {{replaced}} the M13 MGMC <b>half-track</b> after early 1944. As aircraft became more advanced, the usefulness of the M16 was reduced. In the Korean War, it was relegated primarily to the ground-support role, being put out of service in the U.S. Army in 1951.|$|E
50|$|The leading <b>half-tracks</b> {{lost their}} way and {{approached}} the position where it was strongest instead from the rear. From a few hundred meters they {{came under heavy fire}} from the Syrians. One by one the nine Sherman tanks and 19 <b>half-tracks</b> were disabled by gunfire or mines.|$|R

5|$|General manager Kytölä {{travelled}} to France and West Germany in 1947 {{and early}} 1948 to buy military surplus {{materials from the}} Western Allies. He bought 425 White Motor Company M2 <b>Half-Track</b> vehicles, 186 lorry engines, 304 Cadillac V8 engines, 4 Mack ED diesel engines, 2 Hercules Diesel DFXE engines, 11,000 GMC wheels and one 45-tonne-capacity trailer. Trading was organised through the Ministry of Supply and the first delivery arrived in March 1948. The White <b>Half-Track</b> vehicles were without armour; Kytölä's idea was to equip them with superstructures for field or forest clearing, or to convert them into Four-wheel drive lorries by replacing the tracks with a conventional rear axle. In total, VAT sold 359 units as half-tracks, and 60 were converted into 4×4 or 4×2 vehicles. These lorries were sold as Vanaja VaWh. Some of the <b>half-track</b> vehicles were scrapped for parts; the last was sold in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, {{development}} {{began to}} produce a vehicle {{in response to a}} long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack. The first vehicle produced {{in the development of a}} half track with an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a Bendix machine gun mountas used on jeepson a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a power-operated Bendix mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson mount. The T1E3 had an electro-dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 <b>Half-track</b> by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 <b>Half-track</b> chassis with the M3 <b>Half-track</b> chassis.|$|E
5|$|T1E1 – Another {{prototype}} {{that used}} the Bendix mount on a M2 <b>Half-track</b> Car. It was cancelled in April 1942.|$|E

5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major difference, was that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 <b>Half-track</b> while the M21 was based on the M3 <b>Half-track).</b> The major difference was the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5|$|The Ordnance Department {{followed}} {{suit and a}} new 81mm MMC, the T19 MMC, was created, {{which was based on}} the M3 <b>Half-track.</b> The T19 went through its developmental trials, which were completed in July 1943, and the vehicle was later standardized as the M21 MMC. Unlike the M4 mortar carriage, which was based on the M2 Half Track Car, the M21 was based on the M3 <b>Half-track</b> with a longer and roomier rear.|$|E
5|$|The T30 HMC was {{originally}} conceived in 1941 as an interim design to fulfil the Armored Force's requirement for an assault gun to equip tank and armored reconnaissance units. The Ordnance Department design {{was based on}} the M3 <b>Half-track</b> in order that it could be brought into service quickly. A prototype vehicle was authorized in October 1941 armed with an M1A1 75mm Pack Howitzer and a mount that was designed to fit on a simple box structure in the back of an M3 <b>Half-track.</b>|$|E

5|$|T1E2 – This variant was {{essentially}} the same as the T1E1 except the Bendix mount was replaced with the M33 Maxson mount. After the M33 was replaced with the M45 Quadmount it was accepted as the M16 <b>Half-track.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 2,877 were {{produced}} by the White Motor Company {{during the period from}} May 1943 to March 1944, while 568 M13s and 109 T10 Half-tracks were also converted into M16s. Further production of the M13 and M14 was ceased in favor of production of the M16 and M17 (an M16 built on a M5 <b>Half-track</b> chassis).|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 <b>half-track</b> was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 <b>half-track</b> chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E

It was equipped with four 0.5inch (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine guns in a M45 Quadmount. 2700 were produced by White Motor Company from May 1943 to March 1944, with 568 M13 MGMCs and 109 T10 Half-tracks being converted into M16s as well.|$|E
5|$|The M21 Mortar Motor Carriage (MMC) was a {{self-propelled}} artillery mount on a <b>half-track</b> chassis {{used by the}} United States Army during World War II. It was equipped with an 81mm M1 mortar and an air-cooled M2 Browning machine gun. It was produced by the White Motor Company in 1944. Only 110 examples were produced.|$|E
5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10 (Sonderkraftfahrzeug - special {{motorized}} vehicle) was a German <b>half-track</b> {{that saw}} widespread use in World War II.
