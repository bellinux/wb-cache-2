500|$|After the {{publication}} of this letter, Bernard Becker, special correspondent of the Daily News, traveled to Ireland to cover Boycott's situation. On 24October, he wrote a dispatch from Westport that contained an interview with Boycott. He reported that Boycott had £500 worth of crops that would rot if help {{could not be found}} to harvest them. According to Becker, [...] "Personally he is protected, but no woman in Ballinrobe would dream of washing him a cravat or making him a loaf. All the people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that they are sorry, but that they 'dare not. Boycott had been advised to leave, but he told Becker that [...] "I can hardly desert Lord Erne, and, moreover, my own property is sunk in this place." [...] Becker's report was reprinted in the Belfast News-Letter and the Dublin Daily Express. On 29October, the Dublin Daily Express published a letter proposing a fund to finance a party of men to go to County Mayo to save Boycott's crops. Between them, the Daily Express, Daily Telegraph, Daily News, and News Letter raised £2,000 to fund the relief expedition.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 February 1886 Parnell {{declared}} {{to the voters}} of Galway that [...] "If my candidate is defeated, the news will spread round the universe that a disaster has overwhelmed Ireland. The world will say, 'Parnell is beaten. Ireland has no longer a leader.'" [...] Biggar split with Parnell over this, declaring [...] "Mr. Chairman, all I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> I can't agree with what you state, and if Mr. Lynch [...] goes to the poll I'll support him!".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the speech}} Obama {{and his wife}} were interviewed by Brian Williams, and when asked about what she thought, Michelle replied, [...] "And all I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> honey, you didn't screw it up, so good job." [...] Obama said that he hoped his two daughters had watched the whole event, as their baby-sitter was {{permitted}} to let them stay up only if they watched the convention. Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, called Obama after the speech and told him, [...] "You did well...I just kind of worry about you. I hope you keep your head on straight." [...] She was later quoted by a journalist: [...] "I was a little amazed. It was really quite an exceptional speech, or I'm being prejudiced, I don't know. But, to me, it was really quite exceptional." ...|$|E
60|$|But, as I have said, {{our hero}} {{was too far}} gone now to contain himself until all that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou hast {{not come}} alone, Martha," [...] said the youth, half-displeased. [...] "I told thee that the matter I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> for thine own ear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] says William, [...] "thou hast {{put me to}} silence, and all I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> overthrown; all my {{projects}} are come to nothing, and gone." ...|$|R
60|$|POTHINUS. What I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> {{for your}} ear, {{not for the}} Queen's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, aunt. The {{last word}} I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that I implore {{you not to}} leave Scroope {{as long as you}} are {{comfortable}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuming {{you to be}} a man of sense, my dear Selingman," [...] he remarked, [...] "I {{think that}} what you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> easily surmised. The Englishman!" ...|$|E
60|$|All that Fanny <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> submissively, {{that the}} man was clearly much better; and, she added, he had been {{steadily}} improving ever since he came to the cottage.|$|R
50|$|Ye Gods! What a {{commentator}} is this Ann Alexander whale. What he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> short & pithy & {{very much to}} the point. I wonder if my evil art has raised this monster.|$|R
60|$|He seemed {{unable to}} go on, and yet {{both knew that}} he <b>had</b> {{something}} important <b>to</b> tell them. He looked at them vacantly, as though all he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> suddenly gone out of his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, sir, though, though"--began he--"but, {{of course}} you will allow me, being a stranger--and {{as a man of}} business--all I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> if--that is to say--" ...|$|E
60|$|All we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> that Lord Byron's {{conduct in}} this respect is exactly {{what might have been}} {{expected}} if he had a crime on his conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... “If {{you would}} allow me, my lord,” {{returned}} Archie, “what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> very serious to me; and {{be pleased to}} be humorous after I am gone!” ...|$|E
60|$|What I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> Certainly. Bullfinch (who is {{by nature}} of a hopeful constitution) then began to babble of green geese. But I checked him in that Falstaffian vein, urging {{considerations}} of time and cookery.|$|R
5000|$|Melville commented, [...] "Ye Gods! What a {{commentator}} is this Ann Alexander whale. What he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> short & pithy & {{very much to}} the point. I wonder if my evil art has raised this monster." ...|$|R
60|$|So we all sat down. I was {{the first}} witness, and all I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> {{carefully}} noted. Then Phil Jones and Mr. Ranson followed; and after an hour or more, the judge said he was satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Since {{you expect}} me, Mr. Creakle, to justify myself,' said Steerforth, 'and {{to say what}} I mean,--what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> that his mother lives on charity in an alms-house.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank Your Grace. What I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> but a {{repetition}} of the first words I uttered at this table. I would urge Your Grace even now to retreat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} allow me, my lord," [...] {{returned}} Archie, [...] "what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> very serious to me; and {{be pleased to}} be humorous after I am gone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly, he would," [...] agreed Goodwin calmly, as he rose leisurely to his feet. [...] "I'll {{be running}} {{over to the}} house now, old man. Mrs. Goodwin is alone. There was nothing {{important}} you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>was</b> there?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it <b>was</b> {{probably}} {{the right decision}} because look where they are now. All Mr Fayed <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> 'there's my record'. At the time getting rid of me was a harsh decision. A director at the club told me I {{was going to be}} the Alex Fergusonof Fulham. I signed a five-year contract... and four months later I was sacked." [...] Adams speaking in July 2009.|$|R
60|$|Elsie {{could not}} hear what followed; but Williamson and the {{stranger}} spoke in quiet, earnest tones that suggested that what they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> important. Being accustomed to Staffer's voice, she could more easily catch his remarks. Presently he stopped the stranger with an impatient movement of his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> {{for your}} ear alone," [...] was the reply; [...] "and {{if you would}} avoid misfortune now, and sorrow hereafter, you will not refuse to hear me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{interrupt}} you at your work. What I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> perhaps of no great moment. Indeed, words {{between you and}} me never can have much importance now. Can they, Conway?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Dornell sighed. 'All I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> that you'd {{better get}} your husband {{to join you}} as soon as possible,' she remarked. 'To go on playing the maiden like this--I'm ashamed to see you!' ...|$|E
40|$|Apologies for {{delay in}} {{answering}} Clark's last letter. He <b>has</b> very little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{and what he}} does <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>are</b> just disappointments and moody forebodings. Still biding his time for a more satisfactory position to unveil itself. Many mistakes being made in the office by unqualified staff which seems to irk him. C 4 /C 8...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know your}} gracious {{goodness}} to me, Señora, and had nearly forgotten myself, under its influence. All I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was,</b> that Don Luis de Bobadilla desireth exceedingly that the Señor Colon {{might get the}} caravels he seeketh, and that he himself might obtain the royal permission to make one among the adventurers." ...|$|R
60|$|The old man paused again. Evidently what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> very {{difficult}} <b>to</b> put into words. He groped {{in his pockets}} and brought out a large bandana handkerchief, red and yellow and green, with which he began to mop his moist forehead. The quaver in his voice and the trembling of his hands became more apparent and pronounced.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> not in {{the least}} important, and will not keep you a minute, sir," [...] he said. [...] "Still, there are reasons why I would sooner Captain Esmond didn't hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] cried Eugène, [...] "believe me {{that what}} I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> of the utmost consequence, and say it I will--whether before these strangers or in your private ear shall be as you elect." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said Lord Frederick, sipping {{his first}} glass of port, 'if {{this is a}} {{discounting}} dinner, all I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> deyvle take me, if it wouldn't be a good pla-an to get discount every day.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I always painted ideas, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> It <b>was</b> {{always some}} {{set of ideas}} that get me going." ...|$|R
500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>was</b> 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. It was my fault, nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I’m not {{interested}} in symbolisms. I use all that to shape another reality. What that reality <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> another matter altogether. What matters to me is how you {{stand in front of}} an art-work. I don’t look at it head on, I perceive it at my side. It’s beside me, in other words. It’s something I perceive better with my shoulders and my back." ...|$|R
