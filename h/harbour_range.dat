The port {{is located in the}} La Condamine district. Harbour pilots are required for all vessels longer than 30 metres.

5000|$|Located about 45 {{minutes from}} the city of Dartmouth, the {{community}} offers picturesque vistas of ocean and forests. Jutting out into the Atlantic,at the end of a deep fiord with numerous drumlins created by the last Ice Age, Pleasant Point lies on Kent Island. The local weather is moderated by the ocean, with it being generally milder in winter and cooler in the summer than most inland areas. Many forms of wildlife inhabit the area with pheasants, foxes, coyotes and bald eagles being very common. The French Point Lighthouse is one of the two Musquodoboit <b>Harbour</b> <b>Range</b> Lights found at Pleasant Point. This old lighthouse stands {{at the end of the}} Kent Road. The lighthouse, though not in use, is one of three lighthouses that remain standing on the entire Eastern shore, the only one in Halifax Regional Municipality accessible by land. No public access to the lighthouse is permitted. The lighthouse was used for years for navigational purposes to ensure the safety of fishermen and other vessels entering Musquodoboit Harbour. It is on private land - Kent Island, although the actual [...] "footprint" [...] where the lighthouse stands is owned by the Federal Government. Only a handful of residences can be found in Pleasant Point and the population is less than 100 people. Notorious Canadian John Tillmann (art thief), is a year round resident of Pleasant Point.|$|E

The most effective antimicrobial agents were enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, followed by doxycycline and gentamicin.

2500|$|Pigs can <b>harbour</b> a <b>range</b> of parasites and {{diseases}} {{that can be}} transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis, Taenia solium, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract. According to the USDA fact sheet modern pork can be enjoyed cooked rare at 145°F (63°C) with pink in the middle. Today trichinellosis infections from eating undercooked pork are rare in more technologically developed countries due to refrigeration, health laws, and public awareness. Some religious groups have dietary laws that make pork an [...] "unclean" [...] meat, and adherents sometimes interpret these health issues as validation of their views.|$|R
50|$|A {{volcanic}} arc became active to {{the west}} of the current land in Northland in Miocene times (23 Ma), and gradually moved south down to Taranaki. It produced mainly andesitic strato-volcanoes.

Half of the country's flowering plants and 51 {{percent of the}} endemic vertebrates are confined to these forests.

More than 34 percent of Sri Lanka's endemic trees, shrubs, and herbs are only found in these forests.|$|R
40|$|Most tumours {{contain a}} {{heterogeneous}} population of cancer cells, which <b>harbour</b> a <b>range</b> of genetic mutations and have probably undergone deregulated differentiation programmes {{that allow them}} to adapt to tumour microenvironments. Another explanation for tumour heterogeneity might be that the cells within a tumour are derived from tumour-initiating cells through diverse differentiation programmes. Tumour-initiating cells are thought to constitute one or more distinct subpopulations within a tumour and to drive tumour initiation, development and metastasis, as well as to be responsible for their recurrence after therapy. Recent studies have raised crucial questions about the nature, frequency and importance of melanoma-initiating cells. Here, we discuss our current understanding of melanoma-initiating cells and outline several approaches that the scientific community might consider to resolve the controversies surrounding these cells...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) {{has been}} and is {{currently}} used for treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many African countries. Nevertheless, the response of parasites to SP treatment has shown significant variation between individuals. Methods: The genes for dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) were used as markers, to investigate parasite resistance to SP in 141 children aged less than 5 years. Parasite DNA was extracted by Chelex method from blood samples collected and preserved on filter papers. Subsequently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (PCR-RFLP) were applied to detect the SP resistance-associated point mutations on dhfr and dhps.
