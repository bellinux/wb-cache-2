40|$|The <b>Electrodynamic</b> <b>Vibration</b> Exciter (shakers) {{has been}} one of the most {{employed}} excitation sources in modal tests. The shaker is an electromechanical device that provides a mechanical motion due to the input signal sent to its coil. Despite being widely used, it is well known that the shaker interacts with the structure under test. In particular, when the structure passes through a given resonance, the force delivered by the shaker abruptly decreases, causing the so called drop off phenomenon. This paper aims to study this force drop off phenomenon in the single shaker modal testing. Analytical models are developed to help in understanding the physical principles involved in the interaction between the shaker and the structure under test. Experimental analyses are performed using different shakers as well as excitation signals, in order to evaluate the effects of the input signal, as well as the power amplifier operational modes, on the structure dynamics. Preliminary tests revealed that significant distortions might occur during vibration tests using shakers and these distortions significantly affect the determination of the structure response...|$|R
40|$|When using <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>vibration</b> exciters {{to excite}} {{structure}}s, the actual force {{applied to the}} structure under test is the reaction force between the exciter and the structure. The magnitude and phase of the reaction force is dependent upon {{the characteristics of the}} structure and exciter. Therefore the quality of the reaction force i. e. the force applied on the structure depends on the relationship between the exciter and structure under test. Looking at the signal from the force transducer when exciting a structure with a sine wave, the signal will appear harmonically distorted within the regions of the resonance frequencies. This phenomenon is easily observed when performing tests on lightly damped structures. The harmonic distortion is a result of nonlinearities produced by the shaker when undergoing large amplitude vibrations, at resonances. When dealing with non-linear structures, it is of great importance {{to be able to keep}} a constant force level as well as a non-distorted sine wave in order to get reliable results within the regions of the resonance frequencies.

40|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} (LAB) {{are widely}} used in transportation sector for starting, lighting and ignition application. The possibility of vibration mode of failure occurs in this application due to wear and tear of the road. These vibration causes fatigue failure, particularly between the cast on strap and pillar post leading to loss of electrical connection. In this paper vibration test is conducted on a 12 V/ 75 Ah AGM Valve Regulated Lead-Acid Battery (VRLAB) used for above mentioned application in India. The test is carried out using <b>Electrodynamic</b> <b>Vibration</b> System model SD- 10 - 240 /GT 500 M/DA- 10. The shaker is performed with a sinusoidal excitation, with an acceleration of 2. 143 G and a fixed frequency of 16. 7 Hz. The peak to peak displacement is 4 mm. The deformation and crack propagation features {{on the surface and}} cross sectional area of pillar post and strap in both positive and negative group are observed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The material is yielded due to improper fusion between pillar post and strap which could not stand the vibration force. During vibration this region is vulnerable for fatigue failure...|$|R

50|$|One plan {{to control}} the {{vibrations}} is to actively vary the tether current to counteract {{the growth of the}} <b>vibrations.</b> <b>Electrodynamic</b> tethers can be stabilized by reducing their current when it would feed the oscillations, and increasing it when it opposes oscillations. Simulations have demonstrated that this can control tether vibration. This approach requires sensors to measure tether vibrations, which can either be an inertial navigation system {{on one end of the}} tether, or satellite navigation systems mounted on the tether, transmitting their positions to a receiver on the end.|$|R

In the initial phase of the propulsion, the <b>electrodynamic</b> force induces <b>vibrations</b> on the tether. Libration and string vibration are undesirable for any missions of the system.

40|$|A {{combination}} of experiments and modeling {{are used to}} address the vibration durability of structures subjected to different random vibration environments. Presented in this work are a set of experimental data comparing {{the rate of change}} of the first natural frequency and the measured time to failure, of simple structural members under repetitive shock (RS) <b>vibration,</b> single-axis <b>electrodynamic</b> (ED) <b>vibration</b> and multi-axis ED vibration. It was found that multi-axis testing is more severe than single-axis testing at the same level. In addition the RS system low frequency amplitude is often too weak to efficiently propagate the crack. Smoothing of the input power spectral density (PSD) or poor line resolution was also shown to change the time to failure of a test. A poor correlation was shown between the PSD and the rate of natural frequency change (RFC) over a wide frequency shift. The change in natural frequency caused the initial PSD to be ineffective in determining the total time to failure. A predictive, analytic methodology to quantify the RFC was developed to predict the fatigue life of a structure experiencing random vibration excitation. This method allows the estimation of fatigue life using the frequency domain, where only the input power spectral density, damping factor an...|$|R
40|$|The {{multimodal}} {{friction ignition}} tester (MFIT) is a testbed for experiments on the thermal and mechanical effects of friction on material specimens in pressurized, oxygen-rich atmospheres. In simplest terms, a test involves recording sensory data while rubbing two specimens {{against each other}} at a controlled normal force, with either a random stroke or a sinusoidal stroke having controlled amplitude and frequency. The term multimodal in the full name of the apparatus refers to a capability for imposing any combination of widely ranging values of the atmospheric pressure, atmospheric oxygen content, stroke length, stroke frequency, and normal force. The MFIT was designed especially for studying the tendency toward heating and combustion of nonmetallic composite materials and the fretting of metals subjected to dynamic (vibrational) friction forces {{in the presence of}} liquid oxygen or pressurized gaseous oxygen test conditions approximating conditions expected to be encountered in proposed composite material oxygen tanks aboard aircraft and spacecraft in flight. The MFIT includes a stainless-steel pressure vessel capable of retaining the required test atmosphere. Mounted atop the vessel is a pneumatic cylinder containing a piston for exerting the specified normal force between the two specimens. Through a shaft seal, the piston shaft extends downward into the vessel. One of the specimens is mounted on a block, denoted the pressure block, {{at the lower end of}} the piston shaft. This specimen is pressed down against the other specimen, which is mounted in a recess in another block, denoted the slip block, that can be moved horizontally but not vertically. The slip block is driven in reciprocating horizontal motion by an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>vibration</b> exciter outside the pressure vessel. The armature of the electrodynamic exciter is connected to the slip block via a horizontal shaft that extends into the pressure vessel via a second shaft seal. The reciprocating horizontal motion can be chosen to be random with a flat spectrum over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 1 kHz, or to be sinusoidal at any peak-to-peak amplitude up to 0. 8 in. (. 2 cm) and fixed or varying frequency up to 1 kHz. The temperatures of the specimen and of the vessel are measured by thermocouples. A digital video camera mounted outside the pressure vessel is aimed into the vessel through a sapphire window, with its focus fixed on the interface between the two specimens. A position transducer monitors the displacement of the pneumatic-cylinder shaft. The pressure in the vessel is also monitored. During a test, the output of the video camera, the temperatures, and the pneumatic-shaft displacement are monitored and recorded. The test is continued for a predetermined amount of time (typically, 10 minutes) or until either (1) the output of the position transducer shows a sudden change indicative of degradation of either or both specimens, (2) ignition or another significant reaction is observed, or (3) pressure in the vessel increases beyond a pre-set level that triggers an automatic shutdown...|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{and shock}} tests in {{accordance}} with MIL-STD- 810 F were performed on camera HVK 2 1012 of Kappa. The camera is a new developed high resolution camera and is manufactured by Kappa opto-electronics GmbH in Gleichen, Germany. For the performance of tests the camera was mounted on a uni-axial <b>electrodynamic</b> shaker. Sine <b>vibration</b> tests in each longitudinal axis of the camera were performed by sine sweep runs from 60 to 2000 Hz upwards and from 2000 Hz to 60 Hz downwards with a sweep velocity of 1 oct/min and a maximum level of 2. 12 g. In each axis the camera was exposed 2 h to the vibrations. In addition, shock tests with peak values of 10 g and 6 ms and afterwards with peak values of 50 g and 5 ms duration were performed. The camera was exposed to 10 shocks in positive and 10 shocks in negative direction of each axis.
