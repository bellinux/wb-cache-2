5|$|The {{earliest}} known sketch (№ 236) {{is made in}} graphite and {{is located}} in the Carl Larsson museum in Sundborn. It was dated by Karl Axel Arvidsson to a time shortly after the visit to Copenhagen in 1910. In July, Larsson started to paint a large version, which was finished in January 1911, but it is only preserved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph.</b> It is based on the early sketch but it presents a richer set of figures in the foreground. The early version was put on display in Nationalmuseum without receiving any official comments. There was no formal order and no official contest had been declared, and the initiative was only Larsson's.|$|E

5|$|Although to many she is {{best known}} for Demi's Birthday Suit, art aficionados {{consider}} her most famous work Disappearing Model. The work appeared on Ripley's Believe it or Not!. In the trompe l'oeil body painting, the face and body of the model are almost indistinguishable from the red and blue and yellow flowers of the wallpaper in the background. Her first body paintings was also memorable as she painted a moko on a female Ford Modeling Agency fashion model named Jana, which is a tabooed employment of a traditionally male ritual face mask. An example from Gair's website of her ability to trick the eye into seeing a three-dimensional subject blend with a two-dimensional background is seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> of a pregnant Elle Macpherson. Other examples of this technique include the cover of her first book (pictured below) and images from within this book.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, the statue is of an ancient king; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>photograph</b> of the statue taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. The statue has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a necklace and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita thread and its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest the statue may be of a king represented with features of various traditions. According to Carol Radcliffe BolonAssistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave5 remains enigmatic.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{instruments}} provide simple {{solutions for}} micro-photography and image recording electronically.
