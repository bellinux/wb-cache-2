5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged to Pound, although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} four years Shaw made a {{negligible}} income <b>from</b> <b>writing,</b> and was subsidised by his mother. In 1881, for the sake of economy, and increasingly as a matter of principle, he became a vegetarian. He grew a beard to hide a facial scar left by smallpox. In rapid succession he wrote two more novels: The Irrational Knot (1880) and Love Among the Artists (1881), but neither found a publisher; each was serialised a few years later in the socialist magazine Our Corner.|$|E
5|$|His break <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> {{lasted for}} five years, {{following}} the death of his wife, but after battling his illness he returned to print in 2000 with a new novel, Day of Absolution. Gardner also began a series of books with a new character, Suzie Mountford, a 1930s police detective.|$|E
5|$|In October 1941, Reggie {{was offered}} a post as {{lecturer}} at Farouk University in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> novels for several years.|$|E

During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially {{after the death of}} her husband on November 9, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.|$|E

5|$|After Fleming's death a {{continuation}} novel, Colonel Sun, {{was written by}} Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work The James Bond Dossier. Although novelizations {{of two of the}} Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me and James Bond and Moonraker, both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981 the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed. Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote – Licence to Kill and GoldenEye – were novelizations of Eon Productions films of the same name. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996 Gardner retired <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> James Bond books due to ill health.|$|E

5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis had complained that his magazine writing prevented him <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may {{have been based on}} painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E
5|$|Following Seven Assignments Clarke {{then took}} a job at Conservative Central Office, as Head of Public Opinion Research, where he worked until 1952. During this later career he also served as a {{director}} of Securicor. In 1952 he resumed his literary career with the publication of The Eleventh at War, a history of the 11th Hussars. The following year he submitted a publisher's proposal for The Secret War, a full account of deception during the Second World War, but was prevented <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> it by the Official Secrets Act. His final book was fiction, a thriller entitled Golden Arrow, published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Fraser {{was working}} as a {{journalist}} on The Glasgow Herald when he wrote the first novel, Flashman; writing in the evenings, after work, he took 90hours in total to write the story. After the book was published, he left journalism and took up writing novels. When a break <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> was forced upon him by a broken arm, he abandoned the book until his wife read the manuscript and urged him to finish. He did not find a publisher for the novel for two years, until Barrie & Jenkins published it in 1969. When the novel was published in the US the same year, of the 34 reviews read by Alden Whitman of The New York Times, ten of them considered the book to be a genuine autobiography. Fraser researched each novel at Trinity College, Dublin. From their first publication, the books were a commercial success, and new editions appeared on the best-sellers' lists.|$|E

5|$|In 1939 The Map of Love {{appeared}} {{as a collection of}} 16 poems and seven of the 20 short stories published by Thomas in magazines since 1934. Ten stories in his next book, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940), were based less on lavish fantasy than The Map of Love and more on real-life romances featuring himself in Wales. Sales of both books were poor, resulting in Thomas living on meagre fees <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> and reviewing. At this time he borrowed heavily from friends and acquaintances. Hounded by creditors, Thomas and his family left Laugharne in July 1940 and moved to the home of critic John Davenport in Marshfield, Gloucestershire. There Thomas collaborated with Davenport on the satire The Death of the King's Canary, though due to fears of libel the work was not published until 1976.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E
5|$|The Smith Act trials {{decimated}} {{the leadership}} {{ranks of the}} CPUSA. Immediately after the 1949 trial, the CPUSAalarmed at the undercover informants that had testified for the prosecutioninitiated efforts to identify and exclude informers from its membership. The FBI encouraged these suspicions by planting fabricated evidence which suggested that many innocent Party members were FBI informants. Dennis attempted to provide leadership from inside the Atlanta penitentiary, but prison officials censored his mail and successfully isolated him from the outside world. Prison officials from the Lewisburg prison prevented Williamson <b>from</b> <b>writing</b> to anyone other than immediate family members. Lacking leadership, the CPUSA suffered from internal dissension and disorder, and by 1953 the CPUSA's leadership structure was inoperative. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev revealed the reality of Stalin's purges, causing many remaining CPUSA members to quit in disillusionment. By the late 1950s, the CPUSA's membership had dwindled to 5,000, of whom over 1,000 may have been FBI informants.|$|E
