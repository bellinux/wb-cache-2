I {{had been}} {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.|$|E

However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer {{said that he has}} not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: [...] "I'm meeting with my lawyer ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up , I didn’t even know who it was who did that I knew the Jayson Musson [...] So <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "City of Angels" [...] is a synthrock {{song with}} {{influences}} and elements from experimental music. It opens with an instrumental section and [...] "gently burbling" [...] synthesizers. It follows {{with the sounds}} of drum beats, including taiko drums, then transitions into a piano melody. After the first verse, the chorus follows, with Leto singing, [...] "Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights". During the bridge, he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos, affirming [...] "I am home". After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from Billboard cited [...] "City of Angels" [...] as an example of variety and experimentation in Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams. She described the song as a [...] "pulsating, subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band's usual rock backdrop".|$|E

60|$|Crowding all sail, we braced {{the yards}} square; and, the breeze freshening, bowled {{straight}} {{away from the}} land. Once more the sailor's cradle rocked under me, and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> rolling <b>in</b> my gait.|$|R
500|$|After the Beatles {{broke up}} in 1970, McCartney {{continued}} his musical career {{with his first}} solo release, McCartney, a US number-one album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, McCartney is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram. A UK number one and a US top five, Ram included the co-written US number-one hit single [...] "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney {{had this to say}} on the group's formation: [...] "Wings were always a difficult idea... any group having to follow [...] success would have a hard job... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping." [...] In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.|$|E
2500|$|Josie Pracht {{said this}} about boot camp, [...] "The {{first two weeks}} were miserable. I {{was ready to go}} home. I went to bed crying one night.

2500|$|Louis Pauwels wrote Monsieur Gurdjieff (first edition {{published}} in Paris, France in 1954 by Editions du Seuil). In an interview, Pauwels {{said of the}} Gurdjieff work: [...] "... After two years of exercises which both enlightened and burned me, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a hospital bed with a thrombosed central vein in my left eye and weighing ninety-nine pounds... Horrible anguish and abysses opened up for me. But it was my fault." ...|$|E
60|$|Our plans being fixed, {{they were}} at once carried into effect, and the same evening <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> alone <b>in</b> my yacht, with no one but the skipper and crew and the {{faithful}} Lancey, to keep me company.|$|R
2500|$|Commenting on his collection, Hirst {{has said}} [...] "As a human being, {{as you go}} through life, you just do collect. It was that sort of entropic {{collecting}} that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> interested <b>in,</b> just amassing stuff while you’re alive." ...|$|R
60|$|The Court sat {{late that}} day as an {{important}} case was ending; it was striking six as I drove in at {{the gate of the}} Kensington Palace Road. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> installed <b>in</b> a large room close to the sick chamber.|$|R
2500|$|These {{are things}} {{related to the}} past and the {{environment}} <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> at the time. In the early '90s, there were all these different youth gangs in Norway and one thing led to another. I was involved in gang fights and had false friends [...] There was no political disposition – not with me nor any of my friends. But you had to profess allegiance to a certain group if you wanted to defend yourself and not get your ass kicked. [...] But there have definitely been changes and an evolution in my thinking. I'm a different person today.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 August 1941, {{while living}} in Yelabuga (Elabuga), Tsvetaeva hanged herself. She left a note for her son Mur: [...] "Forgive me, but to go on would be worse. I am gravely ill, this is not me anymore. I love you passionately. Do {{understand}} that I could not live anymore. Tell Papa and Alya, if you ever see them, that I loved them to the last moment and explain to them that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> a trap." [...] According to book The Death of a Poet: The Last Days of Marina Tsvetaeva, the local NKVD department tried to force Tsvetaeva start working as their informant, which left her no other choice but to commit the suicide ...|$|E
2500|$|Visitors to Harmony {{commented on}} the {{commercial}} and industrial work being done in this religious settlement along the Wabash River. [...] "It seemed as though <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the midst of Germany," [...] noted one visitor. In 1819 the town had a steam-operated wool carding and spinning factory, a horse-drawn and human-powered threshing machine, a brewery, distillery, vineyards, and a winery. The property included an orderly town, [...] "laid out in a square", with a church, school, store, dwellings for residents, and streets to create [...] "the most beautiful city of western America, because everything is built in the most perfect symmetry". Other visitors were not as impressed: [...] "hard labor & coarse fare {{appears to be the}} lot of all except the family of Rapp, he lives in a large & handsome brick house while the rest inhabit small log cabins. How so numerous a population are kept quietly & tamely in absolute servitude it is hard to conceive—the women I believe do more labor in the field than the men, as large numbers of the latter are engaged in different branches of manufactures." [...] Although they were not paid for their work, the 1820 manufacturer's census reported that 75 men, 12 women, and 30 children were employed, [...] in the Society's tanneries, saw and grain mills, and woolen and cotton mills. Manufactured goods included cotton, flannel, and wool cloth, yarn, knit goods, tin ware, rope, beer, peach brandy, whiskey, wine, wagons, carts, plows, flour, beef, pork, butter, leather, and leather goods.|$|E

6000|$|... "I had imagined," [...] he said, [...] "that an {{understanding}} {{was exactly what}} we had come to. My words were plain enough, were they not? I am leaving this house because <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the company of sharks and card-sharpers." ...|$|R
6000|$|After this I {{remember}} little more, except some confused dreams, till <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> lying <b>in</b> a great hut, which I discovered subsequently was Umbezi's own, the same, indeed, wherein I had doctored {{the ear of}} that wife of his who {{was called}} [...] "Worn-out-old-Cow." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> Twilight Land. How I {{ever got}} there I cannot tell, but there I was in Twilight Land.|$|E

6000|$|... "In about forty-five seconds <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> again <b>in</b> the waiting-room {{with the}} {{compassionate}} secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some document.

6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a great {{pleasure}} to me to meet you. I do not remember anybody with whom <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> so much sympathy--except one of course. It is strange to think that when we meet again I shall be a married woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no--(Yes, Una dear, very pretty)--but <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> talking <b>in</b> {{the voice}} that always makes Alick shut his eyes."--"I should not think he often had to do so," [...] said Ermine, much amused by this gentle remedy--("Mind, Keith, that is a nettle. It will sting--") ...|$|R
60|$|But I did not stop. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> {{the dining}} room, {{and at once}} put the long table between us.|$|E
60|$|In {{five minutes}} after this dialogue, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the parlour of the George, and in the {{presence}} of the stranger.|$|E
60|$|But in {{the present}} case I knew nothing of this, and after three hours of charming silence <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> London.|$|E
60|$|On the {{day when}} <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> with twopence <b>in</b> my pocket, I {{naturally}} {{made up my mind}} to go round the world.|$|R

"With my {{confidence}} shot and my career <b>in</b> tatters, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> trapped <b>in</b> {{a world of}} pain where, {{in the words of}} that old Sad Cafe song, every day hurt."

"So <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> {{installed}} <b>in</b> delightfully spacious rooms {{within the}} Victorian wing of an elegant Tudor college, with {{the beauty of}} the Christ Church Meadow spread panoramically {{on the other side of}} my window panes.

60|$|The daughter's {{pleading}} was {{not without}} effect. In the meantime I had fainted. When I recovered my senses <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> Governor Maitland's mansion.|$|E

60|$|Her manner, {{without being}} {{absolutely}} repellent, {{was far from}} encouraging. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> the embarrassing position of having nothing left to say. I gave up all attempt at conversational philandering.|$|E
60|$|About {{four months}} after my first {{acquaintance}} with Mr. and Mrs. Crowder, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> again <b>in</b> New York; and when I called {{at the house of}} my friends, I received from them a most earnest invitation to take up my abode with them during my stay in the city.|$|R
60|$|At last, in {{a leisurely}} muddled manner {{we got to}} the Address; and <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>myself</b> packed <b>in</b> a dense elbowing crowd {{to the right of the}} Speaker's chair; while the {{attenuated}} Opposition, nearly leaderless after the massacre, tilted its brim to its nose and sprawled at its ease amidst its empty benches.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is in his}} highest {{interests}} that you ask no indiscreet questions and I give no indiscreet replies," [...] he answered, sharply.
