50|$|From the 17. century on, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Age of <b>absolutism,</b> <b>the</b> first baron on Valdemars Castle (who had won {{the rights}} to the castle {{following}} the Battle of Køge Bay) and his inheritants soon amassed as much land on the island as possible, effectively making the ever sitting baron the de facto owner and feudal lord of almost the entire island, and the farmers tenants and copyholders, from {{the first part of the}} 18. century and right until the conversion of entailed estates into fee simple (Lensafløsningen) 1919. Tåsinge also had its own birkeret, presided by the baron as supreme judicial court as well (also until 1919). The population (3.600 in 1823) were all peasantry or sailors.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Renaissance, a desire for non-military residences arose amongst the nobility and they slowly left their old fortified castles, or altered them into stately homes. In the course of the years, many aristocratic family seats grew into big estates; at the same time, the court ceremonial changed. Now, the prince stood more and more in the centre of a luxurious royal household that reached its zenith <b>during</b> <b>absolutism.</b> <b>The</b> nobility surrounded themselves with artists, courtiers, envoys, servants and petitioners. Often the residences overflowed with guests.|$|R

50|$|The primary task of {{the fleet}} {{in the first period}} of its {{existence}} was to counter the power of the Hanseatic League and secure control in the Baltic Sea. The fleet was {{one of the largest in}} Europe under Christian IV with 50-60 larger battle ships and a large number of defensive ships. In the 17th and 18th centuries <b>during</b> <b>the</b> period of <b>absolutism</b> its primary aim was to control the Strait of Øresund against Sweden. In this period it consisted of 20 ships of the line with an average of 60 guns, plus 20-40 frigates, large enough to counter the Royal Swedish Navy at the time. The number of guns on the ships of the line was smaller than the average number of the great sea powers of the time, but it was partly a deliberate decision of the admiralty, in order to make the ships able to navigate in the countless narrow waters around the Danish isles.|$|R
30|$|On the one hand, {{there are}} <b>the</b> <b>absolutisms</b> of <b>the</b> world religions–often {{called by the}} blanket term fundamentalism–that assert {{exclusive}} possession of truth by whichever community is making the assertion. On the other hand, there is also <b>the</b> <b>absolutism</b> of dogmatic materialism, with its equally strident denial of any truth that is not available to the five bodily senses. These various absolutisms–the religious ones with one another, {{and all of them}} with materialism–can only interact violently, cancelling one another out.|$|R
50|$|In 1865 Ottoman intellectuals had {{established}} the Young Ottomans organisation {{in order to}} resist <b>the</b> <b>absolutism</b> of Abdülaziz I.

50|$|Bourdelot {{studied at}} the Sorbonne (1629) and {{travelled}} in 1634 to Rome {{in the company of}} count François de Noailles. In 1638 he came back to France and was appointed asthe privat doctor of the Condé family. In 1640 he founded the Académie Bourdelot, a circle for scientists, philosophers and authors, that came together twice a month. When his uncle died, he inherited a lot of books and manuscripts. When Louis II de Bourbon, prince de Condé, because of actions <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Fronde against <b>Absolutism,</b> was captured by Mazarin, he took off; in 1652 he was in Stockholm, while Christina, Queen of Sweden had a lot of mental and physical problems. Bourdelot took many manuscripts with him as a present. He had a lot of influence on her with his jokes and poems by Pietro Aretino. Within four weeks she seems to have been recovered and enjoying life. Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie and Christina's mother Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg were shocked by his behavior and Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 with many presents.|$|R

50|$|Anti-establishment ideas {{fermented}} in 18th century France in {{part due}} to the country's relative egalitarianism. While less liberal than England <b>during</b> <b>the</b> same period, the French monarchy never approached <b>the</b> <b>absolutism</b> of <b>the</b> eastern rulers in Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, and Constantinople in part because the country's traditional development as a decentralized, feudal society acted as a restraint on the power of the king. Different social classes in France each had their own unique set of privileges so that no one class could completely dominate the others.|$|R

40|$|William James (1842 - 1910) {{constantly}} {{criticized the}} English and American absolutism derived from Hegel, and thereby developed his own philosophy. Examining {{this aspect of}} his philosophy will help to elucidate what he intended to say in his obscure writing. His own doctrine is inseparably linked with the criticism against <b>the</b> <b>absolutism.</b> <b>The</b> {{aim of this study}} is to clarify how he criticized <b>the</b> <b>absolutism</b> and opposed <b>the</b> radical empiricism to it, mainly referring to A Pluralistic Universe. James claims that, in terms of "intimacy" the radical empiricism sets as a criterion of good philosophy, "the Weltanschauung" and the God as the Absolute are not only insufficient, but also logically imperfect because of its crucial contradiction. Thus he replaced the philosophy of the Absolute with the radical empiricism. The finite God held by the radical empiricism is the one James thinks as worth believing in and as totally different from the God who is almighty, infinite and eternal and who reigns transcendently over everything in the whole universe...|$|R

40|$|U radu se razmatraju promjene statusa fizike u pučkim školama Banske Hrvatske tijekom druge polovice 19. stoljeća. Analizirani su ustroj škole, nastavni planovi i programi te čitanke. Analiza pokazuje da se do 1880. položaj fizike bitno poboljšao u odnosu na stanje definirano tijekom apsolutizma, da bi se nakon 1890. počeo postupno pogoršavati, tako da se krajem stoljeća fizika opet našla ondje gdje je bila krajem apsolutizma. Contemporary society {{cannot be}} really {{understood}} without {{paying attention to}} physics as an element of material and spiritual culture, and conversely the social role and position of physics cannot be properly understood without historical analysis. In that spirit, this article tries to contribute {{to an understanding of}} physics as an element of the general culture of Croatian society. The article discusses changes in the status of physics in the public elementary schools of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia from the end of <b>the</b> period of <b>absolutism,</b> when care over organising the Croatian school system and the administration of it was taken over by Croatian legislative and executive authorities, {{to the end of the}} nineteenth century, wherein the position of physics at <b>the</b> end of <b>absolutism</b> is considered as an “initial state” relative to which the changes that followed are measured. The assessment of changes in the position of physics is derived on the basis of analysis of essential elements of the elementary school system, which mirrored the status of every element of education included in it: a) the system and aims of elementary schools (defined by the decree Systema scholarum elementarium of 1845 and regulations from <b>the</b> period of <b>absolutism</b> and school laws of 1874 and 1888); b) curricula (prescribed by orders of 1855, 1858, 1866, 1875, 1890 and 1895); c) prescribed textbooks (the “slovničke čitanke” [Grammatical textbook] used from 1861 to 1879, the “zagrebačke čitanke” [Zagreb textbook] used from 1880 to 1894, and the textbook compiled on the basis of the minimal curriculum from 1895 to 1905). Although the education of male and female teachers certainly essentially influenced the position of physics in elementary schools, discussion of that aspect of the status of physics had to be left out of discussion because of the extent of materials; however, in spite of that, even such an incomplete picture shows that teachers <b>during</b> <b>the</b> whole period advocated the inclusion of extensive materials from physics in teaching in elementary schools. The influence of the characteristics of each of the elements mentioned above on the position of physics in elementary school is discussed in detail, and analysis shows that the position of physics was essentially improved in relation to the position that was defined <b>during</b> <b>the</b> period of <b>absolutism,</b> particularly in <b>the</b> time of rule of Ban Mažuranić, to start to gradually decline after 1890, in the time of Ban Khuen, which had the result that physics at the end of the century, in spite of all the changes within policy, the economy and science, again held the place that it had held at the end of <b>the</b> period of <b>absolutism...</b>|$|R
