5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E

40|$|Dissociated cultured rat hippocampal {{pyramidal}} neurons {{respond to}} estradiol with a time-dependent, twofold increase in density of their <b>dendritic</b> <b>spines.</b> This effect is mediated by an estrogen receptor, probably of the alpha nuclear receptor type. In {{searching for the}} molecular mechanisms leading from the initial activation of the estrogen receptor to the final formation of new <b>dendritic</b> <b>spines,</b> we found that estradiol acts on GABAergic interneurons expressing the estrogen receptor by decreasing their inhibitory tone.

25|$|Experience-induced {{changes in}} <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> {{stability}} {{also point to}} spine turnover as a mechanism involved in the maintenance of long-term memories, though {{it is unclear how}} sensory experience affects neural circuitry. Two general models might describe the impact of experience on structural plasticity. On the one hand, experience and activity may drive the discrete formation of relevant synaptic connections that store meaningful information in order to allow for learning. On the other hand, synaptic connections may be formed in excess, and experience and activity may lead to the pruning of extraneous synaptic connections.|$|E
25|$|Age-dependent {{changes in}} the rate of spine {{turnover}} suggest that spine stability impacts developmental learning. In youth, <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> turnover is relatively high and produces a net loss of spines. This high rate of spine turnover may characterize critical periods of development and reflect learning capacity in adolescence—different cortical areas exhibit differing levels of synaptic turnover during development, possibly reflecting varying critical periods for specific brain regions. In adulthood, however, most spines remain persistent, and the half-life of spines increases. This stabilization occurs due to a developmentally regulated slow-down of spine elimination, a process which may underlie the stabilization of memories in maturity.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> (or spine) {{is a small}} {{membranous}} protrusion from a neuron's dendrite {{that typically}} receives input from a single axon at the synapse.

Most spines have a bulbous head (the spine head), and a thin neck that connects {{the head of the}} spine to the shaft of the dendrite. The dendrites of a single neuron can contain hundreds to thousands of spines.

While {{a net loss of}} spines is observed in Alzheimer's disease and cases of intellectual disability, cocaine and amphetamine use have been linked to increases in dendritic branching and spine density in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens.

2500|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{depends on}} a second messenger cascade regulating gene transcription {{and changes in the}} levels of key proteins at synapses such as CaMKII and PKAII. Activation of the second messenger pathway leads to increased levels of CaMKII and PKAII within the <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine.</b> These protein kinases have been linked to growth in <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> volume and LTP processes such as the addition of AMPA receptors to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of ion channels for enhanced permeability. Localization or compartmentalization of activated proteins occurs in the presence of their given stimulus which creates local effects in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine.</b> Calcium influx from NMDA receptors is necessary for the activation of CaMKII. This activation is localized to spines with focal stimulation and is inactivated before spreading to adjacent spines or the shaft, indicating an important mechanism of LTP in that particular changes in protein activation can be localized or compartmentalized to enhance the responsivity of single dendritic spines. Individual dendritic spines are capable of forming unique responses to presynaptic cells. This second mechanism can be triggered by protein phosphorylation but takes longer and lasts longer, providing the mechanism for long-lasting memory storage.

2500|$|Neurons are {{electrically}} excitable cells composed, in general, {{of one or}} more dendrites, {{a single}} soma, a single axon and one or more axon terminals. Dendrites are cellular projections whose primary function is to receive synaptic signals. Their protrusions, or spines, are designed to capture the neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron. They have a high concentration of ligand-gated ion channels. These spines have a thin neck connecting a bulbous protrusion to the dendrite. This ensures that changes occurring inside the spine are less likely to affect the neighboring spines. The <b>dendritic</b> <b>spine</b> can, with rare exception (see LTP), act as an independent unit. The dendrites extend from the soma, which houses the nucleus, and many of the [...] "normal" [...] eukaryotic organelles. Unlike the spines, the surface of the soma is populated by voltage activated ion channels. These channels help transmit the signals generated by the dendrites. Emerging out from the soma is the axon hillock. This region is characterized by having a very high concentration of voltage-activated sodium channels. In general, it is considered to be the spike initiation zone for action potentials. Multiple signals generated at the spines, and transmitted by the soma all converge here. Immediately after the axon hillock is the axon. This is a thin tubular protrusion traveling away from the soma. The axon is insulated by a myelin sheath. Myelin is composed of either Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system) or oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system), both of which are types of glial cells. Although glial cells are not involved with the transmission of electrical signals, they communicate and provide important biochemical support to neurons. To be specific, myelin wraps multiple times around the axonal segment, forming a thick fatty layer that prevents ions from entering or escaping the axon. This insulation prevents significant signal decay as well as ensuring faster signal speed. This insulation, however, has the restriction that no channels can be present {{on the surface of the}} axon. There are, therefore, regularly spaced patches of membrane, which have no insulation. These nodes of Ranvier can be considered to be [...] "mini axon hillocks", as their purpose is to boost the signal in order to prevent significant signal decay. At the furthest end, the axon loses its insulation and begins to branch into several axon terminals. These presynaptic terminals, or synaptic boutons, are a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles.|$|E
