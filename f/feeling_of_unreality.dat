40|$|Clinical {{reports of}} depersonalization suggest that {{attenuated}} emotional {{experience is a}} central feature of the condition. Patients typically complain of emotional numbness and some patients ascribe their <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality</b> {{to a lack of}} affective "colouring" in things perceived. Recent neuroimaging and psychophysiological studies support these assumptions as they show both attenuated autonomic responses in depersonalization, and decreased activity within neural regions important for the generation of affective responses to emotive stimuli. Furthermore, findings from neuroimaging studies indicate increased prefrontal cortical activity in depersonalised patients, particularly within regions associated with contextualization and appraisal of emotionally-salient information rather than mood induction per se. Taken together, these finding suggest that symptoms of depersonalization, and in particular emotional numbing, may be related to a reversal of normal patterns of autonomic and neural response to emotive stimuli...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempted}} to analyze different factors involved in sensory deprivation (SD) experiments: sensory restriction, social isolation, confinement, {{prior knowledge of}} SD effects, and the sex and "sensation-seeking " personality characteristics of Ss. 36 male and 36 female Ss were confined in 1 of 3 experimental conditions on 1 occasion and were tested again on another day spent outside the laboratory. Confinement without social or sensory isolation produced generalized psychological and endocrine arousal. SD produced an increase in anxiety and related increases in primary-process activity and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality.</b> Women showed these effects more than men. In a review of studies of the stress effects of sensory deprivation (SD), Zuckerman (1964) reported a number of experiments implicating other variables as sources of stress in these experiments.

Nobody was the better for it, while he had involved himself in a horrible tangle.

60|$|There is, first, {{the belief}} in insight as against discursive {{analytic}} knowledge: {{the belief in}} a way of wisdom, sudden, penetrating, coercive, which is contrasted with the slow and fallible study of outward appearance by a science relying wholly upon the senses. All {{who are capable of}} absorption in an inward passion must have experienced at times the strange <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality</b> in common objects, the loss of contact with daily things, in which the solidity of the outer world is lost, and the soul seems, in utter loneliness, to bring forth, out of its own depths, the mad dance of fantastic phantoms which have hitherto appeared as independently real and living. This is the negative side of the mystic's initiation: the doubt concerning common knowledge, preparing the way for the reception of what seems a higher wisdom. Many men to whom this negative experience is familiar do not pass beyond it, but for the mystic it is merely the gateway to an ampler world.|$|E

All the time he had passed out of England was as a dream, and all the interest of his soul[,] all his affections belonged to events which had happened and persons who had existed sixteen years before. It was strange when you heard him talk to see how he passed over this lapse of time as a night of visions; while the remembrances of his youth standing seperate as they did from his after life had lost none of their vigour.

40|$|Worry has {{traditionally}} been considered {{in the study of}} common emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression, but recent studies indicate that worry may be a causal factor in the occurrence and persistence of persecutory delusions. The effect of worry on processes traditionally associated with psychosis has not been tested. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the short-term effects of a bout of worry on three cognitive processes typically considered markers of psychosis: working memory, jumping to conclusions, and anomalous internal experience. Sixty-seven patients with persecutory delusions in the context of a non-affective psychotic disorder were randomised to a worry induction, a worry reduction, or a neutral control condition. They completed tests of the cognitive processes before and after the randomisation condition. The worry induction procedure led to a significant increase in worry. The induction of worry did not affect working memory or jumping to conclusions, but it did increase a range of mild anomalous experiences including <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality,</b> perceptual alterations, and temporal disintegration. Worry did not affect the occurrence of hallucinations. The study shows that a period of worry causes a range of subtle odd perceptual disturbances that are known to increase the likelihood of delusions. It demonstrates an interaction between affective and psychotic processes in patients with delusions. <br/...|$|R

60|$|Overwhelmed by this kindness, I {{could not}} find words to thank him as I got into the chair. My legs were too long for it, I remember. I had a quaint <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality</b> as I sank back on the red satin {{cushions}} and was borne {{out of the gate}} between the lions. Monsieur de St. Gre and Nick walked in front, the faithful Lindy followed, and people paused to stare at us as we passed. We crossed the Place d'Armes, the Royal Road, gained the willow-bordered promenade on the levee's crown, and a wide barge was waiting, manned by six negro oarsmen. They lifted me into its stern under the awning, the barge was cast off, the oars dipped, and we were gliding silently past the line of keel boats on the swift current of the Mississippi. The spars of the shipping were inky black, and the setting sun had struck a red band across the waters. For a while the three of us sat gazing at the green shore, each wrapped in his own reflections,--Philippe de St. Gre thinking, perchance, of the wayward son he had lost; Nick of the woman who awaited him; and I of one whom fate had set beyond me. It was Monsieur de St. Gre who broke the silence at last.|$|E
60|$|With {{a curious}} sense of unreality he {{followed}} her downstairs, and took the vacant seat in the victoria. It was all so much like a dream, {{like one of those}} wonderful visions which had come to him at times in the days of his homeless wanderings. Surely it was an illusion. The luxurious carriage, the great horses with their silver-mounted harness, the servants in their smart liveries, and above all, this beautiful woman, who leaned back at his side, watching him often with a sort of gentle curiosity. At first he sat still, quite dazed, his senses a little numbed, the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality</b> so strong upon him that he was almost tongue-tied. But presently the life of the streets awakened him. It was all so fascinating and alluring. They were in a part of London of which he had seen little--and that little from the gutters. To-day in the brilliant sunshine, in clothes better than any he had ever worn before, and side by side with a woman whom every one seemed honoured to know, he looked upon it with different eyes. They drove along Bond Street at a snail's pace and stopped for a few minutes at one of the smaller galleries, where she took him in to see a wonderful Russian picture, about which every one was talking. Fancying that he looked tired she insisted upon tea, and they stopped at some curious little rooms, and sat together at a tiny table drinking tea with sliced lemons, and eating strawberries such as he had never seen before. Then on again to the Park, where they pulled up under the trees, and she waved constantly away the friends who would have surrounded her carriage. One or two would not be denied, and to all of them she introduced Jesson--the young writer--they had seen that wonderful work of his in the Daily Courier, of course? He took no part in any conversation more than he could help, leaning back amongst the cushions with the white lace of her parasol close to his cheek, watching the faces {{of the men and women}} who streamed by, and the great banks of rhododendrons dimly seen lower down through the waving green trees. The murmur of pleasant conversation fell constantly upon his ears--surely that other world was part of an evil dream, a relic of his delirium. Heaven and hell could never exist so close together. But by-and-bye, when they drove off she herself brought the truth home to him.|$|E
6000|$|That small song {{has served}} {{to remind me}} of two small books I brought into the garden to read--the works of two modern minor poets whose [...] "wren-like warblings," [...] I imagined, would suit my mood and the genial morning better than the {{stirring}} or subtle thoughts of greater singers. Possibly in that I was mistaken; for there until now lie the books neglected on a lawn chair within reach of my hand. The chair was dragged hither half-an-hour ago by a maiden all in white, who appeared half inclined to share the mulberry shade with me. She did not continue long in that mind. In a lively manner, she began speaking of some trivial thing; but after a very few moments all interest in the subject evaporated, and she sat humming some idle air, tapping the turf with her fantastic shoe. Presently she picked up one of my books, opened it at random and read a line or two, her vermilion under-lip curling slightly; then threw it down again, and glanced at me out of the corners of her eyes; then hummed again, and finally became silent, and sat bending forward a little, her dark lustrous eyes gazing with strange intentness through the slight screen of foliage into the vacant space beyond. What to see? The poet has omitted to tell us to what the maiden's fancy lightly turns in spring. Doubtless it turns to thoughts of something real. Life is real; so is passion--the quickening of the blood, the wild pulsation. But the pleasures and pains of the printed book are not real, and are to reality like Japanese flowers made of coloured bits of tissue paper to the living fragrant flowers that bloom to-day and perish to-morrow; they are a simulacrum, a mockery, and present to us a pale phantasmagoric world, peopled with bloodless men and women that chatter meaningless things and laugh without joy. The <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality</b> affects us all at times, but in very different degrees. And perhaps I was too long a doer, herding too much with narrow foreheads, drinking too deeply of the sweet and bitter cup, to experience that pure unfailing delight in literature which some have. Its charm, I fancy, is greatest to those in whom the natural man, deprived in early life of his proper aliment, grows sickly and pale, and perishes at last of inanition. There is ample room then for the latter higher growth--the unnatural cultivated man. Lovers of literature are accustomed to say that they find certain works [...] "helpful" [...] to them; and doubtless, being all intellect, they are right. But we, the less highly developed, are compounded of two natures, and while this spiritual pabulum sustains one, the other and larger nature is starved; for the larger nature is earthly, and draws its sustenance from the earth. I must look at a leaf, or smell the sod, or touch a rough pebble, or hear some natural sound, if only the chirp of a cricket, or feel the sun or wind or rain on my face. The book itself may spoil the pleasure it was designed to give me, and instead of satisfying my hunger, increase it until the craving and sensation of emptiness becomes intolerable. Not any day spent in a library would I live again, but rather some lurid day of labour and anxiety, of strife, or peril, or passion.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} and interpret patients’, family members’ and ambulance personnel’s experiences {{with regard to}} survival, attendance, and caring at cardiac arrests and deaths, and to analyze ethical conflicts that arise in relation to families and how the personnel’s ethical competence can affect caring {{and the ability to}} handle ethical problems. Method: The three interview studies were guided by a reflective lifeworld approach grounded in phenomenology and analyzed by searching for the essence of the phenomenon in two studies and by attaining a main interpretation in one study. In the fourth study, the general approach was supplemented by “reflective equilibrium” that guided the ethical analysis. Results: The survivors are striving towards a good life by means of efforts to reach meaning and coherence, facing existential fear and insecurity as well as gratitude and the joy of life. Family members lose everyday control through <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>unreality,</b> inadequacy and overwhelming responsibility. Ambulance personnel’s care mediates hope and despair until the announcement of survival or death. After the event, family members risk involuntary loneliness and anxiety about the future. For the ambulance personnel, caring for families involves a need for mobility in decision making, forcing the personnel to balance their own perceptions, feelings and reactions against interpretative reasoning. To base decision making on emotional reactions creates the risk of erroneous conclusions and a care relationship with elements of dishonesty, misdirected benevolence and false hopes. Identification with family members can promote recognition of and response to their existential needs, but also frustrate meeting family members emotions’ and handling one’s own vulnerability and inadequacy. It was found that futile cardiopulmonary resuscitation, administered to patients for the benefit of family members, is not an acceptable moral practice, due both to norms of not deliberately treating persons as mere means and to norms of taking care of families. Conclusions: Ethical conflicts exist when it comes to conveying realistic hope, relief from guilt, participation, responsibility for decision making, and fairness in the professional role. Ambulance personnel need support to enhance ethical caring competence and to deal with personal discomfort, as well as clear guidelines on family support...|$|R
