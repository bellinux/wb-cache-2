The different Reynold numbers and expansion ratio has given the different flow pattern around the <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> region.

40|$|The {{process piping}} in the {{refinery}} plant {{does not always}} have straight pipe geometry. The configuration of these pipelines are usually zigzag or snake-like. The pipe fittings or joints including <b>elbow</b> <b>pipes,</b> blind-tee pipes, T-pipes, Y-pipes {{are found to be}} common in a refinery. One of the reasons why the pipelines are layed in zigzag or snake-like configuration is because of the limited space for the piping equipment even in the largest refineries. The aim of the thesis is to study the physical flow inside a pipe with focus on blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipes.</b> Laminar flow regime with Reynolds number equals to 1000 is investigated in this study. The analysis utilizes CFD numerical simulations by using OpenFOAM to investigate the physical flow inside the studied pipes. The geometry of the pipes which are used in this study have a diameter (D) of 1 m, and the blind-tee length varied from 1 D to 5 D. In order to achieve the main objective, there are sub-objectives which need to be carried out. First, the laminar flow analysis of the straight pipe with a length 10 D is investigated as the base case of the study. Since the straight pipe is installed before and after the pipe joints in order to attain the fully developed desirable flow profile. Second, the geometry and mesh setup of the studied pipes are created by using Autodesk Inventor, GMSH and SALOME Software, starting with the straight pipe, and then followed by the blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe.</b> Third, the numerical analysis is carried out by performing OpenFOAM CFD simulations. Fourth, the sensitivity studies of different mesh elements, timesteps, and Reynolds number are carried out. Last, the results of the velocity profiles obtained from the numerical simulations are validated with the velocity profiles of laminar flow derived from the analytical solution of classical formula. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of fluid flow in the straight <b>pipe,</b> blind-tee, and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> are presented. In addition, the streamline, velocity contour, and pressure contour of the blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> cases are shown. For the straight pipe case, the velocity profile in the pipe agrees well with the analytical solution of classical formula. For the blind-tee and <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> cases, the velocity profile at the 5 D from the inlet and 5 D from the outlet have been checked for grid convergence studies. It is found that there are flow circulations, which occurs inside the blind-tee. Moreover, for the blind-tee with the tee lengths that are equal to 4 D and 5 D, fluid deposits would very likely occur, since the velocity inside this tee is very low...|$|R

The pattern and the intensity of the Dean vortex and the small scale eddies change over time and induce the asymmetry of the flow field.

One of the regions most at risk of suffering from thermal fatigue is a small <b>elbow</b> <b>pipe</b> branching off from the main pipe of the coolant loop for the drain or letdown system in the chemical and volume control system (CVCS). This work focuses on a fundamental description of the thermal stratification caused by turbulent penetration and buoyancy effects in the <b>elbow</b> branch <b>pipe</b> using large-eddy simulations (LESs). The LES results for the normalized temperature, mean temperature, and root-mean square (RMS) temperature {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the available experimental data which confirms that LES can predict the thermal stratification in a closed <b>elbow</b> branch <b>pipe</b> where cold fluids are stagnant. Subsequently, the flow and heat transfer were numerically predicted using LES when leakage occurred in the <b>elbow</b> branch <b>pipe.</b> The numerical results show that the thermal stratification region is pushed towards the horizontal part and may remain {{there for a long time}} for a leakage ratio of 1 %. However, thermal stratification is quickly eliminated for a leakage ratio of 5 %, although there is a higher power spectrum density (PSD) of the temperature in the early stages of the leakage. It may be concluded that a small leakage ratio can result in the <b>elbow</b> branch <b>pipe</b> being at high risk of thermal fatigue caused by thermal stratification...|$|R

50|$|Knut Fladmark, a {{professor}} in the Archaeology Department at Simon Fraser University, believes argillite was known to the Haida pre-European contact, and that it had been used for more utilitarian purposes such as the creation of labrets. Fladmark excavated at the Richardson Ranch site on Graham Island, located near the mouth of the Tlell River. During the summers of 1969 and 1970 he found the first major archaeological assemblage of argillite. Fladmark’s analysis of the assemblage led him to believe that the creation of argillite pieces for the purpose of trade followed its use within the Haida community as a pipestone. The <b>elbow</b> <b>pipes</b> Fladmark discovered at the site may predate the generally accepted 1820 start date for the production of argillite as a saleable commodity. These <b>elbow</b> <b>pipes</b> have little to no decoration and seemingly serve a utilitarian purpose only, characteristics which separate them from the later non-functional panel pipes, and other solely aesthetic argillite pieces.

The crack on the external {{surface of the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> was revealed. Macrodelamination was occurred in the steel being influenced by the joined action of working loads and hydrogen absorbed by metal during long-term operation. The causes of the material degradation were investigated by non-destructive testing using ultrasound thickness meter, observing microstructure, hydrostatic pressure testing, and mechanical properties testing of pipe steel. Intensive degradation of steel, primarily essential reduction of plasticity was revealed. The degradation degree of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> steel was higher than of the straight pipe steel regardless of a section was tensioned or compressed. Basing on the tensile tests carried out on cylindrical smooth and notched specimens from the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> steel it was established that the plasticity of the damaged steel could be measured correctly only on the specimens with a circular notch due to concentration of deformation in the cross section location only. The limitations in using elongation and reduction in area for characterisation of plasticity of the pipe steel with extensive delamination were defined. The diagnostic features of macrodelamination, namely an abnormal thickness meter readings and a sharp decrease in hardness and plasticity of the <b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> steel were established...|$|R

40|$|Gasses and fluids are transported via an {{extensive}} infrastructure of steel pipelines. In {{the design of}} pipeline systems the use of <b>elbows</b> (<b>pipe</b> bends) is important because their flexibility makes them able to sustain significant deformations. These bends can be subjected to permanent deformations due to various load combinations {{which can lead to}} progressive material damage. There are three stages commonly observed in ductile damage: void nucleation, growth and coalescence. When subjected to varying bending loads low cycle fatigue damage may occur. Within this research project Finite Element Analysis is used to simulate the response of pipeline bends. Two element types are implemented to model a pipe bend, the classical shell element and an efficient tube element (<b>pipe</b> <b>elbow</b> element), respectively. To predict the structural response when subjected to monotonic loading a damage model is implemented for both elements. When subjected to cyclic loading three phases can be identified. During the first few cycles the permanent deformation increases rapidly. After some cycles, the rate of permanent deformation stabilizes until the point of response degradation. In order to capture this response a new material model, based upon the afore mentioned model, is proposed. Experiments have indicated that this model is well suited to determine the point of material failure. Structural MechanicsCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
