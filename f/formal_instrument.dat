They concluded with Tshombe signing a <b>formal</b> <b>instrument</b> of surrender with General Prem Chand and acting UN Civilian Chief George Sherry, officially ending the Katangese secession. Four days later he peacefully received UN troops in Kolwezi. Thant sent a congratulatory message to the peacekeeping forces, declaring that the conflict had been [...] "forced upon [...] ", adding that [...] "it was only after all other efforts failed that the order was given to undertake defensive action of removing the hostile gendarmerie roadblocks which has now been completed so successfully and fortunately {{with a minimum of}} casualties." [...] All the various political concerns about what ramifications a UN attempt to crush the secession might cause, such as a drawn-out guerrilla war or power vacuum, were virtually resolved with the successful conclusion of Operation Grandslam. Most of the international community was satisfied with the result, including the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|For the defense, Mr. Wentworth, without calling witnesses, in {{his address}} to the Court, stated that the {{defendant}} would not have resisted the payment of the rent {{if he could have}} discovered for what he was paying such, having frequently applied to Mr Campbell for the boundaries of his farm, but without being able to obtain them. In consequence of which, had the defendant been disposed to impound any cattle, he could not have done so without making himself liable to an action at law for a trespass. Another important fact was, that the defendant carried on a trade in supplying the shipping in the harbour with ballast, by the consent of the plaintiff; and yet although the farm ought to have been held sacred to the lessee, and which in fact the lessor was bound to secure to his tenant, a person of the name of Cunningham was in the habit of taking away quantities of soil for ballast, under the sanction of an order from the Colonial Secretary. In the absence of any proof of the title under which the plaintiff held the land, the defendant who was granted a very large portion of land from Sir Thomas Brisbane, had taken up a part of that grant adjoining the farm in question, but did not know how far he might have advanced for want of the proper boundary, and which the plaintiff also appears not to know. Mr. Wentworth contended, that by the evidence of the plaintiff’s son, it appeared that a <b>formal</b> <b>instrument</b> had been executed by the parties, binding them, under their hands and seals, to certain performances of a contract for a specified term of years, and that the present action of assumpsit for use and occupation, could not lie, but that an action of debt would have been the proper cause to pursue.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of MoUs over more <b>formal</b> <b>instruments</b> is that, because obligations {{under international law}} may be avoided, they can be put into effect in most countries without requiring parliamentary approval. Hence, MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these MoUs have factual treaty status. The decision concerning ratification, however, {{is determined by the}} parties' internal law and depends to a large degree on the subject agreed upon. MoUs that are kept confidential (i.e., not registered with the UN) cannot be enforced before any UN organ, and it may be concluded that no obligations under international law have been created. As was obvious in Qatar v. Bahrain, disputes may arise concerning the status of the document once one of the parties seeks to enforce its provisions.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the court}} action of 1831 Milton never disputed Campbell's {{title to the}} 120 acres, or that a lease {{agreement}} had been in place. Indeed {{a copy of the}} memorandum that extended the original lease, the [...] "second document", still existed. Milton also did not disagree with the evidence of Campbell's son [...] "that a <b>formal</b> <b>instrument</b> had been executed by the parties, binding them, under their hands and seals, to certain performances of a contract for a specified term of years". Milton instead disputed knowledge of the boundary between Campbell's 120 acres and Milton's adjoining 50 acres (referred to as [...] "very large portion of land") which he contended could not be proved without the title documents ("proof of title") under which Campbell held his land. Lack of knowledge of the boundary Milton contended caused him difficulties and for this reason he had resisted paying rent. Milton contended that not knowing where the boundary lay between the two plots of land meant that Milton did not know where the opposite boundary of his own 50 acres lay, left him open to a charge of trespass if he impounded cattle that wandered onto his land if the cattle were in fact on the land of his other neighbour, and left Milton without knowledge of how far to advance with improvements on his own property either in the direction towards Campbell's land, or on his opposite boundary. (That Milton was also missing the title deeds to his 50 acres was not drawn into his argument.) Milton also contended {{that he did not have}} the use of the 120 acres [...] "sacred to the lease" [...] as a man by the name of Cunningham was allowed to come onto the land and take away quantities of soil. Milton also contented that the action of assumpsit (or breach of promise to pay) for Milton's use and occupation of Campbell's land was not a lie, but that the proper cource for Campbell to have pursued should have instead been an action for debt under the second document, the memorandum.|$|E
50|$|I {{have always}} {{believed}} {{the law to}} be this, that when an offer is made to another party, and in that offer there is a request express or implied that he must signify his acceptance by doing some particular thing, then {{as soon as he}} does that thing, he is bound. If a man sent an offer abroad saying: I wish to know whether you will supply me with goods at such and such a price, and, if you agree to that, you must ship the first cargo {{as soon as you get}} this letter, there can be no doubt that as soon as the cargo was shipped the contract would be complete, and if the cargo went to the bottom of the sea, it would go to the bottom of the sea at the risk of the orderer. So again, where, as in the case of Ex parte Harris, a person writes a letter and says, I offer to take an allotment of shares, and he expressly or impliedly says, If you agree with me send an answer by the post, there, as soon as he has sent that answer by the post, and put it out of his control, and done an extraneous act which clenches the matter, and shews beyond all doubt that each side is bound, I agree the contract is perfectly plain and clear.But when you come to the general proposition which Mr. Justice Brett seems to have laid down, that a simple acceptance in your own mind, without any intimation to the other party, and expressed by a mere private act, such as putting a letter into a drawer, completes a contract, I must say I differ from that. It appears from the Year Books that as long ago as the time of Edward IV, Chief Justice Brian decided this very point. The plea of the Defendant in that case justified the seizing of some growing crops because he said the Plaintiff had offered him to go and look at them, and if he liked them, and would give 2s. 6d. for them, he might take them; that was the justification. That case is referred to in a book which I published a good many years ago, Blackburn on Contracts of Sale, and is there translated. Brian gives a very elaborate judgment, explaining the law of the unpaid vendor's lien, as early as that time, exactly as the law now stands, and he consequently says: “This plea is clearly bad, as you have not shewn the payment or the tender of the money;” but he goes farther, and says (I am quoting from memory, but I think I am quoting correctly), moreover, your plea is utterly naught, for it does not shew that when you had made up your mind to take them you signified it to the Plaintiff, and your having it in your own mind is nothing, for it is trite law that the thought of man is not triable, for even the devil does not know what the thought of man is; but I grant you this, that if in his offer to you he had said, Go and look at them, and if you are pleased with them signify it to such and such a man, and if you had signified it to such and such a man, your plea would have been good, because that was a matter of fact.I take it, my Lords, that that, which was said 300 years ago and more, is the law to this day, and it is quite what Lord Justice Mellish in Ex parte Harris accurately says, that where it is expressly or impliedly stated in the offer that you may accept the offer by posting a letter, the moment you post the letter the offer is accepted. You are bound from the moment you post the letter, not, as it is put here, from the moment you make up your mind on the subject.But my Lords, while, as I say, this is so upon the question of law, it is still necessary to consider this case farther upon the question of fact. I agree, and I think every Judge who has considered the case does agree, certainly Lord Chief Justice Cockburn does, that though the parties may have gone no farther than an offer on the one side, saying, Here is the draft,—(for that I think is really what this case comes to,)—and the draft so offered by the one side is approved by the other, everything being agreed to except the name of the arbitrator, which the one side has filled in and the other has not yet assented to, if both parties have acted upon that draft and treated it as binding, they will be bound by it. When they had come so near as I have said, still it remained to execute formal agreements, and the parties evidently contemplated that they were to exchange agreements, so that each side should be perfectly safe and secure, knowing that the other side was bound. But, although that was what each party contemplated, still I agree (I think the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn states it clearly enough), that if a draft having been prepared and agreed upon as the basis of a deed or contract to be executed between two parties, the parties, without waiting for the execution of the more <b>formal</b> <b>instrument,</b> proceed to act upon the draft, and treat it as binding upon them, both parties will be bound by it. But it must be clear that the parties have both waived the execution of the <b>formal</b> <b>instrument</b> and have agreed expressly, or as shewn by their conduct, to act on the informal one. I think that is quite right, and I agree with the way in which Mr. Herschell in his argument stated it, very truly and fairly. If the parties have by their conduct said, that they act upon the draft which has been approved of by Mr. Brogden, and which if not quite approved of by the railway company, has been exceedingly near it, if they indicate by their conduct that they accept it, the contract is binding.|$|E

As from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in 1948, the concept of the human dignity become used as a tool to protect the basic needs of humans. The other <b>formal</b> <b>instruments</b> of international human rights also make reference to dignity. Whereas international law widely accepted the inherence of dignity, controversies still arise around the source of the dignity. Polish lawmakers, on the other hand, have no doubt about the fact the concept of dignity comes from natural law.

An analysis of these mechanisms reveals that they are inadequate to ensure protection and restoration of environmental resources damaged during war. Thus, a mechanism is needed for assessing civil liability against nations for any wartime environmental damage. The United Nations Compensation Commission (UNCC), created to compensate victims of the Persian Gulf War, is a mechanism that if modified could fill this void. This Note focuses on the modifications that could make the UNCC a successful mechanism for assessing civil liability for wartime environmental damage. Further, this Note applies the adapted UNCC to the Iraq War, and examines whether U. S. -led coalition forces should be held civilly liable for damage to Iraq’s natural environment...|$|R
