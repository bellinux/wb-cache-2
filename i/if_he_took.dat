5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they would have to give chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended her, and {{to tell her that}} they should be friends. It is not known <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he was fine with Cristina dating other men.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} final race of the season, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher had already won the season's Drivers' Championship, having {{clinched}} the title at the previous race, the Japanese Grand Prix. Schumacher led the championship with 98 points; McLaren driver Mika Häkkinen was second on 86 points. A maximum of 10 points were available for the remaining race, which meant Häkkinen could not catch Schumacher. Behind Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen in the Drivers' Championship, David Coulthard was third on 67 points, ahead of Rubens Barrichello in fourth on 58 points. Barrichello {{was still able to}} clinch third place <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> victory in the race and Coulthard finished outside of the top six. Although the Drivers' Championship was decided, the Constructors' Championship was not. Ferrari were leading on 156 points, and McLaren were second on 143 points, with a maximum of 16 points available.|$|E
5000|$|Exact scoring with {{progressive}} penalty: A {{player who}} makes {{the exact number of}} tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid or overbid lose the amount of the bid, plus ten points for each trick under or overbid. For example, a player bids 4: <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> exactly 4 tricks, <b>he</b> scores 14. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> 3 or 5 tricks, <b>he</b> scores -14. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> 2 or 6 tricks, he scores -24. This variation makes it easier to [...] "pile on the leader" [...] and eliminate even a large lead in just one hand.|$|R

5000|$|Exact scoring with set penalty: A {{player who}} makes {{the exact number of}} tricks bid scores 10 plus the amount bid. Players who underbid score only one point for each trick. Players who overbid have [...] "gone set" [...] and lose 10 points, {{regardless}} of the number of tricks taken. For example, if a player who has bid four takes exactly 4 tricks, <b>he</b> scores 14. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> 5 tricks, <b>he</b> scores 5. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> 3 tricks, <b>he</b> scores -10.|$|R
5|$|Adams {{did work}} for {{publishers}} other than Marvel during the 1980s, {{as when he}} drew several pages of Batman #400 in 1986 and Action Comics Annual #1 in 1987. The latter {{is viewed as a}} turning point in Adam's drawing style, characterized by bulkier figures of Batman and Superman, though Adams explains that this was in part due to the influence of The Dark Knight Returns, and that the overall change in art was style partly due to deliberate experimentation on his part, and partly to Dick Giordano's inking, which exhibited a different line weight. That same year, he illustrated Gumby Summer Fun Special #1 by Comico Comics, a job he obtained through Comico editor Diana Schutz, an old friend who noticed the incidental images of Gumby that Adams had included in the pages of Longshot. Adams, who did not harbor fond memories of that cartoon as a child, and who feared he would be typecast as a Gumby artist <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the job, told Schultz he would only do it if she could get Bob Burden to write it, on the assumption that Schultz would decline this condition. Schultz, who initially wanted Mark Evanier for the job, considered this, and eventually agreed to it after contacting Burden, who was enthusiastic about the idea. That book, which demonstrated Adams' versatility in handling comedy as well as superheroics, garnered him and Burden a 1988 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue. Adams would later illustrate a second Gumby book, Gumby's Winter Fun Special, which was written by Steve Purcell.|$|E
25|$|The {{lead role}} was {{originally}} written for someone of Caucasian descent, but upon casting African-American actor Duane Jones, Romero intentionally did {{not alter the}} script to reflect this. Asked in 2013, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> inspiration from the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. that same year, Romero responded in the negative noting that he only heard about the shooting {{when he was on}} his way to find distribution for the finished film.|$|E
25|$|Mid-game, {{a tribal}} shuffle managed to swap every {{contestant}} {{to the opposite}} tribe {{with the exception of}} Brkich, who remained on the Chapera tribe with Lex van den Berghe, Shii Ann Huang, Jerri Manthey, and Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien. The tribe went on to lose the next challenge and upon leaving, Mariano informed van den Berghe that he would take care of him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> care of Brkich. Van den Berghe, Huang, and Vavrick-O'Brien voted out Manthey in hopes that Mariano would keep his word.|$|E

25|$|At {{home by the}} Christmas tree, Carcetti {{discusses}} {{his options}} with his wife Jen. She tells him that she believes he will do the right thing. Later, Wilson and Carcetti return from a second meeting with the governor. Wilson is enraged that Carcetti could not swallow his pride to rescue the school system. Carcetti is angry that the governor {{was going to call}} a press conference belittling him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the money. Steintorf consoles Carcetti, again telling him that he can do more good as governor himself.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, Graham {{was hospitalized}} due to liver problems. Afterward, he {{announced}} that he probably only had one year left to live without another liver transplant. Graham reserved a burial spot at the Green Acres cemetery in Scottsdale, Arizona, next to Eddie Guerrero. On March 31, 2011, The Phoenix New Times reported that Graham's doctor, Hector Rodriguez-Luna, acknowledged that Graham's advanced fibrosis may be early cirrhosis and that he could live for two more years <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> Interferon—a drug to help slow his Hepatitis C—and stayed in shape. By 2012, Graham was diagnosed with third-stage liver disease and cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|In 1784, {{after the}} King had {{returned}} from his trip to Italy and France, {{the relationship between the}} King and Queen soured. At this time, Gustav III spent more and more time with male favorites. In 1786, this came to an open conflict. The King had taken to spend more time at intimate evenings with his favorite Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, from which he excluded her company. When he gave some of her rooms at the Royal Palace to Armfelt, Sophia Magdalena refused to participate in any representation until the rooms were given back to her, and she also banned her ladies-in-waiting from accepting his invitations without her permission. In 1787, she threatened him with asking for the support of the parliament against him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> their son with him to Finland, which she opposed, and the year after, she successfully prevented him from doing so. She also reprimanded him from allowing his male favorites to slander her before him.|$|E

25|$|Frankie meets two {{neighbours}} of the Bassington-ffrenches – Dr Nicholson and {{his younger}} wife, Moira. Dr Nicholson runs a local sanatorium. Frankie writes to Bobby and gets him to investigate the establishment. On the grounds at night, Bobby encounters a girl who says that she fears for her life; she is the original of the photograph that Bobby found in the dead man's pocket. Several days later, Moira Nicholson turns up at the local inn where Bobby stays in his disguise as Frankie's chauffeur. She says her husband is trying to kill her and says she knew Alan Carstairs before her marriage to the doctor. Bobby introduces her to Frankie. Moira suggests they ask Roger <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the photograph {{from the body of}} the dead man. At the next opportunity, Frankie asks. Roger admits that he took the photo, recognising Moira and wanting to avoid scandal for her. Frankie leaves after Henry is found dead in his home, an apparent suicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimately}} failed crusading efforts did {{not preclude}} Thomas from seeking expansion. The {{death of the}} heirless Ulrich of Celje reopened the possibility of seizeing Talovac lands, but his father-in-law moved more quickly, leading to a new brief cooling in their relations. In January 1458, however, a new opportunity rose on Bosnia's eastern border. The turmoil that followed the death of Lazar Branković enabled Thomas to retake the formerly Bosnian part of {{the valley of the}} Drina, conquered by Lazar's father in the preceding decade, as well as to expand into the river's right bank. Thomas captured a total of 11 towns, keeping Srebrenica, Zvornik and Teočak for himself and distributing the rest among the local nobility that swore fealty to him. He then turned his attention back to Croatia. He suggested to Venice that, since the Hungarians had not yet appointed a new ban of Croatia, he and the Republic should split the banate among themselves. In June, he warned Venice that the new Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, Hunyadi's son, would not be a good neighbour to either Bosnia or Venice <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> hold of Croatia.|$|E
25|$|After Chase {{left the}} show, he was {{replaced}} by Bill Murray, whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first-season cast, {{but was unable to}} because of budget restrictions. When Chase returned to host in 1978, he found the remaining cast resentful at his departure and his success, particularly Belushi. Murray, goaded {{by the rest of the}} cast, and Chase came to blows shortly before the show. Chase's departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent; he threatened to fire Aykroyd <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the role of D-Day in the 1978 comedy Animal House, and later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The Blues Brothers (1980) with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in 1979 to pursue film careers. Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together in the wake of Chase, Aykroyd, and Belushi's independent successes. Radner had a one-woman Broadway show and Murray starred in the 1979 comedy Meatballs. In 1980, Michaels chose to leave the series to pursue other interests and {{was replaced by}} Doumanian, who wanted to give the show a fresh start with a new cast and writing staff. Michaels was followed by the remaining original cast, Curtin, Newman, Radner, Morris, Murray, and additional cast members.|$|E

500|$|Two family {{incidents}} {{during this}} time later surfaced during Romney's political campaigns. [...] A state park ranger in 1981 told Romney his motorboat had an insufficiently visible license number {{and that he would}} face a $50fine <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the boat onto the lake. Disagreeing about the license and wanting to continue a family outing, Romney took it out anyway, saying he would pay the fine. The ranger arrested him for disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped several days later. In 1983, on a twelve-hour family road trip, he placed the family's dog in a windshield-equipped carrier on the roof of their car, and then washed the car and carrier after the dog suffered a bout of diarrhea. [...] The dog incident in particular later became fodder for Romney's critics and political opponents.|$|E
500|$|On {{songs such as}} [...] "Subway Train" [...] and [...] "Trash", Johansen used {{ambiguity}} as a lyrical mode. In Kogan's opinion, Johansen sang in an occasionally unintelligible {{manner and}} wrote in a perplexing, fictional style that was lazy yet ingenious, as it provided his lyrics an abundance of [...] "emotional meaning" [...] and interpretation: [...] "David never provides an objective framework, he's always jumping from voice to voice, so you're hearing a character addressing another character, or the narrator addressing the character, or the character or the narrator addressing us, all jammed up together so you're hearing bits of conversation and bits of subjective description in no kind of chronological order. But as someone says in 'Vietnamese Baby': 'Everything connects.'" [...] On [...] "Trash", Johansen undercut his vaguely pansexual beliefs {{with the possibility of}} going to [...] "fairyland" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> a [...] "lover's leap" [...] with the song's subject.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{was looking}} forward to the race weekend and felt that his result would be good. Biffle was {{confident}} he could secure a top-five finishing position, and stated if his car's handling was good, he believed he could be in contention for winning the race. Having won twice at the track in the early 2000s, Kenseth stated that he enjoyed racing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and hoped the Roush Fenway Racing cars would be able to contend for race victories. Johnson was considered by some bookmakers as the favorite to win the race, and in the event he succeeded, he would have become the first person to secure four consecutive victories in a NASCAR Cup Series racing event since Gordon won the Southern 500 four times between 1995 and 1998. He said that it would be [...] "great" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the victory but would not approach the event differently than at a track where he had not won a race.|$|E

500|$|After Grant {{captured}} Fort Donelson, Sherman got {{his wish}} to serve under Grant {{when he was}} assigned on March 1, 1862, to the Army of West Tennessee as commander of the 5th Division. His first major test under Grant was at the Battle of Shiloh. The massive Confederate attack {{on the morning of}} April 6, 1862, took most of the senior Union commanders by surprise. Sherman had dismissed the intelligence reports received from militia officers, refusing to believe that Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston would leave his base at Corinth. He took no precautions beyond strengthening his picket lines, and refused to entrench, build abatis, or push out reconnaissance patrols. At Shiloh, he may have wished to avoid appearing overly alarmed in order to escape the kind of criticism he had received in Kentucky. He had written to his wife that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> more precautions, [...] "they'd call me crazy again".|$|E
500|$|Two Weeks Notice was {{followed}} by the 2003 ensemble comedy, Love Actually, headlined by Grant as the British Prime Minister. A Christmas release by Working Title Films, the film was promoted as [...] "the ultimate romantic comedy" [...] and accumulated $246million at the international box office. It marked the directorial debut of Richard Curtis, who told the New York Times that Grant adamantly tempered the characterisation of the role to make his character more authoritative and less haplessly charming than earlier Curtis incarnations. Roger Ebert claimed that [...] "Grant has flowered into an absolutely splendid romantic comedian" [...] and has [...] "so much self-confidence that he plays the British prime minister as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the role to be a good sport." [...] Film critic Rex Reed, on the contrary, called Grant's performance [...] "an oversexed bachelor spin on Tony Blair" [...] as the star [...] "flirted with himself in the paroxysm of self-love that has become his acting style." ...|$|E
500|$|Lincoln faced {{three major}} opponents. A {{split in the}} Democratic Party had led northerners to {{nominate}} Senator Douglas, while southerners chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party, a new party consisting mostly of former Southern Whigs, selected former Tennessee senator John Bell. As Lincoln would not even be {{on the ballot in}} ten southern states, he needed to win almost every northern state to take the presidency. Douglas was said to be strong in Illinois and Indiana, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> those, the election might be thrown into the House of Representatives. Seward was urged to undertake a campaign tour of the Midwest in support of Lincoln and did so for five weeks in September and October, attracting huge crowds. He journeyed by rail and boat as far north as Saint Paul, Minnesota, into the border state of Missouri at St. Louis, and even to Kansas Territory, though it had no electoral votes to cast in the election. When the train passed through Springfield, Seward and Lincoln were introduced, with Lincoln appearing [...] "embarrassed" [...] and Seward [...] "constrained". In his oratory, Seward spoke of the U.S. as a [...] "tower of freedom", a Union that might even include Canada, Latin America, and Russian America.|$|E
