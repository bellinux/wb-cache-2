5|$|Between {{the newly}} conquered Mongol {{territory}} and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan {{as well as}} the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence. Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> ranges.|$|E

5|$|Coulter {{knew the}} NK 15th Division {{had crossed the}} Taegu lateral {{corridor}} at Yongch'on and was heading {{in the direction of}} Kyongju. On September 6, he ordered the US 21st Infantry to attack the next day up the valley and bordering hills that lead northwest from Kyongju into the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> mass in the direction of Yongch'on. When it attacked there on September 7 the 21st Infantry encountered virtually no opposition.|$|E
5|$|Often, the {{migration}} route of a long-distance migrator bird doesn't follow {{a straight line}} between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers. For most land-birds, such barriers could consist in seas, large water bodies or <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> ranges, {{because of the lack}} of stopover or feeding sites, or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds.|$|E
5|$|Dani {{remained}} {{engaged in}} excavation {{works on the}} pre-Indus Civilization site of Rehman Dheri in Northern Pakistan. He also {{made a number of}} discoveries of Gandhara sites in the Peshawar and Swat Valleys, and worked on Indo-Greek sites in Dir. From 1980, he was involved in research focusing on the documentation of the rock carvings and inscriptions on ancient remains from the Neolithic age up to the late Buddhist period in the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> region of Northern Pakistan along with Karl Jettmar, Volker Thewalt and (much later, since 1989) Harald Hauptmann of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences, University of Heidelberg.|$|E

5|$|In 1805, on {{the journey}} westward down the Columbia, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{recorded}} seeing the mountain; noting that it was “a <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> of emence hight covered with snow” and thought it “perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.” They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it “a very high humped mountain”. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile <b>high</b> <b>mountain),</b> this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{in the top}} fifteen positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The flat stage finishes awarded a maximum of 45 points, the medium mountain stages awarded a maximum of 30 points, and the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> stages, time trials and intermediate sprints awarded a maximum of 20 points. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E
5|$|Their nocturnal {{approach}} to the breeding sites means that Zino's petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the barn owl, is a rodent hunter. Other than bats, there are no native land mammals on Madeira, although {{there are a number}} of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks. These are brown rats and feral domestic cats. Even the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> nest sites of the Zino's petrel are not safe from these adaptable predators, ten adults being killed by cats in 1990. Feather lice found on Zino's petrels include Trabeculus schillingi, Saemundssonia species and an unnamed species of Halipeurus.|$|E
5|$|While four {{divisions}} of the NK II Corps attacked south in the P'ohang-dong, Kyongju, and Yongch'on area, the remaining three {{divisions of}} the corps-the 3rd, 13th, and 1st conducted their converging attack on Taegu {{from the north and}} northwest. The NK 3rd Division was to attack in the Waegwan area northwest of Taegu, the NK 13th Division down the mountain ridges north of Taegu along and west of the Sangju-Taegu road, and the NK 1st Division along the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> ridges just east of the road.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} risks of {{travelling}} to <b>high</b> <b>mountains</b> and rescue in <b>high</b> <b>mountains</b> before provision of professional rescue. It summarizes major risks and most common injuries in <b>high</b> <b>mountains</b> and researches preparedness and equipment of laymen to provide first aid. It also proposes procedures {{to increase the}} chance of surviving in <b>high</b> <b>mountains</b> through education of people, going to <b>high</b> <b>mountains,</b> which can contribute on potentional increase of successfull rescue operations, initiated by laymen. Object of the thesis is to research risks of travelling to <b>high</b> <b>mountains</b> and rescue operations before professional rescue, which can last longer than in valley due to either arduous terrain or bad weather conditions and {{it is necessary to}} provide first aid in order to rescue the patient. This target was reached by qualitative research, dealing with six respondents. Scientific contribution of the tesis are the rescue cards, usable to educate laymen those cards were made according to conclusion, that lamen have got lack of skills in rescue techniques, required for travelling to <b>high</b> <b>mountains...</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> climbs along the course and {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> areas. With one exception, {{they are}} {{native to the}} Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of centers of {{diversity}} exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers of diversity, as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which {{is the center of}} diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> tops, species {{including}} ptarmigan, {{mountain hare}} and stoat {{can be seen}} in their white colour phase during winter months. Remnants of the native Scots pine forest exist and within these areas the Scottish crossbill, the UK's only endemic bird species and vertebrate, can be found alongside capercaillie, Scottish wildcat, red squirrel and pine marten. Various animals have been re-introduced, including the white-tailed sea eagle in 1975, the red kite in the 1980s, and there have been experimental projects involving the beaver and wild boar. Today, much of the remaining native Caledonian Forest lies within the Cairngorms National Park and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in Argyll, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.|$|E

5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. In the 2010 Tour, stages classified flat had three intermediate sprint points worth 6, 4, and 2 points to the first three riders across the line. For 2011, flat stages had just one intermediate sprint which was worth 20 points to the rider in first position, and the first 15 score points. The intention was to have riders needing to sprint twice during the day to score well. Points awarded at the finish of flat stages also increased, from 35 points for the winner to 45. Medium mountain stages awarded 30 points to the winner, <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> stages and the individual time trial gave 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage two. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{stage was}} {{considered}} to be one of two queen stages, most difficult stages, of this Giro, as it contained many <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> climbs and the Giro's most difficult summit stage finish. After the second rest day came an unusual stage, one that was very short in terms of sheer distance but on par with previous mountain stages in terms of difficulty. These stages were won by Carlos Sastre and Franco Pellizotti, respectively, who fought for the third step on the Giro's podium behind Menchov and previous race leader Danilo Di Luca. Though Sastre went on to win another stage, to Mount Vesuvius, it was Pellizotti who finished the Giro third overall.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the army}} {{boundary}} on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and {{advanced to the}} edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and North Korean troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the <b>high</b> <b>mountain</b> backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong-san. Prisoners taken by the ROK's estimated that there were about 800 North Koreans on this high ridge. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 North Koreans were inside Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the NK 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications were that the NK 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 North Korean troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close-in defense of Taegu. As part of this, fourteen battalions of South Korean police dug in around the city.|$|E
