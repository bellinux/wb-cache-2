5|$|In the 21st century, Silkies {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{ubiquitous}} ornamental breeds of chicken. They are often kept as ornamental fowl or pet chickens by backyard keepers, and are also commonly used to incubate and raise the offspring of other chickens and waterfowl like <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> and game birds such as quail and pheasants.|$|E
5|$|The swans, <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> are {{medium to}} large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened {{to a greater}} or lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists of a variety of animals and plants. The family is well represented in the counties, especially in winter when large numbers visit from further north.|$|E
5|$|Habitats {{within the}} SSSI include reed beds, salt marshes, {{freshwater}} lagoons and sand or shingle beaches. The wetlands {{are important for}} wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. <b>Ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, natterjack toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates.|$|E

5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. <b>Ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese,</b> lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b> Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E

50|$|Castor is French (Latin) for beaver. The town {{is known}} for its <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> {{migration}} in the fall since its territory includes many stopping points well frequented by migrating waterfowl.|$|R
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, white-faced ibis, California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|E
25|$|Waterfowl {{also make}} {{their homes in}} the {{freshwater}} areas around the Coast. These are the many varieties of <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> in the area.|$|E
25|$|The loon, {{the size}} of a large duck or small goose, resembles these birds in shape when swimming. Like <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> but unlike coots (which are Rallidae) and grebes (Podicipedidae), the loon's toes are {{connected}} by webbing. The bird may be confused with cormorants (Phalacrocoracidae), which are not too distant relatives of divers and like them are heavy set birds whose bellies – unlike those of <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> – are submerged when swimming. Flying loons resemble plump geese with seagulls' wings that are relatively small in proportion to the bulky body. The bird points its head slightly upwards during swimming, but less so than cormorants. In flight the head droops more than in similar aquatic birds.|$|E
50|$|The refuge attracts 120,000 {{visitors}} annually. Hunting, fishing, canoeing, wildlife observation, {{and photography}} are popular. Deer, small game, <b>duck,</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> hunting is allowed during {{seasons in the}} autumn and winter. Fishing is allowed year-round.|$|R
50|$|The {{wildlife}} habitat {{located in the}} park consists of a <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> pond, an aviary, and exhibits for various animals including birds of prey, peacocks, bison, emus, pot bellied pigs, white-tailed deer, donkeys, sheep, and goats.|$|R
50|$|Périgord {{is noted}} for its cuisine, {{especially}} its <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> products, such as confit de canard and foie gras. It {{is known as a}} centre for truffles in France. Périgourdine wines include Bergerac (red and white) and Monbazillac.|$|R
25|$|Farm Sanctuary {{achieved}} a legislative victory in California when in September 2004, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger {{signed into law}} Senate Bill 1520, sponsored in part by Farm Sanctuary, which bans the force-feeding of <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> {{in the production of}} foie gras and the sale of the product when made from force-fed birds. Both provisions took effect in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Baur {{played a}} role in a California law that went into effect in 2012, banning the {{production}} and sale of foie gras, which is made by force feeding <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> and causing their livers to expand up to ten times their normal size. He was also involved in passing a 2006 (repealed in 2008) Chicago ordinance banning the sale of foie gras.|$|E
25|$|At {{the centre}} of the park is a lake, formed by {{widening}} the River Lea during the development of the park in the Victorian era. The lake contains a small island which is not accessible to the public, and is home to various waterfowl, such as swans, <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b> At the end of the lake closest to the town centre is a large fountain. Adjacent to the lake is the recently (2005–06) refurbished children's play park.|$|E

50|$|The bay and the estuary of {{the river}} which {{comes to an end}} here attract little egrets, Muscovy ducks, huge flocks of herring gulls, greylag <b>geese</b> <b>and</b> mallard <b>ducks.</b> The {{diversity}} of breeds in the <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> population suggests that most of the original birds had escaped from captivity.|$|R
25|$|Pensthorpe Nature Reserve, {{near the}} town of Fakenham in north Norfolk, is a nature reserve with many captive birds and animals. Such species include native birds such as lapwing and Eurasian crane, to much more exotic {{examples}} like Marabou stork, Greater flamingo, and Manchurian crane. The site played host to BBC's 'Springwatch' from 2008 until 2010. A number of man-made lakes are home to a range of wild birds, and provide stop-off points for many wintering <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Israelites ate domesticated birds such as pigeons, turtledoves, <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese,</b> {{and wild}} birds such as quail and partridge. Remains from archaeological {{excavations}} at the Ophel in Jerusalem and other Iron Age sites show that domestic birds were available, but consumption was small. The inclusion of pigeons and turtledoves in the Biblical sacrifice lists implies {{that they were}} raised domestically, {{and the remains of}} dovecotes discovered from the Greek and Roman periods confirm this. Biblical references and archaeological evidence also demonstrate that wild birds were hunted and eaten.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{imprinting}} behaviour in <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> by Konrad Lorenz and {{the studies of}} instinct in herring gulls by Nicolaas Tinbergen, led {{to the establishment of}} the field of ethology. The study of learning became an area of interest and the study of bird song has been a model for studies in neuro-ethology. The study of hormones and physiology in the control of behaviour has also been aided by bird models. These have helped in finding the proximate causes of circadian and seasonal cycles. Studies on migration have attempted to answer questions on the evolution of migration, orientation and navigation.|$|E

25|$|Head {{and neck}} markers are very visible, {{and may be}} used in species where the legs are not {{normally}} visible (such as <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese).</b> Nasal discs and nasal saddles can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. Neck collars made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are very useful for larger birds such as geese.|$|E
25|$|Migratory {{waterfowl}} (ducks, geese, and swans) and upland {{game birds}} (ptarmigans and grouse) were a valued source of fresh meat. Grouse (spruce grouse, sharp-tailed grouse, ruffed grouse Lower Tanana deyh Tanacross deyh, ch'ehtêeg, tsą́ą' ts'uug Upper Tanana daih, ch'ahtagn, tsąą'ts'uu) and ptarmigan (willow ptarmigan and rock ptarmigan Lower Tanana k'orrh'eba, ddhełk'ola Tanacross k'étmah, ddheł k'aal Upper Tanana k'atbah) were taken opportunistically throughhout {{the year with}} bow and arrows or with snares and fence-snare arrangements. <b>Ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> were easily captured when molting. Men in birchbark canoes quietly approached waterfowl in bays and coves and shot them with bow and arrows. Women and children then caught the birds and collected eggs from their nests.|$|E
25|$|The {{presumption}} {{of a shared}} evolutionary history between parasites and hosts can sometimes elucidate how host taxa are related. For instance, {{there has been a}} dispute about whether flamingos are more closely related to the storks or to the ducks. The fact that flamingos share parasites with <b>ducks</b> <b>and</b> <b>geese</b> was initially taken as evidence that these groups were more closely related to each other than either is to storks. However, evolutionary events such as the duplication or extinction of parasite species (without similar events on the host phylogeny) often erode similarities between host and parasite phylogenies. In the case of flamingos, they have similar lice to those of grebes. Flamingos and grebes do have a common ancestor, implying cospeciation of birds and lice in these groups. Flamingo lice then switched hosts to ducks, creating the situation which had confused biologists.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used bird eggs are those from the chicken. <b>Duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> eggs, <b>and</b> smaller eggs, such as quail eggs, are occasionally used as a gourmet ingredient in western countries. Eggs are a common everyday food {{in many parts of}} Asia, such as China and Thailand, with Asian production providing 59% of the world total in 2013.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 471 <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> {{intestinal}} content {{samples were collected}} from wet markets and were determined for the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. For the detected isolates, resistance to selected antimicrobial agents was identified. Campylobacter spp. was detected in 114 / 291 duck samples (39. 2 %) and 47 / 180 goose samples (26. 1 %). Among the 161 isolated Campylobacter spp., 85. 7 % and 14. 3 % were Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, respectively. Resistance to ciprofloxacin (82. 6 %), tetracycline (77 %) and nalidixic acid (75. 2 %) was particularly high in the tested Campylobacter isolates. However, all isolates were susceptible to gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, neomycin and ampicillin. The presence of Campylobacter spp., {{as well as the}} detection of multidrug-resistant isolates in this study, indicates that consuming of <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> meat might be a potential campylobacteriosis risk in this region.

40|$|A {{study of}} quality traits of <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> eggs {{selected}} from {{different areas of}} Oyo metropolis, Southern Guinea Zone of Nigeria was investigated. A total number of 480 eggs (240 each of <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose</b> eggs) {{were used for the}} study and 20 each of the species eggs were taken for measurement on weekly bases. Data were obtained on quality traits such as egg weight (g), egg length (mm), egg width (mm), shell weight (g), shell thickness, yolk weight (g), yolk length (mm), yolk height (mm), yolk circumference (mm), yolk index, albumen weight (g), albumen height (mm), albumen index and haugh unit. Significant (P< 0. 05) effect was observed between the quality traits measured and the eggs from <b>duck</b> <b>and</b> <b>goose.</b> <b>Duck</b> eggs were better for egg weight (70. 45 g), egg length (62. 34 mm), shell weight (7. 80 g), shell thickness (0. 49) and shell index (67. 35) than the goose eggs. Most of the internal quality traits were also in favoured of ducks eggs for yolk weight (30. 50 g), yolk length (54. 88 mm), yolk circumference (6. 66 mm), yolk index (33. 89), albumen index (7. 89) and haugh unit (73. 24) than the goose eggs while only albumen height was better for goose eggs of value 4. 49 mm. It can be concluded that there are significant variability in most of quality traits observed which favoured the duck eggs than eggs from goose...|$|R
