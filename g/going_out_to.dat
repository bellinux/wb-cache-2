5|$|Collins {{was known}} for all night poker {{sessions}} before <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> open the batting but refused to play against his fellow cricketers, seeing no challenge in taking money from novices. His gambling attracted some criticism and Collins was seen by many, including some cricket administrators, as an inveterate gambler.|$|E
5|$|At 17 {{he became}} the leader of Glebova's claque, {{was working as a}} copyist for lawyers, and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a theater, a tavern, or a party every night. He would later draw on his own life at this time for his {{portrayal}} of Protosov in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse. Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother's divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of their possessions and the theft of their money.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean's {{birth in}} 1975, Lennon took a hiatus {{from the music}} {{industry}} and became a househusband to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple was thinking about <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E

They {{said they}} were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge over the Milldam, and I said I was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> there <b>to</b> get some of my traps together, and they could pick me up at the Art Museum if they liked. Besides, how could I explain?" ...|$|R
5|$|Julia {{had started}} <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast that she had been given the night before. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier.|$|E
5|$|On September20, {{roughly one}} day prior to Igor's arrival in Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issued {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings for southern Newfoundland and the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The following day the CHC issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} eastern and northern coasts. Although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island, warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Early on September22, all advisories were discontinued as Igor {{moved away from the}} region. In response to the storm's arrival, schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at St. John's International Airport. Offshore, an oil rig with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of Newfoundland on September19. In comparison to Hurricane Earl two weeks earlier, there was substantially less media attention given to Igor, attributed to the possibility of it <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E

5|$|It was {{announced}} in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova, assistant manager at Barcelona, would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager. Following his appointment, Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season, recording only two losses and amassing 100 points. Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi, who scored 46 goals in La Liga, including two hat-tricks. On 11 May 2013, Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time, still with four games left to play. Ultimately, Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid, despite losing 2–1 to them {{at the beginning of}} March. They reached the semifinal stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively. On 19 July, it {{was announced}} that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned, and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns withdraws a $1000 {{bill from}} an ATM, but he drops it and an updraft carries it {{away to the}} Simpsons' house, where it is found by Bart and Milhouse. Marge makes Bart and Homer put up fliers so {{that the person who}} lost the bill can reclaim it. No one can {{describe}} it correctly so Lisa suggests that they spend the money on a vacation, but then decide against it because Homer always manages to ruin any trip they go on. After realizing he can make money from the bill, Bart displays it in a museum in his tree house. Mr. Burns visits and reclaims his money, forcing Bart to close his museum. However, Bart has made over $3000 from the museum so they decide to spend the money on a vacation for Marge. Abraham Simpson suggests they go to Britain, where he hopes to meet his long-lost love Edwina. During World War II, he made love to her after claiming he was <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the front lines the next day, not realising that he really was shipping out the next day (D-Day).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} two {{seasons in the}} European Cup were a disappointment for Celtic; <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Dynamo Kyiv {{in the first round}} in their defence of the trophy in the autumn of 1967, then reaching the quarter-finals the following season only to lose their home leg against AC Milan, having achieved a credible no-scoring draw in the first game in Italy. Earlier in the season, Celtic set off a controversy {{in the wake of the}} Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. At chairman Robert Kelly's behest, the club sent UEFA a telegram condemning the military action and expressing concern that any team from Western Europe having to play a tie in an Eastern Bloc country. Celtic's stance received support from several clubs throughout Western Europe, although others such as Leeds United publicly criticised Celtic's intervention. In response, UEFA redid the draw for the first round of the European Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup to avoid pairing Eastern European sides with clubs from the West. This elicited a furious response from clubs and football authorities in the East, the majority of whom withdrew in protest.|$|E

25|$|In 1893–94, St. Mary's, by now {{largely a}} {{professional}} side, were again {{eliminated from the}} FA Cup in the qualifying rounds, <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Reading. Carter damaged a leg in a friendly match in December 1893 thus ending his playing career. With George Marshall now playing at right-back, St. Mary's reached {{the final of the}} Hampshire Senior Cup again in March 1894, but were defeated 1–0 by the Royal Engineers.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts {{had just}} taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about five.

25|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Board's business was derived from the evening fares of people <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> social functions or events at places such as cinemas, dance halls, clubs, and the like. The introduction of television in the early 1960s gave people a new and more convenient way to spend their leisure time, significantly impacting on the popularity of these types of activities. A fall of 19% in the Board's revenue between 1962 and 1968 was largely down to the sale of fewer off-peak fares.|$|E
25|$|The oil {{industry}} moved {{most of its}} local operations offshore during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1947, offshore leases were approved by the federal government, and seismic exploration of the Channel {{took place in the}} 1950s, even though fishermen complained that the underwater explosions were killing fish. The first of the huge black fifteen-story oil platforms, a feature of the seascape south of Santa Barbara for fifty years, went up in 1958. During the period, Stearns Wharf was the main connection for oil services <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the platforms.|$|E
25|$|In February 1959, {{the mercury}} {{distribution}} in Minamata Bay was investigated. The results shocked the researchers involved. Large quantities of mercury were detected in fish, shellfish, and sludge from the bay. The highest concentrations centred around the Chisso factory wastewater canal in Hyakken Harbour and decreased <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, clearly identifying the plant {{as the source}} of contamination. Pollution was so heavy {{at the mouth of the}} wastewater canal, a figure of 2kg of mercury per ton of sediment was measured: a level that would be economically viable to mine. Indeed, Chisso did later set up a subsidiary to reclaim and sell the mercury recovered from the sludge.|$|E
