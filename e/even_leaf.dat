40|$|In theory, {{plants can}} alter the {{distribution}} of leaves along the lengths of their twigs (i. e., within-twig leaf distribution patterns) to optimize light interception {{in the context of}} the architectures of their leaves, branches and canopies. We hypothesized that (i) among canopy tree species sharing similar light environments, deciduous trees will have more evenly spaced within-twig leaf distribution patterns compared with evergreen trees (because deciduous species tend to higher metabolic demands than evergreen species and hence require more light), and that (ii) shade-adapted evergreen species will have more evenly spaced patterns compared with sun-adapted evergreen ones (because shade-adapted species are generally light-limited). We tested these hypotheses by measuring morphological traits (i. e., internode length, leaf area, lamina mass per area, LMA; and leaf and twig inclination angles to the horizontal) and physiological traits (i. e., light-saturated net photosynthetic rates, Amax; light saturation points, LSP; and light compensation points, LCP), and calculated the 'evenness' of within-twig leaf distribution patterns as the coefficient of variation (CV; the higher the CV, the less evenly spaced leaves) of within-twig internode length for 9 deciduous canopy tree species, 15 evergreen canopy tree species, 8 shade-adapted evergreen shrub species and 12 sun-adapted evergreen shrub species in a subtropical broad-leaved rainforest in eastern China. Coefficient of variation was positively correlated with large LMA and large leaf and twig inclination angles, which collectively specify a typical trait combination adaptive to low light interception, as indicated by both ordinary regression and phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses. These relationships were also valid within the evergreen tree species group (which had the largest sample size). Consistent with our hypothesis, in the canopy layer, deciduous species (which were characterized by high LCP, LSP and Amax) had more <b>even</b> <b>leaf</b> distribution patterns than evergreen species (which had low LCP, LSP and Amax); shade-adapted evergreen species had more <b>even</b> <b>leaf</b> distribution patterns than sun-adapted evergreen species.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] cluster zone leaf removal of 'Pinot noir' was initiated at three separate pre-veraison growth stages (bloom, grain-pea size, and bunch closure) and maintained leaf free until harvest, for four growing seasons (2008 - 2011). Fruit anthocyanin composition was examined at harvest for the last two vintages (2010 and 2011) and compared to a control-no cluster zone leaf removal. Experiments were conducted at two commercially operating Oregon vineyards (site A = 420 rootstock/'Pinot noir' 115 scion and site B = 3309 C rootstock/'Pinot noir' 777 scion). All clusters contained the five anthocyanins typically found in 'Pinot noir'. Leaf removal at bloom and maintained until harvest produced maximum anthocyanin accumulation in 'Pinot noir' grapes (site A = 85. 24 mg/ 100 g and site B = 125. 06 mg/ 100 g), compared to no leaf removal (control: site A = 57. 91 mg/ 100 g and site B = 97. 56 mg/ 100 g). <b>Even</b> <b>leaf</b> removal at bunch closure (last leaf removal initiation period) increased grape anthocyanin (site A 73. 22 mg/bog and site B = 118. 93 mg/ 100 g) compared to control, but total anthocyanins were lower than grapes from bloom leaf removal (first time period).

40|$|In {{pre-treatment}} dose verification, {{low resolution}} detector systems {{are unable to}} identify shifts of individual leafs of high resolution multi leaf collimator (MLC) systems from detected changes in the dose deposition. The goal {{of this study was}} to introduce an alternative approach (the shutter technique) combined with a previous described iterative reconstruction method to accurately reconstruct high resolution MLC leaf positions based on low resolution measurements. For the shutter technique, two additional radiotherapy treatment plans (RT-plans) were generated in addition to the original RT-plan; one with even MLC leafs closed for reconstructing uneven leaf positions and one with uneven MLC leafs closed for reconstructing <b>even</b> <b>leaf</b> positions. Reconstructed leaf positions were then implemented in the original RT-plan for 3 D dose reconstruction. The shutter technique was evaluated for a 6 MV Elekta SLi linac with 5 mm MLC leafs (Agility (TM)) in combination with the MatriXX Evolution detector with detector spacing of 7. 62 mm. Dose reconstruction was performed with the COMPASS system (v 2. 0). The measurement setup allowed one row of ionization chambers to be affected by two adjacent leaf pairs. Measurements were obtained for various field sizes with MLC leaf position errors ranging from 1. 0 mm to 10. 0 mm. Furthermore, one clinical head and neck IMRT treatment beam with MLC introduced leaf position errors of 5. 0 mm was evaluated to illustrate the impact of the shutter technique on 3 D dose reconstruction. Without the shutter technique, MLC leaf position reconstruction showed reconstruction errors up to 6. 0 mm. Introduction of the shutter technique allowed MLC leaf position reconstruction for the majority of leafs with sub-millimeter accuracy resulting in a reduction of dose reconstruction errors. The shutter technique in combination with the iterative reconstruction method allows high resolution MLC leaf position reconstruction using low resolution measurements with sub-millimeter accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Plant galls {{constitute}} {{a branch of}} study and research which has been to me a subject of much interest for some time. At {{the start of this}} work, it was intended to include Plant galls in general, but after some months this was found to be too comprehensive a field and would in fact take a great many years to study fully. <b>Even</b> <b>leaf</b> galls alone, both of herbs and trees provide so large a field of investigation that ultimately I decided to confine my attention to those or our native trees and shrubs. Upon looking up the literature on this subject, it will be found that in nearly all cases, either the gall is described fully and mere mention made or the agent concerned in its production, or vice versa. This state of things is most unsatisfactory, as in studying galls, both the gall-maker and the gall formation must be examined in detail before it is safe to apply nomenclature. This work, therefore, sets out to give accurate and scientific descriptions of both galls and gall-makers. The difficulties encountered are manifold; firstly, our trees are all deciduous, hence, the collecting period is necessarily restricted to that time of the year between the appearance of the buds and the fall of the leaf. Secondly, the rearing of imagines is always difficult, especially in the case or the autumn gall; more will be said on this matter later. Lastly, due to war-time conditions much trouble was experienced in obtaining suitable literature and many invaluable books on this subject were unprocurable. The Plates at the back have all been copied from original material except in the case or the Phytoptid mites which have been sketched with the help of illustrations, the reason for this being the difficulty of making suitable mounts of these minute creatures, Where possible all stages or at least larva and imago have been sketched, together with the host plant and the type of gall-formation produced.

40|$|Beauveria bassiana strain 04 / 01 -Tip {{obtained}} from larvae of the opium poppy stem gall Iraella luteipes endophytically colonizes opium poppy plants and protect it against this pest. Development of a specific, rapid and sensitive technique that allows accurately determining {{the process and}} factors leading {{to the establishment of}} this strain in opium poppy plants would be essential to achieve its efficient control in a large field scale. For that purpose in the present study, species-specific primers {{that can be used in}} conventional or quantitative PCR protocols were developed for specifically identification and detection of B. bassiana in plant tissues. The combination of the designed BB. fw/BB. rv primer set with the universal ITS 1 -F/ITS 4 primer set in a two-step nested-PCR approach, has allowed the amplification of up to 10. fg of B. bassiana. This represented an increase in sensitivity of 10000 - and 1000 -fold of detection than when using the BB. fw/BB. rv primers in a single or single-tube semi-nested PCR approaches, respectively. The BB. fw and BB. rv primer set were subsequently optimized to be used in real time quantitative PCR assays and allowed to accurately quantify B. bassiana DNA in different plant DNA backgrounds (leaves and seeds) without losing accuracy and efficiency. The qPCR protocol was used to monitor the endophytic colonization of opium poppy leaves by. B. bassiana after inoculation with the strain EABb 04 / 01 -Tip, detecting as low as 26. fg of target DNA in leaves and a decrease in fungal biomass over time. PCR quantification data were supported in parallel with CLMS by the monitoring of spatial and temporal patterns of leaf and stem colonization using a GFP-tagged transformant of the B. bassiana EABb 04 / 01 -Tip strain, which enabled to demonstrate that B. bassiana effectively colonizes aerial tissues of opium poppy plants mainly through intercellular spaces and <b>even</b> <b>leaf</b> trichomes. A decline in endophytic colonization was also observed by the last sampling times, i. e. from 10 to 15. days after inoculation, although fungal structures still remained present in the leaf tissues. These newly developed molecular protocols should facilitate the detection, quantification and monitoring of endophytic B. bassiana strains in different tissues and host plants and would help to unravel the factors and process governing the specific endophytic association between opium poppy and strain EABb 04 / 01 -Tip providing key insights to formulate a sustainable strategy for I. luteipes management in the host. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Both Leperisinus oregonus and L. californicus are {{bark beetle}} species which emerge from Fraxinus latifolia brood logs as sexually {{immature}} adults and disperse to living ash. Occasional field observations suggest that, for overwintering and maturation feeding, L. oregonus enter trunks and branches, whereas L.; californicus enter twig crotches, buds and <b>even</b> <b>leaf</b> axils. Reemerged beetles also make these short burrows. Not only L. oregonus but also L. californicus initiate egg galleries April through June, and L. californicus adults that overwinter as larvae infest ash in August. Sex ratios of both species at emergence and also when {{trapped in the}} field to cages containing naturally infested logs were usually 1 : 1. In Sept. 1975, L. oregonus emergence varied with maximum daily temperature. L. californicus produced F- 1 and F- 2 generations in the greenhouse when provided with cut twigs and logs. Excisions of field attacks confirm previous reports that both species are monogamous and that females initiate gallery construction. The pars stridens, consisting of one file on the posterior medial undersurface of each elytron, showed bilateral, sex and species differences. The most notable were: left files shorter and wider than right files, females with fewer ridges than males, L. californicus with shorter files than L. oregonus. There was no species overlap in males' left file ridge spacing, averaging 1. 9 μ for L. californicus and 3. 0 μ for L. oregonus. Three-variable discriminant functions could completely separate the four species-sex groups. First principal components accounted for 47 to 68 percent of variation within species-sex-side groups. Left and right file measurements were correlated within species-sex groups, but redundancy was only 33 to 59 percent. Number of ridges was correlated with file length, even after the effect of elytral length was removed, within species-sex-side groups. The plectrum, a pair of scrapers on the seventh tergite's posterior edge, is absent in females. The distance between scrapers was slightly but significantly greater in L. oregonus than in L. californicus. In the laboratory, 25 of 50 L. californicus pairs mated while the male was on the bark surface at the female's gallery entrance, or partly inside the entrance. Based on 23 pairs, premating behavior averaged 16. 4 min and copulation averaged 6. 9 min. Most males of both species stridulated at conspecific female gallery entrances. In several instances, rival L. californicus males engaged in violent conflicts near attractive female galleries. In two cases, L. oregonus rivals gradually displaced resident males. Most male-male encounters were brief, and audiorecorded "rivalry" stridulation was similar to stress stridulation. Both were nearly continuous runs of short chirps. Premating and postmating stridulation consisted of intermittent series of longer chirps of alternating forms labelled "major" and "minor". Major chirps usually had similar numbers of toothstrikes but shorter durations and faster toothstrike rates than minor chirps. L. oregonus had faster series and premating chirp rates, shorter series durations, shorter minor chirp durations and fewer toothstrikes in both major and minor chirps than L. californicus. L. californicus had slightly but significantly faster chirp rates and shorter series durations after mating than before. Females were not heard to stridulate...|$|E
