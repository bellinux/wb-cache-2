The {{purpose of this}} document is to record the hazards evaluation process and document <b>potential</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> {{that could lead to}} the release of radiological and toxicological material from the proposed transfer of a limited quantity (approximately 100, 000 gallons) of waste from SY- 101 to 241 -SY- 102 (SY- 102). The results of the hazards evaluation will be compared to the current Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Basis for Interim Operation (HNF-SD-WM-BIO- 001, 1998, Revision 1) to identify any <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> where Authorization Basis (AB) controls may not be sufficient or may not exist.

5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a <b>potential</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>condition</b> for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|R
40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) {{is used as}} a fuel and intermediate product for petrochemical manufacturing. For storage and transportation, usual LPG tanks will be sealed and pressurized to eliminate the potential evaporative emissions and spillage. However, if there is a leakage, the probability on developing corrosion at the tank’s floor either internally or externally, will cause <b>potential</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>condition.</b> Corrosion is the destructive attack on a substance, usually metal due to the interaction of chemical or electrochemical reaction with the environment Even though the failure or leakage of storage tanks may not disturb the normal operations but it may have serious impact on economic and environment. Tank floor failures due to corrosion process are dangerous because the leakage would penetrate into the ground for years before it been detected. It has been estimated to a loss of USD 5. 5 billion per year due to the corrosion on the storages (NACE, 1984). External corrosion can be categorized as pitting corrosion, bimetallic corrosion and corrosion caused by water trap. It is very difficult to detect on when and where the corrosion has been set off as the ultrasonic measurements on plates which are irregularly corroded underneath may not give accurate results, and the inspected area is generally too large to be covered by a single probe...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) {{storage basin}} {{clean-up}} project, sludge that has accumulated in the K Basins due to corrosion of damaged irradiated N Reactor will be loaded into containers and placed in interim storage. The Hanford Site Treatment Complex (T Plant) {{has been identified as}} the location where the sludge will be stored until final disposition of the material occurs. Long term storage of sludge from the K Basin fuel storage facilities requires identification and analysis of potential accidents involving sludge storage in T Plant. This report is prepared as the initial step in the safety assurance process described in DOE Order 5480. 23, Nuclear Safety Analysis Reports and HNF-PRO- 704, Hazards and Accident Analysis Process. This report documents the evaluation of potential hazards and off-normal events associated with sludge storage activities. This information will be used in subsequent safety analyses, design, and operations procedure development to ensure safe storage. The hazards evaluation for the storage of SNF sludge in T-Plant used the Hazards and Operability Analysis (HazOp) method. The hazard evaluation identified 42 <b>potential</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions.</b> No <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> involving hazardous/toxic chemical concerns were identified. Of the 42 items identified in the HazOp study, eight were determined to have potential for onsite worker consequences. No items with potential offsite consequences were identified in the HazOp study. <b>Hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> with <b>potential</b> onsite worker or offsite consequences are candidates for quantitative consequence analysis. The <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> with <b>potential</b> onsite worker consequences were grouped into two event categories, Container failure due to overpressure - internal to T Plant, and Spill of multiple containers. The two event categories will be developed into accident scenarios that will be quantitatively analyzed to determine release consequences. A third category, Container failure due to overpressure [...] external to T Plant, was included for completeness but is not within the scope of the hazards evaluation. Container failures external to T Plant will be addressed as part of the transportation analysis. This document describes the HazOp analysis performed for the activities associated with the storage of SNF sludge in the T Plant...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the Dutch Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (DMQ) {{for the analysis of}} musculoskeletal workload and associated <b>potential</b> <b>hazardous</b> working <b>conditions</b> as well as musculoskeletal symptoms in worker populations. Its qualities are explored using a database of 1, 575 workers in various occupations who completed the questionnaire. The DMQ-questions can be categorized into 7 indices (force, dynamic and static load, repetitive load, climatic factors, vibration and ergonomic environmental factors). Together with 4 separate questions on standing, sitting, walking and uncomfortable postures, the indices constitute a brief overview of the findings on musculoskeletal workload and related working conditions. Homogeneity of the indices is satisfactory. The divergent validity of the indices is fair when compared with an index of psychosocial working conditions and discomfort during exposure to physical loads. Furthermore it appears that most indices and factors show significant associations with low back and/or neck-shoulder symptoms. The DMQ {{can be used as a}} simple and quick check to identify worker groups that need thorough ergonomic control. ©Medlin...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to divide}} traffic into {{meaningful}} clusters (regimes) and to investigate {{their impact on}} accident likelihood and accident severity. Furthermore, the likelihood of powered-two-wheelers (PTWs) involvement in an accident is examined. To achieve {{the aims of the}} study, traffic and accident data during the period 2006 – 2011 from two major arterials in Athens were collected and processed. Firstly, a finite mixture cluster analysis was implemented to classify traffic into clusters. Afterwards, discriminant analysis was carried out in order to correctly assign new cases to the existing regimes by using a training and a testing set. Lastly, Bayesian logistic regression models were developed to investigate the impact of traffic regimes on accident likelihood and severity. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} urban traffic can be divided into different regimes by using average traffic occupancy and its standard deviation, measured by nearby upstream and downstream loop detectors. The results revealed <b>potential</b> <b>hazardous</b> traffic <b>conditions,</b> which are discussed in the paper. In general, high occupancy values increase accident likelihood, but tend to lead slight accidents, while PTWs are more likely to be involved in an accident, when traffic occupancy is high. Transitions from high to low occupancy also increase accident likelihood...|$|R
40|$|Extreme tides and large, {{battering}} waves {{have the}} <b>potential</b> to cause <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> along the sandy southwest coasts of Maine and New Hampshire. Increasing storm tides inundate low lying areas, while building waves lead to beach erosion and structural damage. The combined {{effects of these}} dynamical forces are complex and not fully understood. According to a recent Northern New England coastal flood climatology (Cannon 2007), damage often occurred during Nor’easters despite tide levels significantly below the Portland Harbor flood stage of 12. 0 ft. The empirical relationship between storm tides and large, battering waves demonstrated the {{need to create a}} forecast prediction scheme based on impact and not solely on water level. Hourly forecasts of water level and near-shore waves were plotted simultaneously to visually display oceanographic conditions on a single diagram. The East Atlantic Water Level Forecast (ADCIRC) and Wave Watch III models were used to produce the output. The result is a web-based coastal flood nomogram, which is produced twice daily at www. gomoos. org. When animated, users can monitor for critical splash-over and coastal flood benchmarks as thresholds are exceeded.

The main document describes the risk binning process and the technical basis for assigning risk bins to the representative accidents involving the release of dried radioactive waste materials from the Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System (DBVS) and to the associated represented <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions.</b> Appendices D through F provide the technical basis for assigning risk bins to the representative dried waste release accident and associated represented <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> for the Contact-Handled Transuranic Mixed (CH-TRUM) Waste Packaging Unit (WPU). The risk binning process uses {{an evaluation of the}} frequency and consequence of a given representative accident or represented <b>hazardous</b> <b>condition</b> to determine the need for safety structures, systems, and components (SSC) and technical safety requirement (TSR) -level controls. A representative accident or a represented <b>hazardous</b> <b>condition</b> is assigned to a risk bin based on the potential radiological and toxicological consequences to the public and the collocated worker.

This project explored the development of real-time monitoring technology to be used for effective asset management. There is a critical need to develop technologies to assess and monitor the condition of these bridges over time, to improve the information available to decision-makers such that effective asset management strategies can be employed. This project investigated the development of an instrumented pile that could provide real-time data on bridge scour, allowing for the remote monitoring of bridge conditions by key managers and engineers. The developed technology has the <b>potential</b> to identify <b>hazardous</b> <b>conditions</b> at a bridge site, such that managers and owners can be notified automatically and appropriate actions can be undertaken. The instrumented pile monitors the temperature along its length using an array of semiconductor thermometers embedded in the soil in a river bed. This technology provides a practical means of managing a bridge asset by reporting on potentially dangerous scour conditions such that mitigation strategies can be employed. A prototype pile was designed and constructed that utilized an array of 64 sensors along the length of a 20 ft. HSS 10 x 10 pile. The test pile was installed in Hinkson Creek, Columbia, MO.
