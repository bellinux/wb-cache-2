40|$|The growing {{computational}} {{and storage}} needs of several scientific applications mandate {{the deployment of}} extreme-scale parallel machines, such as IBM’s BlueGene/L which can accommodate as many as 128 K processors. One of the challenges when designing and deploying these systems in a production setting {{is the need to}} take failure occurrences, whether it be in the hardware or in the software, into account. Earlier work has shown that conventional runtime faulttolerant techniques such as periodic checkpointing are not effective to the emerging systems. Instead, the ability to predict failure occurrences can help develop more effective checkpointing strategies. Failure prediction has long been regarded as a challenging research problem, mainly {{due to the lack of}} realistic failure data from actual production systems. In this study, we have collected RAS event logs from BlueGene/L over a period of more than 100 days. We have investigated the characteristics of fatal failure events, as well as the correlation between fatal <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events.</b> Based on the observations, we have developed three simple yet effective failure prediction methods, which can predict around 80 % of the memory and network failures, and 47 % of the application I/O failures. ...|$|E

Evidence exists {{for the relationship between}} high levels of aldosterone and augmented risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, cardiac failure, coronary artery disease and stroke. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the prognostic role of aldosterone in patients with myocardial infarction. METHODS:The study population included 96 consecutive patients admitted to our department for ST-elevated and non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction from June 2009 to March 2012. Plasma aldosterone levels were measured at admission to hospital in all patients. A 2 -year prospective follow-up was performed, and fatal <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events,</b> such as reinfarction, congestive heart failure and arrhythmias, were recorded. RESULTS:Aldosterone levels at admission were associated with incidence of congestive heart failure (P =  0. 02), ventricular arrhythmias (P =  0. 01) and all complications (P =  0. 003) after 1 -month follow-up. Moreover, high aldosterone levels gave important information in the medium term (24  ±  6 months). Specifically, aldosterone was a predictive variable of reinfarction (P <  0. 0001), congestive heart failure (P <  0. 0001) and adverse events (P =  0. 0002).

We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between PTH and cardiovascular disease (CVD) <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> intermediate outcomes. Methods We conducted a systematic and comprehensive database search using MEDLINE and Embase between 1947 and October 2012. We included English-language prospective studies that reported risk estimates for PTH <b>and</b> CVD <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> intermediate outcomes. The characteristics of study populations, exposure, and outcomes of total CVD <b>events,</b> fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CVD <b>events</b> were reported, <b>and</b> a quality assessment was conducted. Results were extracted for the highest versus lowest PTH concentrations, and meta-analyses were carried out using random effects models. Results The systematic literature search yielded 5770 articles, and 15 studies were included. Study duration ranged between 2 and 14 years. All studies were performed primarily in whites with a mean age between 55 and 75 years. The meta-analyses included 12 studies, of which 10 investigated total CVD events; 7, fatal CVD events; <b>and</b> 3, <b>non-fatal</b> CVD <b>events.</b> PTH excess indicated an increased risk for total CVD events: pooled HR (95 % CI), 1. 45 (1. 24 - 1. 71). The results for fatal CVD <b>events</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CVD <b>events</b> were: HR 1. 50 (1. 18 - 1. 91) and HR 1. 48 (1. 14 - 1. 92). Heterogeneity was moderately present; however, sensitivity analyses for follow-up duration, prior CVD, or PTH as dichotomous values showed similar results.

40|$|Abstract Background Progressive left {{ventricular}} (LV) diastolic dysfunction due to hypertension (HTN) alters left atrial (LA) contractile {{function in a}} predictable manner. While increased LA size is a marker of LV diastolic dysfunction and {{has been shown to}} be predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, the prognostic significance of altered LA contractile function is unknown. Methods A consecutive group of patients with chronic hypertension but without significant valvular disease or prior MI underwent clinically-indicated CMR for assessment of {{left ventricular}} (LV) function, myocardial ischemia, or viability. Calculation of LA volumes used in determining LA emptying functions was performed using the biplane area-length method. Results Two-hundred and ten patients were included in this study. During a median follow-up of 19 months, 48 patients experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including 24 deaths. Decreased LA contractile function (LAEF Contractile) demonstrated strong unadjusted associations with patient mortality, <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events,</b> <b>and</b> all MACE. For every 10 % reduction of LAEF Contractile, unadjusted hazards to MACE, all-cause mortality, <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> increased by 1. 8, 1. 5, and 1. 4 -folds, respectively. In addition, preservation of the proportional contribution from LA contraction to total diastolic filling (Contractile/Total ratio) was strongly associated with lower MACE and patient mortality. By multivariable analyses, LAEF Contractile was the strongest predictor in each of the best overall models of MACE, all-cause mortality, <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events.</b> Even after adjustment for age, gender, left atrial volume, and LVEF, LAEF Contractile maintained strong independent associations with MACE (p Conclusions In hypertensive patients at risk for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, a decreased contribution of LA contractile function to ventricular filling during diastole is strongly predictive of adverse cardiac <b>events</b> <b>and</b> death. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{development}} of atherosclerosis may {{be enhanced by}} iron accumulation in macrophages. Hepcidin- 25 is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, which downregulates the cellular iron exporter ferroportin. In haemodialysis (HD) patients, hepcidin- 25 levels are increased. Therefore, {{it is conceivable that}} hepcidin- 25 is associated with all-cause mortality and/or fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> cardiovascular (CV) <b>events</b> in this patient group. The aim of the current analysis was to study the relationship between hepcidin- 25 and all-cause mortality and both fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events</b> in chronic HD patients. METHODS: Data from 405 chronic HD patients included in the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (NCT 00205556) were studied (62 % men, age 63. 7 +/- 13. 9 years [mean +/- SD]). The median (range) follow-up was 3. 0 (0. 8 - 6. 6) years. Hepcidin- 25 was measured with mass spectrometry. The relationship between hepcidin- 25 and all-cause mortality or fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events</b> was investigated with multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) hepcidin- 25 level was 13. 8 (6. 6 - 22. 5) nmol/L. During follow-up, 158 (39 %) patients died from any cause and 131 (32 %) had a CV event. Hepcidin- 25 was associated with all-cause mortality in an unadjusted model [hazard ratio (HR) 1. 14 per 10 nmol/L, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 26; P = 0. 01], but not after adjustment for all confounders including high-sensitive C-reactive protein (HR 1. 02 per 10 nmol/L, 95 % CI 0. 87 - 1. 20; P = 0. 80). At the same time, hepcidin- 25 was significantly related to fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events</b> in a fully adjusted model (HR 1. 24 per 10 nmol/L, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 1. 46, P = 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Hepcidin- 25 was associated with fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events,</b> even after adjustment for inflammation. Furthermore, inflammation appears to be a significant confounder in the relation between hepcidin- 25 and all-cause mortality. These findings suggest that hepcidin- 25 might be a novel determinant of CV disease in chronic HD patients...|$|R

However, data comparing these procedures are scarce in the literature. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the outcomes of a population with AMI who, during the in-hospital phase, received fibrinolytic therapy followed by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: The study population included 3532 patients submitted to CABG (N = 574) or PCI (N = 2958), out of 15, 114 patients studied in the InTIME- 2 trial. Among patients treated with PCI there were no differences between those who received stents or isolated balloon angioplasty, so that their data were pooled for analysis. Results: CABG and PCI groups were compared regarding all-cause mortality (at 30 days and one year post-AMI) <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> (reinfarction, need of additional post-discharge revascularization and re-hospitalization for an ischemic event) within 30 days after MI.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of AAA in patients hospitalized for ACS and to evaluate it was associated with an increased cardio-vascular (CV) risk during follow up. MethodsBetween February 1, 2008 and March 30, 2009, patients admitted for ACS with significant (≥ 50 % stenosis) coronary lesions underwent echography to check for presence of AAA. The AAA was defined as dilation of infrarenal aorta with maximum antero-posterior diameter ≥ 30 mm. During a 2 years follow-up we recorded all causes death, CV death <b>and</b> <b>non-fatals</b> CV <b>events.</b> The combination of CV death <b>and</b> CV <b>non-fatals</b> <b>events</b> was defined as the primary endpoint. ResultsAmong 306 patients, 20 AAAs (6, 6 %) were diagnosed, of average (±sd) diameter 33 ± 3. 7 mm, with a maximum diameter of 45 mm, non requiring surgery. Follow-up at 2 years was available for 292 patients (95, 7 %). During follow-up, 77 patients (25, 5 %) experienced an event (all causes death or <b>non-fatals</b> CV <b>event)</b> : 23 deaths (7, 6 %), of wich 16 were from CV cause, <b>and</b> 55 <b>non-fatals</b> CV <b>event</b> (18, 2 %).

40|$|AbstractObjective. To {{determine}} the fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> cardiovascular <b>event</b> rate {{in patients with}} intermittent claudication treated with antiplatelet agents. Methods and design. Patients with PAD-II stage Fontaine (n= 223) and sex and age matched controls (n= 446) were followed up from 1974 to 1998. All patients were treated with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, 325 mg once daily or ticlopidine, 250 mg twice daily) and for risk factors, if present. The end points were death for any cause (vascular <b>event,</b> cancer, <b>and</b> others) <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> vascular <b>events</b> (myocardial infarction, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, and leg amputation). Results. PAD patients had a significantly higher mortality rate than controls (3. 99 vs. 2. 53 deaths for 100 patients per year, respectively), cancer (mostly lung, stomach and colon) and vascular mortality accounted for such difference.

40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: There {{have been}} many studies {{of the effects of}} nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD), but these have produced conflicting results. We performed a meta-analysis of these studies to quantify the magnitude of the association between NAFLD (and NAFLD severity) and risk of CVD events. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google scholar, and Web of Science databases using terms "NAFLD", "cardiovascular events", "cardiovascular mortality", "prognosis" and their combinations to identify observational studies published through January 2016. We included only observational studies conducted in adults > 18 years and in which NAFLD was diagnosed on imaging or histology. Data from selected studies were extracted and meta-analysis was then performed using random effects modelling. RESULTS: A total of 16 unique, observational prospective and retrospective studies with 34, 043 adult individuals (36. 3 % with NAFLD) and approximately 2, 600 CVD outcomes (> 70 % CVD deaths) over a median period of 6. 9 years were included in the final analysis. Patients with NAFLD had a higher risk of fatal and/or <b>non-fatal</b> CVD <b>events</b> than those without NAFLD (random effect odds ratio [OR] 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 26 - 2. 13). Patients with more 'severe' NAFLD {{were also more likely to}} develop fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CVD <b>events</b> (OR 2. 58; 1. 78 - 3. 75). Sensitivity analyses did not alter these findings. Funnel plot and Egger's test did not reveal significant publication bias.

40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{events are}} among the most common causes of death in {{long-term}} follow up after liver transplantation. An increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors has been acknowledged and increased incidence of cardiovascular events has been suspected. Cardiovascular risk scores have been used in liver transplant populations but their validity in this specific population has not been demonstrated. Methods: Outpatient charts of 438 liver transplant recipients were reviewed and cardiovascular risk factors at 6 months were correlated with cardiovascular events observed in a follow up period of 10 years. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to check discrimination between high-risk and low risk patients for cardiovascular events through three different cardiovascular risk scores (Framingham, PROCAM and SCORE). DeLong test was performed to compare area under curve (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow Test was used for calibration of Scores. Results: 303 of 438 patients were available for risk factor analysis 6 months after liver transplantation (175 male, 128 female). 40 (13, 2 %) fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> cardiovascular <b>events</b> occurred during the follow up period of 10 years. Univariate analysis of risk factors showed age, male, BMI, cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, creatinine, diabetes mellitus, blood sugar levels but not triglycerides, hypertension, type and dose of immunosuppressant agent significantly correlated with cardiovascular events. Multivariate analysis showed age, cholesterol and gender to be independent risk factors. ROC analysis for cardiovascular events demonstrated AUC of 0, 726 for Framingham, 0, 778 for PROCAM and 0, 804 for SCORE. Calibration for fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> demonstrated a good model fit for PROCAM and an underestimation of events through SCORE.

40|$|Self-rated health (SRH) predicts {{chronic disease}} {{morbidity}} including cardiovascular disease (CVD). In a population-based cohort, {{we examined the}} association between SRH and incident CVD and whether this association was independent of socio-demographic, clinical and behavioural participant characteristics. Population-based prospective cohort study (European Prospective Investigation of Cancer-Norfolk). 20, 941 men and women aged 39 - 74 years without prevalent CVD attended a baseline health examination (1993 - 1998) and were followed for CVD events/death until March 2007 (mean 11 years). We used a Cox proportional hazards model to quantify the association between baseline SRH (reported on a four point scale [...] excellent, good, fair, poor) and risk of developing CVD at follow-up after adjusting for socio-demographic, clinical and behavioural risk factors. Baseline SRH was reported as excellent by 17. 8 % participants, good by 65. 1 %, fair by 16. 0 % and poor by 1. 2 %. During 225, 508 person-years of follow-up, there were 55 (21. 2 %) CVD events in the poor SRH group and 259 (7. 0 %) in the excellent SRH group (HR 3. 7, 95 % CI 2. 8 - 4. 9). The HR remained significant after adjustment for behavioural risk factors (HR 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 3. 5) and after adjustment for all socio-demographic, clinical and behavioural risk factors (HR 3. 3, 95 % CI 2. 4 - 4. 4). Associations were strong for both fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> <b>and</b> remained strong over time. SRH is a strong predictor of incident fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CVD <b>events</b> in this healthy, middle-aged population. Some of the association is explained by lifestyle behaviours, but SRH remains a strong predictor after adjustment for socio-demographic, clinical and behavioural risk factors and {{after a decade of}} follow-up.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the incidence of fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> Low Speed Vehicle Run Over (LSVRO) events among children aged 0 - 15 years in Queensland, Australia, at a population level. Methods. Fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> LSVRO <b>events</b> that occurred in children resident in Queensland over eleven calendar years (1999 - 2009) were identified using ICD codes, text description, word searches and medical notes clarification, obtained from five health related data bases across the continuum of care (pre-hospital to fatality). Data were manually linked. Population data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics were used to calculate crude incidence rates for fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> LSVRO <b>events.</b> Results: There were 1611 LSVROs between 1999 - 2009 (IR = 16. 87 / 100, 000 /annum). Incidence of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> (IR = 16. 60 / 100, 000 /annum) was 61. 5 times higher than fatal events (IR = 0. 27 / 100, 000 /annum). LSVRO events were more common in boys (IR = 20. 97 / 100, 000 /annum) than girls (IR = 12. 55 / 100, 000 /annum), and among younger children aged 0 - 4 years (IR = 21. 45 / 100000 /annum; 39 % or all events) than older children (5 - 9 years: IR = 16. 47 / 100, 000 /annum; 10 - 15 years IR = 13. 59 / 100, 000 /annum). A total of 896 (56. 8 %) children were admitted to hospital for 24 hours of more following an LSVRO event (IR = 9. 38 / 100, 000 /annum). Total LSVROs increased from 1999 (IR = 14. 79 / 100, 000) to 2009 (IR = 18. 56 / 100, 000), but not significantly. Over the 11 year period, there was a slight (non -significant) increase in fatalities (IR = 0. 37 - 0. 42 / 100, 000 /annum); a significant decrease in admissions (IR = 12. 39 - 5. 36 / 100, 000 /annum), and significant increase in non-admissions (IR = 2. 02 - 12. 77 / 100, 000 /annum). Trends over time differed by age, gender and severity. Conclusion: This is the most comprehensive, population-based epidemiological study on fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> LSVRO <b>events</b> to date. Results from this study indicate that LSVROs incur a substantial burden. Further research is required on the characteristics and risk factors associated with these events, in order to adequately inform injury prevention.

40|$|SETTING: As {{part of the}} WHO-MONICA study, acute {{coronary}} {{events have}} been registered from 1983 until 1992 {{in the general population}} aged 25 - 69 years in two Belgian cities [...] Ghent in the northern Dutch speaking part of Belgium and Charleroi in the southern French speaking part. Registration of events was done according to an international standard protocol. OBJECTIVE: To study trends in total, fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>event</b> rates <b>and</b> trends in case fatality rates in these two cities. MAIN RESULTS: Incidence of CHD was on average 50 % higher in Charleroi compared with Ghent in both men and women (attack rate ratio Charleroi/Ghent was 1. 5 in both sexes). In both men and women, diverging trends were observed between the two cities for total <b>and</b> non- fatal <b>event</b> rates, while parallel declining trends were observed in fatal <b>event</b> rates <b>and</b> in case fatality rates. In both sexes, total attack rates showed a significant decrease in Ghent and a significant increase in Charleroi. Also in the two sexes, attack rates of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> increased significantly in Charleroi and remained stable in Ghent. Attack rates of fatal events decreased significantly in men and women in Ghent and in men in Charleroi. Both "total" and "in hospital" case fatality rates declined significantly in both sexes in the two cities. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence and CHD trends between Ghent and Charleroi were observed. These differences and trends are interpreted in the context of existing and still growing differences in the overall socioeconomic situation between {{the north and the south}} of the country. On the other hand, the efficacy of medical treatment of CHD is comparable in the two regions, as reflected by similar figures and trends for case fatality rates...|$|R

40|$|Urotensin II (UTN) is a {{vasoactive}} {{substance that}} may induce vasoconstriction or vasodilatation. Although this peptide {{is seen as}} a vasculotoxic substance, to date there is no prospective study examining the relationship between UTN and hard end points like cardiovascular (CV) events. UTN is much increased in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and this disease may represent a useful natural model to explore the relationship between UTN and CV outcomes. In this study, we analysed the relationship between plasma UTN <b>and</b> incident CV <b>events</b> (fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal)</b> in a cohort of 191 haemodialysis patients followed up for an average time of 3. 6 years (range 0. 07 – 5. 8 years). Plasma UTN in haemodialysis patients (median: 6. 5 ng/ml) was twice higher than in healthy subjects (median: 3. 3 ng/ml). During the follow-up period, 94 patients died and 88 had incident fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events.</b> UTN was significantly lower in patients with incident CV events (median: 5. 3 ng/ml) than in events-free patients (median: 7. 1 ng/ml), and in a Kaplan–Meier analysis, high UTN was strongly and inversely associated with incident CV events (P< 0. 001). Multivariate Cox's regression analysis fully confirmed plasma UTN as an inverse predictor of adverse CV outcomes, and in this analysis, UTN resulted to be the third factor in rank, after age and diabetes, explaining the incidence of CV events. UTN is an inverse predictor of CV outcomes in ESRD. Our data suggest that UTN should not be necessarily seen as a vasculotoxic peptide in haemodialysis patients...|$|R

Methods: The present research was a prospective cohort study of 800 elderly Brazilian outpatients (60 to 85 years old) with a 12 -year follow-up period (baseline: 1997 – 1998). The outcome variable was CV mortality or <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events</b> (stroke, infarction, angina, heart failure). Hypertension, diabetes, global and abdominal obesity, dyslipidemias, and metabolic syndrome were analyzed as independent variables. The analyses were based on Cox proportional hazard models and adjusted for gender, age range, smoking, regular physical activity, and previous cardiovascular disease. Results: A total of 233 fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> CV <b>events</b> were observed (29. 1 %). In the adjusted analysis, the following variables were associated with CV risk: hypertension hazard ratio (HR) : 1. 69; confidence interval (CI) 95 %: 1. 28 – 2. 24, diabetes (HR: 2. 67; CI 95 %: 1. 98 – 3. 61), metabolic syndrome (HR: 1. 61; CI 95 %: 1. 24 – 2. 09), abdominal obesity (HR: 1. 36; CI 95 %: 1. 03 – 1. 79), hypertriglyceridemia (HR: 1. 67; CI 95 %: 1. 22 – 2. 30) and high triglyceride/HDL-c ratio (HR: 1. 73; CI 95 %: 1. 31 – 2. 84). Hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia remained associated with CV risk regardless of abdominal obesity. Conclusion: In this prospective study, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, abdominal obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia were predictors of CV risk in elderly individuals. These results confirm the relevance of controlling these CV risk factors in this age group. Keywords: aged, cardiovascular diseases, risk factors, epidemiolog...|$|R

Using data from the MOnica Risk, Genetics, Archiving and Monograph (MORGAM) Project, sex-specific models estimating 10 year risk of stroke were developed using a Cox regression model stratified by country and including modelling of competing risks. Models were developed in a stepwise manner first using only data from questionnaires, and then adding data from physical examinations and finally data from blood samples. During 1, 176, 296 years of observation, 2928 incident fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> of stroke were registered. The developed model showed good calibration and accuracy of prediction. The discrimination of the model varied between sex and country but increased with increasing number of variables used (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0. 77 and 0. 79 in men and between 0. 75 and 0. 80 in women). The present study shows that using a large multicountry cohort from nine European countries it is possible to develop a stepwise risk estimation model for 10 year risk of stroke tailored to different availability of risk factors and still obtain valid measures of risk even in the simplest form of the model, with increasing performance of the model following increasing complexity.

The traditional approach to farm safety has consisted largely of education designed to prevent traumatic injury. While education is of critical importance, additional incentives {{may be needed to}} reduce fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> to an acceptable level. The Certified Safe Farm concept was developed in collaboration with two Nebraska health insurance companies. The program consists of combining an on-farm safety assessment and occupational health screening with an education program. The incentive to complete this program is to be eligible for a reduction in health insurance premiums, which are a large expense for farmers. A Certified Safe Farm pilot program was established in a northeast Nebraska farm community with no prior occupational heath services for farmers. A local nurse practitioner received agricultural health training and a local farmer was trained to perform the on-farm safety assessments. Eleven farms were enrolled in the program in the first year. While all passed the safety assessment process, a number of important safety problems were identified. Also, a surprising number of current health problems and risk factors for future illness were found. It is hoped that successful participation in the Certified Safe Farms program will be used in the future to offer Nebraska farm families reductions in their health insurance premiums...|$|R

Methods: The incidence of fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> cardiovascular <b>events,</b> {{as well as the}} frequency of occurrence of death from any cause in a cohort of 388 patients with CHF during 3  years of observation was studied prospectively. Circulating levels of NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and endothelial apoptotic microparticles (EMPs) were measured at baseline. Results: Median follow-up was 2. 32  years (IQR =  1. 8 – 3. 1). During follow-up, 110 cardiovascular events (including 43 fatal cases) were determined. Additionally, 74 subjects were hospitalized repetitively due to worsening CHF and also 16 subjects were readmitted in the hospital due to other cardiovascular reasons. In the univariate logistic regression analysis, the main factors independently related with cumulative endpoints were creatinine, fasting glucose, HbA 1 c, total cholesterol, uric acid, various types of EPMs, NT-pro-BNP, hs-CRP, NYHA class, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less 45 %, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In multivariate model NYHA class, decreased LVEF (less 45 %), NT-pro-BNP, hs-CRP, CD 144 +/CD 31 +/annexin V+ EMPs, and CD 31 +/annexin V+ EMPs remained statistically significant for cumulative endpoint. Adding of CD 144 +/CD 31 +/annexin V+ EMCs and CD 31 +/annexin V+ EMCs to the standard ABC model may improve the relative IDI for cumulative endpoint by 11. 4 % and 10. 5 % respectively.

Results from 1457 white men aged 40 - 64 at recruitment showed that phobic anxiety was strongly related to subsequent major ischaemic heart disease (fatal <b>and</b> <b>non-fatal</b> <b>events</b> combined) when other associated variables were taken into account. The phobic anxiety score alone remained significantly associated with ischaemic heart disease when scores on all the subscales were included in the analysis. Phobic anxiety seemed to be particularly associated with fatal ischaemic heart disease but was not associated with deaths from other causes and was no higher in those with a pre-existing myocardial infarction at recruitment than in those without. There was a consistent increase in risk of fatal ischaemic heart disease with score on the phobic anxiety subscale. The relative risk for those whose score was 5 and above was 3. 77 (95 % confidence interval 1. 64 to 8. 64) compared with those whose score was 0 or 1. The 49 participants with evidence of myocardial infarction at recruitment had higher scores on the subscales for free floating anxiety and functional somatic complaint.
