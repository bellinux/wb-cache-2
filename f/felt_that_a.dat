5|$|Periyar <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{small number}} of cunning people created caste distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore {{he or she would}} strive {{to get rid of this}} menace.|$|E
5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E
5|$|Burebista {{may only}} have outlived Caesar {{for a short}} time. In the same year he was assassinated in a plot by the Dacian aristocracy, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{centralized}} state reduced their privileges. After his death, the Dacian kingdom dissolved, {{with the exception of}} the nucleus around the Orăştie Mountains, while the rest became various smaller kingdoms. After Burebista's death the kingdom was divided into four parts ruled by the religious elite. By the time of Augustus Dacia broke further down into five parts.|$|E
60|$|No {{one spoke}} or stirred. They <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> awful and blessed spirit overshadowed the lovers, and were hushed, {{as if in}} the {{sanctuary}} of God.|$|R
60|$|Weston {{laughed in}} a rather curious fashion, and when he spoke {{it was as if}} he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{explanation}} of his attitude were due from him.|$|R

5|$|For , {{a planned}} {{expansion}} to Halo 3 {{that became a}} full game, O'Donnell and Salvatori abandoned all previous Halo themes and started anew. Due to ODSTs shift to a new protagonist, O'Donnell created new music that was evocative of past Halo but branched in a different direction. Since Bungie was aiming for a smaller, detective story feel, O'Donnell <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> jazz-influenced approach worked best in echoing the film noir atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, Singapore {{attained}} self-government and the City Council was dissolved. The Government <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{national anthem}} {{was needed to}} unite the different races in Singapore. The Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye selected the City Council's song as it was already popular. At Toh's request, Zubir modified the lyrics and melody, and the revised song {{was adopted by the}} Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959. On 30 November, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of these national emblems.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In light of what he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
50|$|The album {{title was}} named because Seaver <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> {{hourglass}} represents {{time in a}} creative way. The time he spent in working on the album was also a reason of the name.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. They <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> husband who cannot answer his wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 1858, and Lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful Illinois Democrat. With the former Democrat Trumbull now serving as a Republican Senator, many in the party <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support Trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party. Some eastern Republicans favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led {{the opposition to the}} Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state. But many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the party's Senate nomination with little opposition.|$|E
50|$|Notwithstanding the {{existence}} of the route through Sandown, the member companies of the IoWCR had long <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> independent direct line from Cowes or Newport to Yarmouth was desirable, and a number of schemes had been proposed.|$|R

5|$|During {{the three}} months of his rule, Minh, his {{civilian}} Prime Minister Nguyen Ngoc Tho, and his leading military colleagues, Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim, attempted to defeat the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) non-militarily. They <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> battleground victory was impractical or impossible and pursued a strategy of trying to politically integrate the insurgents into the mainstream. This meant an intensification of rural non-military initiatives {{and a reduction in}} armed operations. This brought them into conflict with the United States, who had plans to start bombing North Vietnam. At the same time, in January 1964, the French government of President Charles de Gaulle proposed the neutralization of Vietnam and the withdrawal of American forces. Khánh and his fellow plotters exploited this to spread rumors that Minh's junta was about to make a deal with Hanoi and then gained the support of the US, most notably through the chief of military forces in Vietnam, General Paul Harkins, who supported Diệm and opposed Minh's November coup.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
50|$|Their {{daughter}} Ada {{worked as}} a mathematician with Charles Babbage, the pioneer of computer science. Lady Byron had <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> education in mathematics and logic would counteract any possible inherited tendency towards Lord Byron's insanity and romantic excess.|$|R
50|$|Union leaders {{including}} Thomas were sacked {{for being}} absent on union business {{at this time}} and it was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> attack on the unions was imminent. This appeared to be confirmed in the following actions of the Mine Managers Association (MMA).|$|R
5000|$|In January 1900 French money {{became the}} only legal {{currency}} in Madagascar.The use of [...] "Monnaie Coupee" [...] continued for a further five years until 1905 when it was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> adequate supply of French coins and notes was in circulation.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, British ships {{continued}} to arrive. On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived. At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 war ships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure {{as to where}} the British would attack. Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. He broke his army in half, stationing half of it on Manhattan, {{and the other half}} on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene. On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena was {{produced}} {{on a budget}} of 8 million. Released on 4 March 1988, the film received critical acclaim. It was also premiered at the 12th International Film Festival of India. However, it was a commercial failure and Babu had to incur a loss of 0.6 million. It was dubbed as a setback for Chiranjeevi who had starred in a streak of successful films such as Pasivadi Pranam, Swayamkrushi, Jebu Donga (all released in 1987) and Manchi Donga (1988). Babu considered Rudraveena a spiritually awakening film personally and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> book could be written about it. The film was remade into Tamil as Unnal Mudiyum Thambi {{in the same year}} by Balachander himself, with Kamal Haasan reprising Chiranjeevi's role, while Ganesan reprised his role.|$|E
5|$|The WSPU's {{approval}} of property destruction {{led to the}} departure of several important members. The first were Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and her husband Frederick. They had long been integral members of the group's leadership but found themselves in conflict with Christabel {{about the wisdom of}} such volatile tactics. After returning from a vacation in Canada they found that Pankhurst had expelled them from the WSPU. The pair found the decision appalling, but to avoid a schism in the movement they continued to praise Pankhurst and the organisation in public. Around the same time, Emmeline's daughter Adela left the group. She disapproved of WSPU endorsement of property destruction and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> heavier emphasis on socialism was necessary. Adela's relationship with her family – especially Christabel – was also strained as a result.|$|E
60|$|Frank, {{who knew}} the man, glanced at the letter {{and looked at his}} cousin; but he said nothing. He was, however, a little jealous, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> injury was done to him by any {{correspondence}} between Miss Dunstable and his cousin George.|$|R

50|$|Wyckoff was {{thorough}} in {{his analysis}} of the trading range. One tool that Wyckoff provides is the concept of the Composite Operator. Simply, Wyckoff <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> experienced judge of the market should regard the whole story that appears on the tape as though it were the expression of a single mind. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was <b>an</b> important psychological and tactical advantage to stay in harmony with this omnipotent player. By striving to follow his footsteps, Wyckoff felt we are better prepared to grow our portfolios and net-worth.|$|R
5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to do their work. Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E
5|$|This Act made null {{and void}} (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 that had repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of the}} See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever saying she was. This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E

50|$|On 12 November 1944 the 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia, {{still under}} SEAC, {{because it was}} <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>an</b> inter-Allied command {{was better than the}} purely British headquarters. Command {{problems}} with General Stilwell and his interactions with the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff had precipitated the change.|$|R
