5|$|Bilateral {{relations}} with the United States are strained because the U.S. Department of State supports various anti-Lukashenko non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and also because the Belarusian government <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> increasingly difficult for United States-based organizations to operate within the country. Diplomatic relations remained tense, and in 2004, the United States passed the Belarus Democracy Act, which authorized funding for anti-government Belarusian NGOs, and prohibited loans to the Belarusian government, except for humanitarian purposes. Despite this political friction, the two countries do cooperate on intellectual property protection, prevention of human trafficking, technology crime, and disaster relief.|$|E

However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

Gibraltar is largely self-governed, with its own parliament and government, though the UK maintains responsibility for defence and foreign policy.
