40|$|Abstract: The bromuconazol is a {{fungicide}} {{which is}} toxic for the environment. This {{present study was}} led {{with the aim of}} testing, in vitro, its biodegradation. The bromuconazol was thus used {{in the presence of a}} microbial consortium resulting from a treated soil. A biphasic system MBS / oil of silicone was used during all the period of acclimatization. The fermentation was followed by measure of the optical density, the determination of the dry weight, the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>power</b> as well as the hydrophobicity of the selected consortium. The results obtained after one year revealed a strong adaptation of this one to the bromuconazol. The use of the biphasic system allowed a better assimilation of the pesticide. The microbiological study allowed identifying a single bacterial strain capable of using the fungicide as unique source of carbon. It is about Aeromonas hydrophila. This strain shows a strong hydrophobicity as well as an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>power</b> lived in saw some pesticide...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the chemical composition of taro mucilage (TM) and explain its emulsification properties using different commercial emulsifiers and gums as benchmarks. The following analyses were performed: moisture, ether extract, protein, fiber, ash, sugar fraction, starch content, infrared spectroscopy and determination of monosaccharides and amino acids using HPLC. The analyses showed that TM has a high carbohydrate content and small protein fraction, similar to commercial gums. Commercial emulsifiers have a high content of lipids compared to TM. Therefore, it can be concluded that the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>power</b> of the studied mucilage is primarily caused by the protein content along with weakly polar amino acids, which occur in gums. The methyl group (CH 3), which was observed in the infrared spectrum, and the lipid content may also contribute to the emulsifying activity by providing a hydrophobic moiety...|$|E
40|$|Emulsion is {{a mixture}} of two {{immiscible}} substances. For the emulsion, we have two types which are Oil-in water emulsions (O/W) and Water –in-oil emulsions (W/O). Diesel fuel emulsions are blended mixtures of diesel fuel, water, emulsifying agents and other additives, that reduce particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions, {{as a result of the}} added water. Addition of water to the emulsified fuel also reduces the energy content of the fuel, with corresponding reductions in fuel economy and engine <b>power.</b> <b>Emulsified</b> diesel fuel has been the subject of several studies, and for comparative purposes in several others. This emulsified diesel fuel is a combination of diesel fuel with 20 % water by weight, and an "additive package" for stabilizing the fuel-water emulsion. To mixed diesel with water we should add surfactants. The surfactants that we used are Sorbitan monoolate, NF,(Span 80), Polysorbate 60,NF,(Tween 60), Polysorbate 80,NF,(Tween 80), Triton X- 100. The components required for making emulsion are mechanical agitator, diesel, distillated water,surfactants, burette, and pipette...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the stability of}} emulsions of oil in several nonaque-ous polar liquids using commercially available nonionic surfac-tants. Stable nonaqueous emulsions were only obtained with for-mamide and dimethylsulfoxide. Hydrogen bonding, and not polar-ity, {{appears to be the}} important factor determining the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>power</b> of a solvent. Ostwald ripening plays a much more important role in the stability of these nonaqueous emulsions than in the corresponding aqueous systems. This destabilizing process can be prevented, however, by addition to the oil phase of a small amount (1 %) of an oil that has a very low solubility in the continuous phase. Furthermore, a larger size of the surfactant molecule pro-tects emulsions against droplet coalescence. Thus, emulsions in formamide and dimethylsulfoxide did not show any breakdown when stabilized with a triblock copolymer of polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene. 0 1997 Academic Press Key Words: emulsions; Ostwald ripening; surfactants...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study in}} which the emulsifying properties of cocoa material with and without its lipid fraction were explored. This study was motivated by the commercial interest in naturally-occurring particulate emulsifiers {{as opposed to the}} chemically modified emulsifying particles presently available for commercial use. The hypothesis was that endogenous lipids from cocoa were responsible for driving the formation of stable oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions. The data presented includes relative quantification of phospholipids from different commercially available cocoa material using 31 P NMR spectroscopy and analyses of the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>power</b> of delipidified cocoa material. The commercially available cocoa material comprised several phospholipids, with phosphatidylcholine being the most abundant in all samples. Dispersions of delipidified cocoa material were found to drive the formation of o/w emulsions despite the absence of lipids. We therefore concluded that the emulsifying behaviour of cocoa material is not entirely reliant upon the endogenous lipids. This suggests that cocoa material may have a new and potentially widespread use in industrial food preparation and may inform manufacturing strategies for novel food grade emulsifiers...|$|E

40|$|Natural polysaccharides {{constitute}} a major group of biopolymers {{widespread in the}} whole vegetable kingdom. Plant polysaccharides comprise highly heterogeneous biopolymers that play diverse biological roles as structural elements, energy reserve and biological signalling. Polysaccharides from natural sources have attracted significant interest as biotechnological products, due to their commercial uses {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Some of them, for example, possess strong antigenic and antipathogenic activities and are successfully employed by the pharmaceutical industry for the formulation of vaccines or as a matrix for drug-delivery applications; others are utilised as food additives taking advantage of their physical-chemical properties (<b>emulsifying</b> <b>power,</b> viscoelasticity, polyelectrolyte, adherence, bio-compatibility, stabilizer, etc). Production of these biopolymers for industrial applications has both economic and environmental costs, depending on the starting materials used as feedstocks and on the chemical/thermal treatments required for their extraction. Recently, wastes from industrial processing of vegetables for food production have been proposed as potential sources of useful polysaccharides. Indeed, transformation and packaging of fruits and vegetables generates huge amounts of wastes, since only a fraction of the incoming biomass is effectively used. The management of such waste biomasses is a problem worldwide, from both economic and environmental standpoints, and therefore research is encouraged to implement new strategies for their re-use. An advantageous option is the extraction of value added chemicals, including different kinds of polysaccharides, besides chemically different species such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, natural pigments, tannins, carotenoids, antioxidants etc. Treatment of vegetable residues by means of newly and environmentally sustainable extraction techniques represents at the moment a fascinating challenge for the valorisation of agro-industrial wastes. Remarkable examples in this framework are represented by polysaccharides isolated from wastes of tomato industrial processing and of tropical fruit juices production based on granadilla, a fruit species of Passiflora, distributed mainly in the warm temperate and tropical regions of America and Africa. These polysaccharides resulted to possess useful biotechnological properties and interesting biological activities. An accurate chemical characterization demonstrated that the main biopolymer obtained from tomato wastes was an heteropolymer with a molecular weight higher than 1 × 106 Da constituted by glucose/ xylose/ galactose/ galactosamine/ glucosamine/ fucose in a relative molar ratio of 1 : 0. 9 : 0. 5 : 0. 4 : 0. 2 : trace, whereas the polysaccharide isolated from waste peels of granadilla (Passiflora liguralis) fruits (with a molecular weight higher than 1 × 106 Da as well) was characterised by the presence of six different sugar residues: xylose/ glucose/ galactose/ galactosamine/ unknown component/ fucose in the relative ratios of 1 : 0. 5 : 0. 2 : 0. 06 : 0. 05 :trace. The study of rheological properties showed for both biopolymers an high thermal resistance and an high viscosity, depending, in particular for granadilla waste polysaccharide, on concentration and pH, with a maximum value of 1. 4  at a concentration of 3...|$|E
