In the terror of 1937-38, the ruling elite was purged of Abkhaz and by 1952 over 80% of the 228 top party and government officials and enterprise managers were ethnic Georgians; there remained 34 Abkhaz, 7 Russians and 3 Armenians in these positions.

40|$|Mixtures of {{distributions}} {{are usually}} effectively used for modeling heterogeneity. It {{is well known}} that mixtures of DFR distributions are always DFR. On the other hand, mixtures of IFR distributions can decrease, at least in some intervals of time. As IFR distributions often model lifetimes governed by ageing processes, the operation of mixing can dramatically change the pattern of ageing. Therefore, the study of the shape of the observed (mixture) failure rate in a heterogeneous setting is important in many applications. We study discrete and continuous mixtures, obtain conditions for the mixture failure rate to tend to the failure rate of the strongest populations and describe asymptotic behavior as t tends to infty. Some <b>demographic</b> and <b>engineering</b> examples are considered. The corresponding inverse problem is discussed. ...|$|R

He worked subsequently on [...] "Baollak Eih" [...] (Tell You What) record in 1995 and musically composed all its tracks. The record {{was produced by}} Laser Records owned by Mustafa Dagher. In this record, Ameer Abdel Mageed recommended Angham to pick up songs that demonstrate her full vocal capacities alongside emotions. The track [...] "Tekdar Aal Meshwar" [...] (Are You Up To The Long Journey) was sung in 7.6 octave voice with a rich oriental music background.

Already within {{the early years of the}} 20th century, the Japanese had started to champion the ideology of Pan-Asianism, under which all of the Asian peoples were to united under the leadership of Japan, the strongest of the Asian nations and as the [...] "great Yamato race", the most racially superior of the Asian peoples as a justification for their imperialism. The CUP were greatly influenced by Japanese Pan-Asianism, which served as a template for their ideology of Pan-Islamism, where all of the world's Muslims were to united in the Ottoman Empire, led of course by the [...] "Turkish race". An American historian, Sven Saaler, noted the [...] "important connections" [...] between the Japanese pan-Asian and the Ottoman pan-Islamist movements in the early 20th century as well as the [...] "astonishing parallels" [...] between the two movements. [...] The ultimate aim of the CUP was to modernise the Ottoman Empire to recapture its former greatness, and just as the modernised Meiji Japan had defeated Russia in 1905, so too would the modernised Ottoman state defeat the western nations. To help with their plans for modernisation, the CUP created a number of semi-official organisations such as the Ottoman Navy League, the Ottoman Red Crescent Society and the Committee for National Defence that were intended to engage the Ottoman public with the entire modernisation project, and to promote their nationalist, militaristic ways of thinking amongst the public. The CUP planned on taking back all of the territory that the Ottomans had lost during the course of the 19th century and under the banner of pan-Turkic nationalism to acquire new territory in the Caucasus and central Asia. As part of its plans to make the Ottoman Empire great again, the CUP leadership stated to engage in an [...] "... increasingly radicalized <b>demographic</b> <b>engineering</b> program aimed at the ethnoreligious homogenization of Anatolia from 1913 till the end of World War I".|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} rebel {{governance}} predict that armed groups {{with access to}} natural resources will engage in looting rather than invest in building the complex bureaucracies that are necessary for taxation. This claim relies on an implicit assumption that {{the sole purpose of}} taxation is to collect revenue. I challenge this assumption with original data from 28 sub-districts governed by the Islamic State (IS) in Syria. The motivating puzzle is that IS imposes heavy taxes in oil-rich areas where existing theories predict low levels of taxation. The paper theorizes that this puzzle can be resolved by taking into account the non-economic benefits of taxation for insurgent groups, including (1) social control, (2) collective identity formation, and (3) <b>demographic</b> <b>engineering.</b> The quantitative and qualitative data presented in the paper suggests that IS imposes taxes that are not always economically rational but that nonetheless serve important functions in governance and state-building...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{collects}} ten essays {{that look}} at intra-regional migration in the Southern Balkans {{from the late}} Ottoman period to the present. It examines forced as well as voluntary migrations and places these movements within their historical context, including ethnic cleansing, population exchanges, and <b>demographic</b> <b>engineering</b> {{in the service of}} nation-building as well as more recent labor migration due to globalization. Inside, readers will find the work of international experts that cuts across national and disciplinary lines. This cross-cultural, comparative approach fully captures the complexity of this highly fractured, yet interconnected, region. Coverage explores the role of population exchanges in the process of nation-building and irredentist policies in interwar Bulgaria, the story of Thracian refugees and their organizations in Bulgaria, the changing waves of migration from the Balkans to Turkey, Albanian immigrants in Greece, and the diminished importance of ethnic migration after the 1990 s. In addition, the collection looks at such under-researched aspects of migration as memory, gender, and religion. The field of migration studies in the Southern Balkans is still fragmented along national and disciplinary lines. Moreover, the study of forced and voluntary migrations is often separate with few interconnections. The essays collected in this book bring these different traditions together. This complete portrait will help readers gain deep insight and better understanding into the diverse migration flows and intercultural exchanges that have occurred in the Southern Balkans in the last two centuries...|$|E

Challenges in urban information extraction and management for solar PV deployment assessment are determined and quantitative solutions are offered. This paper provides the following contributions: (i) a methodology that is consistent with recommendations from existing literature advocating the integration of cross-disciplinary competences in remote sensing (RS), GIS, computer vision and urban environmental studies; (ii) a robust methodology that can work with low-resolution, incomprehensive data and reconstruct vegetation and building separately, but concurrently; (iii) recommendations for future generation of software. A case study is presented {{as an example of the}} methodology. Experience from the case study such as the trade-off between time consumption and data quality are discussed to highlight a need for connectivity between <b>demographic</b> information, electrical <b>engineering</b> schemes and GIS and a typical factor of solar useful roofs extracted per method. Finally, conclusions are developed to provide a final methodology to extract the most useful information from the lowest resolution and least comprehensive data to provide solar electric assessments over large areas, which can be adapted anywhere in the world...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical {{proficiency}} is {{an important}} predictor of engineering success. However, the change of the <b>demographics</b> of <b>engineering</b> students has led to larger percentage of students with weak mathematics skills. Furthermore, electromagnetics courses are perceived as abstract and irrelevant. Students struggle with required mathematics and {{have been shown to}} have motivational difficulties when studying the subject. This thesis examines engineering students' conceptual and procedural knowledge, as well as mathematics anxiety that all relate to proficiency in electromagnetics. Students' conceptual knowledge is measured with the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism (CSEM). Procedural knowledge is assessed from students' performance in complex problem exercises and in the final exam. Mathematics anxiety is evaluated with the Electromagnetics Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (EMARS). The data (N= 133) are collected from an undergraduate static field theory course at Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland. The data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, factor analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear regression, and Fisher's exact test. The results show that there is a relationship between procedural and conceptual knowledge in the context of electromagnetics. The findings suggest that in the context of electromagnetics, a basic conceptual knowledge is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for acquiring procedural knowledge. The prior conceptual knowledge predicts success in the final exam, but developing students' procedural skill with complex problem exercises during the course does not significantly enhance students' conceptual knowledge. The study shows that prior to instruction, 18 % of students have a consistent or partially consistent alternative model of Newton's third law principle. This model impacts the performance of students. The results show also that 16 % of engineering students experience high mathematics anxiety. Anxiety is found to be impacting students' procedural performance but not conceptual. The findings suggest that there is clearly a need to broaden the view of what types of knowledge are valued and assessed in engineering courses...|$|R
40|$|In today?s highly {{competitive}} market with economic, environmental, and social challenges, {{it is imperative}} that engineers are educated to adapt to the new challenges. Engineering education could play a critical role to improve engineering students? self-regulated and adaptive skills that are important for their future engineering productivity and innovation. To survive and thrive in the fast-changing workplace, today?s students will need to become adaptive experts. However, current engineering education practices tend to focus too much on the low-level skills required to do specific and routine tasks rather than fostering self-regulated and adaptive skills required for innovation. Experts are defined in two distinctive characteristics: adaptive experts versus routine experts. Adaptive experts acquire the content knowledge parallel to routine experts in the field; in addition, they have the ability to effectively and innovatively utilize and extend that knowledge. In this dissertation, to determine the ?baseline? adaptive expertise among the sample population, an adaptive expertise survey (AES) instrument is administered to both the practicing engineers and the students. The instrument contains questions defining four dimensions of adaptive expertise: multiple perspectives, metacognitive self-assessment, goals and beliefs, and epistemology. Participants? <b>demographics</b> and <b>engineering</b> experience were recorded and cross-tabulated with their adaptive expertise characteristics captured in the study. In addition this study explored engineering students? and practicing engineers? adaptive expertise (AE) characteristics as they used a CAD tool. The practicing engineers were asked to model a component in a CAD program that they were not familiar with. The students were asked to model a stylized familiar component that they brought from home. In both cases, pre and post interviews were conducted to explore how the participants approached their tasks and overcame any challenges. Effects of the contextualized activity on students? AE characteristics were investigated. In general, results indicated that as students gain more experience through years their overall AE characteristics were developed. In addition, the studies signified that multiple perspectives, goals and beliefs, and metacognitive skills are good indicators of developing AE and educators should consider promoting those skills in engineering education...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the ethnolinguistic {{vitality of the}} indigenous Malays of Singapore forty-five years after Singapore’s separation from Malaysia. The study sets out to explore {{the vitality of the}} Malay language in Singapore and the factors that influence it. It also seeks to know whether the Malay language has really come to a deficit in Singapore, in terms of language use. The general literature on this subject shows that sociolinguistic researches in Singapore are more focused on socio-psychological framework, especially when dealing with the Malay language-use situation. Such approach lacks the sociological framework that together would provide a holistic look at the issue of language use. The need for sociological approach becomes more apparent with the Singapore government’s interventionist stance in language planning and <b>demographic</b> <b>engineering,</b> because sociological factors condition the individual’s socio-psychological and interactional climate, apart from playing decisive role in the survival of a language. Hence, this study embarks on a macro-sociolinguistic research to determine the influence or effect of social factors on individual language use and attitude. The data is derived from a total of 2435 youths in the form of questionnaire survey and interviews. This study has benefited from Giles, Bourhis, and Taylor (1977) ’s Ethnolinguistic Vitality (EV) framework that provides the sociological factors needed to evaluate the position of the Malay minority against the dominant Chinese and the hegemony of the English language in Singapore. The factors have provided the elements needed to generate detailed descriptions of the intergroup situation that help to explain what makes the Malays behave as a distinctive and active collective entity in intergroup situations. The overall finding from EV theory subscribes to the notion of the hypothetical question of whether the Malay language has come to a deficit. It shows that Malay vitality is in the low to medium range, which translates into a situation towards language deficit. Malay relies more on ethnolinguistic affiliations rather than government support. The geographic and informal institutional support factors are identified as significant in generating the vitality despite the weak status and low demographic position of the Malays. This proves that EV theory is able to accurately assess the sociological situation and perceptions of a group and its language position in an intergroup situation. However, socio-psychological data from the use of surveys, interviews, and personal observations in this study has provided consistent findings on the overall vitality of Malay in Singapore. The actual language use situation shows high vitality. The individual’s language use vitality is high and is motivated by home, school, friends and religion that create the necessary environments to instil the identity, loyalty, and attachment to the language. Out of this all, home and religion play the most significant roles in nurturing language use while school and friends provide the linguistic (standard use of language) and sociolinguistic (variations in colloquial usage) support respectively. This means that the EV theory has to be complemented with other conceptual tools to generate a more accurate interpretation of language vitality because sociological factors alone may only generate superficial outcomes. This study concludes that Malays are able to differentiate the role of English and Malay and to use the languages based on context and needs. English is preferred for education and jobs while Malay continues to be cherished as a marker of ethnicity. Hence, Malays’ ability to make pragmatic choices when it comes to language use helps to maintain a healthy vitality for Malay in Singapore...|$|E
40|$|Compared to malaria, {{tuberculosis}} and HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis remains a truly neglected tropical disease. Schistosomiasis, {{perhaps more than}} any other disease, is entrenched in prevailing social-ecological systems, since transmission is governed by human behaviour (e. g. open defecation and patterns of unprotected surface water contacts) and ecological features (e. g. living in close proximity to suitable freshwater bodies in which intermediate host snails proliferate). Moreover, schistosomiasis is intimately linked with poverty and the disease has spread to previously non-endemic areas as a result of <b>demographic,</b> ecological and <b>engineering</b> transformations. Importantly though, thanks to increased advocacy there is growing awareness, financial and technical support to control and eventually eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem at local, regional and global scales. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent progress made in innovation, validation and application of new tools and strategies for research and integrated control of schistosomiasis. First, we explain that schistosomiasis is deeply embedded in social-ecological systems and explore linkages with poverty. We then summarize and challenge global statistics, risk maps and burden estimates of human schistosomiasis. Discovery and development research pertaining to novel diagnostics and drugs forms the centrepiece of our review. We discuss unresolved issues and emerging opportunities for integrated and sustainable control of schistosomiasis and conclude with a series of research need...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{energy conversion}} offers a sustainable method of producing electricity {{to maintain and}} improve {{the standard of living}} within cities. Planning for large-scale adoption of PV in cities, however, provides a challenge to urban planners because of the distributed nature of PV. This paper develops a new methodology to determine a city's PV potential by analysis of solar PV generation potential by distribution feeder given the solar exposure and orientation of rooftops serviced by a specific feeder within the city. The methodology is applied to an example feeder, and then can be scaled to apply to the network of any city. The method comprises the following steps: (i) rooftop extraction from aerial photos; (ii) service parcel and territory matching based on geographical information system (GIS) data; (iii) simulation of the solar exposure of the customers connected to distribution feeders based on local meteorological conditions and the general roof orientation of the customers serviced by the feeder; and (iv) sensitivity analyses of electricity yield as a function of PV module efficiency. Experience from the case study such as trade-offs between time consumption and data quality is discussed to highlight a need for connectivity between <b>demographic</b> information, electrical <b>engineering</b> schematics and GIS. Finally conclusions are developed to provide final methodology with the most and useful information from the highest constrained sources and can be adapted anywhere in the world...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to improve the effectiveness of construction craft workers in using the engineering information format when completing complex construction tasks. Background: The construction productivity of craft workers can be negatively impacted by ineffective communication of the project’s design and information. Traditional information delivery relies on two-dimensional drawings for multiple views, which typically require workers to have high spatial cognitive abilities in order to effectively understand how to interpret and combine all views of the two-dimensional (2 D) drawings. Advancements in three-dimensional (3 D) computer-aided design (CAD), augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3 D printing have provided new format options for delivering engineering information {{in a way that}} is easier to understand. Intellectual Merit: The dissertation describes a set of field trials based on experimental designs and the use of eye tracking technology to explore the interrelation between spatial cognition, <b>demographic</b> traits, and <b>engineering</b> information formats in their impact on the performance of construction craft workers. The aim of the dissertation was to generate new knowledge in several respects by (1) introducing primary constructs regarding the information needs of construction craft workers; (2) quantifying the influence of various <b>engineering</b> information deliverables, <b>demographics,</b> and spatial cognition that captures the individual performance of craft workers; (3) reviewing the guidelines for providing tailored information systems to accommodate unique craft worker demographics and requirements of spatial cognition; and (4) revising proposals and additional recommendations to transform information systems implemented for craft workers. Broader Impact: This dissertation opens channels for extensive transformative findings on how to more naturally incorporate information interfaces with people. Recognition of cognitive aspects of spatial information processing based on different information formats and craft worker demographics provides a better understanding of how to improve information systems and the performance of individuals engaged in frontline tasks in other industries. This is done by understanding how information format can be tailored for broader ranges of populations with diverse spatial cognition and demographics...|$|R
40|$|This study brings {{together}} research on learning communities and student self-efficacy, confidence, outcome expectations, and commitment. Participation in learning communities {{has been proven}} to increase retention rates and success. Similarly, high levels of self-efficacy, confidence, and outcome expectations are correlated with increased retention rates and success. 356 {{students enrolled in the}} undeclared engineering orientation course were surveyed at the beginning of fall semester. Of these students, 130 completed a follow-up survey at the end of spring semester. About half of the students completing the initial survey were enrolled in a course-clustered Undeclared Engineering Learning Community, which was comprised of an orientation course, a math course, and a weekly peer-facilitated math session during fall semester. The students also met regularly with a peer mentor during fall semester. The survey measured math and science self-efficacy, general academic confidence, math and science outcome expectations, and commitment to <b>engineering.</b> <b>Demographic</b> and academic performance data were also collected from the Office of the Registrar.;Based on the surveys and demographic data, significant results include the following: (1) There was a difference between the students electing to participate in the learning community and those electing not to participate in the learning community, with those not participating having better academic preparation (as measured by ACT) and higher self-efficacy in their individual skills, (2) Students participating in the learning community were retained in engineering at higher rate, and (3) All students experienced a significant decline in self-efficacy and confidence from fall to spring semester; however, students retained in engineering experienced a significantly lower drop. Participation in this moderately integrated learning community did not {{have a significant effect on}} academic performance, self-efficacy, confidence, or outcome expectations. Recommendations as a result of this research include: (1) The need to re-evaluate the structure of the community in relation to math performance as measured by grade point averages, (2) A need to investigate why students elect to participate and the marketing of the learning community, and (3) Expansion to include qualitative measures, a longitudinal analysis, and additional types/structures of learning communities...|$|R
