50|$|In 1899, Lucas {{became a}} {{drilling}} contractor and leased land south of Beaumont, Texas {{from the oil}} explorer Pattillo Higgins. He believed that the site — Spindletop Hill — was covering a vast pool of crude oil. Drilling began in late 1900 but was extremely difficult. At the depth of 60 m, a layer of sand was found. The new rotating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drill</b> collapsed upon reaching a depth of approximately 275 m. Not {{able to deal with}} the technical difficulties short on money, Lucas asked for help from John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil. Rockefeller passed but not before persuading John H. Galey and James M. Guffey, associates of the Mellon family from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to join the project.|$|E
50|$|In 1895, {{the quarry}} reopened under the {{direction}} of Moses Kellow, a fearless innovator who set about modernising working practices and methods. The two-man teams working in the mill were no longer tied to a two-man team working underground, which enabled the mill to operate more efficiently. Following trials with air drills, he decided instead to electrify the mill, building a large hydro-electric station, which generated three-phase alternating current, rather than the direct current recommended by British manufacturers. He obtained motors from Prague, which were used to drive winches and an electric locomotive, the first to work in Wales. The water wheels were supplemented by Pelton wheels, supplied by Gilbert Gilkes of Kendal. His greatest innovation was the Kellow drill, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drill</b> for which he obtained six patents between 1898 and 1915. It could drill a 7.5 ft hole in the slate in under two minutes, much less than the day required using hand drills. The mine was ventilated by a Guibal fan, housed in a fan-house near the entrance to the adit. Peak output under Kellow's direction was between 5,000 and 6,000 tons per year, though it declined in the later years, until the quarry closed in 1930.|$|E

50|$|His next {{innovation}} was a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drill,</b> {{powered by}} high-pressure water. A number of quarries were experimenting with compressed air percussive drills, but Kellow disliked them, {{because they were}} noisy, created clouds of dust, and were uncomfortable {{to the men who}} had to use them for long periods. His design of twist drill was attached to the rock by making two 2.5 in holes, which acted as anchorages, and pressure of 2 to 3 tons was applied, which enabled a 7.5 ft hole to be drilled in under two minutes. Previously, hand drilling of such a hole took around ten hours, and the new process created no dust. Kellow implemented another change in working practice, so that rockmen in a chamber would create the two small anchorage holes where they needed a hole to be drilled, and then call for the drilling team, probably one man and an assistant, who would set up the drill, drill the hole, and {{move on to the next}} chamber. The drilling team had an interest in maintaining the drill, and the rockmen could get on with blasting the rock and extracting blocks. Kellow refined the design of the drill over the years, and they were used extensively at Croesor and Parc, and found some use at Llechwedd quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog, but Weaver has suggested that it failed to find wider markets because Kellow did not emphasise the changes in working practice which made it a success in his own quarries.|$|E

(~ 10 cm) core barrel. The transplants were fixed to Reef Ball™ substrates using an adhesive marine epoxy. Drill holes in the donor corals (core holes) were filled with concrete plugs. Control corals, of comparable size to both donor colonies and transplant corals, were monitored for comparison. Transplant corals, donor corals, and controls on the natural reef were monitored for growth and survivorship. Core holes were monitored for tissue regrowth over the surface of concrete plugs. Growth during the transplantation project was defined as an increase in surface area of tissue and skeleton. Growth was monitored on a quarterly basis using photographic techniques. Meandrina meandrites transplants experienced greater mortality and significantly less growth than M. cavernosa transplants. No significant difference in the change in percent tissue coverage between both species of donor corals or between their respective controls was determined. The process of filling core holes in donor colonies with concrete plugs was effective, however, tissue did not completely regenerate over the surface of plugs in either species over the relatively short 15 -month observation period.

40|$|Most {{blasthole}} drills {{currently used}} in the mining industry are manually controlled. The drilling control systems which do exist are based mainly on ladder programming logic techniques. This thesis presents a comprehensive strategy for the automatic control of blasthole drills, based on closed loop feedback control approach. A detailed model for the controlled process consisting of the drill rig's mechanical actuators, machine structure, and the drilling process at the bit-rock interface is presented. The model equations are refined and validated by experimental (field) testing. The instrumentation of an Ingersoll-Rand DM- 45 E drill rig and the subsequent drilling tests in a limestone quarry are described, with an in-depth discussion of the field tests results. Analysis of the field tests data establishes the dependencies between the drilling variables and ground conditions during actual drilling. The transfer functions of the mechanical actuators of the machine are also identified. A strategy for automatic control of feed pressure and rotary speed is proposed. The controller is tested and tuned by interfacing it to a software simulator of the controlled process which implements the relationships identified from field testing. Simulation results are presented and analysed. Results of implementing the controller on a Gardner-Denver GD- 120 electric drill, and an Ingersoll-Rand DM-H <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drill</b> at two surface coal mines in British Columbia, Canada, are also presented.

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survivorship}} of {{two species of}} scleractinian coral transplants, Meandrina meandrites and Montastrea cavernosa, were investigated. Identically sized replicate transplants {{were obtained from the}} second reef, off Dania Beach, using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drill</b> fitted with a 4 ” core barrel. The transplants were fixed to Reef Ball™ substrates using an adhesive marine epoxy. Drill holes in the donor corals (core holes) were filled with concrete plugs to prevent the detrimental effects of bioeroders. Control corals, of comparable size to both the donor colonies and the transplant corals, were selected for comparison. The transplant corals, donor corals, and controls on the natural reef were monitored for growth and survivorship. The core holes were monitored for tissue regrowth over the surface of the concrete plug, in order to assess the effectiveness of the plugging process. Growth during the transplantation project was defined as an increase in surface area or radius, and was monitored on a quarterly basis using photographic techniques. SigmaScan© Pro 4 image analysis software (Jandel Scientific Corporation) was used for the analysis of the photographic data. The following main hypothesis was tested: species-specific differences will occur in the responses of coral colonies to drilling and transplantation. Additional sub-hypotheses were tested, including: 1) a change in surface area and/ or radius in the experimental corals and the control corals will take place, 2) the survivorship of the experimental corals and their control corals will be similar, 3) a change in surface area and/ or radius of the tissue surrounding the core holes will take place. Meandrina meandrites transplants exhibited a substantial amount of mortality and displayed significantly less growth (both in surface area and radius change) than M. cavernosa transplants, and the M. meandrites controls. Montastrea cavernosa transplants experienced significantly more growth than their same species controls. All donor corals that experienced drill damage (separate from the drill holes) were able to regenerate the injured tissue in a period of less than three months. No significant difference was found for the change in percent tissue coverage for either donor species when compared {{with each other and with}} their same species controls. Tissue did not completely regenerate over the surface of the concrete core hole plugs in either species. However, there was no significant difference between the initial area/ radius of the core holes and the final area/ radius for either M. meandrites or M. cavernosa. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the total area change of the core holes when the two species were compared. The results of this study indicated that M. meandrites did not demonstrate statistically significant survivorship or growth as a transplant coral. The M. cavernosa transplants were successful, and displayed a significant increase in surface area. The areas surrounding the core holes did not significantly increase in surface area in either species of donor corals...|$|E

An anti-jamming valve is a core component of an anti-jamming system. A back-propagation (BP) neural network model was established for an anti-jamming valve by analyzing the structure and working principle of an anti-jamming valve on a drilling rig and by utilizing the theory of neural network. The established model was employed and applied with the raw information to a stone pit to perform structural topology optimization and obtain the optimal model. The theoretical feed pressure was determined through calculation and analysis after the rock drill became completely jammed. A comparison between the relative error of computed results and the experimental values shows that the forecast data obtained with the BP model (8 %) are closer to the experimental values than those obtained with the theoretical formula (14 %). The highly nonlinear characteristic of a BP neural network provides a fresh insight into the intellectualization of a drilling rig anti-jamming system...|$|R
