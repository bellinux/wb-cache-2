These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly. The physician subspecialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was established in 2006, to provide expertise {{in the care of}} patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary patient and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.|$|E

MethodsA total of 133 consecutive patients (M/F: 86 / 47; age: 71  ±  17  years) admitted to the respiratory care center (RCC) of the hospital were enrolled. The effects of GCS score on the outcomes and weaning rate of the patients were evaluated.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although accumulating {{evidence}} suggests {{the presence of}} microbleeds as {{a risk factor for}} intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), little is known about its significance <b>in</b> anticoagu-lated <b>patients.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the presence of microbleeds is associated with recurrent hemorrhagic stroke <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> who had received warfarin following atrial fibrillation–associated cardioembolic infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 87 consecutive patients with acute recurrent stroke, including 15 patients with ICH and 72 patients with cerebral infarction, were enrolled in this study. International normalized ratios (INRs), vascular risk factors, and imaging characteristics, including microbleeds on T 2 *-weighted MR images and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on T 2 -weighted MR images, were compared in the 2 groups. RESULTS: Microbleeds were noted more frequently <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with ICH than <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with cerebral infarction (86. 7 % versus 38. 9 %, P. 0007).
