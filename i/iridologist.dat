50|$|In 1979, Bernard Jensen, {{a leading}} American <b>iridologist,</b> {{and two other}} {{iridology}} proponents failed to establish {{the basis of their}} practice when they examined photographs of the eyes of 143 patients in an attempt to determine which ones had kidney impairments. Of the patients, forty-eight had been diagnosed with kidney disease, and the rest had normal kidney function. Based on their analysis of the patients' irises, the three iridologists could not detect which patients had kidney disease and which did not. One <b>iridologist,</b> for example, decided that 88% of the normal patients had kidney disease, while another judged through his iris analysis that 74% of patients who needed artificial kidney treatment were normal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Iridologists</b> {{claim they}} can use the charts to {{distinguish}} between healthy systems and organs {{in the body and}} those that are overactive, inflamed, or distressed. <b>Iridologists</b> claim this information demonstrates a patient's susceptibility towards certain illnesses, reflects past medical problems, or predicts later health problems.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{study was}} {{published}} in the British Medical Journal which selected 39 patients who were due to have their gall bladder removed the following day, because of suspected gallstones. The study also selected {{a group of people who}} did not have diseased gall bladders to act as a control. A group of 5 <b>iridologists</b> examined a series of slides of both groups' irises. The <b>iridologists</b> could not correctly identify which patients had gall bladder problems and which had healthy gall bladders. For example, one of the <b>iridologists</b> diagnosed 49% of the patients with gall stones as having them and 51% as not having them. The author concluded:, [...] "...this study showed that iridology is not a useful diagnostic aid." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to <b>iridologists,</b> {{details in}} the iris reflect changes in the tissues of the {{corresponding}} body organs. One prominent practitioner, Bernard Jensen, described it thus: [...] "Nerve fibers in the iris respond to changes in body tissues by manifesting a reflex physiology that corresponds to specific tissue changes and locations." [...] This would mean that a bodily condition translates to a noticeable change in {{the appearance of the}} iris, but this has been disproven through many studies. (See section on Scientific research.) For example, acute inflammatory, chronic inflammatory and catarrhal signs may indicate involvement, maintenance, or healing of corresponding distant tissues, respectively. Other features that <b>iridologists</b> look for are contraction rings and Klumpenzellen, which may indicate various other health conditions, as interpreted in context.|$|R

40|$|Isolated {{reports of}} hearing loss {{presenting}} as markings on the iris exist, but {{to date the}} effectiveness of iridology to identify hearing loss has not been investigated. This study therefore aimed to determine the efficacy of iridological analysis {{in the identification of}} moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss in adolescents. A controlled trial was conducted with an <b>iridologist,</b> blind to the actual hearing status of participants, analyzing the irises of participants with and without hearing loss. Fifty hearing impaired and fifty normal hearing subjects, between the ages of 15 and 19 years, controlled for gender, participated in the study. An experienced <b>iridologist</b> analyzed the randomised set of participants ’ irises. A 70 % correct identification of hearing status was obtained by iridological analyses with a false negative rate of 41 % compared to a 19 % false positive rate. The respective sensitivity and specificity rates therefore came to 59 % and 81 %. Iridological analysis of hearing status indicated a statistically significant relationship to actual hearing status (P < 0. 05). Although statistically significant sensitivity and specificity rates for identifying hearing loss by iridology were not comparable to those of traditional audiological screening procedures...|$|E
40|$|Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) {{techniques}} are quite popular and effective for chronic diseases. Iridology {{is more than}} 150 years old CAM technique which analyzes the patterns, tissue weakness, color, shape, structure, etc. for disease diagnosis. The objective {{of this paper is}} to validate the use of iridology for the diagnosis of the diabetes. The suggested model was applied in a systemic disease with ocular effects. 200 subject data of 100 each diabetic and non-diabetic were evaluated. Complete procedure was kept very simple and free from the involvement of any <b>iridologist.</b> From the normalized iris, the region of interest was cropped. All 63 features were extracted using statistical, texture analysis, and two-dimensional discrete wavelet transformation. A comparison of accuracies of six different classifiers has been presented. The result shows 89. 66 % accuracy by the random forest classifier...|$|E
5000|$|Iridology (also {{known as}} iridodiagnosis or iridiagnosis) is an {{alternative}} medicine technique whose proponents claim that patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient's systemic health. Practitioners match their observations to iris charts, which divide the iris into zones that correspond to specific parts of the human body. <b>Iridologists</b> see the eyes as [...] "windows" [...] into the body's state of health.|$|R
40|$|In {{alternative}} {{health care}} iridology {{is used as}} a diagnostic aid. The diagnosis of gall bladder disease was used to study its validity and interperformer consistency. The presence of an inflamed gall bladder containing gall stones is said to be easily recognised by certain signs in the lower lateral part of the iris of the right eye. Stereo colour slides were made of the right eye. Stereo colour slides were made of the right eye of 39 patients with this disease and 39 control subjects of the same sex and age. The slides were presented in a random order to five leading <b>iridologists</b> without supplementary information. The prevalence of the disease was estimated at 56 %. The median validity was 51 % with 54 % sensitivity and 52 % specificity. These results were close to chance validity (iota = 0. 03). None of the <b>iridologists</b> reached a high validity. The median interperformer consistency was 60 %. This was only slightly higher than chance consistency (kappa = 0. 18). This study showed that iridology is not a useful diagnostic aid...|$|R
50|$|<b>Iridologists</b> {{generally}} use {{equipment such as}} {{a flashlight}} and magnifying glass, cameras or slit-lamp microscopes to examine a patient's irises for tissue changes, as well as features such as specific pigment patterns and irregular stromal architecture. The markings and patterns are compared to an iris chart that correlates zones of the iris with parts of the body. Typical charts divide the iris into approximately 80-90 zones. For example, the zone corresponding to the kidney is in {{the lower part of}} the iris, just before 6 o'clock. There are minor variations between charts' associations between body parts and areas of the iris.|$|R
40|$|Arcus senilis is a grayish or whitish bow shaped or {{ring-shaped}} deposit in the cornea. It {{is associated}} with coronary heart disease (CHD). It is also recognized {{as a sign of}} hyperlipidemia. Iridology is an alternative medicine to detect diseases using iris‟s pattern observation. <b>Iridologists</b> believe that the grayish or whitish deposit on the iris is sign of presence of cholesterol or Arcus senilis disease. The simple and non-invasive automation system is developed to detect cholesterol presence using iris recognition algorithm in image processing. This study applies iris recognition method to segment out the iris area, normalization process and lastly determines the cholesterol presence using OTSU‟s thresholding method and histogram to determine the optimum threshold value. The result showed that the presence of cholesterol was high when the eigenvalue exceeds an optimum threshold value...|$|R
40|$|In recent times, it is {{apparent}} that increasing numbers of people are being lured to the so-called &quot;alternative&quot; practitioners of health care, such as chiropractors, herbalists, naturopaths, <b>iridologists,</b> faith healers, and so on. Now, I cannot believe that all these people have made conscious decisions to reject scientific principles when dealing with their most important asset, their body, so why do otherwise rational people ignore the total lack of objective proof associated with these fields? After speaking to many people, {{it seems to me that}} in many cases, at least, the explanation is that they simply do not know that the person they are seeing is not recognised as a legitimate, scientifically trained therapist. They regard the various practitioners listed above as equally qualified and trained as doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, and others with recognised credentials. Certainly, the pseudo-science clique do all they can to promote this image, usually setting themselves up in an extremely clinical environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to investigate the claims made by certain alternative medicine practitioners, namely <b>iridologists,</b> {{that the majority of}} systemic diseases are accompanied by changes in the colour and/or structure of discrete regions of the anterior surface of the iris. Colour photographic slides of the left and right irides of between 22 and 30 patients' clinically diagnosed as suffering from one of 5 named disease states; asthma (30 patients), coronary heart disease (25), diabetes mellitus (22), psoriasis (30) and ulcerative colitis (30), were analysed and subsequently compared with slides obtained from an equal number of control subjects. Computer software, designed to map the position of defined iridic features types, relative to a standard reference point, was executed for each of the iris images digitised onto an image processing system. The resulting data, expressed as 360 x 100 -bit binary words, for the left and right irides of patients representing each of the five experimental groups was compared with that for the corresponding control group by means of four differing methodologies. Comparison of the data based on the discrete regions of the iris which, for each of the five diseases under study, should, according to practitioners of iridology undergo changes {{as a result of the}} onset of the disease, failed to demonstrate significant differences between each of the experimental and associated control groups. Further, comparison of the data based on regions of the iris, for which either the size or position varied from that specified by iridology practitioners, also failed to demonstrate any significant differences between experimental and control groups. A detailed visual comparison of iris images obtained from patients with those from control subjects, on the basis of lesions within the regions of the iris designated by iridology practitioners as being of primary importance, did not illustrate any significant differences. This study demonstrated that iridology is not a useful tool for the diagnosis of asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, psoriasis or ulcerative colitis...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Iridology {{is defined}} as a science that {{identifies}} pathological and functional changes within organs via assessing the iris for aberrant lines, spots, and discolourations (Medow, 2000). According to iridology, the iris does not reflect changes during anaesthesia, due to its inhibitory effect on nerves impulses, and in cases of organ removal, it reflects the pre-surgical condition (Jensen, 1986). The Homoeopathic profession is frequently associated with iridology and in a recent survey by Rostovsky et al. (2009) investigating the perceptions of Masters of Technology graduates in Homoeopathy on the existing programme offered by the University of Johannesburg, iridology was highly regarded as a potential additional skill requirement for assessing the health status of the patient. This was a randomized and controlled quantitative study. The study aimed to assess the reliability of iridology in the diagnosis of previous acute appendicitis, as evidenced by appendectomy. A total of 60 participants took part in the study. Of the 60 participants, 30 had had an appendectomy due to acute appendicitis, and 30 with their appendix intact with no prior history of appendicitis. All participants were recruited on the premises of Rita Frank Optometrists. Each participant signed a Participant Information and Consent Form (Appendix E) and a Consent Form to Photograph the iris (Appendix F). Thereafter the researcher obtained the information required in a private setting (Appendix G). Afterwards each participant’s right iris was documented by photograph {{with the use of a}} specialist non-mydriatic retinal camera (Canon EOS- 20 D), reset for the iris, by the researcher. The photographs were then randomized by an external person and no identifying data made available to the three raters. The raters included the researcher and two practising <b>iridologists.</b> Data was obtained from the analyses of the photographs wherein the presence or absence of lesions (implying acute appendicitis) was indicated by the raters. All the data was captured into an Excel spreadsheet (Appendix H) and sent for statistical analysis. vi None of the three raters showed a significant success rate in determining correctly who had had acute appendicitis and resultant appendectomies and who had not. The outcome of this study indicated an outcome that was subject to chance. The null hypothesis that states that appendectomy due to acute appendicitis does not manifest in a corresponding lesion in the typical organ area of the eye, is supported. It is in the opinion of the researcher that the association of iridology with homoeopathic practice may harm the credibility of the profession and that further research on iridology is needed to disprove this conviction...|$|R
