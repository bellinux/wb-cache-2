40|$|MasterThe overall {{performance}} of galvanized steel {{has been greatly}} improved by different surface treatments, various bath chemical compositions and application of organic coatings. In spite of improved surface corrosion resistance, the sheared edges of the steel sheet still suffer from corrosion attack. Since the involved mechanism in the cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{is different from that}} of general surface, the approach of minimizing this problem has to be adjusted in order to satisfy both surface and edge resistance. When the cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance is evaluated, it can be interpreted by three main characteristics such as the time of corrosion commencement, degree of galvanic protection, and initiation site which gives an insight of further corrosion propagation. Therefore, the effect of the coating manufacturing method, aluminum addition, and phosphate pretreatment was investigated by employing potentiostatic polarization test to reveal coating dissolution behavior along with the initiation site of cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The results of coating resistance were obtained from exposure to simulated marine environment in cyclic corrosion chamber. The following analysis of the coating deterioration caused by cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> was performed with the aid of scanning electron microscope and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Consequently, it has been revealed that galvannealing process resulted in substantially reduced cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance due to the high iron content at the outer surface and presence of innate cracks in the coating. On the other hand, 55 % of aluminum addition showed good corrosion resistance owing to slow degradation rate of the coating. Further, phosphate was found to inhibit zinc dissolution from the surface of electrogalvanized steel, which led to the accelerated zinc dissolution from the edges. In addition, the geometry of the sheared edge of organic coated specimen was shown to affect cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance through initial adhesion loss caused by cutting process...|$|E

This inspection revealed at least three rather substantial holes as opposed to crack- or pit-like leak sites near the nominal solution level position on one particular steam coil. This section {{was removed from the}} evaporator vessel, and subsequent hot cell examination revealed extensive general corrosion on the process side of the coil with little or no attack on the steam side.

40|$|AbstractThe {{degradation}} of solar glass mirrors is analyzed {{as a function}} of various constraints such as temperature, humidity, rain and solar irradiation. In order to understand the degradation mechanisms, two kinds of tests have been performed: simple tests to identify the effect of each constraint and complex tests to highlight the effects of synergy and to reproduce the natural ageing. The study of the paints coat degradation evidences that UV exposure {{is one of the most}} aggressive constraints for paint binder. But results show also a strong effect of liquid water on paint degradation and particularly on pigments loss and blistering phenomenon. Whereas temperature in dry environment is not a very degrading factor for coats, presence of liquid water is a strong accelerating constraint at high temperature. Agreement between outdoor ageing and indoor ageing with a new procedure involving UV, temperature and rain also shows that liquid water is the critical constraint responsible to <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> of silver layer and paint delamination. This work shows also that relation between paint degradation and corrosion of silver layer is not obvious.

40|$|In general, the 6 xxx series alloys (AlMgSi) are {{considered}} to be resistant to intergranular corrosion (IGC) in marine environments. However, the addition of copper to increase peak hardness has proven to increase the IGC susceptibility. The detrimental effect on IGC resistance is believed to be caused by the formation of a nanoscale continuous Cu rich film confined along the grain boundaries of the material. Evaluation of IGC susceptibility in heat treatable aluminium alloys is generally carried out by metallographic examination of specimens after exposure in an acidified chloride test solution. Experience has revealed that accelerated corrosion testing is highly dependent on several factors. Especially extruded specimens with a region comprised of highly directional grains in the centre and a recrystallised surface have shown to experience severe corrosion inwards the fibrous area. This observation is believed to influence the extent of corrosion on the recrystallised specimen surface. Extruded copper containing AA 6082 alloys modified with various Zn levels were corrosion tested according to BS-ISO 11846 (method B) in the T 5 and T 6 temper. Several IGC test parallels were conducted to examine how the edge microstructure affects the IGC resistance of these alloys. The influence of Zn on IGC susceptibility was investigated as well. Optical microscopy (LM) was used to characterise the microstructure of the T 5 and T 6 profiles, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were conducted to identify and characterise the grain boundary chemistry in the fibrous microstructure. Assessment of corrosion susceptibility was done by metallographic examination in LM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after accelerated corrosion testing. Results reveal that the edge microstructure had a significant effect on the corrosion behaviour of the recrystallised surface. Corrosion susceptible T 5 tempered alloys with a fibrous microstructure and recrystallised surface experienced extensive <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion,</b> whereas the surface was nearly resistant to IGC. This was especially evident for the Cu containing alloys without Zn and with 0. 21 wt% Zn. By covering the edges, extensive IGC was observed at the surface on the alloys that previously appeared to be resistant to IGC. The completely recrystallised T 6 profiles experienced limited <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion,</b> while severe IGC occurred on the surface in susceptible alloys. The corrosion behaviour did not change when the edges were covered. The difference in IGC extent dependent on edge micsrostructure in the susceptible T 5 alloys points towards that the BS-ISO 11846 standard is inadequate to account for edge effects. Furthermore, results indicated that IGC susceptibility increased with increasing Zn content and EDS analysis of the T 5 profile with 0. 60 wt% Zn revealed a Cu rich film along the grain boundaries, whereas the Zn primarily remained in solid solution. Zn in solid solution might have activated the particle free zone (PFZ) further thus accelerating the IGC mechanism...|$|E

The biological treatment of zeolite enables its {{use as an}} substitute for tripolyphosphates in wash powders which have to comply with strict requirements as far as whiteness is concerned and rounded off grain content. Insoluble Fe 3 + and Mn 4 + in the zeolite could be reduced to soluble Fe 2 + and Mn 2 + by silicate bacteria of Bacillus spp. These metals were efficiently removed from zeolite as documented by Fe 2 O 3 decrease (from 1. 37 % to 1. 08 %) and MnO decrease (from 0. 022 % to 0. 005 %) after bioleaching. The whiteness of zeolite was increased by 8 %. The leaching effect, observed by scanning electron microscopy, caused also a chamfer of the edges of sharp angular grains. Despite the enrichment by fine-grained fraction, the decrease of the surface area of clinoptilolite grains from the value 24. 94 m 2 /g to value 22. 53 m 2 /g was observed. This fact confirms the activity of bacteria of Bacillus genus in the <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> of mineral grains.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the wind laden with sand in modelling pebbles is believed by some authors to be only that of polishing the surface, by others of rounding off bits of stone that already possessed edges and corners, or again by others of wearing any fragment either rounded or angular into definite forms with ridges and facets, dependent on {{the shape of the}} basis (Alb.

40|$|Pipeline with {{multiple}} corrosion defects are often {{observed in the}} field. The strength of pipe {{with multiple}} corrosion patches depends on the corrosion patch intensity, their locations along longitudinal and circumferential directions of the pipe, {{in addition to the}} parameters influencing the strength of pipe with single corrosion defect. The existing design codes recommend the spacing between the corrosion patches when the interacting corrosion patches can be considered as a single patch for calculating the burst pressure of the defected pipe. In this paper, the strength and deformation characteristics of corroded pipe are investigated using finite element analysis. The parameters considered in the analysis are pipe geometries, number of corrosion patches, spacing between multiple <b>corrosions,</b> <b>edge</b> conditions (e. g. sharp and elliptical edges) and the locations of the corrosion patches. The spacing of the corrosion patches are varied along the pipe length and pipe circumference with both symmetrical and unsymmetrical orientations. The study reveals that the effect of the interaction of adjacent corrosion patches exists if the patches are located within a distance of 8 t and 1. 5 √(Dt), where D is the pipe diameter and t is the pipe wall thickness. This distance is similar to the distance recommended in DNV-RP-F 101 code. The distances recommended in ASME B 31 G and CSA Z 662 - 15 codes appear to be un-conservative. The finite element results are compared with different burst pressure prediction models for corroded pipelines...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} the initiation and short term atmospheric corrosion behaviour of 55 % Al-Zn metal coating. It explores the influence of ions produced by localised oxidation and reduction reactions to affect nearby sites during bare and cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Band microelectrode(BME) arrays were used to achieve this aim. Al- 40 % Zn alloy exhibiting solid solution precipitate microstructures were prepared as model alloys for the α-phase of a 55 % Al-Zn metal coating on steel. The effect of electrolyte composition and pH on the polarisation electrochemistry was investigated. Enhanced anodic processes were observed in Cl- compared to SO 4 2 - electrolytes. The electrolyte pH influenced both anodic and cathodic processes by affecting the solubility of the native oxide film. The presence of zinc rich islands influenced the electrochemical polarisation behaviour by enhancing zinc dissolution. The interaction between the α- and β-phases of 55 % Al-Zn metal coating was quantified by arranging model alloys into BME arrays. Only a small galvanic driving force was observed between the phases. During coupling, OH- and metal ions from cathodic and anodic sites respectively were transported tens to hundreds of microns. Micro-pH sensing near {{the surface of the}} alloys allowed the pH at anodic and cathodic sites to be recorded and the transport of OH- ions to be visualised. When the elements of BME arrays were closely spaced, the changes in the near surface electrolyte volume had the effect of reversing the polarity of the galvanic current. Mechanisms for the polarity reversal are discussed as well as the implications for the surface corrosion of unpainted 55 % Al-Zn alloy. The galvanic interaction of 55 % Al-Zn and its constituent phases with steel was also quantified using BME arrays. Near surface pH mapping revealed ubiquitous distribution of OH- from the cathodic processes and localised acidic sites from the anodic processes. Simultaneous polarisation experiments on BME arrays enabled the influence of ion transport during polarisation to be measured. Al 3 + and Zn 2 + ions were found to have a strong pH buffering effect, which accelerated the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction on steel. The steel generated an alkaline environment that solubilised the native oxide film on the sacrificial metal coatings. This shifted their corrosion potentials more negative. The relevance of these observations to the cut <b>edge</b> <b>corrosion</b> behaviour of 55 % Al-Zn alloy is explored. Interfacial composition and impedance properties of Al-Zn alloys exposed to sulfate and chloride bearing electrolytes was investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show that the surface of the native oxide on a series of Al-Zn alloys (2 – 40 wt% zinc) was composed predominantly of aluminium oxides. Zinc and aluminium metal content increased with depth through the oxide, however results show negligible zinc oxide was present in the oxide film, regardless of composition. Impedance results provide information regarding the effect of Cl- and SO 4 2 - on the dissolution mechanism of the alloys. It was concluded that the electrochemical behaviour of the Al-Zn alloys was affected by Cl- and SO 4 2 - anions by changing ion transport mechanisms through the passive film, whereas electrolyte pH affected the electrochemical behaviour via solubility of the native oxides. A model of the Al-Zn oxide – electrolyte interface is presented which accounts for the data in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{literature}} shows that most taphonomic studies of Holocene and fossil macrovertebrates are not methodologically standardized. Hence, results from distinct studies are not comparable, even among researches sharing virtually identical goals, targeting the same biological group of similar age and depositional environment. The {{effects of the}} shell size in the taphonomic analysis are still poorly understood. In order to study this issue, the taphonomic signatures (articulation, valve type, fragmentation, abrasion, <b>corrosion,</b> <b>edge</b> modification, color alteration, bioerosion and encrustation) of brachiopod shells (Bouchardia rosea (Mawe)), from Ubatuba Bay in the northern coast of São Paulo State, were investigated according to the sieve sizes. In the study area, 14 collecting stations were sampled via Van Veen grab sampler, along a bathymetric gradient, ranging from 0 to 35 m of depth. Bulk samples were sieved through 8 mm, 6 mm, and 2 mm mesh sizes, yielding a total of 5. 204 shells. The results indicate that, when taphonomic signatures were independently analyzed per size classes (8 mm, 6 mm, and 2 mm), the taphonomic signatures are recorded in a complex and random way. Additionally, cluster analysis showed that the similarity among the clusters {{vary according to the}} considered sieve size. Thus, the sieve size {{plays an important role in}} the distribution of taphonomic signatures in shells of distinct sizes. These results suggest that the concentration of the taphonomic analysis on one class (e. g., the largest sieve size, 8 mm) is not always the best method. Rather, the total data (all sieves included) seems more accurate in recording the whole spectrum of taphonomic processes recorded in shells of a given assemblage...|$|R
40|$|Metallised {{polypropylene}} (MPP) capacitors, {{the dominant}} capacitor type {{used in a}} wide range of power and electronic circuit applications, offer high volumetric capacitor density, low cost, excellent frequency characteristics and a unique ability to recover from point failures in the dielectric film. However MPP capacitors have a generic weakness that is not well understood, failure of the self-healing process leading to ongoing catastrophic failure. The work described in this thesis includes the derivation of an improved electrical model of a capacitor and the uncovering of a mechanism for the catastrophic failure mode. Corrosion of the thin metallic field is firmly linked to drastic increases in metal film current densities and generation of hot spots in capacitors. In the work, novel formulae were derived relating capacitor parameters such as equivalent series resistance and equivalent series capacitance to frequency and physical characteristics such as metal film resistivity and physical dimensions of multiple layer capacitors. Modelling using numerical methods and diffusion equation showed that capacitors with double-end connection topology have more uniform voltage and power distribution than single-end connected capacitors. External characteristics of both connection topologies were shown to be virtually identical up to frequencies well above typical self-resonance. The aggregate spatial distribution of power from both layers and the voltage across the dielectric were found to be fundamentally different in the two circuit connection topologies. In this work it was shown that above singularity frequencies defined by distributed capacitance and metal film spreading resistance, equivalent series resistance and capacitance both fall with the square root of frequency Analysis of the inductance of typical MPP capacitors for single-end and double-end connected topologies and for circumferentially connected capacitor metallization showed that the magnitude and effect of distributed inductance in typical MPP power capacitors was insignificant compared to packaging inductance. Thermal and electrical modelling and experimental measurements showed that corrosion effects could readily account for the generic catastrophic failure mode of metallised polypropylene capacitors. Modelling showed that remnant vestiges of metal bridging corrosion gaps between the schooping and the metallic film could also pose serious thermal danger to the affected capacitor. Fusing current modelling and experimental measurement showed that fusing in metallic films typically occurred for current densities of several hundred thousand amperes per square centimetre. The partial disconnection of the metallic layers from the schooping <b>edge</b> by <b>corrosion</b> for example, was shown to result in large increases in dissipation factor and power loss in a capacitor readily explaining how capacitors "go high". Simple additions to the standard capacitor equivalent circuit model were developed to encompassing dielectric loss, shunt conductance effects and the impact of source resistance on capacitor parameters.

Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization and exposure tests {{have been carried}} out {{with a wide range of}} stainless steels used in the potash industry. Hastelloy C 276 (a nickel alloy) showed excellent resistance to localized corrosion in high chloride concentration solutions over wide range of temperatures. A wide range of lower cost alloys with less resistance to localized corrosion have been investigated to determine their corrosion behavior at 22 and 90 °C in saturated potash brine. The alloys studied included: austenitic, duplex and cast stainless steel alloys. The results of the electrochemical polarization and exposure tests are compared to the predictions of Localized Corrosion Resistance Index [LCRIwt % = %Cr + 3. 3 (%Mo) + 16 (%N) ]. The electrochemical polarization results show that LCRI can roughly predict the resistance of stainless steel alloys (in the same group i. e. austenitic, duplex) to initiation of localized corrosion. The average pit depth and the five deepest pits have been measured and compared to LCRI for the tested alloys. The deepest pits (the cause of metal failure) found in the exposure tests show that the LCRI cannot predict the propagation of the pits. Austenitic stainless steels are very sensitive to initiation of pits at the edges. The pits on the edges are deep and wide. Residual stresses adjacent to the <b>edges</b> produce stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking at the bottom of each pit which accelerates corrosion. Comparing austenitic and duplex stainless steels to identical LCRIs shows a better resistance of duplex stainless steels to localized corrosion. Duplex stainless steels consist of ferrite-austenite phases with more chromium and molybdenum in the ferrite than in the austenite phase. It was found that the austenite-ferrite interface is prone to the initiation of localized attack, but the attack propagates preferentially in the ferrite phase. The immunity of the austenite phase is related to the higher nitrogen concentration in that phase...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{bodies are}} {{generally}} constructed from galvanized steel, which, together with phosphate and e-coat paint treatments, ensures corrosion resistance. The {{use of these}} materials alone cannot provide adequate corrosion protection to certain features that are inherent to vehicle body construction but are also vulnerable to corrosion, such as cut edges of panels and creviced joints. The use of further corrosion protection measures, (e. g. sealers, lacquers and waxes), is undesirable because they require additional manufacturing processes, increase weight and reduce recyclability of the vehicle. The potential benefits of using zinc-magnesium alloy coated steel (ZMG) {{as a substitute for}} conventional galvanized steel were investigated in this work. Cyclic corrosion testing in sodium chloride and acid rain- based environments was conducted on panels of ZMG and conventional galvanized steel and the resistance of each material to red rust initiation and propagation was assessed. ZMG offered approximately a 3 -fold improvement in red rust resistance compared to galvanized steel in the sodium chloride test but ZMG's corrosion benefit was attenuated in the acid rain environment. Cyclic corrosion testing was also conducted on painted test panels incorporating geometric features; enhanced <b>edge</b> and crevice <b>corrosion</b> resistance was also observed for panels constructed from ZMG. Corrosion products formed in each environment were characterized using a suite of analysis techniques and mechanisms to explain the enhanced corrosion resistance of ZMG were proposed based on these products and on the literature. An inhibiting corrosion protection mechanism was suggested for ZMG whereby cathodic activity was quenched via the precipitation of insulating, sparingly soluble magnesium hydroxide. Further inhibition of cathodic activity has been attributed to the special oxide layer present at the ZMG surface.
