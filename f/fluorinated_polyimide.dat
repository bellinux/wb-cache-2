A blanket FPI- 136 M film is deposited over interdigitated inlaid Al(0. 5 %Cu) structures and the crosstalk capacitance is measured.

40|$|The {{effect of}} atomic oxygen flux and VUV {{radiation}} alone and in combination {{on the surface}} of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>polyimide</b> films was studied using XPS spectroscopy. Exposure of fluorinated polyimides to VUV radiation alone caused no observable damage to the polymer surface, while an atomic oxygen flux resulted in substantial oxidation of the surface. On the other hand, exposure to VUV radiation and atomic oxygen in combination caused extensive oxidation of the polymer surface after only 2 minutes of exposure. The amount of oxidized carbon on the polymer surface indicated that there is aromatic ring opening oxidation. The changes in the O 1 s/C 1 s, N 1 s/C 1 s, and F 1 s/C 1 s ratios suggested that an ablative degradation process is highly favorable.

The polyimide resin exhibited the best post-curing conditions for further crosslinking for 8 hours at 410 degress C based on Tg, thermal stability, and mechanical properties. Blister temperatures, resulting from rapid heating, were obtained by monitoring changes in transverse thickness expansion using two different techniques. Both techniques employed showed similar blister temperatures in relation to the amount of absorbed moisture, regardless of sample size. The polyimide resin exhibited blister temperatures ranging from 225 - 362 degrees C, with 1. 7 - 3. 0 wt% absorbed moisture, and the polyimide composite had blister temperatures from 246 - 294 degrees C with 0. 5 - 1. 5 wt% moisture. Weight loss of the <b>fluorinated</b> <b>polyimide</b> and its corresponding polyimide carbon fiber composite under elevated temperature was examined. Weight loss as a function of exposure temperature and time was measured using TGA and by pre- and post-weighing of specimens treated in an oven. Both techniques showed similar weight loss trends as a function of time and temperature, but TGA showed much greater weight loss due to greater surface area to volume (i. e., small sample size). The neat polyimide resin and carbon fiber composite exhibited negligible weight loss at temperatures below 430 degrees C for exposure times up to 20 minutes.

A continuous desizing system that uses an environmentally friendly chemical- mechanical process was developed for tow level fiber. Composites were fabricated with fibers containing the manufacturer's sizing, desized, and further treated with a reactive finish. Results of room temperature tests show that desizing reduces interface sensitive properties compared to the manufacturer's sizing and that subsequent surface re-treatment with reactive finish increases interface sensitive properties. Properties of thermally aged composites and composites with varying finish concentrations will also be discussed...|$|E

Polyimides designated either as PMR- 12 F when nadic ester (NE) end caps used, or as V-CAP- 12 F when p-aminostyrene end caps used. High-molecular-weight, addition-curing polyimides based on BTBD and HFDE highly processable high-temperature matrix resins {{used to make}} composite materials with excellent retention of properties during long-term exposure to air at 650 degrees F or higher temperature. Furthermore, 12 F addition-curing polyimides useful for electronic applications; <b>fluorinated</b> rigid-rod <b>polyimides</b> known to exhibit low thermal expansion coefficients as well as low absorption of moisture...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{multimode}} fibres have a {{wide variety}} of applications ranging from industrial to medical use. Therefore, even if they are just used as waveguides or sensors, it is important to characterise the whole fingerprint, including the optical and mechanical properties of such fibres. Since the stiffness/elasticity of a material could influence the optical output of a fibre due to micro-bendings, in this paper we report the calculated Young's Modulus of acrylate, <b>fluorinated</b> acrylate, <b>polyimide</b> and silicone, which are the four most used coating materials for such optical components. The results demonstrate that Young's Modulus does {{have an impact on the}} attenuation of propagating light along the optical fibre. However, the refractive index of the coating materials still has a significant impact on the performance of optical fibres...|$|R
40|$|Since the origin, the use {{of liquid}} oxygen as {{oxidizer}} is widespread in space propulsion. It has {{been the source of}} numerous incidents. Many materials can burn violently in an oxygen enriched environment when ignited. Consequently, it is mandatory to perform oxygen compatibility tests. In the present work, compatibility tests are impact tests and auto ignition tests. Both standardized test methods are illustrated by test results on polymeric materials (i. e. <b>fluorinated</b> resins, <b>polyimides,</b> polyetherketone) for seals and ball bearing cage. For future needs, in order to face the increase of pressure of injection of propellants in cryogenic engines, the adiabatic compression test has been identified as well suited for qualifying materials as oxygen compatible in highly constraining conditions. Details on the test procedure and on the installation available at the Université de Liège are presented...|$|R
