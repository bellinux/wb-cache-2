50|$|The 2GR-FSE is a 3.5L engine {{used in the}} Lexus IS, GS 350, Mark X and Crown and {{incorporates}} Toyota's latest D-4S twin injection fuel system. This system combines {{direct injection}} (949cc/min injectors) with traditional port injection (298cc/min injectors). Direct injection lowers the tendency to knock (detonation) and increases performance by reducing the charge intake temperature. Traditionally, direct injection engines require an in-engine mechanism such as swirl ports or specific piston crown shapes to increase air turbulence in the engine. These are in place to help achieve a homogeneous air-fuel mixture inside the cylinder at low RPM and high load, but these mechanisms inhibit performance at higher engine speeds. In the 2GR-FSE, port injection is used considerably to achieve the correct mixture without having in-engine restrictions, meaning the engine achieves specific power {{near the top of}} all naturally aspirated production gasoline engines in the world (67 kW/L, 235 kW in the Mark X). Toyota also developed a new type of injector for this engine. The dual <b>fan</b> <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> of the direct injectors is perpendicular to the piston travel with wide dispersion in the cylinder, which aids air and fuel mixture and therefore increases power and efficiency. The port injectors not only help improve the power and efficiency but they also help improve emissions, especially in the first 20 seconds after start-up (when the catalytic converter is in its warm-up stage). Compression ratio is 11.8:1.|$|E

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a deflective surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the <b>pattern</b> <b>sprays</b> out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat spray, tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the <b>spray</b> <b>pattern.</b> Flat <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles. This <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire sprayed surface. Non-tapered flat spray nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> without any overlap in spray area.|$|R

50|$|Dynamic {{viscosity}} {{is defined}} as the property of a liquid that resists change in the shape or arrangement of its elements during flow.

50|$|Impact of a spray {{onto the}} target surface is {{expressed}} as the force/area, N/m2 or lb/in2. This value {{depends on the}} <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> distribution and the spray angle. Generally, solid stream nozzles or narrow <b>spray</b> angle flat <b>fan</b> nozzles are used for applications in which high impact is desired, such as cleaning.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nozzle wear on the flow rate and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> of <b>fan</b> nozzles made of {{different}} materials and of different nominal capacities were investigated. A mathematical model {{was developed to}} predict the orifice wear rate. Variables affecting nozzle wear rate in the model are operation time, initial orifice size, and orifice material. Equations were developed for relationships between operation times and changes in flow rates through the tips. There was good agreement between predicted and measured flow rate. The percentage increase in flow rate for all tips varied approximately with the square root of the operation time. Wear measurements for new and worn orifices showed that wear mainly increased the minor axis length of the elliptical orifice.

40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an integral}} part of crop production and ground-based agricultural boom sprayers are used extensively to apply pesticides to the crop canopy or soil surface across millions of acres in the United States. Efficient {{application is}} necessary to minimize costs and limit adverse environmental impacts. Errors in flow rate and system pressure measurements may cause as-applied maps to incorrectly indicate application rates and could negatively affect downstream data processing or analysis. The goals of this study were to provide quantified measurements on the effects of nozzle setup errors on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> uniformity and evaluate how laboratory patternator data would compare to measurements on a full spray boom. More specific objectives were to: 1) determine the effects from factors such as nozzle lateral angle, nozzle spacing, nozzle replacement and nozzle pitch angle on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> distribution, 2) evaluate a simulation approach to predict the effects of single nozzle boom setup errors on full boom system pattern uniformity, and 3) assess full boom operational measurements (e. g., flow, pressure, and <b>spray</b> <b>pattern)</b> to assess sensitivity for predicting boom distribution errors. Laboratory and field-based tests were devised to quantify the impact of nozzle setup and operational errors on <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> uniformity, boom pressure, and nozzle flow rates. Results indicated that small variations in boom setup or nozzle operation (i. e., pressure or flow) can cause significant errors in spray nozzle distribution which may not be completely detectable by measuring <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> alone. Simulations using laboratory data from setup or operational errors reflected similar changes in <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> CV as full boom data with similar setup errors. These findings were significant in that it may be possible to model full boom spray distributions based on smaller laboratory-collected datasets. Finally, full boom system-based pressure and flow measurements were compared with similar values at the boom subsection level. Results indicated that localized issues with nozzles or boom subsections may not be readily detected with system-based measurements. Those relying on system-based readings (e. g., pressure or flow) should expect errors exceeding 10 % compared to localized measurements across the spray boom. Advisor: Joe D. Luc...|$|R

40|$|The use of splash {{plates and}} dual {{impinging}} liquid jets are common methods for fuel atomization, but {{the combination of}} these methods has not been explored.

50|$|Spray {{painting}} is a painting technique where a device sprays a coating (paint, ink, varnish, etc.) {{through the air}} onto a surface.

Airbrushes are hand-held and used instead of a brush for detailed work such as photo retouching, painting nails or fine art. Air gun spraying uses equipment that is generally larger.

40|$|In Gasoline Direct Injection engines, direct {{exposure}} of the injector to the flame can cause combustion products to accumulate on the nozzle, which can result in increased particulate emissions. This research observes the impact of injector fouling on particulate emissions and the associated injector <b>spray</b> <b>pattern</b> and shows how both can be reversed by utilising fuel detergency. For this purpose multi-hole injectors were deliberately fouled in a four-cylinder test engine with two different base fuels. During a four hour injector fouling cycle particulate numbers (PN) increased by up to two orders of magnitude. The drift could be reversed by switching to a fuel blend that contained a detergent additive. In addition, {{it was possible to}} completely avoid any PN increase, when the detergent containing fuel was used {{from the beginning of the}} test. Microscopy showed that increased injector fouling coincided with increased particulate emissions. Based on these results a selection of the injectors was installed in a laboratory injection chamber and the <b>spray</b> <b>patterns</b> were investigated with a high speed camera. Injectors corresponding to the largest PN drift produced the thinnest spray jets with the deepest penetration. These factors amplify the risk of wall wetting and provide an explanation for the increase of PN.
