2500|$|A {{large number}} of jokes are about distrofiks, people with severe muscular dystrophy.

[...] Urea 40% [...] "dissolves the intercellular matrix" [...] of the nail plate. Only diseased or <b>dystrophic</b> nails are removed, as there is no effect on healthy portions of the nail. This drug is also used as an earwax removal aid.|$|E
2500|$|Unaided plant roots may {{be unable}} to take up {{nutrients}} that are chemically or physically immobilised; examples include phosphate ions and micronutrients such as iron. One form of such immobilization occurs in soil with high clay content, or soils with a strongly basic pH. The mycelium of the mycorrhizal fungus can, however, access many such nutrient sources, and make them available to the plants they colonize. Thus many plants are able to obtain phosphate, without using soil as a source. Another form of immobilisation is when nutrients are locked up in organic matter that is slow to decay, such as wood, and some mycorrhizal fungi act directly as decay organisms, mobilising the nutrients and passing some onto the host plants; for example, in some <b>dystrophic</b> forests, large amounts of phosphate and other nutrients are taken up by mycorrhizal hyphae acting directly on leaf litter, bypassing the need for soil uptake. [...] Inga alley cropping, proposed as an alternative to slash and burn rainforest destruction, relies upon mycorrhiza within the Inga Tree root system to prevent the rain from washing phosphorus out of the soil.|$|E

Although <b>dystrophic</b> lakes are often considered acidic and nutrient-poor (oligotrophic), these lakes actually vary greatly in terms of both pH and productivity.

The increase of calcium-binding proteins in <b>dystrophic</b> ILM may permit better maintenance of calcium homeostasis, with the consequent absence of myonecrosis.
