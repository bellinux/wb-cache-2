5000|$|As {{part of the}} 2008 {{update of}} the E-Series, the chassis {{underwent}} several updates. Although the Twin I-Beam front suspension was carried over (becoming one of two Ford vehicle to use the system, other is superduty chassis), other upgrades to the braking, suspension and steering systems improved ride and handling, braking performance and load carrying capability. [...] The chassis and suspension improvements increased in the maximum {{gross vehicle weight rating}} (GVWR) from 14,050 lb (6373 kg) to a class-leading 14,500 lb (6577 kg). Additionally, the maximum front <b>gross</b> <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> <b>rating</b> (GAWR) is increased by about 10 percent, from 4,600 lb (2087 kg) to a class-leading 5,000 lb (2268 kg).|$|E
5000|$|The {{weight of}} a vehicle is {{influenced}} by passengers, cargo, even fuel level, so a number of terms are used to express the {{weight of a}} vehicle in a designated state. Gross combined weight rating (GCWR) refers to the total mass of a vehicle, including all trailers. GVWR and GCWR both describe a vehicle that is in operation and are used to specify weight limitations and restrictions. Curb weight describes a vehicle which is [...] "parked at the curb" [...] and excludes {{the weight of a}}ny occupants or cargo. Dry weight further excludes the weight of all consumables, such as fuel and oils. Gross trailer weight rating specifies the maximum weight of a trailer and the <b>gross</b> <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> <b>rating</b> specifies the maximum weight on any particular axle.|$|E
50|$|In general, Dana 70 front axles are uncommon, due to {{attributes}} that the Dana 60 front axle can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 front axle has over a Dana 60 front <b>axle</b> is better <b>gross</b> <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> ratings.|$|R

50|$|The Dana 50 {{was made}} as a solid axle and as a Twin Traction Beam (TTB) which pivots in the center {{allowing}} the wheels to move independently of each other. A unique quality of the Dana 50 axle {{is the lack of}} variation in both TTB and Solid axle versions, which simplifies repairs and upgrades. There were no carrier breaks and only one spline count (30 spline). <b>Gross</b> <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> ratings were lowered by Ford for safety and tire reasons.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2011 the GMC and Chevrolet heavy Duty's have being {{upgraded}} {{with a new}} fully boxed {{high strength}} steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92% with bigger rear springs, larger engine and transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride.The front suspension incorporates new upper and lower control arms and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different <b>gross</b> <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> ratings. Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms, while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross <b>weight</b> <b>rating</b> allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear. These improvements allow {{for up to a}} 6,000 pound front <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> <b>rating,</b> allowing all 4wd trucks to accommodate a snow plow.Additional front suspension enhancements come from new urethane bump stops, two per side. The upper shock mount has been changed from a single stem mount to a two-bolt design to eliminate the possibility of squeaks and thumps. The rear suspension design uses asymmetrical leaf springs that are wider and capable of greater load handling. The design features 3-inch wide leaves, with front and rear spring sections of different lengths to reduce the twisting that can result in axle hop and loss of traction. The 2500HD use a two-stage design with a rating of 6,200 lbs, and 3500HD models have a three-stage design with 7,050 lb and 9,375 lb ratings on single and dual-wheel models respectively ...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at formulating various {{statistical}} {{models for the}} study of a ten year Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) data collected from various WIM stations in Hong Kong. In order to study the bridge live load model it is important to determine the mathematical distributions of different load affecting parameters such as <b>gross</b> vehicle <b>weights,</b> <b>axle</b> <b>weights,</b> <b>axle</b> spacings, average daily number of trucks etc. Each of the above parameters is analyzed by various stochastic processes in order to obtain the mathematical distributions and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method is adopted to calculate the statistical parameters, expected values and standard deviations from the given samples of data. The Kohnogorov-Smirnov (K-S) method of approach is used to check the suitability of the statistical model selected for the particular parameter and the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the distributions of maximum value stochastic processes of a series of given stochastic processes. Using the statistical analysis approach the maximum value of <b>gross</b> vehicle <b>weight</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> in bridge design life has been determined and the distribution functions of these parameters are obtained under both free-flowing traffic and dense traffic status. The maximum value of bending moments and shears for wide range of simple spans are obtained by extrapolation.

40|$|In the through arch bridges, the {{suspenders}} are the {{key components}} connecting the arch rib and the bridge deck in the middle, and their safety is an increasing focus {{in the field of}} bridge engineering.

40|$|This report {{documents}} work {{undertaken in}} the demonstration of a low-cost Automatic Weight and Classification System (AWACS). An AWACS procurement specification and details {{of the results of}} the project are also included. The intent of the project is to support and encourage transferring research knowledge to state and local agencies and manufacturers through field demonstrations. Presently available, Weigh-in-Motion and Classification Systems are typically too expensive to permit the wide deployment necessary to obtain representative vehicle data. Piezo electric technology has been used in the United Kingdom and Europe and is believed to be the basic element in a low-cost AWACS. Low-cost systems have been installed at two sites, one in Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement in Iowa and the other in Asphaltic Cement Concrete (ACC) pavement in Minnesota to provide experience with both types of pavement. The systems provide <b>axle</b> <b>weights,</b> <b>gross</b> vehicle <b>weight,</b> <b>axle</b> spacing, vehicle classification, vehicle speed, vehicle count, and time of arrival. In addition, system self-calibration and a method to predict contact tire pressure is included in the system design. The study has shown that in the PCC pavement, the AWACS is capable of meeting the needs of state and federal highway agencies, producing accuracies comparable to many current commercial WIM devices. This is being achieved at a procurement cost of substantially less than currently available equipment. In the ACC pavement the accuracies were less than those observed in the PCC pavement which is concluded to result from a low pavement rigidity at this site. Further work is needed to assess the AWACS performance at a range of sites in ACC pavements...|$|R

Considering the transverse distribution of the wheel loads on each girder due to two-dimensional (2 -D) behavior of slab-girder bridge, the ILs {{of each of the}} girders can be calculated, which does not require the girders to possess the identical material and geometrical properties.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to reveal the effect of different tillage depths, hence, different draft forces required by a plow, on the weight transferred from a tractor front axle to rear axle, and on the torque applied to tractor rear wheels. The tillage depths incorporated in the study were 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 cm, and the tillage operation was performed on a loamy sand soil at a moisture content (MC) of 12. 55 % using a three bottom moldboard plow integrated on an 89. 6 kW (120 hp) tractor at an average ground speed of 4 km/h. In addition to the horizontal draft force, the dynamic weights on tractor front and rear axle were measured for each tillage depth and transferred weight was determined. For each tillage depth, total increase in tractor rear <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> (transferred weight plus effect of draft force) was calculated. Increase in torque at the tractor rear wheels due to the total increase in rear <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> was also determined. Results showed that, when the tillage depth increased from 5 to 25 cm, the average required horizontal draft force increased from 10. 55 to 15. 45 kN (46. 4 %), however, front <b>axle</b> dynamic <b>weight</b> decreased, on the average, from 18. 20 to 14. 50 kN (20. 3 %).
