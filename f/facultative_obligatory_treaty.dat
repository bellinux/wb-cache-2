40|$|Wolbachia are {{bacteria}} {{that live in}} the cells of various invertebrate species to which they cause a wide range of effects on physiology and reproduction. We investigated the effect of Wolbachia infection in the parasitic wasp, Asobara tabida Nees (Hymenoptera, Braconidae). In the 13 populations tested, all individuals proved to be infected by Wolbachia. The removal of Wolbachia by antibiotic treatment had a totally unexpected effect—aposymbiotic female wasps were completely incapable of producing mature oocytes and therefore could not reproduce. In contrast, oogenesis was not affected in treated Asobara citri, a closely related species that does not harbor Wolbachia. No difference between natural symbiotic and cured individuals was found for other adult traits including male fertility, locomotor activity, and size, indicating that the effect on oogenesis is highly specific. We argue that indirect effects of the treatments used in our study (antibiotic toxicity or production of toxic agents) are very unlikely to explain the sterility of females, and we present results showing a direct relationship between oocyte production and Wolbachia density in females. We conclude that Wolbachia is necessary for oogenesis in these A. tabida strains, and this association would seem to be the first example of a transition from <b>facultative</b> to <b>obligatory</b> symbiosis in arthropod–Wolbachia associations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malaria {{prevalence}} differs {{between the}} two islands that comprise the archipelago of São Tomé and Príncipe. This {{may be due to}} differences in the biology of local Anopheles gambiae, the only vector on the islands. Survival rate and feeding frequency are two factors influencing vectorial capacity. Anophelines generally feed just once per gonotrophic (oviposition) cycle. Newly emerged insects, however, may feed two or more times during their first oviposition cycle thus increasing the likelihood of becoming infected. The reasons for multiple feeding are not clearly understood and it is still uncertain whether the behaviour is <b>facultative</b> or <b>obligatory.</b> We, therefore, determined survival and sporozoite rates, and examined the behaviour of An. gambiae from the two islands during their first gonotrophic cycle.

40|$|The {{production}} of extrafloral nectar and food bodies {{plays an important}} role in many tropical ant-plant mutualisms. In Malaysia, a close association exists between ants and some species of the pioneer tree genus Macaranga (Euphorbiaccac). Macaranga is a very diverse genus which exhibits all stages ofintcraction with ants, from <b>facultative</b> to <b>obligatory</b> associations. The ants nest inside the hollow inlcrnodes and reed mainly on food budies provided by the plants. Food body production had previously been reported only in myrrnecophytic Macaranga species, where it is usually coneentrated on protected parts or the plants such as recurved stipules. We found that non-myrmecophytic Macaranga species also produce food bodies on leaves and stems, where they are collected by a variety or ants. Levels of food body production differ between facultatively and obligatorily ant-associated species but also among the various non-myrmecophytes. This may he rdated to the degree of interaction with ants. Food body production starts at a younger age in the myrmccophytic species than in the transitional or non-myrmcccophytic Macaranga. Although food bodies of the non-inhabited Macaranga species are collected by a variety of ants, there is nu evidence of association with specific ant species. Our observations suggest that food bodies enhance the evolution of ant-plant interactions. Production of food bodies alone, however, does not appear to be the most important factor for the development of obligate myrmccopllytism in Macaranga...|$|R

Brodimoprim is a dimethoxybenzylpyrimidine that has recently entered into clinical use, and its uptake into and elimination from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), together with its effects on normal phagocytic and antimicrobial mechanisms, have been investigated. Brodimoprim uptake by PMNs was determined by a velocity-gradient centrifugation technique under various experimental conditions and was expressed as the ratio of the intracellular to the extracellular drug concentration (C/E) in comparison with the C/E of trimethoprim, which was used as a control drug. After incubation with 7. 5 mg of brodimoprim per ml, PMNs accumulated brodimoprim (C/E, 74. 43 6 12. 35 at 30 min) more avidly than trimethoprim (C/E, 20. 97 6 6. 61 at 30 min). The cellular uptake of brodimoprim was not affected by temperature, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, or potassium fluoride and was increased with an increase in the pH of the medium. It was reduced in formaldehyde-killed PMNs. The efflux of brodimoprim was very rapid (46 % after 5 min). The liposolubility of brodimoprim was about three times that of trimethoprim, as was the uptake. Therefore, a possible passive transmembrane diffusion mechanism might be proposed.

40|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF) is {{a secondary}} wine fermentation conducted by {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB). This fermentation is important in winemaking as it deacidifies the wine, it contributes to microbial stability and lastly it contributes to wine aroma through the production of metabolites. Oenococcus oeni is the main species used in commercially available starter culture currently, but {{research has indicated that}} different Lactobacillus species also partake in MLF and this has shifted the focus in the MLF field to evaluate the potential of lactobacilli as starter cultures for the future. There are 17 different species of Lactobacillus associated with winemaking either being associated with the grapes/beginning of alcoholic fermentation or the MLF and wine. Lactobacillus associated with wine is mainly <b>facultative</b> or <b>obligatory</b> heterofermentative and can withstand the harsh wine conditions such as high ethanol levels, low pH and temperatures and sulphur dioxide. Wine lactobacilli contain the malolactic enzyme encoding gene, but sequence homology shows that it clusters separate from O. oeni. Lactobacillus also possesses more enzyme encoding genes compared to O. oeni, important for the production of wine aroma compounds such as glycosidase, protease, esterase, phenolic acid decarboxylase and citrate lyase. Another characteristic associated with wine lactobacilli is the production of bacteriocins, especially plantaricins which would enable them to combat spoilage LAB.

This paper presents the effects of using tetracycline to eliminate Wolbachia on the oogenesis of its host uzifly Exorista sorbillans (Diptera: Tachinidae), a parasitoid of silkworm Bombyx mori L. Earlier we reported cytoplasmic incompatibility, nucleo-cytoplasmic conflict, male biased sex ratio and reduction in fecundity upon curing of Wolbachia infection using an antibiotic. This paper presents the abnormal growth and proliferation of oocytes in the uninfected/cured uziflies. The anomalies include abnormal/arrested oocyte production with inhibition of normal functioning of nurse cell nuclei, malformation and agglutination in egg chambers, empty egg chambers due to arrested vitellogenesis and undeveloped ovarian tubules. These anomalies further lead to reduction in growth of the ovarian tubules, {{which resulted in a}} 20 reduction of fecundity. It is hypothesized that normal oocyte production in uzifly requires the infection of Wolbachia bacteria. Further, in the uzifly, infection is at transition stage from a <b>facultative</b> to an <b>obligatory</b> mode of symbiosis. In light of this, this paper discusses the relationship between Wolbachia and oocyte production. Â© 2009 The Entomological Society of Korea and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd...|$|R

Sporozoite rates assessed by ELISA in 15, 533 females from São Tomé and 2, 111 from Príncipe were determined. Results Estimated survival rates ranged between 0. 834 – 0. 849 per day in São Tomé and 0. 801 – 0. 818 per day in Príncipe. Sporozoite rates of 0. 63 % in São Tomé were significantly higher than the 0. 24 % from Príncipe. Overall 49 % of females mated on the second night after emergence before feeding, and 51 % on the third night and thus fed before mating. The likelihood of mating before feeding increased with wing size. None of the 3, 776 parous insects collected showed evidence of recent mating. All but two of the 198 females collected in copula had undeveloped ovaries. Mean wing sizes and the number of insects collected in a sentinel light-trap varied but the proportion of newly emerged insects in the collection did not. The estimated survival rate of the smallest insects was lower than other size groups, but the overall size distribution of each age group was normal. Parous insects were gonotrophically concordant. Conclusion Differences in mosquito survival contributed to the lower sporozoite rates and endemicity of malaria on Príncipe compared to São Tomé. On both islands all newly emerged insects blood fed on the second night following emergence but only became gonotrophically active on the third night after emergence. Smaller insects had a higher 'mortality/emigration' rate than larger ones. We suggest that insufficiency of Juvenile Hormone until the third day of adult life is responsible for gonotrophic inactivity and that by partitioning mating between the second or third day after emergence females maximise their chances of out-crossing. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In homeothermic {{birds and}} mammals, several thermoregulatory adaptations have evolved for {{surviving}} in unstable, food-restricted conditions. This study focuses on two adaptive mechanisms in pigeons (Columba livia) and quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) : hypothermia and the adaptive use obligatory heat production connected with feeding and digestion. The plasticity of the hypothermic response in fed and fasted birds and birds with restricted feeding was studied in laboratory and outdoor winter conditions. The other {{objective was to}} study adaptive timing of digestion, and substitution of <b>facultative</b> thermogenesis by <b>obligatory</b> heat production in cold and at thermoneutrality. The results showed that fasting has a strong influence {{on the level of}} nocturnal hypothermia in laboratory conditions: hypothermia becomes progressively deeper when fasting continues. In outdoor conditions, ambient temperature and predation risk modulated the daily body temperature (Tb) pattern of fasting pigeons. In very cold conditions, diurnal Tb of fasted birds also dropped below the normal level of the active phase. Predation risk prevented diurnal hypothermia but also attenuated the depth of nocturnal hypothermia in fasting pigeons. This study provides the first empirical effects of predation risk on hypothermia in starving birds. The study suggests that the presence of crop in pigeons allows adaptive timing of digestion. At thermoneutrality, peak digestion appeared late in the dark phase in birds with fed in the morning. Because the Tb of the birds increases to diurnal levels late in the dark phase, this obligatory heat from digestion can be used to aid re-warming by such timing. On other hand, {{the results of this study}} were partly opposite to the classical model of thermoregulatory substitution. In line with the classical model, a postprandial increase in metabolic rate (heat increment of feeding, HIF) was seen at thermoneutrality but not in cold. However, electromyographic measurements showed that there was no postprandial decrease in the intensity of shivering in the fed birds in cold. This indicates that true thermoregulatory substitution may be less common than assumed and suggests a role for facultative thermogenesis in HIF...|$|R
40|$|Nematodes – “eel worms”; {{members of}} the phylum Nematoda – can be {{considered}} as a success story within the Metazoa (multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes in which cells lack cell walls) : they are speciose and – probably - the most numerous group of multicellular animals on our planet. Nematodes are present in virtually all terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Nematodes are trophically diverse; they may feed on bacteria, fungi/oomycetes, algae and protozoa, other nematodes or on a combination of these (omnivores), or live as <b>facultative</b> or <b>obligatory</b> parasites of plants or animals. As they are abundant, ubiquitous and occupy several trophic levels, they {{play an important role in}} the soil food web. Nematode parasites of animals affect billions of humans and livestock, while plant parasites such as cyst, root knot and lesion nematodes cause large agricultural losses worldwide. Despite their undisputed ecological and economical relevance, the systematics of the phylum Nematoda is far from established. One of the aims of this research was to further elucidate nematode phylogeny using molecular data. First a phylogenetic tree was constructed of 349 taxa, spanning the entire phylum Nematoda, on the basis of full length small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences. A series of mostly well-supported bifurcations defined twelve major clades, whereas the most basal clade was defined by representatives of the Enoplida and Triplonchida. Our analysis confirmed the paraphyly of the Adenophorea. Furthermore it was found that the SSU rDNA from representatives of the distal clades evolved at a higher rate than the SSU rDNA from the basal clades. In the meantime, a substantial number of sequences was added to our overall SSU rDNA nematode alignment - both public data (GenBank) and data generated by ourselves (≈ 1, 500 sequences in total; February 2008). It is noted that the clade division as proposed in 2006 on the basis of “only” 349 taxa still seems to be valid. Subsequent research focused on three specific groups; Dorylaimia, Chromadoria and Tylenchomorpha. Within the suborder Dorylaimina, the SSU rDNA provided an exceptionally low phylogenetic signal, and - therefore – a part (≈ 1, 000 bp) of the more variable large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) was analyzed. In most cases nematode relationships could be elucidated with good support, although some areas in the trees remained unresolved. Generally speaking the results of molecular phylogenetics corresponded fairly well with classical nematode taxonomy. The main exception was the order Dorylaimida where twelve subclades could be distinguished which bore little resemblance to classical taxonomy. Furthermore the suitability of ribosomal DNA for a (semi-) quantative molecular identification method was demonstrated using quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and primers designed to specifically amplify {{members of the}} order Mononchida and the potato cyst nematodes Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis. Plant parasitism has arisen several times within the phylum Nematoda (once in the Triplonchida, at least three times in the Dorylaimida and at least twice in the Tylenchomorpha). The long-standing and generally accepted hypothesis states that plant parasites evolved from fungal feeding ancestors. However, while in most cases plant parasites were associated with fungal feeding nematodes, this hypothesis could neither be confirmed nor denied with the results of our phylogenetic analyses. In the case of two Dorylaimida (Pungentus and Longidorella), however, the ancestor was probably an omnivore. The analysis of this problem was substantially hampered by the lack of knowledge on feeding behavior of basal Tylenchomorpha. Presumably, the common ancestor of the nematodes lived in a marine environment and - if this assumption is correct - the transition to a limnoterrestrial environment must have taken place at least once. Surprisingly, analysis of the Chromadoria (minus the Rhabditida) revealed that transitions from a thalassic to a limnoterrestrial habitat (and vice versa) have taken place at least 11 times in the Chromadoria. Given their frequency these transitions are apparently fairly easy to achieve for nematodes and the possible adaptations involved were discussed. Nematodes vary widely in their responses to environmental disturbance, making them good bio-indicators of soil health. Yet it is not known with certainty which traits are responsible for tolerance to stress in nematodes. A framework was laid out to study correlations between nematode traits and stress tolerance. Furthermore the importance of accounting for the confounding effects of phylogeny was demonstrated. This is a first step towards a transparent, ecological grouping of free-living nematodes. It is worthwhile mentioning that - on the basis of the rDNA-based molecular framework described in this PhD thesis - DNA sequences signatures were identified for nearly all North-West European terrestrial and freshwater nematodes families. The relationship between quantitative PCR signal and numbers of individuals has been established for nearly all families and a first testing of DNA barcode-based community analysis is planned for spring 2008...|$|R
