5000|$|The {{sport was}} challenging, as the oiling of the <b>goose's</b> <b>neck</b> made it {{difficult}} to retain a grip on it, and the bird's flailing {{made it difficult}} to target in the first place. Sometimes the organisers would add an extra element of difficulty; one writer describing an event in the American South witnessed [...] "a nigger, with a long whip in hand ... stationed on a stump, about two rods m / 32 ft from the gander, with orders to strike the horse of the puller as he passed by." [...] The reaction of the startled horse would make it even more difficult for the puller to grab the goose as he went by. Many riders missed altogether; others broke the <b>goose's</b> <b>neck</b> without snapping off the head. The American poet and novelist William Gilmore Simms wrote that ...|$|R
25|$|Other hostile animals : In {{the early}} books, the Dog's main {{tormentors}} were the turkey, goat and pigs (Boris and Dolores). In one strip in Book 4, the goose is chasing Wal and the turkey is chasing the Dog, but Wal kicks the turkey and the Dog jumps on the <b>goose's</b> <b>neck,</b> then Wal and the Dog celebrate their partnership.|$|R

50|$|Many {{jet engines}} {{have a short}} annular passageway, linking two components, {{where there is a}} large change in mean radius, from front to rear. The shape of the {{resulting}} passageway is often similar to that of a swan or <b>goose</b> <b>neck.</b> Consequently, such a passageway is called a swan (or <b>goose)</b> <b>neck</b> duct. The duct provides a continuous matching of the flows between the high pressure and low pressure turbines and a diffusion of the flow upstream of the low pressure turbine. For the latter purpose a swan neck duct is an example of an inter-turbine diffuser.|$|E
50|$|Grogue is {{also used}} {{as a base for}} {{medicinal}} preparations, with the addition of herbs such as common rue, rosemary, or anise. There is also a grogue preparation made with percebes (<b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> barnacles).|$|E
50|$|The Harvaqtuurmiut {{society had}} its own traditions. Niqaptaq was a goose hunting ritual {{involving}} strings with bones ties at the ends that were spun overhead and when they wrapped around a <b>goose's</b> <b>neck,</b> the <b>goose</b> fell to the ground. They used moss smoke in their tents as a mosquito repellent. Dried moss, collected in the summer, {{was used as a}} fuel lighting mechanism.|$|R

The original Causeway Bay {{is near the}} present-day Tin Hau MTR station, whereas the Causeway Bay MTR station is at East Point. The present-day concept of the Causeway Bay area covers all the way until Canal Road (Canal Road East and Canal Road West), or the Canal Road district or in Chinese Ngo Keng Kiu (...) , lit., the bridge of a <b>goose's</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first lowboy trailer {{was invented}} in the 1920s; it {{featured}} a riveted gooseneck and solid rubber tires. The first detachable gooseneck trailer, referred to as an RGN (Removable <b>goose</b> <b>neck),</b> {{was invented in}} 1958.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goose</b> <b>Neck</b> Tower is an 87-metre {{concrete}} radio tower, near Bell and Mendig in West Germany. Built in 1976, {{it serves}} as an internal radio relay link for German electric and natural gas public utility RWE.|$|E
50|$|Another handy {{device for}} {{adjusting}} microphone placement is a flexible <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> tube. Made of a spiral-wound core of steel, goosenecks {{are made in}} various lengths and finishes and provide {{the ability to make}} minute changes in microphone position.|$|E
50|$|Gooseneck, Lead (pigtail)Leaded goosenecks {{are short}} {{sections}} of lead pipe (1’ to 2’ long) {{used during the}} early 1900s up to World War Two in supplying water to a customer. These lead tubes could be easily bent, and allowed for a flexible connection between rigid service piping. The bent segments of pipe often took {{the shape of a}} <b>goose’s</b> <b>neck,</b> and are referred to as “lead goosenecks.” Lead is no longer permitted in new water systems or new building construction.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{barnacles}} {{are considered}} edible by humans, including Japanese goose barnacles (e.g. Capitulum mitella), and goose barnacles (e.g. Pollicipes pollicipes), a delicacy in Spain and Portugal. The resemblance of this barnacle's fleshy stalk to a <b>goose's</b> <b>neck</b> gave rise {{in ancient times}} {{to the notion that}} geese, or at least certain seagoing species of wild geese, literally grew from the barnacle. Indeed, the word [...] "barnacle" [...] originally referred to a species of goose, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis, whose eggs and young were rarely seen by humans because it breeds in the remote Arctic.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} {{the servant}} {{is accused of}} stealing the Queen's ring. He is given one day to prove his innocence or submit to punishment. After having given up, he sits awaiting his demise when he overhears a goose complaining about a ring stuck in her throat. The servant leaps up, grabs the goose and hurries to the kitchen. When the cook slits the <b>goose's</b> <b>neck</b> and finds the missing gold ring. The King apologizes and offers the servant land and riches. The servant declines accepting only a little gold and a horse on which to see the countryside.|$|R

There is a {{stainless}} bail with a mounting hole bolted to the mast - vang block with built-in cleat can be mounted to it. Downhaul setup offers 3:1 purchase.|$|E
50|$|Before urban development, {{the area}} was the estuary of the Wong Nai Chung river, which flowed through Happy Valley. The 4th Governor of Hong Kong, John Bowring, {{developed}} the estuary area and named it Bowrington (or Bowring City). Bowrington Canal was built during {{the mid to late}} 1850s, fed by Wong Nai Chung. Because the long and narrow canal resembled the neck of a goose it was known as Ngo Keng Kan (鵝頸澗, lit. <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> stream). It was used by small vessels that could pass under various bridges along the route. The landmark Bowrington Bridge across the canal, built in 1861, was known as Ngo Keng Kiu (鵝頸橋, lit. <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> bridge) and carried the Hong Kong Tramways line across the waterway. The surrounding area is also known as Ngo Keng.|$|E
60|$|A {{few seconds}} more, {{and he was}} stripped, for his {{garments}} consisted only of shirt and trousers. But {{it was more than}} a few seconds before he returned to land, swimming on his back and trailing a <b>goose</b> by the <b>neck</b> with each hand, for the reeds were thick and the mud softish, and the second bird had been further out than he expected.|$|R
50|$|Sometime women simply drew {{parts of}} animals; these symbols were {{probably}} {{a sort of}} shorthand, endowed with all the attributes of the animal represented. Ducks’ <b>necks,</b> <b>goose</b> feet, rabbits’ ears, rams’ horns, wolves’ teeth, bear claws, and bulls’ eyes can all be found on pysanky. One cannot be sure, however, if these symbols were actually meant to represent animals, or were renamed centuries later because of their appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Wang Xizhi is {{particularly}} remembered {{for one of}} his hobbies, that of rearing geese. Legend has it that he learned that the key to how to turn his wrist whilst writing was to observe how <b>geese</b> moved their <b>necks.</b> There is a small porcelain cup depicting Wang Xizhi [...] "walking geese" [...] in the China Gallery of the Asian Civilisations Museum in Singapore. The other side of the cup depicts a scholar [...] "taking a zither to a friend".|$|R
50|$|The <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> is pin-style with a 90-degree tang {{that has}} {{a hole in it}} and sits over a screw below the {{stainless}} pin receiver on the mast, preventing the boom from swinging independent of the mast. Original halyard is wire/rope, with a ball stop on the wire but now vary.|$|E
50|$|Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus, the big shaggy-moss or rough <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> moss, is {{species of}} moss {{in the family}} Hylocomiaceae. It is often the {{dominating}} moss species in moderately rich forest habitats in the boreal regions and the Pacific Northwest. Because of its fuzzy appearance and tail-like shape it is also called the 'electrified cat's tail moss'. Not {{to be confused with}} square goose-necked moss, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus.|$|E
50|$|Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus is {{a species}} of moss known as springy turf-moss in the United Kingdom, and square <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> moss in the United States. It is {{widespread}} in Eurasia and North America, and has been introduced to the Southern Hemisphere. It has broad ecological tolerances, and is usually found in man-made habitats such as lawns and golf courses. It is most closely related to R. subpinnatus, with which it is often confused.|$|E

An adult freeflying indigenous <b>goose</b> with flaccid <b>neck</b> muscles, lethargic, emaciated and mildly dehydrated {{was brought to}} TVH (Teaching Veterinary Hospital), Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Khulshi, Chittagong, Bangladesh. Palpation of neck revealed solid tubular mass ventrally in the mid cervical region. Treatment included oesophagotomy and drug therapy. The bird was fully recovered within 10 days of post operation.

6000|$|Wicliffe and Huss opposed and {{assaulted}} {{the manner}} of life and [...] conversation in Popedom. But I chiefly do oppose and resist their [...] doctrine; I affirm roundly and plainly that they teach not aright. [...] Thereto am I called. I take the <b>goose</b> by the <b>neck,</b> and set the knife [...] to the throat. When I can maintain that the Pope's doctrine is false, [...] (which I have proved and maintained), then I will easily prove and [...] maintain that their manner of life is evil.|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced {{overfeeding}} and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined. In the necropolis of Saqqara, in {{the tomb of}} Mereruka, an important royal official, there is a bas relief scene wherein workers grasp <b>geese</b> around the <b>necks</b> in order to push food down their throats. At the side stand tables piled with more food pellets, and a flask for moistening the feed before giving it to the geese.|$|R
5000|$|This {{generation}} of Focus incorporated a redesigned cabin, changed materials, {{and a new}} [...] "infotainment" [...] system. Following the industry trend towards decontenting, and {{in keeping with the}} sedan's downmarket [...] "economy car" [...] image vs. the [...] "premium" [...] hatchback, the earlier sedan's space-saving gas strut trunk hinges are replaced with cheaper, intrusive <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> hinges. The Focus also has Ford's patented capless fuel tank, which doesn't require a cap to prevent siphoning.|$|E
50|$|A {{gooseneck}} (or <b>goose</b> <b>neck)</b> is a 180° {{pipe fitting}} {{at the top}} of a vertical pipe that prevents entry of water. Common implementations of goosenecks are ventilator piping or ducting for bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans, ship holds, landfill methane vent pipes, or any other piping implementation exposed to the weather where water ingress would be undesired. It is so named because the word comes from the similarity of pipe fitting to the bend in a goose's neck.|$|E
50|$|Pollicipes pollicipes, {{known as}} the <b>goose</b> <b>neck</b> {{barnacle}}, goose barnacle or leaf barnacle is a species of goose barnacle, also well known under the taxonomic synonym Pollicipes cornucopia. It {{is closely related to}} Pollicipes polymerus, a species with the same common names, but found on the Pacific coast of North America, and to Pollicipes elegans a species from the coast of Chile. It is found on rocky shores in the north-east Atlantic Ocean and is prized as a delicacy, especially in the Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5000|$|Mistreatment {{of animals}} was also {{reported}} by eyewitness audience members. For example, one audience member stated, [...] "We were front row {{and able to}} see the offside of back stage. First horrifying thing, the goose was waddling off stage and stopped, a stage hand reached out and SNATCHED the <b>goose</b> by the <b>neck,</b> yanking it off stage, NO EXAGGERATION. The white poodle has a significant ear injury and possible ear infection, kept pawing at it. The wire fox terriers seemed to have eye issues, perhaps conjunctivitis. The handling of the cats going into to apartment building was VERY ROUGH." ...|$|R
50|$|The nēnē-nui (along {{with the}} {{endangered}} nēnē and the extinct giant Hawaii goose) {{evolved from the}} Canada goose which migrated to the islands half a million years ago and adapted to the Pacific's tropical environment. This evolution is evidenced from both genetic similarities and outward appearances. An {{example of this is}} that Canada <b>geese</b> have black <b>necks,</b> whereas the surviving nēnē are similar in that they have the sides and front of their necks buff-colored with dark furrows http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0206_020206_canadiangeese.html. Scientists have also concluded that the two major reasons for this evolution were the loss of migration as well as the change in habitat, which eventually led to the goose's change in wingspan and change in the depth of their skulls and bills.|$|R
50|$|This is held on 5 September, the aim {{being to}} hold on {{for as long as}} {{possible}} to a goose that is hanging from a rope that crosses the harbor from one dock to the other. The rope has one side fixed and on the other side there is a group of men pulling the rope to raise and lower it. In the middle of the rope there is a goose drenched in oil (in previous times the bird was alive). There are a lot of boats that take part and all of them have to go, in the order assigned through a random lottery in the morning, to the place the goose is and one participant from each boat has to grab the <b>goose</b> by the <b>neck</b> as strongly as possible. Once the boat has advanced to the front, the men at the end of the rope start pulling it, lifting the goose with the member holding it. Once the participants reach the top, the men let him drop from there, before rapidly pulling him up again. They continue like that until the participant lets the goose go or until the <b>neck</b> of the <b>goose</b> gets broken. The one who makes most elevations wins the competition.|$|R
