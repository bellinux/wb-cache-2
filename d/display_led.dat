5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen <b>display</b> <b>led</b> to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the match, Keenor {{himself had}} asked manager Ted Robbins {{if he could}} have the players to himself for four hours prior to the game, taking the team to relax and discuss tactics for the match. In his pre-match, team talk Keenor exhorted to his {{teammates}} [...] "There's eleven of them and eleven of us, and there's only one ball, and it's ours." [...] Despite their inexperience, the Welsh side held Scotland to a 1–1 draw having taken the lead after six minutes through a Tommy Bamford goal. The <b>display</b> <b>led</b> for the Welsh public to call for the same side to remain for the following match against England, however there was no repeat of the result, the Welsh side losing 4–0 at the Racecourse Ground. He won his final cap for Wales on 26 October 1932 in a 5–2 victory over Scotland.|$|E

40|$|<b>LED</b> <b>displays</b> {{are widely}} {{employed}} for advertisements, sports, transportation, Stock markets, traffic signs in public transportation systems, shopping malls, schools, railways etc., The conventional <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> system uses traditional microcontrollers so that many {{problems such as}} poor reliability, flickering and more hardware requirement {{can be seen in}} display system. This article presents an efficient architecture for controlling <b>LED</b> <b>displays</b> which has the ability to expose monochrome movies and animations. Implementing the <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> screen using 32 -bit ARM 9 (S 3 C 2440) processor reduces the hardware requirement and also provide the speed of refreshing the screen will be high so that we can avoid the flickering in the display. In this article, a new way is implemented to increase the speed of the monochrome display is by scanning 8 rows at a time(row byte scanning) rather than single row(pixel by pixel). Therefore, the speed of refreshing of <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> will be increased. By allowing constant current through the <b>LEDs</b> in the <b>display</b> will increase the reliability of the display. The 8 GPIO lines of ARM processor are connected to the 8 rows of the <b>LED</b> <b>display</b> via 8 bit latches connected to implement row-byte scanning. Unlike in traditional <b>LED</b> <b>display,</b> rather than many microcontrollers a single ARM processor is enough to refresh the screen.
