5|$|The <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> {{includes}} {{well documented}} examples of phyletic gradualism and punctuational evolution. As such, much debate persists over {{the prominence of}} stasis in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of the elk) first appear in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (Cervidae) known from the <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> because the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all the species that have ever lived.|$|E

5|$|The <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is very uneven and, {{with few}} exceptions, is heavily slanted toward organisms with hard parts, leaving most groups of soft-bodied organisms {{with little to}} no <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b> The groups {{considered}} {{to have a good}} <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> including a number of transitional fossils between traditional groups, are the vertebrates, the echinoderms, the brachiopods and some groups of arthropods.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans have a {{rich and}} {{extensive}} <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> which begins with animals such as Canadaspis and Perspicaris from the Middle Cambrian age Burgess Shale. Most of the major groups of crustaceans appear in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> {{before the end of}} the Cambrian, namely the Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda (including barnacles and tongue worms) and Malacostraca; there is some debate as to whether or not Cambrian animals assigned to Ostracoda are truly ostracods, which would otherwise start in the Ordovician. The only classes to appear later are the Cephalocarida, which have no <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> and the Remipedia, which were first described from the fossil Tesnusocaris goldichi, but do not appear until the Carboniferous. Most of the early crustaceans are rare, but fossil crustaceans become abundant from the Carboniferous period onwards.|$|E

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs {{have always}} been an {{extremely}} varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and {{the total number of}} genera preserved in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> has been estimated at around1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered. An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record.</b> By September 17, 2008, 1047 different species of dinosaurs had been named.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> {{of the greater}} noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time. In 1980 Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez {{proposed the}} hypothesis that an impact event {{was responsible for the}} Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup led to a better appreciation of the importance of mass extinction events to the history of life on earth.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>fossil</b> <b>records</b> exist of wolf-like canids from Late Pleistocene Eurasia, no <b>fossil</b> <b>records</b> {{are known}} for the Ethiopian wolf. In 1994, a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis showed a closer relationship to the gray wolf and the coyote than to other African canids, and C. simensis may be an evolutionary relic of a gray wolf-like ancestor's past invasion of northern Africa from Eurasia.|$|R
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary {{developmental biology}} in his 1930 book Embryos and Ancestors, {{by showing that}} evolution could occur by heterochrony, {{such as in the}} retention of juvenile features in the adult. This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record,</b> since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the <b>fossil</b> <b>record</b> had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position. However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.|$|E
