5|$|The show {{depicts the}} adventures of a mysterious and {{eccentric}} Time Lord known as the Doctor, who travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS, which normally appears from the <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> be a blue 1950s British police box. With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Uranus {{is known}} to have 13 inner moons. Their orbits lie inside that of Miranda. All inner moons are intimately {{connected}} to the rings of Uranus, which probably resulted from the fragmentation of one or several small inner moons. The two innermost moons (Cordelia and Ophelia) are as shepherds of Uranus's ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab is a source of Uranus's outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> Uranus' α and β rings.|$|E
5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable to afford a really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|After Herschel {{discovered}} Titania and Oberon on January 11, 1787, he subsequently {{believed that}} he had observed four other moons: two on January 18 and February 9, 1790, and two more on February 28 and March 26, 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six satellites, though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell's observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel's observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites beside Titania and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel's four additional satellites in orbital characteristics. Herschel's four spurious satellites were thought to have sidereal periods of 5.89 days (interior to Titania), 10.96 days (between Titania and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (<b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> Oberon). It was therefore concluded that Herschel's four satellites were spurious, probably arising from the misidentification of faint stars {{in the vicinity of}} Uranus as satellites, and the credit for the discovery of Ariel and Umbriel was given to Lassell.|$|E

50|$|Cement plaster is {{a mixture}} of {{suitable}} plaster, sand, portland cement and water which is normally applied to masonry interiors and <b>exteriors</b> <b>to</b> achieve a smooth surface. Interior surfaces sometimes receive a final layer of gypsum plaster. Walls constructed with stock bricks are normally plastered while face brick walls are not plastered. Various cement-based plasters are also used as proprietary spray fireproofing products. These usually use vermiculite as lightweight aggregate. Heavy versions of such plasters are also in use for <b>exterior</b> fireproofing, <b>to</b> protect LPG vessels, pipe bridges and vessel skirts.|$|R

25|$|Flow over {{a cavity}} that is {{considered}} deep can create a whistle similar to that over shallow cavities. Deep is generally distinguished from shallow by the cavity depth being greater than the width. There are two geometries that have been studied.

25|$|Roman domes {{are found}} in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi are common features. They are customarily {{hemispherical}} in shape and partially or totally concealed on the <b>exterior.</b> <b>To</b> buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome, and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof.|$|E
25|$|In {{deriving}} the Schwarzschild metric, it {{was assumed}} that the metric was vacuum, spherically symmetric and static. In fact, the static assumption is stronger than required, as Birkhoff's theorem states that any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations is stationary; then one obtains the Schwarzschild solution. Birkhoff's theorem has the consequence that any pulsating star which remains spherically symmetric cannot generate gravitational waves (as the region <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> the star must remain static).|$|E
25|$|The Encke Gap is a 325-km-wide gap {{within the}} A Ring, {{centered}} {{at a distance}} of 133,590km from Saturn's center. It is caused by the presence of the small moon Pan, which orbits within it. Images from the Cassini probe have shown that {{there are at least three}} thin, knotted ringlets within the gap. Spiral density waves visible on both sides of it are induced by resonances with nearby moons <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> the rings, while Pan induces an additional set of spiraling wakes (see image in gallery).|$|E

25|$|The Heart of Dixie Railroad Museum {{operates}} a Missouri Pacific Railroad Planetarium Dome coach on its Calera & Shelby Railroad. The coach was built as MP 892 in 1948, renumbered to MP 592 in 1968. After being {{purchased by the}} Illinois Central, it was renumbered 2202. The museum purchased the car for steam excursion service in 1972 keeping the 2202 but replacing Illinois Central on the letter boards with Heart of Dixie. In 2015, the Heart of Dixie Railroad Museum restored the car's <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> its original MP 892 colors and numbering.|$|E
25|$|Before his death, {{nobody had}} {{expected}} that Franco would {{be buried in}} the Valley. Moreover, the grave had to be excavated and prepared within two days, forcing last minute changes in the plumbing system of the Basilica. Unlike the fallen of the Civil War who were laid {{to rest in the}} valley <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> the basilica, Franco was buried inside the church. His grave is marked by a simple tombstone engraved with just his Christian name and first surname, on the choir side of the main high altar (between the altar and the apse of the Church; behind the altar, {{from the perspective of a}} person standing at the main door).|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the library}} needed space {{and took over}} the stair area {{leading up to the}} theater. A tower was added to the rear <b>exterior</b> <b>to</b> compensate. After the state fire code was revised in the 1960s, however, the theatre no longer met those {{standards}} and could not be used as a public space. The library used it as storage space afterwards, with a few occasional public exhibitions, as it continued to deteriorate. In 1978, the Irvington Town Hall Theatre Group raised $100,000, mostly from the village, for the necessary improvements and restoration of earlier period details such as light fixtures. It reopened in late 1981 and has been in use ever since.|$|E
