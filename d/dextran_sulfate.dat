50|$|Jak3 is also {{implicated in}} mucosal {{differentiation}} and predisposition to {{inflammatory bowel disease}} in mice model. These studies show that Jak3 is expressed in colonic mucosa of mice, {{and the loss of}} mucosal expression of Jak3 results in reduced expression of differentiation markers for the cells of both enterocytic and secretory lineages. Jak3 KO mice showed reduced expression of colonic villin, carbonic anhydrase, secretory mucin muc2, and increased basal colonic inflammation reflected by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A in colon along with increased colonic myeloperoxidase activity. The inflammations in KO mice were associated with shortening of colon length, reduced cecum length, decreased crypt heights, and increased severity toward <b>dextran</b> <b>sulfate</b> sodium-induced colitis. In differentiated human colonic epithelial cells, Jak3 redistributed to basolateral surfaces and interacted with adherens junction (AJ) protein β-catenin. Jak3 expression in these cells was essential for AJ localization of β-catenin and maintenance of epithelial barrier functions. Collectively, these results demonstrate the essential role of Jak3 in the colon where it facilitated mucosal differentiation by promoting the expression of differentiation markers and enhanced colonic barrier functions through AJ localization of β-catenin. Though constitutive activation of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) leads to different cancers, the mechanism of trans-molecular regulation of Jak3 activation is only recently reported. This study showed that Jak3 auto-phosphorylation was the rate limiting step during Jak3 trans-phosphorylation of Shc where Jak3 directly phosphorylated (P) two tyrosine residues in SH-2-domain, and one tyrosine residue each in CH-1, and PID domains of Shc. Direct interactions between mutants of Jak3 and Shc showed that while FERM domain of Jak3 was sufficient for binding to Shc, CH-1 and PID domains of Shc were responsible for binding to Jak3. Functionally, Jak3 was auto-phosphorylated under IL-2 stimulation in epithelial cells. However, Shc recruited tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and PTP-1B to Jak3 and thereby dephosphorylate Jak3. Thus the study not only characterized Jak3 interaction with Shc, but also demonstrated the mechanism of intracellular regulation of Jak3 activation where Jak3 interactions with Shc acted as a regulator of Jak3 dephosphorylation through direct interactions of Shc with both Jak3 and tyrosine phosphatases.|$|E

Particularly potent inhibition has been reported for the milk protein beta-lactoglobulin (betaLG) on modification by 3 -hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3 HP). The introduction of multiple negatively charged carboxyl groups along the polypeptide backbone obviously leads to repulsion within the protein molecule and this is likely to affect the specific tertiary, and perhaps also secondary, structure of the protein. We used several biophysical techniques to probe the structural changes that occur on 3 HP modification of betaLG.

The disease activity index (DAI) increased in DSS only-treated mice. In contrast, the DAI value was significantly reduced in rCsStefin- 1 treated mice than DSS only-treated mice. In addition, the colon length of DSS only-treated mice was shorter than that of rCsStefin- 1 treated mice. The secretion levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were significantly increased by DSS treatment, but the level of TNF-α in MLNs was significantly decreased by rCsStefin- 1 treatment. IL- 10 production in both spleen and MLNs was significantly increased, and IL- 10 + F 4 / 80 + macrophage cells were significantly increased in the spleen and MLNs of rCsStefin- 1 treated mice after DSS treatment.

40|$|TNF-like {{cytokine}} 1 A (TL 1 A) {{is expressed}} on APCs and provides costimulatory signals to activated lymphocytes that bear its functional receptor, death receptor 3 (DR 3). TL 1 A/DR 3 signaling {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of human and experimental inflammatory bowel disease. In the current study, we investigated the role of this cytokine/receptor pair in acute intestinal injury/repair pathways. We demonstrate that intact DR 3 signaling protected mice from acute <b>dextran</b> sodium <b>sulfate</b> colitis because DR 3 -/- mice showed more severe mucosal inflammation and increased mortality. DR 3 -/- mice were compromised in their ability to maintain adequate numbers of CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells in response to acute mucosal damage. This defect in immune regulation led to a nonspecific upregulation of effector proinflammatory pathways, which was most prominent for the Th 17 immunophenotype. TL 1 A-/- mice were similarly more susceptible to <b>dextran</b> sodium <b>sulfate</b> colitis, although without mortality and with delayed kinetics compared with DR 3 -/- mice, and also displayed significantly reduced numbers of regulatory T cells. Infection of DR 3 -/- mice with Salmonella typhimurium was associated with defective microbial clearance and elevated bacterial load. Taken together, our findings indicate a novel protective role for the TL 1 A/DR 3 axis in the regulation of mucosal homeostasis during acute intestinal injury/repair, which contrasts with its known pathogenic function during chronic intestinal inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Because neurotensin (NT) and its highaffinity {{receptor}} (NTR 1) modulate immune responses, chloride secretion, and {{epithelial cell}} proliferation, {{we sought to}} investigate {{their role in the}} repair process that follows the development of mucosal injuries during a persistent inflammation. Colonic NT and NTR 1, mRNA, and protein significantly increased only after <b>dextran</b> sodium <b>sulfate</b> (DSS) -induced inflammatory damage developed. Colitis-induced body weight loss, colonic myeloperoxidase activity, and histological damage were significantly enhanced by SR- 48642 administration, a nonpeptide NTR 1 antagonist, whereas continuous NT infusion ameliorated colitis outcome. To evaluate the NT and NTR 1 role in tissue healing, mucosal inflammatory injury was established administering 3...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{developmental}} role for Hippo signaling in organ size control is well appreciated, how this pathway functions in tissue regeneration is largely unknown. Here we {{address this issue}} using a <b>dextran</b> sodium <b>sulfate</b> (DSS) -induced colonic regeneration model. We find that regenerating crypts express elevated Yes-associated protein (YAP) levels. Inactivation of YAP causes no obvious intestinal defects under normal homeostasis, but severely impairs DSS-induced intestinal regeneration. Conversely, hyperactivation of YAP results in widespread early-onset polyp formation following DSS treatment. Thus, the YAP oncoprotein must be exquisitely controlled in tissue regeneration to allow compensatory proliferation and prevent the intrinsic oncogenic potential of a tissue regeneration program...|$|R
