40|$|Copyright © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved. We have {{previously}} shown that administration of progesterone during early pregnancy in sheep enhances fetal weight and crown–rump length. The present {{study examined the}} effect of this treatment on individual fetal organ weights and on placental growth and structure. Embryos that had been exposed to either a normal or a high concentration of progesterone on days 1 – 3 in initial recipient ewes were transferred at random to <b>final</b> <b>recipient</b> ewes that had or had not been treated with progesterone on days 1 – 3. Embryos in an additional group of ewes were exposed to progesterone on days 1 – 3 with oviducts of the ewes ligated. An increase in fetal weight was observed in the <b>final</b> <b>recipient</b> group that had been treated with progesterone (P< 0. 01) but not in the initial group treated with progesterone. Fetal weight was increased (P< 0. 05) in the initial recipients treated with progesterone plus ligation. Placental weight did not differ between any of the treatments in either initial or <b>final</b> <b>recipients,</b> while placental volumes of chorionic membrane and maternal crypts were increased by progesterone, with and without ligation, in initial recipients (P< 0. 05). The responses of fetal weight in <b>final</b> <b>recipients</b> were associated with increases in the weight and linear dimensions of specific fetal components (e. g. brain, kidney, heart, spleen, total gut, head width, thorax circumference). Proportionate increases were observed for most parameters with the exception of brain, heart and M tibialis anterior weight; adjusted least squares means indicated disproportionate increases in these of 5 per cent, 32 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. Enhanced fetal weight in the progesterone plus ligation group was associated with increased (P< 0. 05) heart weight; a disproportionate increase of 39 per cent was recorded. Increased fetal weight and fetal heart, skeletal muscle and brain weight were correlated with increased volumes and surface area of the fetal trophectoderm and maternal fetomaternal syncytium in the <b>final</b> <b>recipients</b> treated with progesterone. It is concluded that alteration of the embryo's environment during {{the first few days of}} development enhances fetal growth disproportionately, in close association with increased abundance of the exchange epithelia in the placenta.

30|$|The {{evaluated}} {{results show}} that the New Swiss Split concept would lead to a significant improvement in the overall feasibility of container distribution by SWL in Switzerland.

5000|$|In {{some cases}} the {{borrowing}} process can be more complicated and the words might move through different languages before {{coming back to the}} originating language. The single move from one language to the other is called [...] "loan" [...] (see loanword). Reborrowing is the result of more than one loan, when the <b>final</b> <b>recipient</b> language {{is the same as the}} originating one.|$|R
30|$|Shifting the {{transport}} of goods from road to rail and inland waterways is a major goal of European transport policy. Current research often focuses {{on the distribution of}} maritime containers by using combined transport or more specifically, on the usage of rail or inland waterways to serve hinterland terminals and the subsequent distribution of containers to recipients by truck. Very little research has considered using rail for the distribution of containers right up to the <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> In Switzerland, however, SBB Cargo still distributes a large number of containers directly to their <b>final</b> <b>recipients</b> by using the Swiss Split service. The research presented here aims at developing ideas that might help to improve the competitiveness of container distribution by rail. It presents a holistic approach that covers the entire transport chain. Many of these ideas will be implemented in an improved service called New Swiss Split as soon as the new Basel-Nord intermodal terminal will have been opened in 2019.|$|R
40|$|When {{there are}} {{externalities}} across households, governments can improve economic outcomes by equitably subsidizing education. But this chain of causality works only if (1) allocated resources reach the <b>final</b> <b>recipients,</b> and (2) equity in public subsidies translates directly into equity in total educational expenditures, including private spending at the household level. Using a unique data set from Zambia, the author shows that whether these conditions are met {{depends on the}} specific schemes used to allocate resources {{as well as the}} exact form of the subsidies. First, subsidies allocated through clear guidelines and legislated rules reached the <b>final</b> <b>recipients,</b> but those allocated at the discretion of province and educational offices did not. Second, even those components of subsidies that were progressive (in that the share of total subsidies for the poor was greater than the share for the non-poor) had no effect on inequality in total educational expenditures due to the crowding-out of household spending...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{messaging}} middleware guarantees {{the delivery of}} messages to intermediary destinations like message queues, but does not guarantee the receipt or the processing of a message by <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> Conditional messaging is an extension to standard {{messaging middleware}} that addresses this shortcoming by allowing an application to define, monitor, and evaluate various conditions on messages, such as time constraints on the receipt or the processing of a message {{by a set of}} <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> In this paper, we introduce the notion of conditional messaging, and present the design and implementation of a flexible and reliable system that supports conditional messaging for use in Java 2 Enterprise Edition and message queuing environments. Our solution uniquely shifts the responsibilities for implementing the management of conditions on messages from the application to the middleware. We further discuss the grouping of multiple conditional messages into atomic units-of-work, which can also integrate requests to transactional resources like distributed objects using object middleware. Conditional messaging serves to implement various kinds of backward dependencies for distributed object transactions that integrate messaging...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{if there is a}} reasonable prospect of success of a re-use liver transplantation. METHODS: We systematically searched for reports of liver graft re-use using electronic searches of PubMed and Web of Knowledge. We performed hand searches of references lists of articles reporting re-use of grafts. RESULTS:A systematic review of the literature reveals 28 liver transplantations using previously transplanted grafts. First and second recipients ranged in age from 4 to 72 years and 29 to 62 years respectively. Liver disease in the first recipient was varied including 5 (18 %) patients with fulminant liver failure who died subsequently of cerebral edema. The second transplantation was performed after a median interval of 5 d (one day- 13 years). Viral hepatitis was present in 3 (11 %) of the initial recipients and in 8 (29 %) of <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> hepatocellular carcinoma was present in 6 (21 %) of the <b>final</b> <b>recipients.</b> Early survival after the final transplantation was 93 %, whereas long-term survival was 78 % with a mean follow-up of 23. 3 (3 - 120) mo. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of transplantation using previously transplanted grafts in this select population are similar to those seen with conventional grafts...|$|R
