25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because there is never displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box in the same <b>direction</b> that the <b>box</b> moves, doing positive work.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dependence of}} single-particle diffusion coefficients on {{the size and shape}} of the simulation box in molecular dynamics simulations of fluids and lipid membranes. We find that the diffusion coefficients of lipids and a carbon nanotube embedded in a lipid membrane diverge with the logarithm of the box width. For a neat Lennard-Jones fluid in flat rectangular boxes, diffusion becomes anisotropic, diverging logarithmically in all three <b>directions</b> with increasing <b>box</b> width. In elongated boxes, the diffusion coefficients normal to the long axis diverge linearly with the height-to-width ratio. For both lipid membranes and neat fluids, this behavior is predicted quantitatively by hydrodynamic theory. Mean-square displacements in the neat fluid exhibit intermediate regimes of anomalous diffusion, with t[*]ln[*]t and t 3 / 2 components in flat and elongated boxes, respectively. For membranes, the large finite-size effects, and the apparent inability to determine a well-defined lipid diffusion coefficient from simulation, rationalize difficulties in comparing simulation results to each other and to those from experiments...|$|R

40|$|Microstructural banding is {{explored}} in 2 D and 3 D using serial sectioned micrographs. The banding is quantified using two parameters called the Band Continuity Index Cb and the Perpendicular Continuity Index Cp. The indexes determined from the 2 D micrographs {{is shown to}} be sufficient for estimating {{the distribution of the}} bands in 3 D. A stereological model employing oriented circular cylinders is established to represent the bands in steel microstructures. This model assumes that cylinders are distributed randomly inside of a box with their symmetry axes oriented in the same <b>direction.</b> The <b>box</b> is then cut parallel to the symmetry axes and rectangles are observed on the cut plane. The inverse relationship between the rectangles and the cylinders is established, and the distribution functions and expectations various quantities of interest, such as the cylinder radius, height, surface area and volume, as well as the covariance between the radius and height, are estimated directly from the rectangle observations. The asymptotic behavior of the empirical, isotonic and kernel smoothed estimators is determined and used to obtain confidence intervals for the expectations of the quantities of interest when the model is applied to the steel microstructures. The limitations of the model are explored and the model is shown to be reasonably robust against deviations from its rather stringent requirements. This makes the model useful in a practical setting, and the results obtained for the steel microstructures are reasonable. This model is not limited in application to banded microstructures, but can also be used for any microstructural feature that {{can be thought of as}} being plate-like, rod-like or needle-like.

In an attempt to add to the {{understanding}} of geostrophic flow (balance with the Coriolis force) and its interaction with time-dependent wave phenomena, this study treats a model (experimental set-up) for geostrophic currents, with which experiments on flow through a rectangular box on a rotating platform have been performed. A dataset studying the effect of tilt of the box and its eccentricity with respect to the position of the rotation axis has been produced, measuring the differential pressure between two points perpendicular to the flow <b>direction</b> within the <b>box</b> and the established flow as a function of table's rotation frequency and pump steering voltage. The mean-time differential pressure was not affected by eccentricity. The tilt of the box influenced the observed differential pressure such that it is suggested there exists a relation between the differential pressure and the wave attractor that could form in a tilted box. Rotation influences the through flow in the tubes that connect the box with pump and flowsensor. The relationship found between flow, differential pressure and Coriolis parameter was consistent within equal parameter settings, but did not follow the expected geostrophic relation.

40|$|Abstract — Many {{architectures}} {{have been}} proposed to solve tightly-coupled multirobot tasks (MT) through coalitions of heterogeneous robots. However, several issues remain unaddressed. As coalitions are formed, sensor constraints among robots are also established. For example, in a leader-follower task, follower robots must keep leader robots within their sights, while in a box-pushing task, a supervisor robot needs to track the moving <b>direction</b> of the <b>box</b> and monitor the pushing path to the goal for obstacle avoidance. The {{question of how to}} keep these constraints satisfied during the entire execution, from initial configurations to completeness of the task, remains an open issue. In addition, environmental factors, both static and dynamic, can influence the maintenance of the constraints. Moreover, problems arise when the constraints are unsatisfiable given the current circumstances. For example, the sight of the leader might be blocked or there might be obstacles blocking the view of the box. This paper proposes a general method to address these issues for various applications with sensors having certain characteristics. Our approach combines the use of sensor models, environment sampling, measures of information quality, a motion model with sampling, and a constraint model. We believe that this approach offers the first generic formulation of robotic sensor constraints that can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} applications. To illustrate this method, we apply the approach to solve robot tracking and navigation tasks both in simulation and with physical robots. Experimental results illustrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach. I...|$|R

The response from the automotive industry includes vehicles whose primary propulsion systems are not based upon fossil fuels. On this basis a Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project, partly funded by the European Regional Development Fund, is currently under way; part of this project involves designing a lightweight Body In White (BIW). This has been specifically tailored to suit the drive train and general packaging requirements associated with a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The future opportunities for new lightweight vehicle architecture have been investigated using a technique entitled topology optimisation, which extracts the idealised load paths for a given loading. The topology optimisation includes equivalent NCAP dynamic impact loading conditions, as well as torsional rigidity performance. Initially a total of 7 loading scenarios are applied on a structure comprising of various battery and range extender layouts. Two different optimisation modelling techniques have been undertaken comparing conventional boundary conditions against inertia relief, as well as studying {{the sensitivity of the}} BIW topology against the influence of load case <b>direction</b> and battery <b>box</b> stiffness. Optimal locations for the two components having the highest mass, i. e. a single battery pack and a combined range extender and fuel tank have been studied focusing upon the effects of the location of their Centre of Mass.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} rotation {{on the evolution of}} the Parker instability by carrying out three-dimensional numerical simulations with an isothermal magnetohydrodynamic code. These simulations extend our previous work on the nonlinear evolution of the Parker instability by J. Kim and coworkers. The initial equilibrium system is composed of exponentially stratified gas and a field (along the azimuthal direction) in a uniform gravity (along the downward vertical <b>direction).</b> The computational <b>box,</b> placed at the solar neighborhood, is set to rotate uniformly around the Galactic center with a constant angular speed. The instability has been initialized by random velocity perturbations. In the linear stage, the evolution is not much different from that without rotation, and the mixed (undular + interchange) mode regulates the system. The interchange mode induces alternating dense and rarefied regions with small radial wavelengths, while the undular mode bends the magnetic field lines in the plane of the azimuthal and vertical directions. In the nonlinear stage, flow motion overall becomes chaotic, as in the case without rotation. However, as the gas in higher positions slides down along field lines forming supersonic flows, the Coriolis force becomes important. As oppositely directed flows fall into valleys along both sides of the magnetic field lines, they experience the Coriolis force toward opposite directions, which twists the magnetic field lines there. Hence, we suggest that the Coriolis force plays a role in randomizing the magnetic field. The three-dimensional density structure formed by the instability is still sheetlike with the short dimension along the radial direction, as in the case without rotation. However, the long dimension is now slightly tilted with respect to the mean field direction. The shape of high-density regions is a bit rounder. The maximum enhancement factor of the vertical column density relative to its initial value is about 1. 5, which is smaller than that in the case without rotation. We conclude that uniform rotation does not change our point of view that the Parker instability alone is not a viable mechanism for the formation of giant molecular cloudsopen 252...|$|R
