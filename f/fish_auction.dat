5|$|For generations, Skagen's {{economy has}} been based on its fishing {{industry}} which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing harbour, the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest fish oil factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A <b>fish</b> <b>auction</b> is held at dawn in the harbour, and between May and October the harbour also attracts yachting enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no <b>fish</b> <b>auction</b> takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores <b>fish</b> <b>auctions</b> as a {{management}} tool for allocation of quotas and a motivating institution for market-oriented value adding (MOVA) among target fishery groups, {{as an alternative}} or supplement to the individually transferable quota (ITQ) system. A management model is developed where administrative allocation of fishing rights to preferred target groups is combined with auctioning of individual seasonal quota (ISQ) rights as leasing contracts to fishery companies. It is shown how the management model maintains {{the positive effect of}} ITQs in terms of maximizing the resource rent in fisheries whilst the negative effects in terms of privatization, unfair allocation, concentration of quota power and possibly weakened linkages between fish resource utilization and coastal communities, are avoided. The costs of the administrative constraints should be weighed against the advantages of the model: (1) Sustainability and fair social allocation of the rights to utilization of the fish resources can be maintained without privatization. (2) Motivating MOVA among target groups through the allocation of ISQs to the most market-oriented and efficient fishers is encouraged since quota is leased but not owned. (3) Collective use of the resource rent is extended to the wider community.
