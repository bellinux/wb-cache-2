40|$|Greece {{was one of}} the Eurozone {{countries}} that was hit the hardest by the crisis and there is a real threat that the risk overflow from the Greece home markets could have negative consequences on the activities of their subsidiaries in Serbia since they account for 14 % of total assets of the banking sector in Serbia. The initial reasons for entering the Serbian market were versatile, the most important ones being the high interest margins, untapped debt potential of the corporate and retail sectors and a search for new clients. The data about the performance of Greek bank subsidiaries are mixed. The ROAA and ROAE data show that they are below average, but had a positive trend before the crisis. On the other hand, the data on the net interest margin (NIM) show that before crisis the <b>Greek</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> had NIM above the industry average. After the crisis, the NIM decreased, but most of the banks are still above the average. Negative profitability figures mean that a bank is unable to generate income (net interest income or other operating income) to the level necessary to cover the expenses, even though the NIM of Greek bank subsidiaries is above the banking sector average...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} profits of Greek banks operating abroad by developing an integrated model that includes a set of determinants informed by {{the literature on the}} profitability of both multinational and domestic banks. The basis for our econometric analysis is provided by an unbalanced panel dataset for 19 <b>Greek</b> bank <b>subsidiaries</b> operating in 11 nations, covering the period from 1995 to 2001. The results show that the profitability of the parent bank and the operating experience of its host nation subsidiaries have a robust and positive impact on the profits of Greek banks abroad, whereas subsidiary bank size has a negative effect. Domestic financial factors reflecting stock market developments, bank-specific factors such as liquidity, loan loss provisions or cost efficiency, and market specific factors like concentration or market share in the host nations, are all insignificant in explaining <b>Greek</b> <b>subsidiary</b> banks' profits. © 2006 Elsevier B.

50|$|In 1923, {{after the}} {{population}} exchange between Greece and Turkey, many ethnic Greeks from Asia Minor fled to Greece {{as a result}} of the Greco-Turkish War. They settled in poor neighborhoods in Piraeus, Thessaloniki, and Athens. Many of these immigrants were highly educated, such as songwriter Vangelis Papazoglou, and Panagiotis Toundas, composer and leader of Odeon Records' <b>Greek</b> <b>subsidiary,</b> who are traditionally considered as the founders of the Smyrna School of Rebetiko. Another tradition from Smyrna that came along with the Greek refugees was the tekés (τεκές) 'opium den', or hashish dens. Groups of men would sit in a circle, smoke hashish from a hookah, and improvise music of various kinds.|$|R
40|$|In many companies, {{the field}} service (FS) {{department}} {{plays an important}} role, contributing up to 40 % to the company's total revenue. FS managers {{have to cope with}} conflicting objectives: (a) to maintain a high level of customer service and (b) to keep the spares inventory level as low as possible. Therefore, they need tools to analyse the impact of their decisions on customer service and inventory cost. Such a tool is presented in this paper. We have developed a closed queueing network model, similar to one due to Waller, incorporating priority classes of customers via the application of the priority mean value analysis (PMVA) algorithm, developed by Shalev-Oren et al. This model has been applied to the FS organization of the <b>Greek</b> <b>subsidiary</b> of a multinational computer company, and it has proved to be very efficient from the computational point of view, thus constituting a powerful tool for the FS managers. queueing performance evaluation field service decision support systems strategic planning...|$|R

40|$|Set in the <b>Greek</b> <b>subsidiary</b> of a {{multinational}} company whose products are capital goods and consumables sold through business-to-business channels, this work addresses a noticeable fall in sales over recent {{years from the}} perspective of a practitioner-researcher. A participative approach to the research work was chosen by reference to the Action Inquiry paradigm and the thesis outlines the reasons for this choice. It goes on to trace how the problem of falling sales was first explored through the literatures of customer satisfaction and customer relationship management before finding expression in the Service-Profit Chain model. The application of this model to a business-to-business environment is carefully considered throughout. From a wide client base, not all customers could be accommodated in the research and so a method of customer selection is outlined. To enable an evaluation of the progress of the work, a non-positivist process for benchmarking customer sentiment towards the subsidiary has been developed by extensive use of the Repertory Grid Technique. The thesis reports on two applications of this method, each a year apart, and on the ameliorating interventions made in the intervening period. These interventions were facilitated by the application of a key account management system in the company where the work took place. Both practical and theoretical issues concerning the KAM approach are discussed at length. The work may be seen as pursuing a gap in the literature recognized by several writers and as such it contributes to knowledge by virtue of being a rare piece of pragmatic research into customer relationships and their management. It demonstrates a practical integration of the fields of theory covered by the Service-Profit Chain, Customer Relationship Management and Key Account Management, whilst reinforcing the Service- Profit Chain model as an integrating theory within the business-to-business field. Finally, the research outlines a transferable process for the assessment of a company's standing with its customers in such an environment and for planning appropriate interventions with a view to influencing that standing on a cyclical basis.

40|$|The {{prices of}} Greek closed-end funds behave {{similarly}} to {{the prices of}} US funds: they deviate substantially from their net asset values (NAVs); they are more volatile than their NAVs; and they are overly-sensitive to {{the movements of the}} domestic stock market index. Furthermore, their premia are: (i) positively correlated cross-sectionally; (ii) positively correlated with the future NAV returns; and (iii) negatively correlated with the future returns on the funds. Yet most <b>Greek</b> funds are <b>subsidiaries</b> of banks that have considerable influence on their pricing, whereas US funds are owned mainly by small investors. Future explanations to the closed-end fund puzzle should, therefore, transcend the narrow institutional characteristics of asset composition and ownership of US closed-end funds.

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007 - 8 {{and the ensuing}} manifestation of the Greek debt crisis in the euro area have abruptly ended the credit-fuelled boom in the South East Europe (SEE). The crisis episodes have also reignited the interest of researchers and policy makers on the determinants of credit risk {{and the impact of}} crisis on the stability of the SEE banking sectors. The contribution of this thesis {{lies in the fact that}} it provides the first systematic assessment of the relationship between credit risk and macroeconomic shocks in the Bulgarian and Romanian banking systems with an explicit role for the Greek debt crisis and the spillover effects transmitted through the <b>Greek</b> banks’ <b>subsidiaries</b> in the thesis’ focal countries. The empirical research uses a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2001 to 2010, thus covering a significant part of the boom-bust cycle, as well as advanced modelling approaches that have not been used before in the focal banking systems. The results indicate that credit risk plays a central role in the linkages between banking systems and macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The determinants of credit risk in Bulgaria and Romania are macroeconomic, bank-specific and institutional. The evidence on the spillover effects from the Greek debt crisis, manifested through the strong banking linkages, differs between the two countries. The data generate evidence of a Greek crisis spillover effect on Romania but not on Bulgaria, given the pronounced differences in the economies and banking systems of these two countries. The results of the empirical research are country-specific, suggesting that the region does not form a homogeneous block, thus each country merits research on its own. The implications of the research support the view that banking stability should be at the core of central banks’ policymaking, while strong regional cooperation and coordination among regulators would be beneficial in safeguarding banking systems from crisis contagion...|$|R
