40|$|From 1990 to 1994 the {{research}} institutes of the Agricultural Research Department in the Netherlands (DLO-NL) investigated potential new arable oilseed crops for industrial application {{as part of}} the National Oilseeds Programme (NOP). The Institute of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering (IMAG-DLO) studied the mechanical harvesting and cleaning of Crambe abyssinica, Dimorphotheca pluvialis, Calendula officinalis and Euphorbia lagascae. This paper describes {{the research}} conducted on the crops Calendula officinalis and Dimorphotheca pluvialis, using three harvesting methods: combining (New Holland 8070), combining after chemical desiccation and combining after windrowing. Gross yield, moisture content <b>of</b> harvested <b>seeds</b> and foliage, <b>seed</b> losses and <b>impurities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> were measured. It was found that both crops could best be harvested with a combine harvester after chemical desiccation. Timely harvest seemed to be important to avoid weather damage and excessive seed shedding.

40|$|Testing seed lots for the {{unintended}} presence {{of genetically modified}} (GM) seeds is carried out in European Union Member States (MS). The aim of the testing <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is to test whether GMOs are present in non-GM seed lots. Splitting samples <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> taken from lots into subsamples, testing for the presence <b>of</b> GM <b>seeds</b> in each subsample, and {{counting the number of}} positive subsamples is a suitable method for estimating the proportion <b>of</b> GM <b>seeds</b> <b>impurities</b> with a specified probability. The detection of lower proportions <b>of</b> GM <b>seeds</b> in lots requires the analysis <b>of</b> larger <b>seed</b> samples and larger amounts of DNA. This entails more effort and cost to detect lower quantities <b>of</b> GM <b>seed.</b> This document aims at studying the relation between the <b>impurity</b> <b>of</b> GM <b>seed</b> that could be detected and the cost of the analyses required to detect {{the unintended}} presence <b>of</b> GM <b>seed</b> in conventional seed lots. A statistical model is elaborated to describe the relation between the <b>impurity</b> level <b>of</b> GMO <b>seeds</b> in seed lots that will, with a high probability, be reliably detected by test plans (the limit of detection) and the cost of the test plans needed to achieve this and effort devoted to the plan. Lowest-cost test plans were estimated for crops with test plan limits of detection at 5 %, 0. 9 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 05 %, 0. 01 % and 0. 005 % GM seed. As the limit of detection for a plan is reduced, an increasing number of subsamples are required and the change in estimated cost becomes inversely proportional to the change in the estimated limit of detection. A halving from a low limit of detection to a lower limit of detection approximately doubles the estimated cost of the laboratory analysis. For high test plan limits of detection this has no effect on laboratory costs because there is a certain minimum effort required to test working samples of any size. The analysis showed that the rate at which cost increases is determined by the properties <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> being tested: specifically, the size <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> and the number of genome copies per mass of DNA.

A model, based on a fluid description of electrons, main and impurity ions and taking into account the plasma quasi-neutrality, Coulomb collisions <b>of</b> background and <b>impurity</b> charged particles, radiation losses, sinks of particles to bounding material surfaces, is elaborated. Particle, momentum and energy balances are deduced by integrating transport equations within the clouds of neutral and singly charged impurities, both inside and beyond the scrape-off layer of the puffing limiter. These provide algebraic non-linear equations for the characteristic densities and temperatures of the plasma components in the cloud and for the cloud dimension itself.

If several ion species are present in the plasma the generalized Bohm criterion requires that a certain function of the main ion velocity changes its sign when moving along the magnetic field from the distant plasma through the impurity source to the surface. This allows us to formulate the 'regularity' conditions for the motion equation of the main ions and a numerical approach to find the only physical solution without singularities is elaborated.

The pedestal degradation due to the Ne seeding is taken as input. The impact of Zeff and radiative loss on the heat transport are modeled with the quasi-linear 1 D fluid code RITM. The input parameters are taken from a series <b>of</b> Ne <b>seeded</b> discharges conducted in JET. Discharges with D, D + Ne and Ne only fueling are qualitatively analyzed. The model recovers the experimentally observed fact that, while the confinement is degraded from the D to the D + Ne seeded plasma, it is improved from the D + Ne to the Ne only seeded plasma...|$|R

To investigate the effect of noble gases on deuterium retention, tungsten targets have been implanted by different noble gas ions and subsequently exposed to deuterium plasma. Irradiation induced defects and deuterium retention in tungsten targets have been characterized by positron annihilation Doppler broadening and thermal desorption spectroscopy. Similar defect distributions are observed in tungsten irradiated by neon and argon, while it is comparatively low {{in the case of}} helium. The influence of helium pre-irradiation on deuterium trapping is found to be small based on the desorption spectrum compared with that of the pristine one. Neon and argon pre-irradiation leads to an enhancement of deuterium trapping during plasma exposure.

5000|$|Christine Hayes {{compares the}} Deuteronomic and Ezran {{viewpoints}} on intermarriage, and discusses in terms <b>of</b> ritual <b>impurity</b> {{and the fear}} <b>of</b> profaning the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> Israel. First and foremost, Hayes holds that the fear <b>of</b> profaning the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> Israel was the underlying rationale for the ban in exogamous marriage, rather than the ritual <b>impurity</b> <b>of</b> Gentiles in general. She also argues that the regulations on intermarriage in the times of Ezra were different from the restrictions on intermarriage {{according to the book}} of Deuteronomy. For example, the Ezra ban on intermarriage was different in that it was 1) Universal in scope, and 2) had the rationale that intermarriage was the profanation <b>of</b> the holy <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> Israel. [...] She elaborates on these differences by saying that the prohibition at the time the Torah was written was not based on the ritual <b>impurity</b> <b>of</b> all Gentiles; rather, only the Gentiles of the seven Canaanite nations that were specified were to be avoided. This was [...] "based on the fear that intimate contact with the Canaanites will lead Israelites to imitate their idolatrous and immoral ways." [...] Thus, Hayes contrasts the restrictions on intermarriage at the time the Torah was written with the time of Ezra by pointing out that the Torah did not prohibit intermarriage between all Gentiles, only those in the seven nations specified. Furthermore, the intent of the Ezra ban was different in that it was based on the preservation <b>of</b> a holy <b>seed,</b> as opposed to the idea in the Torah that contact with the Canaanites would lead to the Israelites imitating their idolatrous and immoral ways.|$|R
40|$|Impurity {{injection}} with {{noble gases}} {{has been used}} in DIII-D to increase radiation in the mantle region, with confinement enhancements above the ITERL- 89 P L mode scaling relation in both diverted and limited discharges. For discharges with an L mode edge, impurity injection produces a prompt increase in confinement and a more gradual increase in density. These changes occur at densities and radiated power fractions significantly lower than those observed in the TEXTOR tokamak device. ELMing H mode discharges with active pumping and high deuterium gas feed (puff and pump) exhibit an increase in density with no degradation in energy confinement after impurity injection, increasing to nearly the Greenwald density limit following a spontaneous transition several hundred milliseconds after impurity injection. The highest density phase of both L mode and ELMing H mode radiating mantle discharges is usually terminated after the onset of n = 2 MHD activity. identified as an m/n = 3 / 2 neoclassical tearing mode. A reduction in density fluctuations after impurity injection in the mantle region has been measured using beam emission spectroscopy in L mode discharges and is coincident with reductions in thermal diffusivity and increases in core toroidal rotation. The similarities and differences between these types <b>of</b> <b>impurity</b> <b>seeded</b> discharge will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{beta limit}} in {{radiative}} improved (RI mode) discharges where energy confinement is enhanced {{due to an}} increased radiation level from the edge by <b>impurity</b> <b>seeding</b> <b>of</b> neon has been investigated. Under these discharge conditions spontaneous confinement transitions from higher to lower energy confinement can be observed when the beta limit is approached. The empirically determined limit of the normalized toroidal beta, PN, is 2. 2, pp reaches values up to 1. 5 in the circular limiter tokamak TEXTOR- 94. The sawtooth activity is often stabilized and replaced by central mode oscillations around q = 1 when high values (greater {{than or equal to}} 1) of the confinement enhancement factor f(H 93) With respect to the ELM-free ITER- 93 H mode scaling are reached. Measurements of the plasma current distribution show that already before the confinement transition the central current density decreases, i. e. the current profile broadens and magnetic shear is decreased. The deterioration of energy confinement has been found to correlate with the onset of MHD activity either at the q = 1. 5 and/or the q = 2 surface. The enhanced transport after the beta drop is caused by the MHD mode activity in the plasma; the favourable stabilization of the ITG mode under RI mode conditions is not altered. The possible role of pressure driven contributions to the destabilization of the observed MHD modes will be discussed...|$|R

In some cases, the system is unable to avoid plasma reattachment to the divertor plate or the formation of a confinement damaging x-point MARFE. This is due to the small operational window for mitigated heat flux in the parameters of incident plasma heat flux, plasma density, and impurity density as well as the relatively slow response <b>of</b> the <b>impurity</b> gas injection system compared to plasma transients. Given the severe consequences for failure of such a system to operate reliably in a reactor, there is substantial risk that the conventional vertical target plate divertor will not provide an adequately controllable system in reactor-class devices.
