The album reached No. 10 and 21 on the U.S. Billboard Jazz Albums and Billboard 200 charts respectively, and No. 36 on the Swedish albums chart. Notably, There & Back showcases Beck's stylistic shift towards instrumental rock while largely retaining the jazz fusion elements of his two previous releases, Blow by Blow (1975) and Wired (1976). The opening track, [...] "Star Cycle", was used {{for a number of}} years as the theme song for both Mid-South Wrestling in the United States and the British music programme The Tube (1982-87); [...] "The Pump" [...] was featured in the 1983 film Risky Business; [...] "Too Much to Lose" [...] is an instrumental cover of a song composed by keyboardist Jan Hammer that was originally featured on the Jan <b>Hammer</b> <b>Group's</b> 1977 album Melodies.|$|R

50|$|Cleveland Stadium was {{the home}} field of the Cleveland Indians {{baseball}} team, so Belkin could only schedule stadium concerts for dates when the Indians were playing out of town.

Following the 1975 football season, groundskeepers completely resurfaced the field, and installed a drainage system, to repair damage from the rock concerts. The first concert of 1976 was scheduled for July 11 with Aerosmith, Todd Rundgren's Utopia, Jeff Beck (with the Jan <b>Hammer</b> <b>Group)</b> and Derringer. However, the concert was canceled after stadium officials refused to allow seating on the field to prevent damage to the new turf and Aerosmith would not play without fans on the field.

40|$|When {{dealing with}} a large stratigraphic data set, it is {{difficult}} to get a general idea of the excavation’s main features and their chronological sequence because the Harris diagram will become very big. It is hard to understand a diagram consisting of hundreds of equally sized boxes, if no hints are given how to structure them. Large Harris diagrams are seldom published owing to the high costs, and they cannot be displayed properly on a web page. In addition, multilinear or floating sequences (Harris 1984, p. 128) pose a problem, i. e. the network of stratigraphic relationships may be displayed in a large number of diagrams reflecting different chronological sequences. These problems can be overcome in part by grouping stratigraphic units (Roskams 2001, p. 258). During post-excavation analysis, archaeologists combine individual stratigraphic units to form groups: for example, all the postholes belonging to a building are allocated to a group. Often lower level groups are aggregated to create higher-level groups, resulting in an overview display of the main features of an excavation. British archaeologists call these overview displays <b>group</b> sequence diagrams (<b>Hammer</b> 2000, pp. 167 - 168). According to <b>Hammer,</b> a <b>group</b> summary including dating is vital for understanding a site. Clark (2000, p...|$|R

50|$|Whitten {{continued}} to drift, {{his personal life}} ruled almost totally by drugs. He {{was kicked out of}} Crazy Horse by Talbot and Molina, who used replacements on the band's two albums of 1972. In October of that year, after receiving a call from Young to play rhythm guitar on the upcoming tour behind Young's Harvest album, Whitten showed up for rehearsals at Young's home outside San Francisco. While the rest of the <b>group</b> <b>hammered</b> out arrangements, Whitten lagged behind, figuring out the rhythm parts, though never in sync {{with the rest of the}} group. Young, who had more at stake after the success of After The Gold Rush and Harvest, fired him from the band on November 18, 1972. Young gave Whitten $50 and a plane ticket back to Los Angeles. Later that night Whitten died from a fatal combination of diazepam, which he was taking for severe knee arthritis, and alcohol, which he was using to try to get over his heroin addiction.

50|$|In early 1969 Leslie West, {{formerly}} of the Long Island R&B band The Vagrants, put together a band, Leslie West Mountain (a reference to his then-large size), with Norman Landsberg (keyboards, bass) and Ken Janick (drums) and began playing concerts. Right around this time, former Cream collaborator Felix Pappalardi {{expressed an interest in}} producing West's work. West, previously disgruntled and unsatisfied with the lack of success he desired in his first project, found Cream to be a great inspiration. He began to feel disillusioned with the R&B and Blues scenes of the 1960s that he previously played in. West immediately dropped the style and envisioned a project that would take on a rawer and much harder style of Rock N' Roll which he had begun to favor. The resulting solo album by Leslie West, Mountain, featured Pappalardi, Landsberg and former Remains drummer N.D. Smart. The album spotlighted West's raw vocals and melodic, bluesy guitar style, and Pappalardi's bass lines were prominent throughout. According to West, when Pappalardi asked what would be next, West suggested the pair go on the road. The group was heavily influenced by seminal British blues-rock band Cream (with which Pappalardi had been a frequent collaborator: he produced Disraeli Gears, Goodbye and Wheels of Fire, also contributing viola, brass, bells and organ to the latter) and also comprised keyboardist Steve Knight (from Devil's Anvil, another of Pappalardi's productions), who was added after Landsberg left to form another <b>group,</b> <b>Hammer,</b> with Janick.|$|R

In Ernakulam in 1980, parallel to the Kerala Lalit Kala Akademi exhibition, he participated in a group exhibition of posters in protest. Thereafter he went to Shantiniketan for a post diploma, and in July 1984 was admitted as a scholarship holder at the Kanoria centre for Arts in Ahmedabad.Shortly after leaving the Centre, he attended the young sculptors camp at Kasauli.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on May 31, 2016 Dissertation advisor: Chen YiVitaThesis (D. M. A.) [...] Conservatory of Music and Dance. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 Mock Trial {{is a work}} for wind ensemble. It is {{inspired}} by proceedings common to debates and courtroom sessions, where multiple arguments are presented, examined and cross-examined. As a parody, the work pokes fun at the rigid process of a trial, which breaks down {{into a series of}} arguments rather than following the expected orderly proceedings. The ensemble is split into nine groups, with the percussionists taking center stage and the other eight wind groups forming a semi-circle around them. The eight surrounding groups represent the debating parties, while the group in the center serves as the judge or mediator to regulate the interactions that occur. When chaos ensues, the center group intervenes with a hammering from the piano and bass drum, much like a judge's gavel. What is “on trial” in this piece is the tension between Western and Eastern musical values. For instance, in the beginning, one of the wind groups engages in a slow pseudo-jazz passage, which eventually gets drowned out by the brass players making Bronx cheer noises through their mouthpieces, signifying their utter distaste towards the idea. The gavel-like blow from the central group comes in and silences them. More Western ideas from other wind groups make their entry, but are repeatedly mocked by mouthpiece noises and other sorts of rude interventions from the groups around them. After a number of these instances, an unheralded mock Chinese idea from another wind group is heard. The other groups react by formulating their own versions. This chaotic buildup eventually accumulates until the percussion <b>group</b> <b>hammers</b> at them, calling for a brief recess. It becomes clear {{that the majority of the}} wind groups share a mutual dislike towards Western musical ideas and would rather lean towards Eastern tunes, an agreement confirmed at the climax, where all the groups engage in long-winded Eastern textures overlapping each other. This time, the percussionists play along with them until the end. Abstract [...] Instrumentation [...] Stage setup [...] Musi...|$|R
