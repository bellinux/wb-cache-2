BLAKE is one of the five finalists of the NIST SHA- 3 competition submitted by J. -P. Aumasson et al. For SM 3, we present boomerang distinguishers for the compression function reduced to 34 / 35 / 36 / 37 / 38 steps out of 64 steps, with time complexities 2 31. 4, 2 33. 6, 2 73. 4, 2 93 and 2 192 respectively.

Meanwhile, we launch boomerang attacks on up to 7 and 8 rounds keyed permutation of BLAKE- 256 which are the first valid 7 -round and 8 -round boomerangs for BLAKE- 256. Especially, since our distinguishers on 34 / 35 -step compression function of SM 3 and 7 -round keyed permutation of BLAKE- 256 are practical, we are able to obtain boomerang quartets of these attacks.

NASA patented the method to reduce pumping damage to red blood cells and {{the design of a}} continuous flow heart pump (# 5, 678, 306 and # 5, 947, 892).

Ventricular assist devices were developed {{to bridge the gap between}} heart failure and transplant. Early devices were cumbersome, damaged red blood cells, and increased the risk of developing dangerous blood clots. Application emerged from NASA turbopump technology and computational fluid dynamics analysis capabilities. To develop the high performance required of the Space Shuttle main engines, NASA pushed the state of the art in the technology of turbopump design. NASA supercomputers and computational fluid dynamics software developed for use in the modeling analysis of fuel and oxidizer flow through rocket engines was used in the miniaturization and optimization of a very small heart pump. Approximately 5 million people worldwide suffer from chronic heart failure at a cost of 40 billion dollars In the US, more than 5000 people are on the transplant list and less than 3000 transplants are performed each year due to the lack of donors. The success of ventricular assist devices has led to an application as a therapeutic destination as well as a bridge to transplant.

40|$|At present, {{governments in}} many {{countries}} are actively engaged {{in the development of}} <b>electronic</b> trading and <b>certification</b> standards to enable the smooth operation of export markets. Standards and their usability underpin confidence in the operations of markets and their effective functioning. In institutional markets, an important role for government agencies lies in developing the initial specifications for standards for interoperable systems. Once these specifications are accepted, governments can then facilitate the eventual diffusion of a standard to the B 2 B marketplace. Acceptance of an industry standard can determine demand, which defines the viability of that market. In this paper, we describe an initiative by a government agency, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), in developing EXDOC, a standard for export documentation and the role that AQIS played in its implementation and diffusion. Our case study illustrates a successfully facilitated B 2 G implementation. It demonstrates how a standard can be supported and promulgated for the effective functioning of markets in the transition from manual to online export documentation. Once the overarching specifications for related industries have been established and diffused by government, opportunities arise for private sector markets to develop across these industries. Government agencies can promote the effective operation of standards for electronic markets. The EXDOC implementation and its iterations provide an exemplar of active engagement in the development of <b>electronic</b> trading and <b>certification</b> standards for an institutional market.

50|$|A Digital Postmark (DPM) is a {{technology}} that applies a trusted time stamps issued by a postal operator to an electronic document, validates electronic signatures, and stores and archives all non-repudiation data needed to support a potential court challenge - it guarantees the certainty of date and time of the postmarking. This global standard was renamed the <b>Electronic</b> Postal <b>Certification</b> Mark (EPCM) in 2007 shortly after a new iteration of the technology was developed by Microsoft and Poste Italiane. The key addition to the traditional postmarking technology was integrity of the electronically postmarked item, meaning any kind of falsification and tampering will be easily and definitely detected. Additionally, content confidentiality is guaranteed since document certification is carried out without access or reading by the postal operator. The EPCM will eventually be available through the UPU to all international postal operators in the 191 member countries willing {{to be compliant with}} this standard, thus granting interoperability in certified communications between postal operators. In the United States, the US Postal Service operates a non-global standard called the Electronic Postmark, although it is soon expected to provide services utilizing the EPCM.|$|R

40|$|For over 140 years, {{federal law}} has {{provided}} for recording of documents pertaining to copyright in one central location, at the Copyright Office and, before the Copyright Office was {{created as a}} separate unit, at the Library of Congress. Over that time, the copyright recordation system has supported a market for interests in and use of works of authorship by lowering the cost of obtaining information about ownership and by reducing unavoidable risks that threaten ownership. Yet the recordation system has not kept up with developments in technology and in business practices. This report, prepared while the author was serving as the Abraham L.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Electronic</b> death <b>certification</b> was {{established}} in France in 2007. A methodology based on intrinsic characteristics of death certificates was designed to compare the quality of electronic versus paper death certificates. METHODS: All death certificates from the 2010 French mortality database were included. Three specific quality indicators were considered: (i) amount of information, measured {{by the number of}} causes of death coded on the death certificate; (ii) intrinsic consistency, explored by application of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) General Principle, using an international automatic coding system (Iris); (iii) imprecision, measured by proportion of death certificates where the selected underlying cause of death was imprecise. Multivariate models were considered: a truncated Poisson model for indicator (i) and binomial models for indicators (ii) and (iii). Adjustment variables were age, gender, and cause, place, and region of death. RESULTS: 533, 977 death certificates were analyzed. After adjustment, electronic death certificates contained 19 % [17 %- 20 %] more codes than paper death certificates for people deceased under 65 years, and 12 % [11 %- 13 %] more codes for people deceased over 65 years. Regarding deceased under and over 65 respectively, the ICD General Principle could be applied 2 % [0 %- 4 %] and 6 % [5 %- 7 %] more to electronic than to paper death certificates. The proportion of imprecise death certificates was 51 % [46 %- 56 %] lower for electronic than for paper death certificates. CONCLUSION: The method proposed to evaluate the quality of death certificates is easily reproducible in countries using an automatic coding system. According to our criteria, electronic death certificates are better completed than paper death certificates. The transition to electronic death certificates is positive in many aspects and should be promoted...|$|R
