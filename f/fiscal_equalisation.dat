Second, how to solve the trade-off between the need for greater efficiency {{and the need to}} equalise the lower endowment of the poorer regions.

The discussion of horizontal <b>fiscal</b> imbalance and <b>equalisation</b> was of particular importance in the drafting of the new Iraqi constitution.

40|$|Given the {{possible}} effective economic roles that sub-central governments can perform, i. e., those of Allocation and Distribution. This {{study examined the}} extent of fiscal decentralisation in Nigeria, {{with a view to}} seeing the relative degree of autonomy of the states. This autonomy is seen as a strong basis for allowing the states to undertake the two responsibilities effectively if the fiscal capacities, costs and needs of these jurisdictions are equalised. However, before seeing whether equalisation is feasible using grants, we runned a series of regressions to find out whether the tool for equalisation (which in this case is the country's statutory allocation) has an impact on state government expenditures. The results obtained showed that whilst there was an increasing trend towards fiscal decentralisation it was never-the-less not uniform over time. In consideration of the factors that affect the decentralisation drive we found the grant variable to be quite significant, implying that States independence is among others a function of grants from the Federal Government. Further it was found that grants (in this case only statutory allocation) are quite significant in the factors that affect State expenditures. Hence this suggest that <b>fiscal</b> capacity <b>equalisation</b> based on costs/needs can be effected by the States using federal grants. So ultimately we developed a model to show the extent of <b>fiscal</b> capacity <b>equalisation</b> undertaken using federal transfers, aimed at reducing horizontal fiscal imbalance. Deviations were found between the use of the formula for disbursements to states based on the fiscal capacity and needs/costs of each state, and the actual/estimated disbursements existing at present, suggesting that the problem of horizontal fiscal imbalance is not effectively tackled. This we hope will be remedied by the policy recommendations put forward...|$|R

50|$|Australia has {{a formal}} {{horizontal}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> (HFE) scheme, introduced in 1933, which distribute more funds to States and territories {{which have a}} lower capacity to raise revenue or have a greater cost burden, to enable each State and territory to {{have the capacity to}} provide services and the associated infrastructure at the same standard, if each made the same effort to raise revenue from its own sources and operated at the same level of efficiency.|$|E
40|$|The 36, 600 French communes are {{far from}} able to offer their {{residents}} and businesses {{the same level of}} local public services for a given tax burden. Tax wealth is concentrated in a small number of communes while the costs of providing services differ considerably from one commune to the next. The purpose of the regional equalisation policy is to smooth out these disparities. It concerns an annual sum of approximately ¬ 20 billion in transfers. The 2003 constitutional reform, which set a target for the system to move towards greater equality, steps up the need for an evaluation of equalisation today. A preliminary overall and commune-by-commune evaluation is presented here. The overall analysis shows that the equalisation mechanisms are relatively effective and that this effectiveness increases over time.

50|$|Australia {{also has}} a {{horizontal}} fiscal imbalance, which arises because state and territory governments have different abilities to raise revenue from their tax bases and because their respective costs of providing public services differ.

When the Commonwealth transfers funds to states and territories, it does not give each State a fixed amount or an amount proportional to the state's population relative to other states.

40|$|This article theorises the {{territorial}} solidarity and fiscal federalism and compares Switzerland with the European Union. While inter-territorial solidarity {{is a prerequisite}} for legitimate <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation,</b> such equalisation in turn also contributes to the legitimacy of and solidarity within federal political systems. By cutting across territorial and ethno-national communities, fiscal transfers often contribute to both a “civic” sense of belonging and a “cosmopolitan” identity. After placing types and degrees of (inter-) territorial solidarity at the heart of our conceptual perspective, we discuss the effects of such solidarity through an analysis of two different forms of “federal” equalisation. Comparing the recently reformed Swiss <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> system with the EU structural funds allows us to infer if, and how, the fiscal dimension of federalism matters for feelings of solidarity, reciprocity, unity and, ultimately, for the legitimacy of the very (nation-state or Union) structures that are to contribute to the ever-growing prosperity and happiness of their people(s). In Switzerland, a civic understanding of nationhood and cross-cutting cleavages were necessary conditions for extensive, effective and legitimate <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation.</b> We infer that, for the EU, this means that strengthening the equalisation component of the structural funds would contribute to an ever closer Union in a political sense: because <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> and inter-territorial solidarity are interdependent, reinforcing the one also means cementing the other.

40|$|By Hansjörg Blöchliger and Claire Charbit <b>Fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> is a {{transfer}} of fiscal resources across jurisdictions to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2. 5 % of GDP or 5 % of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average and in some countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70 % of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an equalisation fund. The equalisation rate is generally higher for jurisdictions with low fiscal capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than revenue equalisation in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes {{at the cost of}} sub-central budget needs. <b>Fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> is very country specific, and data and analysis must be taken with care. ...|$|E
40|$|No {{detailed}} analysis of the fiscal and economic inequalities of local units (at the municipality and city level) in Croatia has ever been published.

However, {{at the same time the}} fiscal capacities have not been properly calculated, because during the definition of the criteria for horizontal <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> no care has been paid to the economic inequalities nor has there been proper establishment of the way local units belong to a special financing system. The paper, then, tests out the hypothesis that the existing Croatian model of horizontal <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> is ineffective, for the Government and the Finance Ministry do not, with their poorly targeted financial instruments (personal income tax sharing, current grants and personal income tax refunds), manage to bring about palliation of the differences among the fiscal capacities of the local units, on the contrary, they tend to increase them. <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation,</b> tax sharing, personal income tax, personal income, tax refund, fiscal capacity, Croatia...|$|E
40|$|In Western economies, the {{concrete}} design of fiscal federalism {{is determined by}} the status the federation grants to regionally comparable economic and social conditions, and to what extent this status is anchored in the constitution. If the political and social acceptance of regional differences is high, the significance of regional equalisation is low and vice versa. In the case of great regional differences <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation</b> could be overburdened by the task of reducing fiscal strength. Moreover, if the political and social acceptance is lacking, regional policy interventions of the federal level is appropriate to support the regional economic convergence rather than <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation.</b> However, in high-performing economies organized as federations, comparably weak institutions such as those in Russia are largely unknown.

The view is widespread that moving towards a 'fiscal union' would have a stabilising effect in the event of macroeconomic shocks. In this paper we study the economic effects of introducing two elements of a fiscal union: Firstly, an EU-wide tax and transfer system and secondly, an EU-wide system of <b>fiscal</b> <b>equalisation.</b> Using the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD, we exploit representative household micro data from 11 Eurozone countries to simulate these policy reforms and to study their effects on the distribution of income as well as their impact on automatic fiscal stabilisers.

These effects depend on income levels and the structures of the existing national tax and transfer systems. The EU system would improve fiscal stabilisation especially in credit constrained countries. It would absorb between 10 and 15 per cent of a macroeconomic income shock.
