25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

However, she was critical of the book's initial chapters about Bay City's people and the interviews that Simone conducted, finding them to be not [...] "meaningful enough to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> attention". Fry also found the author's method of talking about her own musical aspects to be distracting, when {{she should have been}} analyzing the work of Madonna.|$|E

We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> heads high because of that.

500|$|While Amusement Vision was {{responsible}} for most of the game's development, Nintendo EAD employees Shigeru Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura took on the role of producer and supervisor, respectively. Sega handled planning and execution and Nintendo {{was responsible}} for supervision of their product. Nagoshi was initially concerned about differences in opinion between the two companies, and mentioned [...] "If Nintendo planned to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> hands through development, I would have suggested they develop the game themselves. That way we could focus on a project which would reflect our studio's abilities. I figured that would cause a war, but I was told most of the responsibility would be left to us." [...] Miyamoto thought the collaboration resulted in a [...] "true evolution of the F-Zero series", enhancing the simulation of racing at high speeds and expanding the [...] "F-Zero world on a grand scale." [...] Published by Nintendo, F-Zero GX was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, in North America on August 25, 2003, and in PAL regions on October 31, 2003. The Arcade version was released in 2003 alongside its Gamecube counterpart.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Dunn, Willkie's {{mission was}} to be Roosevelt's {{personal}} representative, [...] "demonstrating American unity, gathering information, and discussing with key heads of state plans for the postwar future". After leaving the U.S. on August 26, Willkie's first stop was in North Africa, where he met General Montgomery and toured the front at El Alamein. In Beirut, he stayed with General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French. In Jerusalem, Willkie met with Jews and Arabs, told the British rulers of Palestine that both peoples should {{be brought into the}} government, and he later wrote that the conflict there was so ancient, it was unrealistic to think that it could [...] "be solved by good will and simple honesty". Willkie had been moved to add the Soviet Union to his itinerary when three Western reporters there urged him by telegram to do so. There, he met with Stalin, and upon his return he advocated more liberal Lend-Lease terms for the USSR. In China, Willkie was hosted by Chiang Kai-shek and was fascinated by Madame Chiang. Willkie was taken to the front in order to observe the Chinese military forces in their fight against the Japanese, and he spoke out against colonialism, in China and elsewhere. [...] His statements were reported widely in Britain, angering Churchill, who responded by saying, [...] "We mean to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> own. I have not become the King's First Minister in order to preside over the liquidation of the British Empire." ...|$|E

500|$|Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on eight reviews. David Jeffries of Allmusic opined that [...] "the too-pop [...] now feels more balanced once this eight-track EP worth of material tips the scales", {{adding that the}} additional tracks and DVD is [...] "the better deal and bigger picture" [...] than the original. Dan Weiss of the Boston Phoenix complimented Minaj's rapping, commenting that [...] "the rapper who rhymes [...] "fri-vo-lous" [...] with [...] "po-ly-ga-mist" [...] is X-Acto sharp as ever". The Los Angeles Times Gerrick D. Kennedy noted the variety of genres incorporated in the reissue, stating [...] "Sure, she flirts with dance pop and R balladry, but you can forgive her for wanting to satisfy different tastes. Here, it actually works". Andy Gill of The Independent provided a mixed review, feeling that the material was generic and [...] "does not add much to the Minaj experience". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrical content and featured guests, adding that [...] "as long as [...] keeps comparing herself to Jesus, we probably shouldn't <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> breath". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly placed the album at number two on his list of The Worst Albums Of The Year, writing that the album was [...] "soul-less, lazy, and totally unnecessary." ...|$|E

2500|$|A for Andromeda {{met with}} a varied {{critical}} reception. [...] "Science fiction serial starts well", said The Times after the broadcast of the first episode, adding, [...] "Although it is encouraging to have the authority of Professor Fred Hoyle for the scientific credibility of ... it is the skill of Mr Hoyle the novelist that will mainly {{be called upon to}} <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> attention". The Evening News, meanwhile declared the serial to be [...] "a jolly good successor to Quatermass". Not so impressed was L. Marsland Gander in the Daily Telegraph who wrote, [...] "As a devotee of Prof. Hoyle and a keen student of disembodied intelligence I felt impatient... I am too well acquainted with [...] work to be disappointed, but the temptation is great". A harsher verdict came from Philip Phillips of the Daily Herald who said, [...] "The next six episodes might be brilliant. But I won't be watching them" [...] while The Sunday Times said, [...] "I cannot with the best will find anything in the least exciting about A for Andromeda".|$|E
2500|$|A {{major problem}} in the {{managing}} of the Luftwaffe was Göring; Hitler believed the Luftwaffe was [...] "the most effective strategic weapon", and in reply to repeated requests from the Kriegsmarine for control over aircraft insisted, [...] "We {{should never have been}} able to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> own in this war if we had not had an undivided Luftwaffe." [...] Such principles made it much harder to integrate the air force into the overall strategy and produced in Göring a jealous and damaging defence of his [...] "empire" [...] while removing Hitler voluntarily from the systematic direction of the Luftwaffe at either the strategic or operational level. When Hitler tried to intervene more in the running of the air force later in the war, he was faced with a political conflict of his own making between himself and Göring, which was not fully resolved until the war was almost over. In 1940 and 1941, Göring's refusal to co-operate with the Kriegsmarine denied the entire Wehrmacht military forces of the Reich the chance to strangle British sea communications, which might have had strategic or decisive effect in the war against the British Empire.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. The Ninth Gate holds a 41% rating at Rotten Tomatoes and a metascore of 44 on Metacritic. Most movie reviewers {{said that}} the suspense in The Ninth Gate was {{less than that of}} Rosemary's Baby (1968), director Polanski's famous supernatural-themed film. Roger Ebert said the ending was lackluster, [...] "while at the end, I didn't yearn for spectacular special effects, I did wish for spectacular information — something awesome, not just a fade-to-white". In his review for The New York Times, Elvis Mitchell said the movie was [...] "about as scary as a sock-puppet re-enactment of The Blair Witch Project, and not nearly as funny". Entertainment Weekly rated the film [...] "D+", and Lisa Schwarzbaum said it had an [...] "aroma of middle-brow, art-house Euro-rot, a whiff of decay and hauteur in a film not even a star as foxed, and foxy, as Johnny Depp, himself, could save". In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan said the film was [...] "too laid-back, and unconcerned about the pacing of its story to be satisfying", because [...] "a thriller that's not high-powered, is an intriguing concept, in reality it can <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> attention for only so long". In the Village Voice, J. Hoberman said the film was [...] "barely releasable hokum, stuffed with cheesy blah-blah". European reviews were generally more attentive and praised the film's fine pace and irony.|$|E
2500|$|Following his win in Hong Kong A Shin Hikari {{was off the}} racecourse for {{six months}} before being sent to France for the Prix d'Ispahan on 24 May. The race was run at Chantilly Racecourse as its usual venue, Longchamp, was being redeveloped. He was made the 7.4/1 fourth choice behind New Bay, Dariyan (Prix Ganay) and Vadamos (Prix du Muguet) whilst the other five runners {{included}} the Grand Prix de Paris winner Erupt. Racing on heavy ground he settled in second place behind Vadamos {{before going to the}} front 400 metres from the finish. He drew further and further away from his rivals in the straight and crossed the line ten lengths clear of Dariyan. After the race Sakaguchi said [...] "I had imagined he would jump to the front and lead the race, so I was surprised, but it was good judgement by Yutaka to run him a bit away from the rail where the ground was not as bad. It was great to see that he could settle and race from second place, as well as win with that style. We can now proudly <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> heads high and go to England for the Royal Ascot meeting". Bookmakers responded by making the horse favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes. In the June 2016 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings A Shin Hikari was rated the best horse in the world, three pounds ahead of California Chrome and Winx.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Cherrete of Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy {{said the}} video {{lived up to}} the [...] "energy" [...] and [...] "power" [...] of the track, commenting that it {{contained}} the [...] "most inspiring and awesome youth power dancing, hair whipping and floor stomping that you're going to see all day". Matt Donnelly of The Los Angeles Times said with the release, the singer [...] "introduces to us a pre-preteen firecracker who lives up to her impeccable breeding and perhaps takes the legacy one step further". Admitting she originally dismissed the song and a video concept, due to her quick rise to fame and the oversexualized image of pop music already, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "his clip is about to put a boom in the chiropracting industry (with possible ancillary benefits for housepaint), because girl can snap it." [...] Billy Johnson, Jr. of Yahoo! Music said among the many dancers in the clip, Smith [...] "shines as the clear breakout star", calling the video a [...] "smash", and commenting [...] "she pulls it off without need for cameo appearances from her famous parents." [...] Veronica Miller of NPR that it wasn't the hairstyles that made the clip, but [...] "the sheer fearlessness with which young Willow is singing, dancing and whipping", stating she has [...] "just enough sass and pluck and confidence to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> attention and leave us wanting more".

2500|$|Because the Internet {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 26 reviews. Writing for The Boston Globe, Franklin Soults said, [...] "Love Donald Glover or hate him, this writer/actor/comedian/rapper unquestionably ranks among America's most accomplished performers. [...] The production is {{as rich as}} the raps, spanning pop, underground R, club music, and psychedelic experimentation. The project is further heightened by Glover's knowing irony, his gift for hooks, and his visionary theme. Without making it a burdensome concept to explain and belabor, the Internet figures prominently throughout the disc in ways empowering and emasculating." [...] Killian Fox, writing for The Observer, said, [...] "Glover reflects on some unsettling phenomena of our internet-addled age, such as the 3D printing of guns – and his restless delivery is matched by jerky, off-kilter production. The results are intriguing, occasionally frustrating, rarely boring." [...] Jabbari Weekes of Exclaim! said, [...] "Because the Internet is a vast improvement over his debut effort, showcasing an artist who has confidently {{found a way to}} coalesce his love for music and films into one hybrid effort." [...] Christian Lee of HipHopDX said, [...] "He raps because, well, he can. Most of all, in his ambitious second album Because The Internet, he raps as if to pass the time. Anxious introverts may recognize what Childish Gambino does here, repeatedly: flit around, try to be sociable, but then flee. Childish Gambino still manages to mostly <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> attention, though, because he concerns himself instead with his own terms." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "Connecting with the album is nearly impossible, understanding it is difficult, and often enough, its inflated ego is irksome, but Because the Internet is too free and fascinating to be dragged down by these complaints, so if a Yeezus with more flash and fun is what's required, Gambino's got the good stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, {{said that}} the Supreme Court has never ruled that {{companies}} have religious beliefs and that [...] "it has never held that religious exercise provides a license to harm others, or violate the rights of third parties." [...] Louise Melling, ACLU deputy legal director, said religious freedom [...] "gives us all the right to <b>hold</b> <b>our</b> beliefs, but it doesn't give {{you the right to}} impose your beliefs on others, to discriminate against others." [...] The editorial board of The New York Times wrote that the decision [...] "swept aside accepted principles of corporate law and religious liberty to grant owners of closely held, for-profit companies an unprecedented right to impose their religious views on employees." [...] A Fox News columnist wrote, [...] "..., with all of the debate about the religious beliefs of the Hobby Lobby owners, what about the religious beliefs of their employees? They are just as important, and should not be trampled upon." [...] The director of the United Church of Christ's Washington, D.C. office, {{said that the}} ruling [...] "may embolden private employers to claim religious objections to particular health care services, in effect forcing their own religious views upon their employees." [...] Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, [...] "It's the first time that our court has said that a closely held corporation has the rights of a person when it comes to religious freedom, which means that the ... corporation's employers can impose their religious beliefs on their employees." [...] The Center for American Progress said that the ruling [...] "moves in the direction this court has been moving already, which is talking about corporate personhood—really treating corporations like people, saying that the corporation has a religion itself and that should be imposed on its employees." [...] Interfaith Alliance leader Rev. Welton Gaddy said, [...] "The First Amendment is at its best when it is used {{to protect the rights of}} minorities from the whims of the powerful. Today's decision, which gives the powerful the right to force their religious beliefs on those around them, is a far cry from the best traditions of religious freedom." ...|$|E
