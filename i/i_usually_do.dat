500|$|Initial {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Artpop {{coincided with the}} Born This Way Ball. Zedd was {{not happy with the}} initial outcome of the recordings and so he suggested Gaga to re-do the whole process. Gaga's idea of recording the songs with Zedd was to not limit themselves with the intention of creating a staple radio hit, instead be creative in whichever way they wanted. He explained to Rolling Stone that they did not [...] "try to make an EDM album — but, at the same time, we didn't try not to make an EDM album. I've done a lot of stuff that's really outside of what <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do.</b> There was one song that started from her just giving me, like, 10 words to describe an emotion, and then I had to make this into music. It's been a very experimental way of approaching music." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do,</b> which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E

You are well and happy, my dear? You look so.’ ...|$|E

Now----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seemed to}} {{hesitate}} {{for a moment}} or two as if in thought whether he should speak or not, and then to suddenly make up his mind to speak, for he added: 'I stayed in town the whole of that day, and only drove back to Brockelsby late in the evening. I had some business to transact, and put up at the Grand, as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do,</b> and dined with some friends.' ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{forgotten}} to draw my curtain, which <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did,</b> and also to let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking {{in the dead of}} night, I opened my eyes on her disk--silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.|$|R

[...] "I am degenerating, Ffoulkes--that's what it is. Pay no heed to it. I suppose that carrying that sleeping child in my arms last night softened some nerves in my body. I was so infinitely sorry for the poor mite, and vaguely wondered if I had not saved it from one misery only to plunge it in another. There was such a fateful look on that wan little face, as if destiny had already writ its veto there against happiness. It came on me then how futile were our actions, if God chooses to interpose His will between us and our desires." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{that was}} no small make-weight to our disasters, after all. I sighted her for six days' sail from the American coast: but ere we could lay her aboard it fell dead calm. Never a boat had I on board--they were all lost in a gale of wind--and the other ships were {{becalmed}} two leagues astern of me. There was no use lying there and pounding her till she sank; so I called the carpenter, got up all the old chests, and with them and some spars we floated ourselves alongside, and only just in time. For the last of us had hardly scrambled up into the chains, when our crazy Noah's ark went all aboard, and sank at the side, so {{that if we had}} been minded to run away, Amyas, we could not; whereon, judging valor to be the better part of discretion (as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do),</b> we fell to with our swords and had her in five minutes, and fifty thousand pounds' worth in her, which set up my purse again, and Raleigh's too, though I fear it has run out again since as fast as it ran in." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} {{setting-out}} {{of the city}} is half the game. Then you devise incidents. As I wanted to photograph the particular set-out for the purpose of illustrating this account, I took a larger share in the arrangement than <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do.</b> It was necessary to get everything into the picture, to ensure a light background that would throw up some of the trees, prevent too much overlapping, and things like that. When the photographing was over, matters became more normal. I left the schoolroom, and when I returned I found that the group of riflemen which had been converging on the publichouse had been sharply recalled to duty, and were trotting in a disciplined, cheerless way towards the railway station. The elephant had escaped from the zoo into the Blue Ward, and was being marched along by a military patrol. The originally scattered boy scouts were being paraded. G. P. W. had demolished the shop of the Jokil Company, and was building a Red End station near the bend. The stock of the Jokil Company had passed {{into the hands of the}} adjacent storekeepers. Then the town hall ceremonies came to an end and the guard marched off. Then G. P. W. demolished the rifle-range, and ran a small branch of the urban railway uphill to the town hall door, and on into the zoological gardens. This was only the beginning of a period of enterprise in transit, a small railway boom. A number of halts of simple construction sprang up. There was much making of railway tickets, of a size that enabled passengers to stick their heads through the middle and wear them as a Mexican does his blanket. Then a battery of artillery turned up in the High Street and there was talk of fortifications. Suppose wild Indians were to turn up across the plains to the left and attack the town! Fate still has toy drawers untouched...|$|E
60|$|I {{was there}}, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I {{was there at}} night, I {{generally}} went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home together. One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock. I could not leave, as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did,</b> quite punctually at the time, for I was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to finish what I was about; but it was {{within a few minutes}} of the hour when I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss for the night, and hurried downstairs. Mr. Woodcourt went with me, as it was dusk.|$|R

6000|$|... 19. I went to-day {{into the}} City, {{but in a}} coach, and sossed(9) up my leg on the seat; and as I came home, I went to see poor Charles Barnard's(10) books, which are to be sold by auction, and I itch to lay out nine or ten pounds for some fine editions of fine authors. But 'tis too far, and I shall let it slip, as <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> all such opportunities. I dined in a coffee-house with Stratford upon chops {{and some of his}} wine. Where did MD dine? Why, poor MD dined at home to-day, because of the Archbishop, and they could not go abroad, and had a breast of mutton and a pint of wine. I hope Mrs. Walls mends; and pray give me an account what sort of godfather I made, and whether I behaved myself handsomely. The Duke of Argyle is gone; and whether he has my memorial, I know not, till I see Dr. Arbuthnot,(11) to whom I gave it. That hard name belongs to a Scotch doctor, an {{acquaintance}} of the Duke's and me; Stella can't pronounce it. Oh that we were at Laracor this fine day! the willows begin to peep, and the quicks to bud. My dream is out: I was a-dreamed last night that I ate ripe cherries.--And now they begin to catch the pikes, and will shortly the trouts (pox on these Ministers!)--and I would fain know whether the floods were ever so high as to get over the holly bank or the river walk; if so, then all my pikes are gone; but I hope not. Why don't you ask Parvisol these things, sirrahs? And then my canal, and trouts, and whether the bottom be fine and clear? But harkee, ought not Parvisol to pay in my last year's rents and arrears out of his hands? I am thinking, if either of you have heads to take his accounts, it should be paid in to you; otherwise to Mr. Walls. I will write an order on t'other side; and do as you will. Here's a world of business; but I must go sleep, I'm drowsy; and so goodnight, etc.|$|E

5000|$|I {{was sitting}} at my piano thinkin about holy music. I poked around for some simple but moving chords. Later I sat down and wrote Our Prayer in sections.

40|$|Grading is {{important}} to ensure the production of high-quality foods, but It <b>Is</b> <b>usually</b> <b>done</b> with error, distorting market signals and diminishing Incentives to produce high-quality products. Size is the main quality criterion for dried prunes and the crucial characteristic In determining prune value. We studied the economic effects of errors In commodity grading, focusing In particular on the Implications of one-way (asymmetric) grading errors, namely when small, low quality product Is erroneously classified as high quality, but not vice versa. In an application to the California prune Industry, we estimated {{the extent to which}} large prunes are undervalued and small prunes are overvalued. We conclude that grading error means that prunes graded as high-quality may not really be high-quality prunes. The presence of these Incorrectly graded prunes depresses the prices that growers are paid for high-quality prunes and increases the net returns for small prunes. As a result, growers face reduced incentives to produce larger prunes...|$|R
5000|$|Cash himself, in his 1997 book Cash: The Autobiography commented, [...] "I {{was there}} - I {{was the first}} to arrive and the last to leave, {{contrary}} to what has been written - but I was just there to watch Carl record, which he did until mid-afternoon, when Elvis came in with his girlfriend. At that point the session stopped and we all started laughing and cutting up together. Then Elvis sat down at the piano, and we started singing gospel songs we all knew, then some Bill Monroe songs. Elvis wanted to hear songs Bill had written besides [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", and I knew the whole repertoire. So, again contrary to what some people have written, my voice is on the tape. It's not obvious, because I was farthest away from the mic and I was singing a lot higher than <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> in order to stay in key with Elvis, but I guarantee you, I'm there." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea came}} from Courtney and his {{frustration}} with organized religion. Both Link {{and he wrote}} the show, and appeared in it as well. Courtney said of the show, [...] "I was walking through Central Park, and the whole show just sort of came to me on that 20-minute walk. <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> the concept and {{the book and the}} lyrics, and Peter did the music. So I hit him with the idea and he was hot to do that. In fact, he probably was more anxious to do it than I was...He's very productive. So I said let's do it, and I started working on the lyrics and giving them to him as fast as I could. So it became, in effect, well, the plot is pretty much my life story." [...] Both were actors looking for the next thing. Courtney was appearing on the NBC daytime drama The Doctors. At the same time, Link was on the CBS daytime drama As the World Turns as the pot-smoking, troubled Tom Hughes. Afterwards, Link would join Hair and replace Gerome Ragni as Berger.|$|R

He has often told me gravely of having seen the Seven Whistlers, and the Hounds as here described. Among the groves of Coleorton, where I became familiar with the habits and notions of old Mitchell, there was also a labourer of whom, I regret, I had no personal knowledge; for, more than forty years after, when he was become an old man, I learned that while I was composing verses, which <b>I</b> <b>usually</b> <b>did</b> aloud, he took much pleasure, unknown to me, in following my steps that he might catch the words I uttered; and, what is not a little remarkable, several lines caught in this way kept their place in his memory.

40|$|The {{power output}} of {{photovoltaic}} systems (PVS) increases {{with the use}} of effective and efficient solar tracking techniques. However, current techniques suffer from several drawbacks in their tracking policy: (<b>i)</b> they <b>usually</b> <b>do</b> not consider the forecasted or prevailing weather conditions; even when they do, they (ii) rely on complex closed-loop controllers and sophisticated instruments; and (iii) typically, they do not take the energy consumption of the trackers into account. In this paper, we propose a policy iteration method (along with specialized variants), which is able to calculate near-optimal trajectories for effective and efficient day-ahead solar tracking, based on weather forecasts coming from online providers. To account for the energy needs of the tracking system, the technique employs a novel and generic consumption model. Our simulations show that the proposed methods can increase the power output of a PVS considerably, when compared to standard solar tracking techniques...|$|R
