5|$|In 738, Quiriguá, a vassal of Copán, Tikal's key {{ally in the}} south, {{switched}} {{allegiance to}} Calakmul, defeated Copán and gained its own independence. It appears {{that this was a}} conscious <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset {{the balance of power in}} the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Copán.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{campaigned on}} the {{platform}} that Eisenhower was weak on defense {{and that he was}} not doing enough to solve the looming missile gap. After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the {{services}} of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company did, at times, take some <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the residents. For example, in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the jetty {{was replaced by a}} stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
50|$|Lobbying <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Consol {{have also}} been an issue of controversy. In {{the first quarter of}} 2010, Consol spent $1.02 million in {{lobbying}} expenses on issues relating to the coal mining and natural gas industries.|$|R

5|$|The Christian {{conversion}} of the Merina royal court in 1869 spurred the arrival of Merina missionaries in Sihanaka country and the {{conversion of}} {{a significant portion of}} the population. Following the French capture of the Merina capital in 1895, Christianity was largely abandoned in Sihanaka and traditional religious beliefs regained preeminence; at least one major historic church in the area was burned. French Catholic missionaries arrived in the area around 1900 and gradually began converting members of local communities. This was soon followed by a renewed <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Protestant missionaries, leading to further conversions. Today, traditional beliefs remain strong among the Sihanaka, although a growing number practice orthodox Christianity or a syncretic form that incorporates aspects of traditional respect for ancestors and their norms.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Peninsula was not {{the only}} region from which Napoleon took art. Under the Directory {{government}} of the 1790s, Napoleon (then a General) led an expedition to Egypt. The campaign was an expansionist <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the government, but the Directory had another goal to make Paris the center of art, science, and culture. The Directory wanted France to assume responsibility for liberating the works of art they deemed in danger in order to protect and nationalize the heritage and culture of their subjects. As a result, there were teams of artists and scientists who accompanied the armies into battle equipped with lists of paintings, sculptures, and other pieces of patrimony that would be collected, crated, and shipped back to France.|$|E
5|$|The {{late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century demand for coffee and rubber led to Brazil's coffee economy and rubber boom. At the time, it was {{estimated}} that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, Minas Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years. Simultaneously, there was an <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, {{the main}} {{function}} of the experiences given to the disciple {{at the time of}} initiation is to convince the disciple there is something worth seeking inside—i.e., that the Master's instructions are worth pursuing. If something is provided initially, without any <b>effort</b> at all <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> disciple, a free sample as it were—then more will surely be available in the future with some <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> meditator.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Portugal {{to prevent}} their {{commercial}} contacts failed, and Vili communities could be found all over Kongo and Ndongo-Matamba as well as neighboring regions between them. In addition to buying and selling slaves, the Vili became involved in local industry, specializing in smithing.|$|R
5|$|Bethe {{arrived in}} the United States in February 1935, and joined the faculty at Cornell University on a salary of $3,000. Bethe's {{appointment}} {{was part of a}} deliberate <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the new head of its physics department, Roswell Clifton Gibbs, to move into nuclear physics. Gibbs had hired Stanley Livingston, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence, to build a cyclotron at Cornell. To complete the team, Cornell needed an experimentalist, and, on the advice of Bethe and Livingston, recruited Robert Bacher. Bethe received requests to visit Columbia University from Isidor Isaac Rabi, Princeton University from Edward Condon, University of Rochester from Lee DuBridge, Purdue University from Karl Lark-Horovitz, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from Francis Wheeler Loomis, and Harvard University from John Hasbrouck Van Vleck. Gibbs moved to prevent Bethe from being poached by having him appointed as a regular assistant professor in 1936, with an assurance that promotion to professor would soon follow.|$|E
25|$|Sign {{language}} interpreting involves considerable <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the interpreter, since sign {{languages are}} distinct natural languages {{with their own}} construction, semantics and syntax, different from the aural {{version of the same}} principal language.|$|E
25|$|Services, {{including}} {{government and}} military expenditures, {{account for about}} one-fourth of Morocco's GDP. Government spending accounts for fully half of the service economy, despite an ongoing <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{of the government to}} sell much of its assets to private concerns. Since the mid-1980s tourism and associated services have been an increasingly significant sector of the Moroccan economy and by the late 1990s had become Morocco's largest source of foreign currency.|$|E

25|$|Time for {{the match}} expires without a result being reached. This usually {{occurs at the}} end of the last day of the match. The result is a draw: there is no winner, no matter how {{superior}} the position of one of the sides. Rain causing a loss of playing time is a common factor in drawn matches, although matches may be drawn even without interference from the weather: usually as a result of poor time management or an intentional <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of one team to avoid losing.|$|E
25|$|Such is {{the system}} in outline. The {{historical}} position of the system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned {{in the form of}} infinite or absolute cause is but a mere unrealizable tentative or <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of and something different from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.|$|E
25|$|The iPod Shuffle was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the Mac Mini. Like the iPod Shuffle, the Mac Mini is a scaled-down product which has been introduced at a lower price. These two products together can be seen as a conscious <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Apple management to target a lower-end market and increase visibility in the mass-market. Previously, the success of Apple's iPod and especially the iPod Mini had been chipping away at the inexpensive flash player market, causing flash players at the beginning of 2005 to account for less than half the market share they did in 2004. However, the original and Mini iPods were expensive and the Shuffle was intended to make the iPod compete with mainstream players.|$|E

The notion that I would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous.|$|R

50|$|For {{the next}} five years, Thomaston {{actively}} supported the war effort in Vietnam, conducted troop and cargo lifts, and participated in amphibious operations. The tide of war, however, was running against the South Vietnamese; and, {{by the spring of}} 1975, concentrated <b>efforts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops put pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crumbling South Vietnamese government.|$|R
25|$|Carlos Finlay, a Cuban {{doctor and}} scientist, {{proposed}} in 1881 that yellow fever might be transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct human contact. Since the losses from yellow fever in the Spanish–American War in the 1890s were extremely high, Army doctors began research experiments {{with a team}} led by Walter Reed, composed of doctors James Carroll, Aristides Agramonte, and Jesse William Lazear. They successfully proved Finlay's ″mosquito hypothesis″. Yellow fever was the first virus shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes. The physician William Gorgas applied these insights and eradicated yellow fever from Havana. He also campaigned against yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal, after a previous <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the French failed (in part due to mortality from the high incidence of yellow fever and malaria, which killed many workers).|$|E
25|$|DeLay's {{involvement}} with the lobbying industry included a pointed <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the Republican Party to parlay the Congressional majority into dominance of K Street, the lobbying district of Washington, D.C. DeLay, Senator Rick Santorum, and Grover Norquist launched a campaign in 1995 encouraging lobbying firms to retain only Republican officials in top positions. Firms that had Democrats in positions of authority, DeLay suggested, would not be granted the ear of majority party members. In 1999, DeLay was privately reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee after he pulled an intellectual property rights bill off the House floor when the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) hired a former Democratic Congressman, Dave McCurdy. Firms initially responded to the campaign, but it waned during 2004, when the possibility of Senator John Kerry's winning the presidency gave lobbying firms some incentive to hire Democrats.|$|E
25|$|After the 1989 {{attack on}} La Tablada Regiment, sixteen {{members of the}} MTP (Movimiento Todos por la Patria) were {{sentenced to life in}} prison, and a few others were given shorter sentences, ranging from ten to twenty years in 1989. Many of them, {{including}} Antonio Puigjané, a Franciscan Monk wrongfully accused of participating in the attacks, were placed in maximum security cells on the 18th floor of Caseros. Despite six years of <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Amnesty International, and other human rights groups, Puigjané was held for ten years in Caseros, before being put under house arrest when he turned seventy (an Argentine law allows for prisoners over the age of 70 to carry out the rest of their sentences under house arrest). In 2003, his sentence was finally commuted, after having served 14 years.|$|E

500|$|The main {{issues in}} the case were whether or not abridgements of a work {{inherently}} constituted copyright infringement, or whether they could qualify as a separate, new work. Lord Hartwicke ruled that abridgements fell under two categories: [...] "true abridgements" [...] and [...] "coloured shortenings". True abridgements presented a true <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the editor, and by this effort, constituted a new work which did not infringe upon the copyright of the original. Leaving it to literary and legal experts to decide, Hartwicke ruled that Modern Crown Law was not a true abridgement, but merely a duplication intending to circumvent the law.|$|E

Additional colonies were located in Pennsylvania and Delaware, one in Maryland, several in Virginia, three in Tennessee (1920–1930), two in Kentucky (1927–1932), and many in West Virginia (1921). In summarizing these discoveries in 1932, Wherry noted {{that many of the}} colonies were already known to local residents, who picked the berries for food, under names such as [...] "juniper-berry", [...] "ground-huckleberry", and [...] "bear-huckleberry". He called for more intensive <b>effort</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the scientific community to make use of such local knowledge in determining plant geography. More recently, a colony of box huckleberry was discovered in Durham County, North Carolina, the first report from that state, in 2003.|$|E
