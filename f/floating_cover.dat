40|$|Floating covers used in {{waste water}} {{treatment}} plants {{are one of the}} many structures formed with membrane materials. These structures are usually large and can spread over an area measuring 470 m × 170 m. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe recent work to develop an innovative and effective approach for structural health monitoring (SHM) of such large membrane-like infrastructure. This paper will propose a potentially cost-effective non-contact approach for full-field strain and stress mapping using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted with a digital camera and a global positioning system (GPS) tracker. The aim is to use the images acquired by the UAV to define the geometry of the <b>floating</b> <b>cover</b> using photogrammetry. In this manner, any changes in the geometry of the <b>floating</b> <b>cover</b> due to forces acting beneath resulting from its deployment and usage can be determined. The time-scale for these changes is in terms of weeks and months. The change in the geometry can be implemented as input conditions to a finite element model (FEM) for stress prediction. This will facilitate the determination of the state of distress of the <b>floating</b> <b>cover.</b> This paper investigates the possibility of using data recorded from a UAV to predict the strain level and assess the health of such structures. An investigation was first conducted on a laboratory sized membrane structure instrumented with strain gauges for comparison against strains, which were computed from 3 D scans of the membrane geometry. Upon validating the technique in the laboratory, it was applied to a more realistic scenario: an outdoor test membrane structure and capable UAV were constructed to see if the shape of the membrane could be computed. The membrane displacements were then used to calculate the membrane stress and strain, state demonstrating a new way to perform structural health monitoring on membrane structures...|$|E

As the earliest form of biogas digester, the round-shaped water-pressure biogas plant was once popular among farmers in China (He et al. 2013), and also welcomed by many developing countries with a name of “China-mode biogas” digester (Zeng et al. 2007). Recently other types of technology have been developed in various areas of China. Strong back-flow biogas digesters have been introduced in Jiangxi province. The meandering-distribution biogas digester is a major type of digester in Yunnan province.

The systems were designed to treat four kinds of wastewater: dairy wastewater (three systems, average inflow 4. 9 – 46. 6 m 3 d− 1, average inflow content 2400 – 5000 mg COD l− 1, 2 – 5 years of operation); wastewater from a pig farm, including liquid food washing wastewater (one system, 4. 1 m 3 d− 1, 9500 mg COD l− 1, 2 years of operation); wastewater from potato starch processing (one system, 5. 4 – 13. 3 m 3 d− 1, 24, 000 – 54, 000 mg COD l− 1, 2 years of operation); and wastewater containing pig farm swine urine (one system, 16. 9 m 3 d− 1, 10, 100 mg COD l− 1, 1 year operation). Our systems were composed of three to four vertical (V) flow beds with self-priming siphons and surface partitions and no or one horizontal (H) flow bed (total of three to five beds). In some V flow beds, treated effluents were recirculated (Vr) through the inlet to improve performance, mainly during the growing season. The total bed area was 168 – 2151 m 2. Mean annual temperature was 5 – 8 ◦C at all locations. To overcome clogging due to the high load in a cold climate, we applied a safety bypass structure and <b>floating</b> <b>cover</b> material (Supersol: lightweight porous glass) to the V flow beds. The safety bypass structure and <b>floating</b> <b>cover</b> material helped to prevent clogging and freezing and maintained dry conditions and abundant growth of reeds and earthworms. The average purification rates were 70 – 96 % for chemical oxygen demand (COD), 39 – 90 % for total nitrogen (TN), 36 – 82 % for NH 4 –N, and 70 – 93 % for total phosphorous (TP). Calculated average oxygen transfer rates (OTRs) were 16 – 99 g O 2 m− 2 d− 1. OTRs increased in proportion to influent load, and the OTR value was Vr > V > H. Recirculating the treated effluents was expected to enhance removal of nitrogen in V flow beds mainly {{by a combination of}} nitrification and denitrification.

40|$|A {{petrochemical}} plant producing {{terephthalic acid}} faced a saturation of its wastewater treatment facilities {{due to an}} increase in production. In fact, the plant has been growing in the last years, and the effluents have been treated by reproducing the original design of three aerobic tanks in series. However, due to lack of space, as well as energy consumption and sludge production reaching a certain level, the plant considered other options for coping with the new effluent flow and organic load. Based on the authors' previous experience with this wastewater, the consultant designed a process consisting of a modification of an existing pond, in order to add an anaerobic step previous to the aerobic tanks already in operation. The anaerobic pond is a three stage process, all included in the same adapted basin, with a distribution system in the bottom of each stage, that creates an upflow pattern. Terephthalic acid wastewater is a mixture of several organic acids, with different anaerobic degradation kinetics, acetic and benzoic acids being more rapidly removed; the staged design takes this into account. The first two stages have a plastic <b>floating</b> <b>cover</b> (5813 m 3 and 8719 m 3 volume, respectively), while the third one is a conventional UASB type reactor (6276 m 3 volume) with a gas-liquid-solid separation device on top.

There is an effluent recycling pump (510 m 3 /h) in order to control upflow velocities and eventual acidification problems in the first two stages. The reactor, seeded with anaerobically adapted waste sludge from the aerobic plant, is now under start up, with the expected performance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that over the summer months up to 50 % of the water stored in small farm dams may be lost to evaporation. Reducing this loss using dam covers therefore has the potential to significantly increase agricultural water use efficiency in Australia. A research project to investigate the performance of various different types of cover was commissioned by Queensland Natural Resources and Mines. This project has now been completed with useful knowledge gained as to the typical performances of various cover products. An outcome of the project has been increased public awareness of the potential for evaporation reduction on water storages. Significant interest has been shown by landholders, agencies and consultancy companies in this regard. The project involved the development of a novel experimental method to measure and record water depth to an accuracy of ± 1 mm using highly sensitive pressure transducers. Pressure Sensitive Transducer (PST) units were placed at a constant 30 cm height above the dam floor by a float-weight mechanism. The units were connected to dataloggers and the data was compared to weather station derived Penman-Monteith based estimates of evaporation. This enabled evaporation losses to be separated from seepage. The PST methodology confirmed that evaporation losses in small farm dams was typically 4 - 7 mm/day in summer rising to 10 mm/day when air temperatures exceeded 40 ° C. As a matter of interest, the analysis also revealed that Australian summer night-time evaporation due to heat advection effects could be as much as 10 - 20 % of the total daily evaporation. The PST analysis technique applied to covered dams revealed evaporation reduction performance figures of approximately 75 % for shadecloth covered dams, up to 95 % with dams covered with a properly functioning <b>floating</b> <b>cover,</b> and approximately 15 to 30 % with dams covered with a cetyl alcohol based chemical monolayer. Improving the performance of monolayers with improved application technology is currently the focus of evaporation research efforts at NCEA.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis {{was to develop}} a three dimensional (3 -D) algorithm that predicts temperature and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of an anaerobic pond, to calibrate and validate the mathematical model based on experimental data series collected by the candidate from a full-scale experimental anaerobic pond and finally, the utilization of the COD simulation model, as a predictive tool of the performance of modified design scenarios aiming to improve the anaerobic ponds COD removal. The computational hydrodynamic, biochemical and thermal energy model was developed on a specialized software environment of computational fluid dynamics (FLUENT), based on the numerical method of solving fluid mechanics equations according to the finite volume technique. The experimental anaerobic pond, from which data that was required for the computational model verification was collected, was a covered anaerobic pond part of a pilot-experimental station of municipal wastewater treatment with Natural Systems, designed by the National Agricultural Research Foundation (NAGREF), at Sindos in Thessaloniki, and operates since 1996. The experimental pond, which was covered with a <b>floating</b> <b>cover</b> made by geomembrane, operated on a batch flow mode supplied with pre-screened, untreated wastewater from the nearby municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant of Thessaloniki, Greece, at a flow rate of 150 m 3 /day. The time-dependent solution concerned a 13 th month period, similar to the period of experimental data collection. Boundary conditions of the model were incorporated by external sub-programs written in C++. The pre-processor GAMBIT was employed to develop the geometric model and mesh of the pond model. Numerical simulation was validated with temperature measurements and COD sample analyses, taken from the full scale experimental plant. The experimental job required for the verification of the simulating model was to accomplish temperature measurements and COD laboratory analyses from samples taken from the pond. In the initial stage, the temperature predictive model of the covered anaerobic pond was developed and validated, since it was the necessary base, for the COD model development. Boundary conditions included: · Ηourly mean ambient air temperature, · Mean monthly soil temperature profile, · Mean daily influent wastewater temperature and · Mean daily influent wastewater velocity The mean relative error of the simulated temperature data series, in comparison to the respective measured values (out of 164 temperature values), was 9. 34 % that is a strongly satisfactory result. In order to support the model validity and reliability of predicting the temperature field of an anaerobic pond, the temperature model was applied on a second similar experimental anaerobic pond, part of a wastewater treatment plant with Natural Systems at Meze of France, from which operational and performance results have been presented in the bibliography. The mean relative error was low as 7 %. It is thus confirmed, that the temperature simulation model of the experimental anaerobic pond, corresponds and describes well the natural process. ...|$|E

A research project took place from 2003 - 2005 to investigate the performance of various different types of cover. Outcomes from the Queensland Natural Resources and Mines commissioned project included important new knowledge regarding the field performance of various different types of cover, technology to accurately assess evaporation and seepage losses and increased public awareness of the potential for evaporation reduction on water storages. Significant interest has been shown by landholders, agencies and consultancy companies in developing this further. The project involved the development of a novel experimental method to measure and record water depth to an accuracy of ± 1 mm using highly accurate Pressure Sensitive Transducers (Craig et al 2005). PST units were placed at a constant 30 cm height above the dam floor by a float-weight mechanism. The units were connected to dataloggers and the data was compared to weather station derived Penman-Monteith based estimates of evaporation. This enabled evaporation losses to be separated from seepage, also a very significant loss of Australian farm water. The PST methodology confirmed that evaporation losses in small farm dams was typically 4 - 7 mm/day in summer rising to 10 mm/day when air temperatures exceeded 40 ° C. As a matter of interest, the analysis also revealed that Australian summer night-time evaporation due to heat advection effects could be as much as 10 - 20 % of the total daily evaporation. The PST analysis technique applied to covered dams revealed evaporation reduction performance figures of approximately 75 % for shadecloth covered dams, up to 95 % with dams covered with a properly functioning <b>floating</b> <b>cover,</b> and approximately 15 to 30 % with dams covered with a cetyl alcohol based chemical monolayer (Barnes, 1993). Optimising the performance of monolayers with improved application technology is currently the focus of evaporation research efforts at NCEA. The study has revealed that high evaporation savings are possible if physical covers are used on small farm dams less than 10 ha in size. Physical covers can still be used on dams larger than 10 ha in size, but may be prove economically impractical due to the high amounts of capital investment required. In the future, however, increasing cost of water may allow increasingly large sizes of dam to be covered. For the present, economic analyses have implied that chemical covers may represent the best option for evaporation control on large farm water storages. Future research is planned commencing in June 2006 {{with the support of the}} CRC for Irrigation Futures and collaboration with CRC for Polymers and Nylex Water Solutions, producers of WaterSavr, the cetyl alcohol based chemical monolayer. A new applicator for applying the monolayer has recently been developed which relies on a compressed air system for delivery of the powder just below the water surface. The instrument was successfully demonstrated for the first time in Australia at USQ Toowoomba in the presence of David Verlee (Vice President of Business Development, Water Savr Global Solutions Inc, Richmond, Canada and Greg Phillips, Northern Regional Manager, Nylex Corporation. The applicator has been trialed at Byrock (80 km south of Bourke, NSW) by Brendon Mason, Nylex Water Solutions. The research will focus upon developing computer assisted application technology which will relies upon visualisation of the chemical coverage on the water surface. Fundamental research will be carried out on the performance of chemical monolayers in terms of their spread and resistance to breakup, microbial and UV degradation. Preliminary investigations have indicated that the performance of cetyl alcohol based monolayers may be significantly enhanced with the addition of other chemicals, for example, poly vinyl stearate. PVS is a polymer with a comb-like structure which may enhance the resistance of the monolayer to wind stress (Barnes, 1993). The NCEA evaporation research team comprises Director Erik Schmidt, Ian Craig, Andrew Green and Michael Scobie. The project was funded by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines (NRM) through the Rural Water Use Efficiency Initiative (RWUEI). The project depended upon the cooperation of product suppliers including NetPro (shadecloth), Nylex Water Solutions (WaterSavr), Evaporation Control Systems (E-VapCap), Raftex, Ciba Speciality Chemicals, and site owners Moonrocks (St George), Cubbie Station (Dirranbandi), Renato Andreatta (Stanthorpe) and Peak Downs Shire Council (Capella) ...|$|E
