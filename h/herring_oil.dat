50|$|The Storm (I stormen), {{published}} in Norway in 1923 and in America in 1935, covers the later life, and eventually death, of Odin Setran. Odin and Ingri {{have been married}} for about twenty years now, and have had two sons, Anders and Per. Lauris and Astri, too, have two children: Arne and Peder. The two couples both live on Haaberg, which has been separated into thirds; Odin owns a third, and Lauris the other two-thirds, which he obtained through trickery. In the interval years between Odin Grows Up and this novel, Odin has started up a factory producing <b>herring</b> <b>oil,</b> which is owned in shares by several men in the parish. Facing things like labor strikes, dissatisfied shareholders, and the ambition of men like Lauris and Engelbert Olsen, Odin works to keep the factory on an even keel. At a meeting of the shareholders, Odin loses his place as the man in charge, replaced by Lauris. Lauris, however soon takes ill and Odin is forced to perform his old job anyway. Meanwhile, Bonsach Arnesen, Ingri's father, is given a management position at the factory, which he soon resigns due to fear that his past (he had served time in jail for a minor crime) would cause Ingri and Odin suffering. Meanwhile, Lauris and Engelbert work at a plot to discredit Odin {{in the eyes of the}} parish. Engelbert attempts to spread gossip about Ingri and her father, which ends in an encounter between him and Odin, in which Odin drives him into the sea. Engelbert washes up on shore the next day, where Lauris persuades him to flee the parish secretly, so that Lauris can charge Odin with murder. Meanwhile, a letter found by Mina of Segelsund upon the suicide of old Ola Haaberg reveals a minor crime of Lauris', which Mina eventually takes to the sheriff. Because of this, Astri is caught between her feelings of duty and love for Lauris, and her conscious which will not allow her to tell a lie. Astri ultimately decides to tell the truth, and because of this they are spared public embarrassment. In reaction to Lauris' rumors, Odin is determined to kill Lauris, and bides his time. Eventually Astri falls ill, and Odin asks Lauris to go across the fjord to get the doctor. Because of the violent storm, Lauris tries to get out of it, but Odin is insistent. The doctor declines due to the weather, and on the way back to Haaberg the boat is overturned. Odin and Lauris realize that the boat will now only hold one of them, and they fight for survival. Odin wins, and Lauris floats helplessly in the sea. But Odin changes his mind, telling himself that he will not be a murderer. He lets Lauris have the goat, and drifts away supported by the oars. Eventually Odin washes up on shore, having drowned in the storm. At the funeral ale, his friends and family draw two conclusions: firstly, that by giving up his life to save his enemy, Odin had won a victory over Lauris; and secondly, that Lauris had become a different person after the ordeal. The series ends when Anders, Odin's eldest son, takes his mother home after the funeral ale.|$|E
40|$|AIM: Few dietary {{studies have}} looked beyond fish oil {{to explain the}} {{beneficial}} metabolic effects of a fish-containing diet. Our aim was to study whether addition of herring, or sub-fractions of herring, could counteract negative metabolic effects known to be induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. METHODS: Rats were given six different diets: standard pellets; high energy diet with chicken mince (HiE control); high energy diet with herring mince (HiE herring); and high energy diet with chicken mince and either <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> (HiE <b>herring</b> <b>oil),</b> herring press juice, PJ (HiE PJ) or herring low molecular weight PJ (HiE LMW-PJ). Factors associated with the metabolic syndrome were measured. RESULTS: There were no differences in energy intake or body weight between the groups, but animals fed high energy diets had a higher body fat content compared with the pellet group, although not statistically significant in all groups. Mesenteric adipocyte size was smaller in the HiE <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> group compared with the HiE control. Glucose clamp studies showed that, compared with the pellet group, the HiE control and HiE herring diets, but not the HiE <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> diet, induced insulin resistance. Addition of herring or <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> to the high energy diet decreased total cholesterol levels, triacylglycerols and the atherogenic index compared with the HiE control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that addition of herring or <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> counteracts negative effects on blood lipids induced by a high energy diet. The lipid component of herring thus seems {{to be responsible for}} these beneficial effects...|$|E

40|$|Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, {{albatrosses}} and shearwaters) forage over {{thousands of}} square kilometres for patchily distributed prey resources. While these birds {{are known for their}} large olfactory bulbs and excellent sense of smell, how they use odour cues to locate prey patches in the vast ocean is not well understood. Here, we investigate species-specific responses to 3 -methyl pyrazine in a sub-Antarctic species assemblage near South Georgia Island (54 degrees 00 ' S, 36 degrees 00 ' W). Pyrazines are scented compounds found in macerated Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a primary prey item for many seabird species in this region. To examine behavioural attraction to this odour, we presented birds with either scented or 'unscented' vegetable oil slicks at sea. As a positive control for our experiments, we also compared birds' responses to a general olfactory attractant, <b>herring</b> <b>oil.</b> Responses to pyrazine were both highly species specific and consistent with results from earlier studies investigating responses to crude krill extracts. For example, Cape petrels (Daption capense), giant petrels (Macronectes sp.) and white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoctialis) were sighted at least 1. 8 - 4 times as often at pyrazine-scented slicks than at control slicks. Black-browed albatrosses (Diomedea melanophris) were only sighted at pyrazine-scented slicks and never at control slicks. Wilson's storm-petrels (Oceanites oceanicus), black-bellied storm-petrels(Fregetta tropica), great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis) and prions (Pachyptila sp.) were sighted with equal frequency at control and pyrazine-scented slicks. As expected, responses to <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> were more common. With the exception of great shearwaters (Puffinus gravis), each of these species was sighted up to five times as often at slicks scented with <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> compared with control slicks. Together, the results support the hypothesis that Antarctic procellariiforms use species-specific foraging strategies that are inter-dependent and more complex than simply tracking prey by scent...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} dietary lipid and bile acids on astaxanthin absorption in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Fish with an average weight of 1500 g were fitted with a dorsal aorta cannula and fed diets containing <b>herring</b> <b>oil,</b> soybean lecithin, lard, or <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> supplemented with taurocholic acid (2. 5 g/kg diet). Each fish was fed all of the experimental diets in successive order to minimize the effect of individual variation. At a given time following the feeding of each diet, blood was collected and analyzed for astaxanthin. Soybean lecithin significantly lowered the absorption of astaxanthin compared to fish fed <b>herring</b> <b>oil.</b> A 20 % (p < 0. 12) increase in blood astaxanthin was observed when the fish were fed the diet supplemented with taurocholic acid. Feeding lard significantly increased the blood astaxanthin level compared to the control group. It appears that altering the micellar structure by stimulating micellar (taurocholic acid) or mixed micellar (lecithin) systems did not increase the apparent absorption of astaxanthin. However, increasing the phospholipid level may have actually decreased the absorption possibly by lowering the astaxanthin solubility in the micelles. The increased apparent absorption of astaxanthin with lard is possibly linked to the increased content of 16 : 0, 18 : 1 n - 9 or 18 : 2 n - 6 fatty acids in this diet, or a reduction in very long chain monoenes (20 : 1 n - 9 and 22 : 1 n - 9). This suggests that the solubility of astaxanthin is higher in diets containing higher levels of 16 : 0 or 18 : 1 n - 1, or alternatively, that reductions in longer chain monoenes (20 : 1 n - 9 and 22 : 1 n - 9) increase the micellar solubility of this pigment.

The term Big Data concerns with the huge volume, complex and rapidly growing data sets with multiple, independent sources. Due to fast development of networking,data storage and data collection capacity the concept of big data is now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains including biological, physical and biomedical sciences.

40|$|Diets {{incorporating}} homogeneous binary {{mixtures of}} <b>herring</b> or krill <b>oil</b> were fed to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for 22 weeks, and belly flap and muscle tissues were then analyzed for fatty acid (FA) composition. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) {{was able to}} estimate proportions of major dietary components within ~ 10 % of actual values, but {{the accuracy of the}} estimates depended on the FA set and calibration coefficients (CC) used in the modelling. FAs present at low levels had little influence on estimates, despite having only dietary sources; the FA set used in the modelling must incorporate the major FAs in tissues to ensure accurate estimates of diet. CC, which reflect modifications that consumers make to dietary FAs, were similar in the two tissues but varied with diet. When CC were applied to correct for fish metabolism, QFASA tended to overestimate the dietary component that had been fed to determine the CC. Diet estimates were most accurate when CC that had been developed from feeding the krill oil-based diet were applied. This first application of QFASA to fish therefore establishes a set of FAs and CC to begin to investigate diets of salmonids. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNineteen {{samples of}} food in glass jars with twist {{closures}} were collected by the national food inspectors at Danish food producers and a few importers, focusing on fatty food, such as vegetables in <b>oil,</b> <b>herring</b> in dressing or pickle, soft spreadable cheese, cream, dressings, peanut butter, sauces and infant food. The composition of the plasticizers in the gaskets was analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. ESBO and phthalates were determined in the homogenized food samples. ESBO was the principal plasticizer in 5 of the gaskets; in 14 it was phthalates. ESBO was found in seven of the food samples at concentrations from 6 to 100 mg/kg. The highest levels (91 – 100 mg/kg) were in oily foods like garlic, chilli or olives in oil. Phthalates, i. e. di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP) and di-iso-nonylphthalates (DINP), were found in seven samples at 6 to 173 mg/kg. The highest concentrations (99 – 173 mg/kg) were in products of garlic and tomatoes in oil and in fatty food products like sauce béarnaise and peanut butter. For five of the samples the overall migration from unused lids to the official fatty food simulant olive oil was determined and compared to the legal limit of 60 mg/kg.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a white grape dietary fiber concentrate (WGDF) against hemoglobin-mediated oxidation of washed cod mince, with and without 10 % added <b>herring</b> <b>oil,</b> was evaluated during ice storage. WGDF was added at two different levels: 2 and 4 % based on final weight. An ethanol extract with the ethanol extractable polyphenols (EPP) and the ethanol-extracted grape dietary fiber residue were also tested as antioxidants in the washed cod mince. The addition of WGDF to the model system completely and significantly (p <= 0. 05) inhibited the hemoglobin-mediated development of rancid odor during the entire ice storage (10 days). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) development and red color (a*) losses supported the sensory data. Controls fortified with 10 % <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> oxidized {{at the same rate}} as oil-free controls and were also significantly stabilized by 2 % WGDF. The EEP of the WGDF had the same high antioxidant capacity as whole WGDF. The ethanol-extracted fiber residue significantly (p <= 0. 05) reduced maximum oxidation values obtained for controls by similar to 50 % and extended the oxidation lag phase by 1 day (p <= 0. 05).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in male wistar rat colon carcinogenesis. In order to induce colon cancer, the rats were given a weekly subcutaneous injection of 1, 2 -Dimethylhydrazine (DMH) at a dose of 20 mg/kg b. w. for five weeks. Afterwards, some of the rats ingested fish oil for either 4 weeks (DMH-FO 4 group), or 17 weeks (DMH-FO 17 group). The remaining rats continued without any supplementation for the same 4 weeks (DMH 4 group), or 17 weeks (DMH 17 group). Another two groups of rats did not receive the DMH and were given fish oil (FO 17 group) or a normal diet only and considered as the control group (CN group). At the end of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed; and were subsequently subjected to biochemical and molecular biological analyses as well as histopathological examinations. The results showed increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and alkaline phoshatase (ALP) activities in the DMH rats compared to the control. The liver and colonic changes that were induced by DMH were significantly improved through fish oil supplementation in the DMH-FO 17 group. The molecular analysis revealed that DMH treatment induced the expression alterations of genes p 53, p 27 and p 21 and increased DNA band patterns related to cancer, while both FO 17 and DMH-FO 17 groups showed much better results. A histopathological examination of the DMH 17 group revealed colon adenocarcinoma and several lesions in rat liver tissues. An improvement in the histopathological picture was seen in the livers and colons of groups DMHFO 17. In conclusion, the present results demonstrated the anti-carciongenic effect of <b>herring</b> fish <b>oil</b> against DMH induced colon carcinogenesis in rats. The inhibitory effect of FO was due to the modulation of elevated biochemical parameters, DNA damage, gene expression and histopathological lesions caused by DMH. Este estudio fue realizado para examinar la eficacia de la suplementación de aceite de pescado en la carcinogénesis de colon en ratas wistar machos. Para la inducción del cáncer de colon, las ratas fueron tratadas semanalmente con una inyección subcutánea de 1, 2 -dimethyl hydrazine (DMH) a una dosis de 20 mg/kg de peso durante cinco semana. A continuación, algunas ratas tomaron aceite de pescado durante 4 semanas, o durante 17 semanas (grupo DMH-FO 17). Las ratas restantes continuaron sin ningún tipo de suplementación durante las mismas 4 semanas (grupo DMH 4), o 17 semanas (grupo DMH 17). Otros dos grupos de ratas no recibieron DMH y un grupo consumió aceite de pescado (grupo FO 17) y el otro solamente una dieta normal y es considerado como el grupo control (grupo CN). Al final del experimento, las ratas fueron sacrificadas; y a continuación fueron evaluadas mediante análisis bioquímico y biología molecular así como examen histopatológico. El resultado mostro un incremento en los niveles de lactato deshidrogenasa (LDH), malondialdehido (MDS) y fosfatasa alcalina (ALP) en ratas DMH en comparación con el control. Los cambios inducidos en el hígado y el colon por DMH fueron significativamente mejorados con la suplementación de aceite de pescado en el grupo DMH-FO 17. El análisis molecular revelo que el tratamiento con DMH indujo alteraciones de la expresión de los genes p 53, p 27 y p 21 e incremento el perfil de bandas de DNA relacionadas con el cáncer, mientras que los grupos FO 17 Y DMH-FO 17 mostraron mejores resultados. El examen histológico del grupo DMH 17 revelo adenocarcinoma de colon y algunas lesiones en tejidos de hígado de rata. La mejora en el perfil histológico fue notable en el hígado y colon del grupo DMH-FO 17. En conclusión, los presente resultados demuestran el efecto anti-carcinogénico del aceite de arenque contra la carcinogénesis de colon inducida por DMH en ratas. El efecto inhibidor de FO fue debido a la modulación de parámetros bioquímicos elevados, daño a DNA y lesiones histopatológicas causadas por DMH...|$|R

We hypothesized that fatty acids from a given meal would be transferred acutely from chylomicrons into breast milk. To test this hypothesis, the following experiment was performed. Fourteen lactating women drank 700 Calorie breakfast formulas containing six different test fats: 40 grams of cocoa butter, coconut, safflower or canola oil, 20 grams of menhaden oil or 7 grams of <b>herring</b> <b>oil.</b> Each fat contained a specific fatty acid whose appearance was tracked in the milk. After consuming the breakfast formula, subjects collected mid-feeding milk samples at 0, 6, 10, 14 and 24 hours, and one morning sample on days two through seven.

The oil had an initial peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV), and free fatty acids of 0. 7 meq peroxides/kg of lipid, 0. 4, and 0. 6 %, respectively. During storage, the oil reached the secondary oxidation stage for all 3 temperatures. The formation of fluorescent compounds was inhibited at 0 °C. Significant decrease of the α-tocopherol content was found after storage at 0 and 20 °C, but no consumption occurred at 50 °C. The development of oxidation products over time exhibited a temperature-dependency with a very good correlation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} four {{studies that}} investigated {{whether or not}} herring (Clupea harengus) intake decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. It has previously been shown that fatty fish and fish oil intake decreases the risk of atherosclerosis and CVD. However, until these studies, no research has investigated influence of herring intake on CVD risk factors. Herring has high eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content and are rich in other nutrients, such as vitamins D and B 12, selenium and various antioxidants that may affect CVD risk factors. One of the aims with this thesis was to study how both the whole herring meat and its individual constituents (the oil and water fraction) affect CVD risk factors. Studies I and II were crossover intervention studies with 4 - and 6 -week dietary periods, respectively. Study I had 13 obese men and women; study II had 35 overweight men; the subjects received five meals per week that included 150 g baked herring fillets or, as controls, 150 g baked lean pork or chicken fillets. Plasma lipoproteins and other CVD risk factors, such as C-reactive protein, oxidized-LDL and blood pressure, were measured. The herring-rich diet significantly raised HDL in both studies, compared with the control diets. Pooled data from the two human intervention studies together showed that the oxidized -LDL/LDL ratio was significantly lower in subjects on a herring rich diet. In study III, 96 rats were fed six different diets to investigate whether the addition of herring or subfractions of herring could counteract negative metabolic effects known to be induced by a high-fat, high-sugar diet. Risk factors for metabolic syndrome were evaluated after the diets. In rats, herring and <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in an improved lipoprotein profile and decreased triacylglycerides. <b>Herring</b> <b>oil</b> decreased the adipocyte size, indicating that <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> could decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herring water fraction and herring decreased plasma oxidation products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]). Study IV used carotid intima-media thickness to evaluate the extent of subclinical atherosclerosis. Plasma phospholipid EPA and DHA were measured in a population-based cohort of 61 -year-old men (n= 487). EPA was negatively associated with intima-media thickness in the carotid and femoral arteries. EPA and DHA levels were also negatively associated with several CVD risk factors, such as markers of endothelial function. These data indicated that subjects with the metabolic syndrome or obesity, who commonly have low HDL, may benefit from the addition of herring to their diet. The studies demonstrated that high fish intake had a neutral or slightly positive effect on oxidative status...|$|E
40|$|Marine lipids {{contain a}} high {{proportion}} of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including the characteristic long chain (LC) n- 3 PUFA. Upon peroxidation these lipids generate reactive products, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), 4 -hydroxy- 2 -hexenal (HHE) and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (HNE), which can form covalent adducts with biomolecules and thus are regarded as genotoxic and cytotoxic. PUFA peroxidation can occur both before and after ingestion. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine what levels of MDA, HHE and HNE can evolve in the gastric and intestinal lumen after ingesting meals containing fish or fish oil using a dynamic gastrointestinal (GI) model (TIM). The impact of the fish muscle matrix, lipid content, fish species, and oven baking on GI oxidation was evaluated. MDA and HHE concentrations in gastric lumen increased for all meals during digestion, with the highest level found with herring mince; similar to 25 mu M MDA and similar to 850 nM HHE. Aldehyde concentrations reached in intestinal lumen during digestion of fish containing meals were generally lower than in gastric lumen, while isolated herring oils (bulk and emulsified) generated higher MDA and HHE values in intestinal lumen compared to gastric lumen. Based on aldehyde levels in gastric lumen, meals containing herring lipids were ranked: raw herring (17 % lipid) = baked herring (4 % lipid) > raw herring (4 % lipid) >> <b>herring</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion > <b>herring</b> <b>oil.</b> Herring developed higher concentrations of MDA and HHE during gastric digestion compared to salmon, which initially contained lower levels of oxidation products. Cooked salmon generated higher MDA concentrations during digestion than raw salmon. Low levels of HNE were observed during digestion of all test meals, in accordance with the low content of n- 6 PUFA in fish lipids...|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{well-established}} {{that the}} fatty acid profile of breast milk will reflect the dietary fatty acids, the response time with which this occurs is not known. We hypothesized that fatty acids from a given meal would be transferred acutely from chylomicrons into breast milk. To test this hypothesis, the following experiment was performed. Fourteen lactating women drank 700 Calorie breakfast formulas containing six different test fats: 40 grams of cocoa butter, coconut, safflower or canola oil, 20 grams of menhaden oil or 7 grams of <b>herring</b> <b>oil.</b> Each fat contained a specific fatty acid whose appearance was tracked in the milk. After consuming the breakfast formula, subjects collected mid-feeding milk samples at 0, 6, 10, 14 and 24 hours, and one morning sample on days two through seven. Fatty acids specifically tracked in milk sample...|$|E

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} twenty rainbow trouts (IBW: 700 g) were {{randomly}} allotted to four tanks, with a male/female ratio of 0. 56. Fish were fed for 168 d with four experimental diets containing <b>herring</b> <b>oil,</b> cod liver oil and coconut oil with the following inclusion rates: diet A: 12 - 1 - 0 % respectively; diet B: 6 - 1 - 6 %; diet C: 0 - 1 - 12 %; diet D: 0 - 0 - 13 %. Irrespective of the dietary treatment, weight gains of broodstocks were high (> 3 g/d) and FCR below 2. No significant difference was observed concerning {{the total amount of}} eggs spawn, egg average weight (82. 5 mg/egg) and lipid content (5. 4 mg/egg). However, the fatty acid profile of eggs was significantly affected by the dietary treatments.
