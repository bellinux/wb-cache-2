Hovannisian wrote, [...] "the battle for Turkish Armenia had been quickly decided; the struggle for Russian Armenia was now at hand". After the Turks captured Erzurum, the largest city in Turkish Armenia, Andranik retreated through Kars, passed through Alexandropol and Jalaloghly, and arrived in Dsegh by 18 May. By early April 1918, the Turkish forces had reached the pre-war international borders. Andranik and his unit in Dsegh {{were not able to}} take part in the battles of Sardarabad, Abaran and Karakilisa.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days before}} the season's premiere, Mel B made {{comments}} about the other judges, labelling them dishonest and boring. She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan thinks he knows it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I <b>hope</b> <b>so</b> otherwise she deserves a slap."

500|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance by}} the Mercedes cars sparked controversy in the paddock. Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans after what he felt was a [...] "boring" [...] race. Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals, calling for the FIA {{to step in and}} apply rule changes to level the field, fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to sort it out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really <b>hope</b> <b>so?</b> Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it's going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you're saying?" ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the storyline {{which saw}} Kyla's Alcoholics Anonymous {{companion}} Stuart McElroy (Conor Mullen) violently attack her colleague, Ward Sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), Ayola has stated: [...] "It makes her finally accept what Stuart was capable of. She sees this huge gash and feels that all her instincts {{about other people}} are wrong – so she ends up running off. [...] has no excuses – all she can think is that she’s really messed up and needs to leave." [...] This plot strand saw Kyla once more resort to drinking while at work, and decide to quit her job, only to be talked out of doing so by Nursing Consultant Mark Williams (Robert Powell). [...] Ayola explained: [...] "He suggests she takes a demotion, so she’ll have less to worry about and more {{time to deal with}} her problems. It's the lifeline she needs, because her work is all she has right now. I think if Kyla did leave, she’d end up simply going home and buying loads of cheap booze." [...] When asked if Kyla would be able to overcome her addiction and regain custody of her son, Ayola responded: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> Kyla's had trouble being a good parent to Max, but she's had lots of time to reflect on why this is." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{invocation}} {{was given}} by Episcopal bishop Alfred Harding followed by presentation of the colors while the band performed [...] "The Stars and Stripes Forever". [...] The cloth screens concealing the fountain were then removed by Du Pont's granddaughter, Sophie Du Pont Ford, and the band performed the national anthem and [...] "Narcissus" [...] by Ethelbert Nevin. The fountain was formally presented by Rear Admiral Purnell Frederick Harrington, who had served alongside Du Pont. [...] Weeks received the fountain as {{a gift from the}} Du Pont family on behalf of the government. [...] A speech was then given by Denby who praised Du Pont's services to his country. [...] He stated: [...] "Du Pont's hereditary background had justified the <b>hope</b> <b>so</b> meritoriously fulfilled in that officer's career, while his service as a midshipman on the then active Constitution must have proved an inspiration for his later activities." [...] Denby also praised Du Pont's attitude toward his fellow sailors and his willingness to put the country's needs above his own. [...] He concluded his speech by noting how proud the Navy was of the new memorial and expressed hopes that it would always be well maintained. [...] Following Denby's speech, three young girls that were descendants of Du Pont, Ann Andrews, Emily Du Pont and Mary Harvey, placed laurel wreaths in the fountain water.

[...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her.

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>so!</b> Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E

According to its leader, the alliance was a [...] "broad democratic arch, composed of the democratic right, namely AN, the great democratic centre, namely Forza Italia, CCD and CDU, and the democratic left represented by the League, the New PSI, the PRI and, at least I <b>hope</b> <b>so,</b> Cossiga".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the general}} notion of {{consistency}} of political positions over time, McCain said in June 2008: [...] "My principles and my practice and my voting record are very clear.

Look, none of my principles or values have changed. Have I changed position on some specific issues because of changed circumstances? I would <b>hope</b> <b>so!</b> I would hope so!" [...] It is often reported that McCain has grown more conservative throughout his tenure in the Senate, according to various studies.|$|E

2500|$|Disney Infinity was {{originally}} described to be a [...] "platform that's always growing and will ultimately {{have something for}} everyone," [...] and that the Infinity platform is open to expanding. When Disney Infinity was yet to be released, Avalanche Software CEO, John Blackburn stated that discussions about the inclusion of Star Wars and Marvel characters in the game, took place. On that subject Blackburn said [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>so!</b> As a developer, I so want that. When Disney bought Lucasfilm, I was like, 'Holy crap! This is awesome!' But {{at this point in}} time, there's been some discussions about that, there's just been no decisions made."

2500|$|The concert {{begins with}} Harrison {{taking to the}} stage alone and {{addressing}} the audience, his comment [...] "We've got a good show lined up – well, I <b>hope</b> <b>so</b> anyway..." [...] alluding to {{the speed with which}} the event was organised. He then introduces the first group of musicians, led by Shankar, who, like Harrison, attempts to convey the intricacies of Indian classical music to the audience, as well as outlining the reason for this [...] "special benefit concert". Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan proceed to tune their instruments and then stop after about 90 seconds. The audience, apparently believing they have heard an entire piece, respond with enthusiastic applause, to which Shankar replies: [...] "Thank you, if you appreciate the tuning so much, I hope you will enjoy the playing more." [...] The four musicians then launch into a fifteen-minute dhun.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, while {{promoting}} his second solo album Cauterize, Mark Tremonti claimed {{in an interview}} with Kerrang that he [...] " [...] been a close friend of Scott's in 9 years". He said that Stapp believed that the other members would end Alter Bridge and perform solely with him in Creed, which they didn't wish to do, as they had established a unique foundation in that band. The other members did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge. [...] In August 2015, Tremonti reiterated that there were no plans for Creed {{for at least the next}} few years, but he didn't rule out the possibility. [...] In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the Dr. Oz Show and recounted his history with depression and drug use, and how they contributed to mental health scare in November. [...] When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: [...] "I can tell you what, I sure <b>hope</b> <b>so.</b> I love the guys with all my heart and if they’re watching, 'Come on guys, let’s make a record.'" [...] He later doubled down on the statements by stating that Creed would [...] "definitely" [...] reunite and that he expected new material from the band within [...] "the next two years." [...] When asked about Stapp's statements, Tremonti clarified that he was still busy {{promoting his}} solo albums and that Alter Bridge would record and tour in 2016, making it unlikely for him to return to Creed within Stapp's proposed timeline.|$|E
