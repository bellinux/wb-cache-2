25|$|The {{trademark}} Volvo (which is Latin for <b>I</b> <b>roll)</b> {{was first}} registered by SKF on 11 May 1915 {{with the intention}} {{to use it for}} a special series of ball bearing for the American market but it was never used for this purpose (however in the application for the trademark, it was also designated for the purpose of automobiles). The SKF trademark as it looks today was used instead for all the SKF-products. Some pre-series of Volvo-bearings stamped with the brand name 'Volvo' were manufactured but never released to the market, and it was not until 1927 that the trademark was used again, now as a trademark and company name for an automobile.|$|E

60|$|This {{day last}} year, Mary and I wandered {{up and down}} Holborn and the streets about for hours, looking after a little table for Kate's bedroom, which we bought at last at the very first broker's which we had looked into, and which we had passed half-a-dozen times because I didn't {{like to ask the}} price. I took her out to Brompton at night, as we had no place for her to sleep in (the two mothers being with us); she came back again next day to keep house for me, and stopped nearly the rest of the month. I shall never be so happy again as in those {{chambers}} three storeys high--never if <b>I</b> <b>roll</b> in wealth and fame. I would hire them to keep empty, if I could afford it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Those, big ears," [...] {{continued}} Jumper, [...] "heard {{every little}} sound that Old Mother Nature made, and they sounded queer to Mr. Owl. 'If <b>I</b> <b>roll</b> back my eyes without turning my head, I believe I {{can see what}} she is doing, and she won't be any the wiser,' thought he. So {{he rolled his eyes}} back and then looked straight ahead again. What he had seen made him want to see more. He tried it again. Just imagine how he felt when he found that his eyes wouldn't roll. He couldn't move them a bit. All he could do was to stare straight ahead. It frightened him dreadfully, and he kept trying and trying to roll his eyes, but they were fixed fast. He could see in only one direction, the way his head was turned.|$|E
6000|$|She laughed drearily. [...] "My work! If {{you only}} {{knew what it}} is like you would not talk to me about it.

I work all day, and in the evening perhaps I have to mend the tablecloths, or--what do you think?--write my father's sermons. It sounds curious, does it not, that I should write sermons? But I do. I wrote the one he is going to preach next Sunday. It makes very little {{difference}} to him what it is so long as he can read it, and, of course, I never say anything which can offend anybody, and I do not think that they listen much. Very few people go to church in Bryngelly." ...|$|E

60|$|I remembered {{having seen}} tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes {{with which they}} were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like a good fellow, the knots {{remained}} as hard as ever, and there was no appreciable slack. In the course of my squirming, however, <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over upon a heap of clam-shells--the remains, evidently, of some yachting party's clam-bake. This gave me an idea. My hands were tied behind my back; and, clutching a shell in them, <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over and over, up the beach, till I came to the rocks I knew to be there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I yelled, and yelled--I {{was in for}} it now. I screamed comic refrains that vulgar {{young men}} had sung, to my regret, at our village concerts; <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> to and fro like a ninepin about to fall.|$|R
60|$|I hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst {{all about}} me, {{scattering}} {{a mass of}} orange spores in every direction, and covering me with orange powder. <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over spluttering, and came to rest convulsed with breathless laughter.|$|R
