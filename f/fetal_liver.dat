40|$|International audienceJun is {{essential}} for fetal development, as fetuses lacking Jun die at mid-gestation with multiple cellular defects in liver and heart. Embryos expressing JunD in place of Jun (Jund/d) can develop to term with normal <b>fetal</b> <b>livers,</b> but display cardiac defects as observed in fetuses lacking Jun.

In an attempt to characterize the proliferating cells in these conditions, we studied the expression of several antigens by immunohistochemical methods. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alpha 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), a hepatocellular export protein, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a marker of bile duct epithelial cells, and hepatitis B virus antigens (HBsAg, HBcAg), were localized by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method in 11 <b>fetal</b> <b>livers,</b> 10 cases of nodular transformation, and 7 cases of massive hepatic necrosis. AFP was the most prevalent antigen in fetal hepatocytes. Many hyperplastic hepatocytes in nodular transformation contained AAT, but not oncofetal antigens, supporting the differentiated hepatocellular nature of these cells. A similar staining pattern was seen in two-cell-thick plates of hepatocytes in massive hepatic necrosis. In contrast, the ductlike structures at the periphery of necrotic lobules contained both AAT and CEA, suggesting that these cells exhibit features of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells.

40|$|Background: Interindividual {{differences}} in liver {{functions such as}} protein synthesis, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and drug metabolism are influenced by epigenetic factors. The role of the epigenetic machinery in such processes has, however, been barely investigated. 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) is a recently re-discovered epigenetic DNA modification that {{plays an important role}} in the control of gene expression. Results: In this study, we investigate 5 hmC occurrence and genomic distribution in 8 fetal and 7 adult human liver samples in relation to ontogeny and function. LC-MS analysis shows that in the adult liver samples 5 hmC comprises up to 1 % of the total cytosine content, whereas in all <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> it is below 0. 125 %. Immunohistostaining of liver sections with a polyclonal anti- 5 hmC antibody shows that 5 hmC is detected in most of the hepatocytes. Genome-wide mapping of the distribution of 5 hmC in human liver samples by next-generation sequencing shows significant differences between <b>fetal</b> and adult <b>livers.</b> In adult livers, 5 hmC occupancy is overrepresented in genes involved in active catabolic and metabolic processes, whereas 5 hmC elements which are found in genes exclusively in <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> and disappear in the adult state, are more specific to pathways for differentiation and development.

Examination of growth retarded babies have shown {{significant changes in the}} weight of organs such as the thymus, spleen, liver and kidneys. Ultrasound examination is the usual modality of choice for fetal imaging, but conventional ultrasound is a 2 D imaging modality, lacking the positional information necessary for the reconstruction of 3 D shapes. Different organs have different 3 D shapes and the similarity in individual shapes helps identify that particular organ.

40|$|Mosaicism of {{ornithine}} transcarbamylase (OTC) {{expression in}} hepatocytes was quantitatively analyzed during liver {{development of the}} spfash-heterozygous female mouse. Because the mosaic patterns depend on cell migration and cell mixing, such analysis could give insights on the growth pattern or allocation pattern of hepatocytes during liver development. Complex mosaic patterns of OTC-positive and -negative hepatocytes were observed in sections of <b>fetal</b> and postnatal <b>livers.</b> Sizes of patches, which were aggregates of OTC-positive or -negative hepatocytes, increased during development. Patches were slender and comparatively simple in 15. 5 - and 17. 5 -day <b>fetal</b> and neonatal <b>livers.</b> Quantitative analysis of patch shapes demonstrated that undulation of patches was maximal at 7 postnatal days. Patches with nodular shapes also started to increase in number at this stage. Isolated patches in sections of <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> and postnatal livers three-dimensionally connected with one another. However, especially in <b>fetal</b> <b>livers,</b> in which OTC-positive patches were minor, due {{to the presence of}} abundant hemopoietic cells, isolated three-dimensional patches consisting of approximately 5 to 70 cells were often found. They were shaped like slender branching or zigzag-shaped cords, but no definite orientation such as portal-central was observed in them at any stage. These results suggest that hepatocytes contiguously allocate their daughter cells as zigzag-shaped or branching cords at younger stages. Some hepatocytes grow with nodular formation after 7 postnatal days. Migration and mixing of hepatocytes appear to be more extensive at fetal stages than in the adult liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of intercellular junction proteins (E-cadherin, connexins 26 and 32, occludin, and ZO- 1) also revealed that their expression and distribution changed in hepatocytes during development, which may be correlated with the OTC mosaic patterns...|$|R
40|$|Erythropoietin (EP) mRNA was {{measured}} in normal and anemic mice during fetal and postnatal development. Normal <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> at 14 d of gestation contained {{a low level of}} EP mRNA. By day 19 of gestation, no EP mRNA was detected in normal or anemic <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> or normal <b>fetal</b> kidneys, but anemic fetal kidneys had low levels of EP mRNA. Newborn through adult stage mice responded to anemia by accumulating renal and hepatic EP mRNA. However, total liver EP mRNA was considerably less than that of the kidneys. Juvenile animals, 1 - 4 wk old, were hyperresponsive to anemia in that they produced more EP mRNA than adults. Moreover, nonanemic juveniles had readily measured renal EP mRNA, whereas the adult level was at the lower limit of detection. Because of the very low level of fetal EP mRNA, placental transfer of EP was evaluated. When administered to the pregnant mouse, 125 I-EP was transferred in significant amounts to the fetuses. These results indicate that in mice the kidney is the main organ of EP production at all stages of postnatal development and that adult kidney may also play some role in providing EP for fetal erythropoiesis via placental transfer of maternal hormone...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH), (L-lactate: NAD oxidoreductase, EC, 1, 1, 1, 27) {{has been found}} to consist of two parent types and three hybrid forms. The two parent types are H 4 and M 4, and the hybrids may be referred to as H 3 M, H 2 M 2, and HM 3 which corresponds to the random association of subunits in tetramer. Using pig LDH preparations, in vitro molecular hybridization was performed. Quantitation of the resulting isozyme distributions and a comparison with that expected from the binomial distribution demonstrated that random association of subunits occurred as proposed by Markert. Based on this concept, the LDH isozyme patterns and LDH pI isozyme patterns of normal adult <b>livers,</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> and hepatoma tissues were studied. The isozyme patterns in hepatoma were of an intermediate type between normal adults and <b>fetal</b> <b>livers.</b> The LDH subunit compositions of normal human livers were similar to a 1 : 9 mixture of pig LDH-H 4 and LDH-M 4, however, those of hepatoma tissues were similar to the mixture with a broad range of 1 : 2 ? 1 : 5. The results observed above suggest that the LDH isozyme patterns of hepatoma tissues show “fetalism”, which is based on the proportional increase of H subunit. It appears that the wide fluctuation of LDH isozyme patterns observed in the hepatoma tissues are due to the varieties of relative amounts of the LDH-H and LDH-M subunits...|$|R

Here we analyze the effect of streptozotocin=req- induced maternal diabetes on IGFBP- 1 mRNA expression during GD 12 - 16 of rat fetal development, using in situ hybridization. IGFBP- 1 mRNA was more abundant in GD 12 - 14 <b>fetal</b> <b>livers</b> from diabetic dams than in livers of age-matched controls.
