5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> not a program. But in fact, ELIZA {{had no idea what}} she was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
5|$|In the novels, Dexter {{initially}} considers Rita {{little more}} than part of his disguise as a normal <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> the perfect cover for his secret life as a serial killer. He later admits to growing quite fond of Rita, whom he married in the third book, Dexter in the Dark. In the television series, Rita is portrayed as a loving and caring mother who is emotionally damaged due to physical abuse by her former husband, Paul Bennett. Rita {{is the mother of}} Astor Bennett (Christina Robinson) and Cody Bennett (Preston Bailey), and later in the television series, gives birth to Dexter's son, Harrison. In the book series, she and Dexter have a daughter, Lily Anne.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E

The society was held together by the Prophet. Feuding among Muslim clans was forbidden. Muhammad's community was designed to transform the world itself through action in the world.|$|R

5|$|In the series, Clark Kent {{attempts}} {{to live the}} life of a normal <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them {{at the start of the}} show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In Theravadin Buddhism, Buddhas {{are born}} as unenlightened humans, {{and are not}} rulers of any paradise or pure land.

25|$|Although usually invisible, a kobold can {{materialize}} in {{the form}} of an animal, fire, a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> a candle. The most common depictions of kobolds show them as humanlike figures the size of small children. Kobolds who live in human homes wear the clothing of peasants; those who live in mines are hunched and ugly; and kobolds who live on ships smoke pipes and wear sailor clothing.|$|E

There is a third, less common tone – starting high, dipping low and then ending high – all within the same vowel sound, e.g.: bôngó (therefore).|$|E

25|$|Burt defined sex {{education}} as {{the study of}} the characteristics of beings: a male and female. Such characteristics make up the person's sexuality. Sexuality is an important aspect of the life of a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> almost all people, including children, want to know about it. Sex education includes all the educational measures which - regardless of the particular method used - may center on sex. He further said that {{sex education}} stands for protection, presentation extension, improvement and development of the family based on accepted ethical ideas.|$|E

25|$|Olivia's {{perspectives}} and inner feelings very often {{serve as the}} focal points for episodes of the series that directly focus on her development as a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> {{a member of the}} law enforcement community. Critically acclaimed for an evolving storyline, Olivia has highlighted determination and focus as her main traits, according to Abrams. Following a plot line in the second season, viewers are introduced to Olivia's doppelgänger from the parallel universe, which develops an alternate reality for each character. Torv has received several awards for her portrayal of Olivia.|$|E
25|$|Saint Francis’ {{intuitive}} {{approach was}} elaborated into a philosophical vision by subsequent Franciscan theologians, such as Bonaventure of Bagnoregio and John Duns Scotus, leading {{figures in the}} Franciscan intellectual tradition. The philosophy of Scotus is founded upon {{the primacy of the}} Incarnation, and may have been a particularly important influence on Sahagún, since Scotus’s philosophy was taught in Spain at this time. Scotus absorbed the intuitive insights of St. Francis of Assisi and his devotion to Jesus Christ as a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> expressed them in a broader vision of humanity.|$|E
25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a <b>human</b> <b>being)</b> <b>and</b> that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E

25|$|Media {{portrayals of}} an 'ideal' body shape are widely {{considered}} to be a contributing factor to bulimia. In a 1991 study by Weltzin, Hsu, Pollicle, and Kaye, it was stated that 19% of bulimics undereat, 37% of bulimics eat an amount of food that is normal for an average <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>and</b> 44% of bulimics overeat. A survey of 15- to 18-year-old high school girls in Nadroga, Fiji, found the self-reported incidence of purging rose from 0% in 1995 (a few weeks after the introduction of television in the province) to 11.3% in 1998. In addition, the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population.|$|E
25|$|In drawing {{attention}} {{to a number of}} preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of Guernica, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez. In his chef d'oeuvre, Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, Guernica should be seen as Picasso’s comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.|$|E
25|$|Numerous popular stories {{throughout}} the world reflect a firmly-rooted belief in an intimate connection between a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> <b>and</b> a tree, plant or flower. Sometimes a man's life depends upon the tree and suffers when it withers or is injured, and we encounter {{the idea of the}} external soul, already found in the Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers from at least 3000 years ago. Here one of the brothers leaves his heart {{on the top of the}} flower of the acacia and falls dead when it is cut down. Sometimes, however, the tree is a mysterious token which shows its sympathy with an absent hero by weakening or dying, as the man becomes ill or loses his life. These two features very easily combine, and they agree in representing to us mysterious sympathy between tree and human life.|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} human-computer {{interaction}} (HCI) presents an enormous theoretical challenge to researchers {{trying to establish}} it as an integrated field of studies. To become such a field, HCI {{should be based on}} a conceptual scheme powerful enough to incorporate both <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> computer technology within a coherent theoretical framework. One possible solution is based on the cognitive approach, according to which both <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> computers can be considered as information processing units. 1 If the basic mechanisms underlying human cognition and those underlying the functioning of computer systems are essentially the same, it is possible to use the same concepts and methods to analyze both entities and eventually to build a general theory that explains the functioning of higher-level systems composed of both <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> computers. Another broad approach, which is becoming more popular, is based on a radically different assumption. It assumes that what is needed to make HCI a conceptually integrated field is a theory that describes and explains the larger context of human interaction with computers. This second approach employs another feature <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> computers have in common: both are involved in real-life activities of computer use. If we can provide an account of the general context of computer use and identify the place of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> computers within this overarching scheme, we can understand interactio...|$|R
