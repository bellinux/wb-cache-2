40|$|Purposes {{work was}} create {{technical}} documentation to an electrically driven tackle with actuated by hand undercarriage. Was booked up fundamental parameters like bearing, stroke and hoisting speed. First was effected calculation of load on pinion necks and an <b>idle</b> <b>pulley.</b> Subsequently was effected calculation for right {{election of a}} rope, an <b>idle</b> <b>pulley,</b> a rope drum and bearings for the rope drum. Up this calculation followed calculation for a right election of an electric motor and a shaft clutch. The documentation was complemented with pictures and tablets, that are seted near single decisive knots of the tackle. To the documentation was creationed how a suggested arrangement drawing so single subassemblies drawings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} design {{solution of}} SMC storage machine (Sch√§fer Miniload Crane) with symmetrically placed driving element towards blocks of <b>idle</b> <b>pulleys.</b> Solution of SMC storage machine with symmetrically placed driving element could reduce excessive abrasion of <b>idle</b> <b>pulleys</b> {{and contribute to}} more stable ride on the rail...|$|R
