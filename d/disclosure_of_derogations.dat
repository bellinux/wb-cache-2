This prescribed insurance contracts regime was designed to remedy comprehension problems generated by the length and complexity of insurance documents and to alleviate misunderstanding over the terms and conditions of individual policies. This article examines the rationale underpinning s 35 and the prescribed insurance contracts regime {{and looks at the}} operation of the legislation with particular reference to home contents insurance in Australia.

40|$|Decentralising wage {{setting in}} times of crisis? The {{regulation}} and use <b>of</b> wage-related <b>derogation</b> clauses in seven European countries The author addresses the issue of wage setting decentralisation from the inter-sectoral to company level through the use <b>of</b> <b>derogation</b> clauses. Sectoral and inter-sectoral level collective agreements are a key feature of industrial relations in most Western European countries. Traditionally inter-sectoral bargaining has had the function of homogenising wages and working conditions for entire sectors or countries, of bringing stability to the relations between workers and employers and of relieving company level actors from engaging in time consuming and possibly conflict-ridden bargaining processes. In recent decades, however, the rationale for such inter-sectoral agreements has been questioned for an advancing globalisation of competition and for a greater requirement from employers of decentralisation and flexibility {{in the setting of}} wages and working conditions. A specific form of decentralisation is the opening up of possibilities for companies, through various kinds <b>of</b> <b>derogation</b> clauses (opening clauses, hardship clauses, opt-out clauses, inability-to-pay clauses, etc.), to deviate from pay norms set under inter-sectoral or sectoral agreements when they suffer from temporary economic hardship. The article provides a summary of the results of a comparative study on the regulations, practices and politics <b>of</b> wage <b>derogation</b> clauses in seven EU countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. It provides a detailed and original contribution to the political and academic debate on labour law and industrial relations...|$|R

Therefore, it is suspected that there is a simultaneous relationship between <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> corporate social responsibility in annual report with institutional ownership. Collecting data using a purposive sampling method to non-financial companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2009. Some 93 companies are used as research samples.

This study used variable industry type, company size and profitability as a control variable <b>of</b> <b>disclosures</b> <b>of</b> corporate social responsibility and used variable firm size, profitability, and leverage as control variables of institutional ownership. Result of research by Hausman test shows that there is no simultaneous relationship between <b>disclosure</b> <b>of</b> corporate social responsibility with institutional ownership.

Several EU regions have made use of this possibility but all in a different way. In 2009, 6 different derogation policies were worked out. This paper focuses on the differences between the applied policies and makes an assessment of the impact of these differences on the application rate <b>of</b> <b>derogation,</b> the manure surplus and the costs to allocate the manure. Based on the MP-MAS model described by Van der Straeten et al. (2010) the different scenarios are applied on a single case area (Flanders) and the economic effects have been simulated. Results show large differences between the policy alternatives, leading to the conclusion that member states not only have to focus on the permission to allow derogation or not but also at the details <b>of</b> the <b>derogation</b> policy. Granting derogation at parcel level instead of farm level increases the potential effect <b>of</b> <b>derogation,</b> the height <b>of</b> the increase in fertilization standards under derogation determines the application rate of derogation: a higher increase leads to a higher application rate.
