The site stretched from the centre of Handforth village, through Cheadle Hulme and onwards to Woodford. The industrial estate Adlington Park in Woodford/Poynton was a <b>dispersed</b> <b>site</b> of RAF Handforth. Cheadle Hulme itself escaped being badly damaged, but its villagers knew {{the extent of the}} war, mainly due to the large and visible presence of the RAF and could hear the sounds of air-raids on Manchester.|$|E

One such building is the Underground Battle Headquarters, {{which was designed to}} provide emergency organisation of airfield defenses should the airfield come under attack. Other remaining buildings include defensive pillboxes, a brick slit trench used as a defence position,the fire tender building now used as a store for the shooting club, a complete cantilever 'Oakington' type defence position, 20mm ammunition store, and a Small arms ammunition store. and on Number 3 <b>dispersed</b> <b>site,</b> there are the remains of latrines and air raid shelters, (although these are on Private land and permission to enter must be sought) [...] The last remaining blister hangar at Hunsdon was demolished in the mid 2000s as it was made unsafe after the 1987 'hurricane'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{experiment}} comprised {{a randomized}} controlled {{trial in the}} city of Winnipeg and rural Manitoba (the rural <b>dispersed</b> <b>site).</b> A so-called [...] "saturation site" [...] pilot project in the town of Dauphin was added in 1973. The Winnipeg and rural Manitoba sites randomly allocated lower-income household to one of seven treatment groups and a control group. The families in the treatment groups received an income guarantee or minimum cash benefit according to family size that was reduced by a specific amount (35, 50 or 75 cents) for every dollar they earned by working. [...] Dauphin residents were eligible for a single treatment that reduced the benefit guarantee by 50 cents for each dollar earned. Also the Dauphin site had only one plan (Plan 4) and unlike the Winnipeg and rural dispersed sites, any resident of the city could apply.|$|E

50|$|On the North Camp, much of {{the vacant}} land was taken up with new {{accommodation}} blocks for the expected large influx of personnel, including WAAFs. A new WT/RT station {{was set up to}} supersede the old hut. On both camps, numerous air raid shelters were constructed. To assist in the defence of the airfield, a series of <b>dispersed</b> <b>sites</b> were set up over a wide area around the airfield. These sites included a searchlight camp at the top of Ferryboat lane, and small AA gun posts out on the Birtley road, above the old quarries at the bottom end of Boldon Bank and along the disused railway line towards North Hylton. A large gunsite was set up near Downhill Farm, and on the Birtley road, well away from the station, a decontamination centre was built. Most of these <b>dispersed</b> <b>sites</b> were to be manned by members of the Durham Light Infantry and the Royal Artillery.|$|R

50|$|No male {{individuals}} of M. smithii {{have ever been}} identified, and when researchers examined 6 widely <b>dispersed</b> <b>sites</b> they discovered {{that all of the}} workers of each colony were genetically identical with the queen.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. A {{method to}} use pecuniary costs to {{directly}} compare {{environmental and social}} consequences of a project and relate them to construction and operating costs was developed. The method depends on determining the difference in cost between two options. The method was tested against a hypothetical construction project. The difference in financial, environmental, and social costs were determined for construction and 30 -year operation of four identical 550 -MW coal-burning electric generating plants when either separated according to an arbitrary air-quality criterion, or consolidated at a single location. The two siting strategies were evaluated for a locale near Farmington, New Mexico. At this locale, the capital, construction, and lifetime operations and maintenance costs were determined to be 510 million, ot 10. 5 percent, higher for the <b>dispersed</b> <b>siting</b> option. All environmental and social cost differentials also favored the dispersed option, although the differential costs were small compared to the difference in financial costs. A sensitivity analysis and application of the methodology to a hypothetical locale in other geographic regions did not change the basic conclusion: consolidated power plant siting is preferred to <b>dispersed</b> <b>siting</b> economically, environmentally and socioeconomically...|$|R

50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was built}} as a satellite to RAF Lossiemouth, and was completed in early June 1940. As an early war airfield, it had no hard runways, but otherwise had all of the facilities and <b>dispersed</b> <b>sites</b> of similar later stations {{in other parts of}} Britain. Twenty circular hard-standings were spaced around the perimeter track, some connected to it, with others simply circles on the grass. On its completion, due to the threat of invasion, the field was obstructed by the Royal Engineers, to prevent enemy landings. As No. 20 Operational Training Unit RAF at Lossiemouth expanded, Elgin was cleared and became available for use on 30 June 1940.|$|R
