50|$|On the show, Bradley {{was known}} for his sense of style. He was the first male {{correspondent}} to regularly wear an earring on the air. He had his left ear pierced in 1986 and says he was inspired to do it after receiving encouragement from Liza Minnelli following an interview with the actress. He is also thus far the only male 60 Minutes anchor to do so, though male correspondents from other network programs, including Jim Vance, <b>Jay</b> <b>Schadler,</b> and Harold Dow, later wore earrings on camera.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} newsmagazines, Downtown was never carried by any big name anchor. An {{ensemble}} team of anchors fronted the broadcast, which {{was aimed at}} attracting younger viewers, but was hampered {{by many of the}} network's larger market affiliates bumping the show to late night or weekend timeslots to accommodate local pre-game shows or coach's shows/highlight recap programming dealing with NFL or college football teams preceding ABC's Monday Night Football. The anchor/reporting duties were filled by the team of Elizabeth Vargas, Cynthia McFadden, Chris Cuomo, <b>Jay</b> <b>Schadler</b> and John Qui√±ones. Downtown was canceled in 2002. In 2003, the program returned for one season as Primetime Monday, with the same anchors and format.|$|E
