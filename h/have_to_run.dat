5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E

5|$|Knightly Dawn {{was entered}} into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly Dawn, William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly Dawn was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E

25|$|The Forum of National Parties, an {{association}} of 12 moderate Islamist parties, said it rejected the proposed election law because it encouraged voting along tribal lines and gave undue influence to the wealthy.

25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|E
25|$|He won the Republican {{primary and}} then the general election. Some Oregon {{newspapers}} considered him a contender for President of the Senate, {{but he was never}} a serious candidate for the position. He took his seat in the Oregon Senate on January 13, 1913 and served through the 1913 regular session, which ended on March 3. Since Oregon state senators serve a four-year term, Thompson did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election prior to the opening of the 1915 legislative session. However, once the November 1914 general election was over, he announced that he would actively seek the President of the Senate position. Just {{a few days after the}} election, Thompson had 11 of the 16 votes he needed to be elected Senate President. By mid-December, he had enough pledged votes to ensure his election. When the Oregon Senate elected its president in January 1915, Thompson was the only candidate nominated for the position. He received 25 out of 28 Republican votes. In addition, both Democratic senators voted for Thompson. Two Republicans voted for Senator W. D. Wood and Thompson joined them to honor Wood.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} established a new ferry service from Kleppestø to Kjøkkelvik on the mainland. This would provide a shorter ferry ride and shorter transport for vehicles heading to western Bergen. The idea was passed by Askøy Municipal Council on 26 August 1976, and was also supported by Bergen's executive committee. However, there were large protests from locals in Kjøkkelvik and Kjøkkelvikdalen. The Public Roads Administration proposed two plans for a ferry service in 1979, one to Kjøkkelvik and one further east at Kvarven, which would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> via a tunnel to {{the southern end of}} Gravdalsvatnet, where it could intersect with National Road 555. The latter would be able to take over all transport between Askøy and Bergen, leaving the ferry service to Nøstet to only have passenger transport. To ease local protests in Kjøkkelvik, Rutelaget bought a property east of Brøstadneset in 1980. The Kvarven proposal was opposed by the Norwegian Armed Forces, who had installations in the area, and the Norwegian Diver School, which had established itself at Gravdal in 1980. Because of the opposition, Askøy Municipal Council on 26 August 1982 voted to instead work to upgrade the ferry quay at Nøstet.|$|E
500|$|Eleven horses {{entered the}} Belmont Stakes on June 7, and California Chrome drew post {{position}} 2, the same post position as Secretariat in the 1973 Belmont. Ride On Curlin and General a Rod also entered; {{they were the}} only other horses besides California Chrome to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown. Four entries had run in Kentucky Derby but skipped the Preakness, and there were four [...] "New Shooters" [...] who had not run in either of the previous Triple Crown races, including Tonalist and Matterhorn, who each wound up playing {{a major role in the}} race. Anticipating the possibility of a Triple Crown champion, several people connected to the last three Triple Crown winners came to the Belmont, including 92-year-old Penny Chenery, owner of Secretariat; Patrice Wolfson, who co-owned Affirmed; and some of Seattle Slew's connections—trainer Billy Turner and co-owner Jim Hill. The jockeys of the three past Triple Crown winners, Steve Cauthen, Jean Cruguet, and Ron Turcotte, also attended. Cauthen, jockey of Affirmed, stated, [...] "This horse has got a great chance of pulling it off," [...] but added, [...] "you never know, that's why they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the race." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{this was}} his 12th {{published}} novel, Irving said that Last Night in Twisted River was [...] "20 years in the making". The idea for a novel about a cook and his son on the run {{had been in the}} back of his mind for as long ago as 1986. Irving, who likes to start his novels with the last sentence, said in an interview with The Independent in October 2009: [...] "For the longest time the last sentence eluded me, but 20 years ago I imagined a novel about a cook and his young son who become fugitives; who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from some violent act that will follow them. And it was always in a kind of frontier town — a place where there was one law, and it was one man, who was single-minded and bad." [...] Irving did not start writing the novel until 2005. Speaking to the BBC World Service in October 2009, Irving explained that he found that last sentence on his way to a doctor's appointment. He said an old Bob Dylan CD was playing [...] "Tangled Up in Blue" [...] in his car, and when he heard the lyrics: ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{handling}} of ground combat {{received the most}} substantial criticism. Computer Gaming World's editorial staff wrote that the game's real-time combat system was [...] "handled so fast that players didn't have a chance in 90% of the battles." [...] According to reviewer L.S. Lichtmann, [...] "many are disappointed because the phased, tactical system of Traveller has been modified to have arcade game characteristics." [...] He also stated that the player does not compete on a [...] "level playing field" [...] {{when he or she}} must issue commands in real-time to individual party members engaged in combat while the computer simultaneously controls multiple non-player characters. Paragon responded to these criticisms by releasing an updated version of the game which gave the player the ability to pause the combat to issue orders to party members. But even after this update, some reviewers still found that, whenever possible, it is still far easier for the party to flee from ground combat situations than to fight. Moreover, immediately after the player assumes control of the party {{at the start of the}} game, it is attacked by well-armed opponents. The Computer Gaming World editorial staff criticized this design choice by stating that the [...] "player would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away from the first encounter or be killed within two minutes of spending 30 minutes to an hour generating a character." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bears {{opened the}} season hosting rival Green Bay Packers, the 191st meeting in the two teams' history and the third season opener in which both teams played each other in Chicago; the Bears held a 93–91–6 all-time lead, and also led the series in season opener record with 17–12–2. However, the Packers had won nine of the last ten games between the two, {{including}} the last game, a 55–14 victory at Lambeau Field. WBBM-TV analyst Jeff Joniak believed the Bears would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> to gain an advantage against the Packers; when Chicago played Green Bay in week four last season, the latter had the 30th-ranked run defense, and allowed 235 rushing yards in that game. Additionally, the offense had to avoid drives that required long yardage, as the Bears had scored 74 points outside of the red zone (the 29th-best in the league), while also protecting [...] quarterback Jay Cutler from linebackers Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews III. On defense, the new 3–4 defense faced a fast-paced Green Bay offense featuring quarterback Aaron Rodgers and tailback Eddie Lacy. The Rodgers-led Packers, who led the NFC North in touchdowns with 58, along with having the highest average yards per play (6.17) in the NFL in 2014, also provided a challenge for the Bears defensive backs; blitzing Rodgers was also a liability, as he had a league-best 130.4 rating with 15 touchdowns and one interception against the blitz. However, the Packers did not have receiver Jordy Nelson, who had caught 13 touchdowns in 2014, as he had suffered an ACL tear during the preseason. [...] quarteback David Fales, cornerback Tracy Porter, runningback Ka'Deem Carey, linebacker Jon Bostic, center Hroniss Grasu, tackle Tayo Fabuluje and receiver Cameron Meredith were inactive for the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} Australian {{season he}} became captain of New South Wales following {{the retirement of}} Kippax and the departure of Bradman to South Australia. However, with Australia touring South Africa in 193536, McCabe did not represent his state. However, he was made vice-captain to Vic Richardson for the tour, with Woodfull and Ponsford having retired, and Bradman ill. McCabe enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs at 84.00. After scoring 24, 65 and 29 in three warm-up matches, {{all of which were}} won by innings, McCabe hit 149 in the First Test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with Bill Brown in gale-force conditions which caused balls to make U-turns in the headwind, forced the umpires to glue the bails to the wickets using chewing gum, to set up a nine-wicket victory. In the following Test in Johannesburg, McCabe made 34 as Australia took a first innings lead of 93. However, Dudley Nourse scored 235 to help the hosts to 491; McCabe removed Nourse and ended with 2/30. Australia were set a Test world record target of 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a turning wicket, and McCabe told captain Richardson {{that he would not be}} able to bat or run between wickets effectively because of altitude sickness. Regarding McCabe was his most important batsman, Richardson implored him to bat and told him to simply stand his ground and hit boundaries so that he would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> McCabe joined Fingleton at 1/17 before taking the score to 1/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility on a wicket with irregular bounce and lateral deviation, McCabe resumed on 38 and scored a century in the morning session to reach lunch at 138, after Fingleton was dismissed at 2/194. The pair had put on 177 runs for the second wicket, and McCabe had done more than four fifths of the scoring. McCabe had reached his century in only 90 minutes, and continued on despite a storm that brought low dust clouds and hindered visibility, and increasingly irregular bounce and cut off the pitch. Midway through the afternoon, dark clouds gathered, along with thunderstorms and lightning, but this had no effect on the batsman. McCabe pushed the score to 2/274, and with only 125 runs needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, Herbie Wade, the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear [...] "for the fieldsmen's safety" [...] in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting. He finished unbeaten on 189, an innings described by Fingleton as [...] "bordering on miraculous". McCabe struck 24 fours, and was productive square of the wicket, hitting numerous cut shots past point. Fingleton further added that “McCabe never put a foot or his bat in a false position”, and that he “pulverized the South African attack into the dust”. McCabe was unable to maintain such a standard of performance in the remaining three Tests; he scored a duck, 40 and one, as Australia won each by an innings. He ended the series with three wickets at 45.33. However, he scored consecutive centuries in the tour matches, adding 115 and 112 against Border and Orange Free State.|$|E
