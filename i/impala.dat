5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the <b>impala</b> as {{a species}} of least concern overall. The black-faced <b>impala,</b> however, is {{classified}} as a vulnerable species; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. Though there are no major threats {{to the survival of}} the common <b>impala,</b> poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced <b>impala.</b> As of 2008, the population of the common <b>impala</b> has been estimated at around two million. According to some studies, translocation of the black-faced <b>impala</b> can be highly beneficial in its conservation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Impala</b> are symbiotically {{related to}} oxpeckers, which feed on ticks from {{those parts of}} the antelope's body which the animal cannot access by itself (such as the ears, neck, eyelids, {{forehead}} and underbelly). The <b>impala</b> is the smallest ungulate with which oxpeckers are associated. In a study it was observed that oxpeckers selectively attended to <b>impala</b> despite the presence of other animals such as Coke's hartebeest, Grant's gazelle, Thompson's gazelle and topi. A possible explanation for this could be that because the <b>impala</b> inhabits woodlands (which can have a high density of ticks), the <b>impala</b> could have greater mass of ticks per unit area of the body surface. Another study showed that the oxpeckers prefer the ears over other parts of the body, probably because these parts show maximum tick infestation.|$|E
5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced <b>impala</b> is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced <b>impala</b> is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced <b>impala.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>impala</b> {{occurs in}} {{woodlands}} and sometimes {{on the interface}} (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced <b>impala</b> is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common <b>impala</b> is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the <b>impala</b> as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|According to Vrba, the <b>impala</b> {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically different forms, the <b>impala</b> has continued in its basic form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the <b>impala</b> has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could {{have played a role in}} preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Around {{a quarter}} of the common <b>impala</b> populations occur in {{protected}} areas, such as the Okavango Delta (Botswana); Masai Mara and Kajiado (Kenya); Kruger National Park (South Africa); the Ruaha and Serengeti National Parks and Selous Game Reserve (Tanzania); Luangwa Valley (Zambia); Hwange, Sebungwe and Zambezi Valley (Zimbabwe). The rare black-faced <b>impala</b> has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the Etosha National Park. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one <b>impala</b> per square kilometre in Mkomazi National Park (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influences of various natural and anthropogenic factors on the vigilance and flight behaviour of <b>impalas</b> in the Save Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe, using multivariate statistical techniques. The factor that most significantly affected the proportions of time that individuals spent being vigilant and their rates of vigilance was {{the position of a}} focal animal in the group; <b>impalas</b> on the periphery of a group were more vigilant than central <b>impalas.</b> Both measures of vigilance were also negatively related to group size. Males spent more total time being vigilant but females raised their heads more often. <b>Impalas</b> spent more time being vigilant in the late afternoon than in the early morning, when greater than ten metres from cover, and when predators had been nearby within the previous six hours. <b>Impalas</b> spent more time vigilant at the property where more <b>impalas</b> were hunted, possibly reflecting the differences in the intensity of hunting by humans on the two properties. Flight distances at the approach of humans were significantly greater at one property than the other, and were also greater for small groups. Further research into the effects of hunting by humans on animals 2 ̆ 7 antipredator behaviours would provide valuable insights for wildlife managers...|$|R

5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from <b>impala</b> include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. <b>Impala</b> have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that <b>impala</b> adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Impala</b> browse {{as well as}} graze; either may predominate, {{depending}} upon the availability of resources. The diet comprises monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). <b>Impala</b> prefer places close to water sources, and resort to succulent vegetation if water is scarce. An analysis showed that the diet of <b>impala</b> is composed of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits; the proportion of grasses in the diet increases significantly (to as high as 90%) after the first rains, but declines in the dry season. Browsing predominates in the late wet and dry season, and diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when <b>impala</b> feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study showed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.|$|E

5|$|Lice {{recorded}} from <b>impala</b> include Damalinia aepycerus, D. elongata, Linognathus aepycerus and L. nevilli; in a study, ivermectin (a medication against parasites) {{was found}} to have an effect on Boophilus decoloratus and Linognathus species, though not on Damalinia species. In a study of <b>impala</b> in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when <b>impala</b> turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema. Haemonchus, Impalaia, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the <b>impala</b> – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced <b>impala</b> is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common <b>impala</b> has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in Gabon and across southern Africa.|$|E

Although it usually accounted for only {{a small proportion of}} the total louse burden, its overall prevalence exceeded 27 %. Its prevalence on adult male <b>impalas</b> (9 %) was significantly lower (P = 0. 004) than that on adult females (39 %), but did not differ among age classes. However, the intensity of L. weisseri infestation was higher on lambs than on yearlings and adults, and peaked on <b>impalas</b> in late winter to early summer.

5|$|Active mainly {{during the}} day, the <b>impala</b> may be gregarious or {{territorial}} {{depending upon the}} climate and geography. Three distinct social groups can be observed: the territorial males, bachelor herds and female herds. The <b>impala</b> is known for two characteristic leaps that constitute an anti-predator strategy. Browsers as well as grazers, <b>impala</b> feed on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits and acacia pods (whenever available). An annual, three-week-long rut takes place {{toward the end of}} the wet season, typically in May. Rutting males fight over dominance, and the victorious male courts female in oestrus. Gestation lasts six to seven months, following which a single calf is born and immediately concealed in cover. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males—forced out of the all-female groups—join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|<b>Impala</b> feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. <b>Impala</b> {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest are {{the most}} {{commonly}} taken medium-sized ungulate prey item in both Ngorongoro and the Serengeti, with zebra and Thomson's gazelles coming close behind. Cape buffalo are rarely attacked {{due to differences in}} habitat preference, though adult bulls have been recorded to be taken on occasion. In Kruger National Park, blue wildebeest, cape buffalo, Burchell's zebra, greater kudu and <b>impala</b> are the spotted hyena's most important prey, while giraffe, <b>impala,</b> wildebeest and zebra are its major food sources in the nearby Timbavati area. Springbok and kudu are the main prey in Namibia's Etosha National Park, and springbok in the Namib. In the southern Kalahari, gemsbok, wildebeest and springbok are the principal prey. In Chobe, the spotted hyena's primary prey consists of migratory zebra and resident <b>impala.</b> In Kenya's Masai Mara, 80% of the spotted hyena's prey consists of topi and Thomson's gazelle, save for during the four-month period when zebra and wildebeest herds migrate to the area. Bushbuck, suni and buffalo are the dominant prey items in the Aberdare Mountains, while Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, sheep, goats and cattle are likely preyed upon in northern Kenya. In west Africa, it is thought that the spotted hyena is primarily a scavenger, but will occasionally attack domestic stock and medium-size antelopes in some areas. In Cameroon, it is common for spotted hyenas to feed on small antelopes like kob, but may also scavenge on reedbuck, kongoni, buffalo, giraffe, African elephant, topi and roan antelope carcasses. Records indicate that spotted hyenas in Malawi feed on medium to large-sized ungulates such as waterbuck and <b>impala.</b> In Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, spotted hyenas primarily prey on wildebeest, followed by buffalo, zebra, <b>impala,</b> giraffe, reedbuck and kongoni. In Uganda, it is thought that the species primarily preys on birds and reptiles, while in Zambia it is primarily a scavenger.|$|E
