These guidelines are valid for any elliptical orbit, regardless of eccentricity. Although maneuvers required for formation establishment, reconfiguration, and station-keeping require accurate prediction of the state estimate to the maneuver time, and hence are directly affected by errors in all the orbital elements, experience has shown that determination of orbit plane orientation and orbit shape to acceptable levels is less challenging than the determination of orbital period or semi-major axis. Furthermore, any differences among the member <b>s</b> semi-major <b>axes</b> are undesirable for a satellite formation, since {{it will lead to}} differential along-track drift due to period differences.

Fibrobacter succinogenes <b>S</b> 85 <b>Axe</b> 6 B (FSUAxe 6 B) is an acetyl xylan esterase encoded in the genome of this rumen bacterium. The enzyme is a modular protein comprised of an esterase domain, a carbohydrate-binding module, and a region of unknown function. Sequences that are homologous to the region of unknown function are paralogously distributed, thus far, only in F. succinogenes. Therefore, the sequences were desig-nated Fibrobacter succinogenes-specific paralogous module 1 (FPm- 1). The FPm- 1 s are associated with at least 24 polypeptides in the genome of F. succinogenes S 85. A bioinformatics search showed that most of the FPm- 1 -appended polypeptides are putative carbohydrate-active enzymes, suggesting a potential role in car-bohydrate metabolism. Truncational analysis of FSUAxe 6 B, together with catalytic and substrate binding studies, has allowed us to delineate the functional modules in the polypeptide. The N-terminal half of FSUAxe 6 B harbors the activity that cleaves side chain acetyl groups from xylan-like substrates, and the binding of insoluble xylan was determined to originate from FPm- 1. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of highly conserved active-site residues in the esterase domain suggested that the esterase activity is derived from a tetrad composed of Ser 44, His 273, Glu 194, and Asp 270, with both Glu 194 and Asp 270 functioning as helper acids...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{kinds of}} axes are {{described}} as achromatic in the vision science literature: those of Le Grand and Ivanoff, originally proposed in the 1940 s, and those of Thibos and Bradley proposed in the 1990 <b>s.</b> Thibos–Bradley <b>axes</b> are based on chief nodal rays, that is, nodal rays that intersect the pupil at its center. By contrast Le Grand–Ivanoff achromatic axes are pupil independent. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop the linear optics of Thibos–Bradley achromatic axes and to examine the sense in which such axes can be said to be achromatic. Linear optics is used to define the chief nodal ray of an arbitrary optical system whose refracting elements may be heterocentric and astigmatic and with nonaligned principal meridians. The incident segment of the ray then defines what is called here the incident chief nodal axis and the emergent segment the emergent chief nodal axis. When applied to an eye they become the external and retinal chief nodal axes of the eye. The axes are infinite straight lines. Equations are derived, in terms of the properties of the eye, for the inclination and transverse positions of both axes at incidence onto the eye. An equation is also derived for the position of the retinal chief nodal axis at the retina. The locations of the axes are calculated for a particular model eye in Appendix A. The equations are specialized for the system consisting of an eye and a pinhole in front of it. For a reduced eye the external and retinal chief nodal axes coincide and are independent of the frequency of light; and, hence, the Thibos–Bradley axes are strictly achromatic for that eye. However for more complicated eyes this is not usually the case; the external and retinal axes are usually distinct, dependent on frequency, and, hence, not strictly achromatic. It seems appropriate, therefore, to reserve the term achromatic axis for axes of the Le Grand–Ivanoff type and generalizations thereof, and to call Thibos–Bradley axes chief nodal axes...|$|R

Patterns, orientations, dimensional parameters and other outcrop-scale characteristics of the various deformation features are illustrated and their genetic mechanisms and timing of development are inferred. These new structural data and interpretations allow a better constraint of the structural style and evolution of the Pisco Basin, and can represent useful guidelines for characterizing the outcrop-scale deformation affecting similar forearc basins along the Peruvian coast. Major {{results of this study}} are that the development of the documented deformation features, their patterns, dimensional parameters and kinematics seem influenced by local perturbations of the paleostress field by mechanic processes partly independent of plate tectonics forces. These processes include strain localization on both pre-existing and progressively forming new structural discontinuities, and cyclic switches of the horizontal, principal stress <b>axes</b> <b>s</b> 2 and s 3. In particular, we discuss how different normal fault patterns, from sub-parallel to multidirectional/polygonal, could form in a same deformation phase in response of the local s 2 /s 3 magnitude ratio, as an evolution of stratabound, mutually orthogonal vein set...|$|R

IL- 6 is a multifaceted pleiotropic cytokine, which is produced {{by a variety of}} cell types and targets different cells and tissues. In physiological conditions, IL- 6 can be locally and transiently produced by skeletal muscle and {{plays an important role in}} muscle homeostasis. Circulating IL- 6 levels are normally very low or undetectable but are dramatically increased in several pathologic conditions. In this study, we aimed to define the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of IL- 6 on myogenic program. We explored the molecular mechanisms through which exogenous IL- 6, or the conditioned medium from the murine C- 26 adenocarcinoma cells (a cellular model that secretes high levels of IL- 6 and induces cancer cachexia in mice), interferes with the myogenic program. Our study revealed that IL- 6 induces the activation of the Stat 3 signaling and promotes the downmodulation of the p 90 RSK/eEF 2 andmTOR/p 70 <b>S</b> 6 K <b>axes,</b> while it does not affect the activation of AKT. We thus identified potential molecular mediators of the inhibitory effects of IL- 6 on myogenic program. 1...|$|R

Diagrams Showing Equal-Area Plots of Quartz and Mica Subfabrics of Six Orientated SpecimensThe {{rocks of}} the Oriflmmne Mountains of southeastern San Diego County are metamorphosed quartz sandstones, siltstones, and {{calcareous}} argillaceous rock (?) intruded by the Bonsall tonalite (mid-Cretaceous) and pegmatite of presumed mid-Cretaceous age. Mineral assemblages indicate metamorphism of high grade amphibolite facies. The metamorphic rocks exhibit appressed cylindroidal folds with monoclinic symmetry in bedding (S 1) and transposed bedding surfaces (<b>S</b> 2). The <b>axes</b> of these folds trend north-northwest with average plunge of 25 ??. The poles to the axial planes (S 3) of the mesoscopic folds are spread {{on a great}} circle arc, the normal to which coincides with the regional megascopic fold axis BS 1 S 2 S 2. A slip cleavage (S 4) is developed subparallel to the axial planes of the megascopic folds. S 4, which strikes north-northwest with an average dip of 80 ?? east, parallels S 1 S 2 in some subfields. The symmetry of both field and microscopic structures is monoclinic (C 1 H). Deformation was probably accomplished by early flexural slip folding of S 1 and S 2 about an axis parallel to BS 1 S 2 with development of S 3 (kinemetically active folding stage). Coaxial refolding followed and as slip {{could no longer be}} accommodated on S 1 -S 2, S 4 was developed accompanied by rotation of S 3 about BS 1 S 2 S 3 (passive folding stage). Slip on S 4 is thought to have been normal to the axis S 4...|$|R
40|$|Fertilizer {{spreaders}} {{are traditionally}} tested {{by using the}} collecting tray method. This method requires large indoor test facilities and is very expensive when applied on a large scale. A proposed alternative method is to measure the velocity and diameter of individual fertilizer particles emanating from the spreader and use a model to predict the landing spot of individual particles. The total spread pattern follows from accumulating {{a large number of}} particle landing spots. An optical device for measuring the velocity vector and dimensions of individual fertilizer particles was developed. The system proved capable of measuring the velocity of a 4 mm particle travelling at 29 m / s within an accuracy of 5 % and dimensions within 2 %. Two forms of the detector are discussed, namely, one and two dimensional versions respectively.
