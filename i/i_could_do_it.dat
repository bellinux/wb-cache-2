5|$|Though Caravan had yet {{to achieve}} strong {{commercial}} success in 1970, they had started to build a live following, including an appearance at the Kralingen Pop Festival in the Netherlands {{to an audience of}} 250,000 and the 10th Plumpton Festival. In between touring, the group had written several new pieces that they wanted to record. Having had problems self-producing the previous album, If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You, the group decided to collaborate with producer David Hitchcock. Hitchcock had become a fan of the band and had been a key figure in getting them signed to Decca Records. He had progressed from the label's art department to production and was keen to work on the album. The group had been apprehensive about Hitchcock working on If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> All Over Again... but after discovering his enthusiasm and creative ideas, decided {{it would be a good}} idea to enrol him as producer.|$|E

500|$|English writer Brian Sibley found Travers still gun-shy {{from her}} {{experiences}} with Disney {{when he was}} hired in the 1980s to write a possible Mary Poppins sequel. Sibley reported that Travers told him, [...] "I could only agree if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> on my own terms. I'd {{have to work with}} someone I trust." [...] Regardless, while watching the original film together—the first time Travers had seen it since the premiere—she became excited at times and thought certain aspects were excellent, while others were unappealing. The sequel never went to production, and when approached to do a stage adaptation in the 1990s, she only acquiesced on the condition that English-born writers and no one from the film production were to be directly involved with the musical's development.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|Protests were {{scheduled}} for the film's Italian premiere in Viareggio, Italy, by unspecified organizations. The protesters objected to the plotline of a Partisan collaborating with the Nazis.

[...] McBride, the novel's author, stated: [...] "As a black American, I understand what it's like for someone to tell your history... unfortunately, the history of World War Two here in Italy is ours as well, and this was the best <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do...</b> <b>it</b> is, after all, a work of fiction.” ...|$|E

But I am so incensed against the oppresions from England, and have so little regard to the laws they make, that I do, as a clergyman, encourage the merchants both to export wool and woollen manufactures to any country in Europe, or anywhere else, and conceal it from the Custom-house officers, as I would hide my purse from a highwayman, if he came to rob me on the road, although England hath made a law to the contrary; and so I would encourage our booksellers here to sell your author's books printed here, and send them to all the towns in England, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with safety and profit; because I repeat, it is no offence against God, or the laws of the country I live in.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the Breaking Bad staff decided {{early on that}} Gus would not speak much during the scene because they felt it was more {{dramatic}} that way and more appropriate for his character. Esposito felt the scene was a pivotal moment not only for his character, but for Gus' relationship with Walter, and a warning that Walter should continue to operate Gus' way or risk death. Regarding his character's murder of Victor, Esposito said: [...] "This had to be done. Someone did something, they got seen. ... It was about survival. This had to be done, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{in a way that}} also sent a message to the people who weren't listening." [...] Bryan Cranston said he was not expecting the episode to take the direction it did. He called the scene [...] "painful, but beautifully crafted, and reasonably so", and commented on the contrast between Gus' calm demeanor and Walter's [...] "tap-dancing to stay alive". Cranston said of Esposito's performance, [...] "When he plays that bad character, his eyes go dead, and all it takes is to look into his eyes." [...] Gilligan said although Gus' actions in the scene were scripted, [...] "You'd be surprised how little I talked to Giancarlo about how he played that part ... This is a man with amazing instincts." ...|$|E
500|$|The Flyers had a {{difficult}} start to the 1987–88 season, partly attributed by Keenan {{to the absence of}} Hextall. Hextall returned to the Flyers line-up against the New York Rangers, and made over 40saves in a 2–2 tie. Just over a month later, Hextall became the first goaltender to shoot at goal and score in the NHL when he scored an empty net goal towards the end of a game against the Boston Bruins. The Flyers led 4–2 which prompted the Bruins to pull their goaltender in favour of an extra attacker. The puck was dumped into the Philadelphia zone by the Bruins, and Hextall picked it up without any players near him; his shot fired into the air, bounced and rolled into the net. Hextall had targeted becoming the [...] "first NHL goaltender to score a true goal" [...] over a year earlier, and, speaking after the game, commented that: [...] "I knew <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> It was a matter of when." [...] Despite his early season suspension, and a shoulder injury late in the season which made him miss five games, Hextall played 62of the 67games for which he was available during the regular season. He recorded 30wins, and a GAA of3.50, slightly higher than during his rookie year. Hextall struggled in the playoffs: he was replaced in successive games of the series against the Washington Capitals having conceded four goals in each. In the final two games of the series, which the Capitals won 4–3, Hextall gave up a further 12goals, and completed the playoffs with a GAA of4.75.|$|E

500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E
