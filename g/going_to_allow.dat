500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Bosman ruling in 1995 had negative consequences for Ajax in the 1996–97 season. The club lost several players, and reinvested poorly according to Winner. Injuries also affected their challenge for honours; many players were exhausted {{as a result of}} UEFA Euro 1996 and the short summer break that came with it. Chairman Michael van Praag was determined to keep the club's players and revealed Overmars had signed a four-year contract in 1996. He added, [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> them to break their contracts so they are not leaving." [...] On the pitch, Overmars made his return from injury against AZ on 28 August 1996. He had his least productive season for Ajax, scoring two goals. The club finished the season in fourth position.|$|E

In his first appearance of the season on April 24, Feller suffered an injury to his elbow while throwing a curveball. He spent April and May healing the arm, and in May graduated from high school; the ceremony aired nationally on NBC Radio. In mid-May, the Indians considered ending Feller's season early. [...] "We're not taking any chances on that arm and we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> him to pitch again until the last trace of soreness has disappeared", said Slapnicka. On May 18 Feller appeared in his first game since April 24 but did not record an out. He did not pitch again until June 22, when he recorded two innings, then returned to normal pitching duties on July 4.|$|E

During his term he {{commissioned}} a review into {{the effectiveness of}} the syllabus at RAAF College for meeting the future needs of the Air Force in an age of missiles and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. Promoted air marshal, he became Chief of the Air Staff in March 1957, succeeding Air Marshal Sir John McCauley. Long identified as a strong contender for the RAAF's senior role, Scherger was described by Air Marshal Hardman as [...] "easily the best material on offer". He declared that as an administrator he was [...] "not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> myself to be bogged down with minor matters of detail...Broad policy comes from the top.

He particularly praised the Michael/Pam relationship in the episode, as well as soccer subplot involving Jim and Charles {{and the return of}} Ryan; he said Ryan's new bleached blond hair and his theft of bowling shoes were particularly funny moments. Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode has provided a change the show needed, and said, [...] "Considering how unlikely it was that The Office was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> Michael and Pam to degrade into homelessness and squalor, the show has handled the predictable transition as well as possible." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the episode included a good exploration of Michael and Pam's relationship; he said [...] "they're weirdly good together". Phipps, who gave the episode an A- grade, also said the Dunder Mifflin material worked well, [...] "although Idris Elba has been so good at portraying a heartless professional it almost doesn’t seem right for anything to break through his icy exterior." ...|$|E

Disillusioned {{by the way the}} British tabloids portrayed her personal life, Winslet moved base to New York. She wed Mendes in May 2003 on the island of Anguilla. Their son, Joe, was born later that year.

Amidst intense media speculation of an affair between Mendes and the actress Rebecca Hall, the couple announced their separation in 2010 and were divorced a year later. Winslet admitted to being heartbroken by the split, but remarked that [...] "there's no way I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> my children to be fucked up because my marriages haven't worked out".|$|E
