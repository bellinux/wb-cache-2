40|$|ABSTRACTFloating {{production}} {{storage and}} offloading (FPSO) facilities are used {{at most of}} the offshore oil fields worldwide. FPSO usage {{is expected to grow}} as oil fields move to deeper water, thus requiring the reliability and stability of mooring wires and risers in extreme environmental conditions. Except for the case of predictable attack angles of external loadings, FPSO facilities with turret single point mooring (SPM) systems are in general use. There are two types of turret systems: permanent systems and <b>disconnectable</b> turret mooring systems. Extreme environment criteria for permanent moorings are usually based on a 100 -year return period event. It is common to use two or three environments including the 100 -year wave with associated wind and current, and the 100 -year wind with associated waves and current. When fitted with a <b>disconnectable</b> turret mooring system, FPSOs can be used in areas where it is desirable to remove the production unit from the field temporarily to prevent exposure to extreme events such as cyclones or large icebergs.

40|$|Different {{grades of}} {{chemically}} functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been processed by spraying layer-by-layer (sLbL) {{to obtain an}} array of chemoresistive transducers for volatile organic compound (VOC) detection. The sLbL process led to random networks of CNT less conductive, but more sensitive to vapors than filtration under vacuum (bucky papers). Shorter CNT were also {{found to be more}} sensitive due to the less entangled and more easily <b>disconnectable</b> conducting networks they are making. Chemical functionalization of the CNT’ surface is changing their selectivity towards VOC, which makes it possible to easily discriminate methanol, chloroform and tetrahydrofuran (THF) from toluene vapors after the assembly of CNT transducers into an array to make an e-nose. Interestingly, the amplitude of the CNT transducers’ responses can be enhanced by a factor of five (methanol) to 100 (chloroform) by dispersing them into a polymer matrix, such as poly(styrene) (PS), poly(carbonate) (PC) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). COOH functionalization of CNT was found to penalize their dispersion in polymers and to decrease the sensors’ sensitivity. The resulting conductive polymer nanocomposites (CPCs) not only allow for a more easy tuning of the sensors’ selectivity by changing the chemical nature of the matrix, but they also allow them to adjust their sensitivity by changing the average gap between CNT (acting on quantum tunneling in the CNT network). Quantum resistive sensors (QRSs) appear promising for environmental monitoring and anticipated disease diagnostics that are both based on VOC analysis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} and {{analysis}} of subsea structures, the hydrodynamic coefficients {{play a significant role}} in determining the behaviour of the system, particularly when they are under the combined action of steady and oscillatory flow. For small regularly shaped structures and slender members there is a significant amount of literature that provides assistance in the selection of suitable values, however this is not the case for larger and irregular shaped structures where there is a scarcity of information. This paper details the results of a study to develop techniques to derive hydrodynamic coefficients for representative mid water arch configurations commonly used in shallow water flexible riser system applications. The results of a literature review are presented outlining where these structures fit into the different theoretical models. The use of the potential flow approach is verified by means of computational fluid dynamic simulations for a representative structure and both methods are utilised to assist in the generation of appropriate coefficients. A case study on a typical shallow water North Sea project is presented that demonstrates the importance of selecting appropriate hydrodynamic values to represent the structure. The influence of each of the coefficients on the arch motion, which has an impact on the riser response, is studied. It is shown that it is not always possible to be conservative and instead it is important to select appropriate coefficients for the structure in question, which may differ from those typically used. The method developed has wide ranging applicability and can in principle be applied to the determination of hydrodynamic coefficients for other large structures subject to hydrodynamic loading, including <b>disconnectable</b> turret buoys and hybrid riser tower systems...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{report the}} {{clinical}} and angiographic {{results of the}} OPEN I study, a multicentre prospective single-arm study evaluating both the drug-eluting and bare metal STENTYS® stents {{in the treatment of}} coronary bifurcation lesions. Methods and results: The STENTYS® stent is a provisional, self-expanding, nitinol stent with small interconnections that can be disconnected by balloon angioplasty in between the stent struts to provide access to the side branch (SB) and full ostium coverage. In nine European centres, 60 stents (33 BMS, 27 DES) were implanted in 63 patients (procedural success of 95. 2 %). Angiographic QCA and IVUS were used to measure acute gain and late loss. The Medina classification showed 35 patients (58 %) had disease affecting the SB (true bifurcations) and 19 patients (32 %) had disease in all three arms. The average bifurcation angulation pre-stenting was 60 ° ± 21 °. Post-stenting, disconnection was performed on 90 % of the stents implanted. In 18 cases, disconnection was followed by SB stenting with all SB stents successfully implanted. Post-stenting, the bifurcation angle was 51 °. The primary clinical endpoint, cumulative MACE at six months, was low for DES (3. 7 %) but higher for BMS (27. 3 %) with the latter driven exclusively by clinically-driven TLR rates (3. 7 % vs. 24. 2 %). No cardiac deaths were recorded at six months and one patient had a non-Q wave infarct. The secondary angiographic endpoint of late luminal loss (LLL) was measured for both DES (paclitaxel) and BMS stents in the proximal main branch (MB), MB, distal MB as well as the SB. The values for DES were 0. 39 mm, 0. 42 mm, 0. 40 mm and 0. 16 mm, respectively. The values for BMS were 0. 86 mm, 0. 87 mm, 0. 85 mm and 0. 54 mm, respectively. Observed results using matched IVUS analysis at six months revealed an increase in mean stent area (mm 2) for DES from 7. 52 ± 1. 86 at baseline to 12. 32 ± 2. 90 at six month follow-up (p < 0. 001); and for BMS from 7. 95 ± 1. 40 to 11. 56 ± 2. 22 (p < 0. 001), with no decrease in minimum lumen area (MLA) for DES (5. 10 to 4. 91) and a minimal decrease for BMS (5. 74 to 5. 15). Conclusions: This first-in-man (FIM) study on the STENTYS® stent showed excellent procedural success and a relatively low MACE with competitively low LLL in both MB and SB at six months for the DES version and LLL comparable to other BMS for the BMS version. The <b>disconnectable</b> struts offered excellent "cross over" to T- stenting when necessary and the increased gains in stent area over time...|$|E

40|$|Installing {{deep water}} risers in harsh {{environmental}} conditions {{even in the}} icing environment, {{in the near future}} seems like inevitable. Especially in the Norwegian Sea, the development of deep water technology requires an urgent solution of how to transfer hydrocarbons from sea bed to the host facility in a remote area with considering hostile environment conditions. In every subsea production system combined with a floating facility, the need of risers is a must. Deeper water causes various challenges, for instance; higher payload of the vessel, increase probability of collapse failure of the riser, higher probability for riser failure due to buckling and fatigue issue at the touch-down-point (TDP) as well as presence of Vortex Induce Vibration (VIV) in the long suspended riser span. In addition, the polar climate which is occurring in the Norwegian Sea should be considered during designing, installing and operating of the system which caused this area to be different from other places. In order to reduce excessive floater motions, an uncoupled riser system is introduced. By using buoy elements, the riser system is able decouple the motion effect of the floater, riser and mooring system that may magnify the extreme hull/floater response. This can significantly improve strength and fatigue performance of the riser. This system is widely used in deep water conditions with various riser configurations. In general, an uncoupled riser system consists of two different types of riser concepts (flexible and steel) with buoy in between. There are three main components in this configuration; a flexible jumper that is directly connected to the floater, a sub-surface buoyancy module at the connection point, and a steel riser at the bottom parts. The flexible jumper is used to absorb the floater motions, and the result the configuration gives the optimum riser concept which is best suited for deep water conditions. In this topic, we limit the uncoupled riser configurations into two types; Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) and Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR). The difference between these two riser configurations is at the bottom part and at the connection point; COBRA configures the steel pipe as a catenary riser with a long-slender sub-surface buoyancy module on the top which is tethered down to sea bed via mooring lines while SLOR configures the steel pipe as a tensioned riser by using an air can as a buoyancy module to maintain the riser in tensioned position all time. By means of these riser configurations we have the possibility to use different types of riser arrangements since a standalone flexible riser is very expensive to use in deep water conditions. The main advantage of the two uncoupled riser configurations is that they enable possibilities for the floater to drift/side-step in case of drifting icebergs, which {{will be one of the}} study cases. This thesis focuses on a comparison study of the two uncoupled riser configurations based on ultimate limit state (ULS) and accidental limit state (ALS) results by considering the possibility to avoid/prevent iceberg collision. As explained previously, the risers to be studied are set to be installed in the Norwegian Sea which has harsh environmental conditions. Three different water depths have been chosen on purpose, which are 100 m, 400 m, and 1500 m. In the event of iceberg approach, this thesis work presents two solutions for comparison study. The two solutions are to drift/side-step the floating structure or to disconnect the riser/mooring system using a <b>disconnectable</b> turret. The repot will suggest the optimum solutions; the most suitable uncoupled riser configuration for the Norwegian Sea condition with respect to the riser performance for the case of floater drift off and the geometry of a disconnected riser. Based on detail strength analysis in operating and accidental conditions, this thesis concludes that COBRA riser concept has robust and efficient design to install in the Norwegian Sea conditions. In addition, the COBRA configuration in 1500 m water depth is feasible to perform a 250 m side-stepping in the event of an iceberg approach...|$|E
