40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of research on the phytoseston of the Vistula River along a distance of 163 km. The research was conducted between 1994 and 2010. A total of 218 diatom taxa were identified in the phytoseston. A large number of diatoms were represented by only a few specimens, and, in some cases, only in one of the 312 samples examined. Only nine species had the highest constancy of occurrence in the lower Vistula River; however, mostly periphyton and benthos species predominated the phytoseston in the Vistula River at all of the stations. Most of the species were cosmopolitan. The eutrophic conditions of the Vistula River were confirmed by the great number of eutraphentic diatom taxa. The 86 diatom species identified that have high or very high oxygen requirements confirm that oxygen conditions in the river are <b>good.</b> The <b>ecological</b> <b>potential</b> of the Vistula River was rated based on concentrations of chlorophyll a.

The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the percentage of lakes in England andWales that are likely to fail recently agreed WFD phosphorus standards. As measured lake phosphorus concentrations are only available for a small number of lakes a model-based approach was adopted. This involved estimating phosphorus loads from a wide range of sources including agricultural loads, sewage effluents, septic tanks, diffuse urban sources, atmospheric deposition, groundwater and bank erosion. Lake phosphorus concentrations were predicted using the Vollenweider model, and the model framework was satisfactorily tested against available observed lake concentration data. Applying the model to all lakes in England and Wales greater than 1 ha, it was estimated that under current conditions, roughly two thirds of the lakes would fail <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> status with respect to phosphorus. According to our estimates, agricultural phosphorus loads represent the dominant source for the majority of catchments, but diffuse urban runoff also is important in many lakes and sewage effluents are the most frequent dominant source for lake catchments greater than 100 km 2.

40|$|Background My thesis {{aimed at}} the {{ecological}} evaluation of restored former sewage channels located in the highly urbanised Emscher catchment in western Germany. Prior to restoration the study streams had been used as open sewers for decades and benthic invertebrate life was not possible except for some sewage tolerant Oligochaeta. Restoration measures included the construction of underground sewers for the wastewater, the near-natural remodeling of riparian areas and of the stream bed. The unique situation in the streams of the Emscher catchment allowed to investigate the recolonisation of restored urban streams by benthic invertebrates and follow-up, the restoration success and additionally, the primary factors influencing the recolonisation. According to literature the following factors predominantly influence recolonisation: the recolonisation potential (e. g. Sundermann et al. 2011 a; Tonkin et al. 2014), the species dispersal capability (Cañedo-Argüelles et al. 2015), the environmental conditions and landscape context (Hughes et al. 2008; Reynolds et al. 2013) and the succession processes (McCook 1994). These influencing factors were mainly investigated in streams of the open landscape. Therefore, their influence on the urban streams of the Emscher catchment was analysed in this thesis. For this purpose, new indicators were developed and indicators of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) were used. The WFD aims at improving the chemical and biological quality of European waters. For heavily modified water bodies, like the streams of the Emscher system, {{the goal is to}} reach the “Good Ecological Potential” until 2015 (or under certain circumstances until 2021 or 2027) (European Commission 2000). In summary, this thesis focussed on the ecological evaluation of the three main topics: First, the ecological assessment of the restored streams after restoration according to the WFD and environmental parameters influencing the Good Ecological Potential; second, the primary colonisation by benthic invertebrates after restoration and their recolonisation patterns; and third, the succession of benthic invertebrates communities and environmental parameters steering the succession process. Ecological assessment The thesis starts with an overview of the ecological status of restored sites in the whole Emscher catchment. Based on 248 taxa lists of benthic invertebrates sampled in restored sites by different sampling methods, the analysis focused on the Ecological Potential according to the requirements of the WFD. As possible explanatory parameters for the Ecological Potential, amongst others, riparian land use, stream habitats, and time since restoration were included into a PCA analysis. Almost 40 % of the sites already achieve the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential</b> at the recent sampling. Environmental parameters enhancing the probability of meeting the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential</b> include: connection of restored sites to an unmodified stream section upstream, dead wood in the stream bed, good hydro-morphological structure, deciduous riparian vegetation and unsealed surface in the stream´s surrounding, while the occurrence of iron ochre and sewage overflows located upstream of the sampling sites hinder the achievement of the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential.</b> This study also reveals that the Ecological Potential of the restored streams in the Emscher system is only indirectly determined by the factor time. Although the statistical analysis presented this factor as most influencing, in the minority of cases a parallel development of the Ecological Potential and time was found. Instead, the above mentioned environmental conditions of a restored site are of greater importance for the assessment and the achievement of the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential.</b> In conclusion, the factor “time since restoration” must be interpreted as a proxy for the overall development of the (aquatic and terrestrial) habitats in and at the restored sites. Recolonisation The recolonisation success and a good ecological assessment of the streams are amongst others dependent on recolonisation sources and the dispersal capabilities of taxa. Therefore, in a second step I analysed the recolonisation processes by benthic invertebrates. For this analysis, the case study catchment of the Boye, a 77 km² sub-catchment of the Emscher was chosen. This catchment has a high number of restored streams with almost the same ecological conditions as the whole Emscher catchment. In the spring 2012, seven restored sites connected to near-natural upstream sections were sampled, which were never used as sewage channels and are in good status morphologically. Furthermore, six unconnected restored sites were sampled. Restoration measures had been conducted between one and 19 years before sampling. Additionally, 21 near-natural sites within the catchment and eleven near-natural sites in neighbouring catchments were sampled. Near-natural sites were considered to be potential source sites from which benthic invertebrates might colonise the restored sites. 128 taxa were recorded and were categorised into five dispersal classes reflecting dispersal capabilities and degree of ecological specialisation, according to a literature review. Assemblages at restored sites were characterised by lower numbers of taxa and/or high abundances of hololimnic taxa and poorly dispersing winged species and by higher species numbers and abundance of strongly dispersing generalists. A recolonisation sequence was derived from the observed patterns, in which winged, strongly dispersing generalists colonised most rapidly and were followed by hololimnic species, weakly dispersing generalists and habitat specialists. Restored sites connected to near-natural upstream sections were colonised more rapidly than unconnected restored sites, particularly by habitat specialists. Almost 90 % of the recolonisation events originated from sources within a distance of 5 km. A succession from pioneer assemblages to more mature communities, which resembles that of the surrounding near-natural sites, was observed. In summary, assemblages in connected, restored sites needed 9 to 19 years to reach maturation, while the settlement of assemblages in unconnected sites are expected to require more time. Succession While successional changes of assemblages in lakes or wetlands are well documented, these processes are poorly understood in streams. Following stream restoration and primary recolonisation the benthic invertebrate assemblage is also supposed to undergo a succession, as new habitats have been generated. These successional changes are important to predict the taxonomical development, thus indirectly the development of the ecological assessment, of restored sites. Therefore, the same 13 sites in the seven restored streams as of the Boye sub-catchment in chapter 3 were investigated again in the spring 2013. For each site environmental parameters expected to steer the succession process were collected. Their influence on the inter-annual taxonomical change was tested with correlation analyses (Spearman’s rho). The 21 near-natural sites within the Boye catchment and 11 near-natural sites in neighbouring catchments sampled in 2012 served again as source sites for the analysis. Within 1 year time, the restored sites have undergone further succession, which lead to a higher resemblance of their assemblages to those of the source sites. These results were derived from similarity analyses, non-metric multidimensional scaling and therefrom developed change values, which show the taxonomical change of a site after 1 year dependent of the recolonisation sources. The assemblages of young restored sites changed more markedly than assemblages of old restored sites within the time span of 1 year. In the first years after restoration instable assemblages with high abundances of eurytopic pioneer taxa were found, while 5 years after restoration assemblages were increasingly {{similar to those of the}} source sites and mature assemblages were observed 9 to 10 years after restoration. Differences between young restored sites connected and unconnected to near-natural upstream sections were observed, suggesting a strong colonisation with organisms from upstream sections particularly in the first years. The succession towards near-natural assemblages is further supported by recolonisation sources in the surroundings, the presence of gravel/stones at the stream bottom and a low share of urban land use in the surrounding. Especially urban land use is associated with several stressors (e. g. diffuse inputs, morphological degradation, hydraulic stress) leading to unstable, less predictable and less favourable conditions. Conclusion and future prospects From the results of the first study, suggestions, as the creation/enhancement of growth of deciduous woody riparian vegetation along buffer strips of the streams, the reduction and improvement of sewage overflows, the provisioning of a connection to the streams tributaries, and active addition of dead wood to the streams, for further optimisation of the restoration of urban streams were derived. They serve as recommendations to improve restoration measures in the future. Furthermore, the second study showed that the establishment of mature habitat conditions, in particular woody riparian vegetation, is a prerequisite for the recolonisation of habitat specialists, which indicate the maturation progress of a restored site. In the planning phase of a restoration this knowledge can be used to especially create habitats in order to promote the recolonisation of sensitive species. Several streams of the Emscher catchment are still isolated after restoration and not directly connected to colonisation sources. For these streams a possible approach might be an assisted migration of invertebrates, which would not reach these streams on their own. This can probably help to reach the target assemblage and the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential</b> in due course. The results of the second and third study suggest that the invertebrate assemblages will reflect the restoration effects in sense of maturation at earliest 5 years, but more likely a decade, after restoration. Applying the “change value” used in the third study, timeframes for the monitoring of restored sites can be aligned for each river network, dependent of the recolonisation sources of the surrounding and the environmental conditions of the study streams´ catchment. My findings about succession help to set realistic goals in stream restoration. It can be detected at an early stage, whether the restoration target or the achievement of the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential</b> is realistic for a stream or not. Often, the success of a restoration measure initially does not result in the <b>Good</b> <b>Ecological</b> <b>Potential.</b> Nevertheless, it is important to know, whether a site has reached a “small success”, in terms of a taxonomic improvement, after a restoration measure. For this purpose, the dispersal classes of the second study can be used. The dispersal classification is transferable to other catchments and additional taxa could be classified following the described rules. As the number of taxa representing different dispersal classes is more constant than species richness or similarity patterns, dispersal classes could be used as a generic trait to analyse assemblage maturation. Small successes like the recolonisation of demanding taxa can get apparent. To better understand the processes of recolonisation and succession, long term studies, ideally also addressing population genetics, are advisable in the future...|$|E

In particular, the purpose of these case studies was to actively support the CIS working group 2. 2 ''Heavily Modified Water Bodies'' during the development of the European guidance document for the identification and designation of heavily and artificial water bodies. The support was given by cooperating together with the international subgroups ''Navigation'' and ''Hydro Power Generation'' and by participating at European workshops on that topic. The study focuses on the development and testing of criteria to identify significant physical alterations, scenario development of measures to reach the good ecological status and their evaluation within an economic analysis. Furthermore, the identification of the conditions to achieve by establishing criteria for heavily modified water bodies with special emphasis on maximum and <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>potential</b> has been elaborated. Additional results refer to the scales that should be applied for the identification of water bodies, testing of criteria, evaluating ecological status and ecological potential and linking the IMPRESS and HMWB guidance documents produced by the CIS working groups.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive {{requires}} {{member states}} to restore aquatic habitats to good ecological status (quality) by 2015. Good ecological status is defined as slightly different from high status, which, according to the Directive, means negligible human influence. This poses problems enough for restoration of natural habitats but artificial reservoirs are not excluded from the Directive. They must be restored to <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>potential.</b> The meaning of good ecological status is linked to that of 'high' ecological status, the pristine reference condition for aquatic habitats under the Directive. From {{the point of view}} of an ecologist, this is taken to mean the presence of four fundamental characteristics: nutrient parsimony, characteristic biological and physical structure, connectivity within a wider system and adequate size to give resilience of the biological communities to environmental change. These characteristics are strongly interrelated. Ecological potential must bear some relationship to ecological status but since the reference state for ecological quality is near absence of human impact, it is difficult to see how the criteria for ecological status can be applied to a completely man-made entity where the purpose of the dam is deliberately to interfere with the natural characteristics of a river or former natural lake. Rservoirs are disabled lakes, ususally lakcing the diversity and function provided by a littoral zone. Nonetheless, pragmatic approaches to increasing the biodiversity of reservours are reviewed and conclusions drawn as to the likely effectivemess of the legislation...|$|E

40|$|Impairments in {{executive}} functions (EF), {{for example}} planning and impulsivity, are often identified {{in people with}} Human-Immunodeficiency Virus- 1 (HIV). Previous research has predominantly used ‘traditional tests’ such as the Stroop, which do not have <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> validity (Bennett et al., 2005). The main {{aim of this study}} was to assess EF in people with HIV using a battery approach with <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> validity, the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) (Wilson et al., 1996). The study used a comparison pilot design to compare performance on the BADS within a sample of participants with HIV to the published normative data. A total of 20 participants with HIV were assessed (13 men; 7 women). On average, participants scored significantly lower on the BADS relative to normative data.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{pollution}} of an aquatic ecosystem, {{it is necessary to}} analyze not only the levels of chemical pollutants in water, but also those accumulated in the sediment matrix, as well as to assess its ecotoxicological status. The Alqueva reservoir, the largest artificial lake in Europe, was chosen as case study as it constitutes the most important water supply source in southern Portugal. It is located in the Guadiana River Basin, in a semi-arid region with high levels of water scarcity and where agriculture {{is one of the main}} activities. The evaluation of sediments comprised: (1) physical and chemical analysis (grain size, pH, organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus); (2) potentially toxic trace elements (Cu, As, Pb, Cr, Cd, Zn and Ni); and (3) ecotoxicological evaluation with Vibrio fischeri, Thamnocephalus platyurus, Daphnia magna, and Heterocypris incongruens. Total trace element concentrations indicated that As, Cd, and Pb surpassed the Canadian levels for the protection of aquatic life, in most of Alqueva’s sites. The results of the toxicity assessment showed that some locations induced acute and chronic toxicity in the species used. Further, the H. incongruens was the most sensitive species as far as the contamination found in the sediment is concerned, followed by the bacteria V. fischeri. This integrative approach, together with the water column quality assessment, allowed a comprehensive evaluation of the environmental quality of this strongly modified water body and will allow the implementation of remediation strategies to obtain a <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>potential</b> as proposed in the Water Framework Directive...|$|E
40|$|Hydromorphological {{alterations}} due to e. g. {{water storage}} with major {{impacts on the}} aquatic ecology {{are among the most}} widespread pressures on water bodies in Europe. Many of these impacted water bodies have been designated as heavily modified water bodies, and many are expected to need mitigation measures to meet the <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>potential</b> (GEP) and some possibly good ecological status (GES) to fulfil the requirements of the WFD. Among the core activities for the CIS WG ECOSTAT from 2013 onwards, have been to assess the comparability of GEP among countries implementing the WFD. The aims of this activity and hence this report have been to develop a suitable method for assessing comparability (intercalibration), learn from each other to ensure common understanding and emerging good management practice across Europe, as a basis for supplementary guidance on HMWBs issues. In other words; agree on a common understanding on environmental requirements for water bodies impacted by water storage. Several workshops have been arranged and a series of templates have been circulated to national management experts to get a comparison of available measures in mitigation libraries and use thereof. In the present report, the assessment of comparability is based on returned templates from 23 countries. Response is lacking from four countries while three countries have informed ECOSTAT that finalising and use of national libraries is still ongoing. The outcome has been a common terminology and some key findings regarding key ecological functions normally expected to be mitigated by measures in water bodies impacted by water storage to meet the requirements of GEP.

40|$|The quality {{protection}} and {{improvement of the}} aquatic ecosystems and achievement of "good status" for all water bodies until 2015, involved integration of key ecosystem principles into water policies {{and a series of}} new management elements. Thus, the "health" status of aquatic ecosystems is a new objective for European water policy which is reflected in the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, being defined by the biological, morphological and physico-chemical quality components as well as the presence of specific pollutants (synthetic and non-synthetic). In order to achieve good ecological status / <b>good</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>potential</b> for all water bodies (rivers) of Romania, the paper presents an innovative approach regarding monitoring of hydromorphological quality component and its integration in the assessment of ecological status of water bodies. In this approach the river system is seen in the context of stream corridor as a complex of ecosystems which includes not only the river, but also the riparian zone with the species of plants and animals that inhabit this space. The river corridor is responsible for shaping the river bad, retaining the water and sediments, and also constitutes the support for creating a variety of habitats / microhabitats for communities of aquatic organisms underlying the assessment of ecological status of rivers. In this context, the paper presents hydromorphological indicators set identified in accordance with the requirements of the WFD and a hydromorphological classification system of rivers in five quality classes which should represent a scientific basis for the water monitoring and evaluation system and assists in a judicious way the decision makers to improve water quality in Romania...|$|E
