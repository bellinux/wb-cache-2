He also denied ever accusing the Popular Front of Azerbaijan of having anything to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> events, saying that he only meant that the PFA took advantage of the situation to focus the popular resentment on him. Mutalibov stated that after the massacre he called the speaker of the Supreme Soviet of NKAO Artur Mkrtchyan, and the latter assured him that the people of Khojaly were given a corridor to escape, and he only referred to Mkrtchyan's words, without making any assertions as to whether the corridor actually existed.|$|E
25|$|After {{eleven years}} of marriage, George Boleyn {{was arrested in}} May 1536 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, accused of having had sexual {{intercourse}} with his sister, the Queen. Jane likely had little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> accusations, and it is usually Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester who is accredited by contemporaries with having provided the evidence against the Queen and her brother. There was no truth in these rumours, according to {{the vast majority of}} contemporary witnesses, but they provided the legal pretext that the Boleyns' enemies needed to send Lord Rochford to the block. Jane was mentioned only once during the trials, when George Boleyn was asked if the Queen had relayed information about Henry's sexual troubles to her.|$|E

25|$|Carvings {{in stone}} adorned the exteriors and interiors, {{particularly}} the tympanum above the main entrance, which often featured a Christ in Majesty or in Judgement, {{and the large}} wooden crucifix was a German innovation right {{at the start of}} the period. The capitals of columns were also often elaborately carved with figurative scenes. The ensemble of large and well-preserved churches at Cologne, then the largest city north of the Alps, and Segovia in Spain, are among the best places today to appreciate the impact of the new larger churches on a city landscape, but many individual buildings exist, from Durham, Ely and Tournai Cathedrals to large numbers of individual churches, especially in Southern France and Italy.

Reviews in AllMusic, Uncut, Q, Rolling Stone, Paste and PopMatters praised the supplemental material, but with reservations.

Plagenhoef said, [...] "That the band had nothing to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> is beside the point: this is the final word on these records, {{if for no other}} reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era."

500|$|Nick Offerman {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} his performance as Ron Swanson {{during the second}} season. Many reviewers praised Offerman's subtle and understated style of comedy, {{and said he was}} often the funniest part of the scenes he was in. Jonah Weiner of Slate magazine declared Swanson [...] "Parks and Recreations secret weapon" [...] and [...] "vital to the show's improvement". Aziz Ansari, who was particularly acclaimed during the first season for his role as Tom Haverford, received similar praise in the second season as well. Many reviewers were critical of the pairing of Mark and Ann, feeling the couple lacked chemistry and were often the least funny parts of the individual episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons called Mark and Ann the show's [...] "Achilles' heel", and Sandra Gonzalez, also from Entertainment Weekly, wrote, [...] "No matter what they <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> two, I can’t help but be bored." ...|$|E
500|$|Herodotus recounts that Megabates made {{inspections}} {{of the ships}} (probably whilst beached for the night), and came across one ship from Myndus which had not posted any sentries. Megabates ordered his guard to find {{the captain of the}} ship, Scylax, and then had the captain thrust into one of the ship's oar holes with his head outside and his body inside the ship. News reached Aristagoras of the treatment of his friend and he went to Megabates and asked him to reconsider his decision. When Megabates refused to grant Aristagoras's wishes, Aristagoras simply cut the captain loose himself. Predictably, Megabates was furious with Aristagoras, who in turn retorted [...] "But you, what have you to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> matters? Did not Artaphrenes send you to obey me and to sail wherever I bid you? Why are you so meddlesome?". According to Herodotus, Megabates was so enraged by this that he sent messengers to the Naxians to warn them of the approach of the Persian force.|$|E

[...] Over time, more and more personal, social and religious/moral problems would be blamed on alcohol. And not only would it be enough to prevent drunkenness; any consumption of alcohol would come {{to be seen as}} unacceptable. Groups that began by promoting the moderate use of alcohol instead of its abuse- would ultimately form temperance movements and press for the complete and total prohibition of the production and distribution of beverage alcohol.

That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one.

2500|$|If IVF were {{to involve}} the {{fertilisation}} of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then {{this would not be}} an issue.

Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in stem cell research, a field perceived to have ethical issues.|$|E

2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>these</b> baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days I had noticed how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?"
