25|$|Rabbinic Judaism {{was based}} on {{vigorous}} and often contentious debate {{over the meaning of}} the Torah and other sacred texts. One challenge facing the rabbis was to establish the degree of heterodoxy that was acceptable in debate. In this context, Elisha the heretic and Eleazar, who is said to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> Torah, represent two extremes in attitudes towards the Torah; actual rabbis and their arguments had to fit somewhere between these two limits.|$|E

Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover's homosexuality as relying {{on the kind of}} tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected: guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip. He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a homophobic fantasy. He believes only those who <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.|$|E

25|$|A model {{proposed}} by Naqvi et al. (see above) {{is that the}} insula stores {{a representation of the}} pleasurable interoceptive effects of drug use (e.g., the airway sensory effects of nicotine, the cardiovascular effects of amphetamine), and that this representation is activated by exposure to cues that have previously been associated with drug use. A number of functional imaging studies have shown the insula to be activated during the administration of drugs of abuse. Several functional imaging studies have also shown that the insula is activated when drug users are exposed to drug cues, and that this activity is correlated with subjective urges. In the cue-exposure studies, insula activity is elicited when there is no actual change in the level of drug in the body. Therefore, rather than merely representing the interoceptive effects of drug use as it occurs, the insula {{may play a role in}} memory for the pleasurable interoceptive effects of past drug use, anticipation of these effects in the future, or both. Such a representation may give rise to conscious urges that feel as if they arise from within the body. This may make addicts feel as if their bodies need to use a drug, and may result in persons with lesions in the insula reporting that their bodies <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> urge to use, according to this study.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times saw {{the primary}} as [...] "the Gettysburg of the party's internecine strife" [...] {{over control of}} the Democratic National Convention in 1940. Early on, Chandler portrayed himself as a {{supporter}} of Roosevelt – since Roosevelt was popular in Kentucky – but opposed to the New Deal. He pointed to his fiscal conservatism as governor, including reorganizing and downsizing the executive branch and reducing the state's debt. Polls showing Barkley with a comfortable lead and an overwhelming victory by New Deal supporter Claude Pepper in Florida's May Senate primary convinced Chandler to shift his focus from the New Deal. He criticized Barkley as [...] "a stranger to the state" [...] and obliquely referred to [...] "fat, sleek senators who go to Europe and <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> people of Kentucky except when they run for election". Forty years old – 20 years Barkley's junior – he referred to Barkley as [...] "Old Alben".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Erdrick {{arrived at}} Tantegel Castle {{to speak with}} King Lorik and offered his help to defeat the Dragonlord. After searching the land for clues to the Dragonlord's whereabouts, Erdrick found that the Dragonlord lived on an island that could be accessed only via a magical bridge that only a [...] "Rainbow Drop" [...] could generate. After venturing to the island, Erdrick was never heard from again. Many years later, during King LorikXVI's reign, the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin. Many heroes tried to rescue the princess and recover the Ball of Light from the Dragonlord's castle, called Charlock, but none succeeded. The prophet Mahetta predicted that [...] "One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord." [...] However, when the descendant (the game's hero) arrives, {{many of the people}} of Alefgard <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> story of Erdrick, and those few who do remember consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta's prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Sunita Narain, the {{director}} of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) think tank, said the unprecedented floods in the Chennai metropolitan region were the direct result of unregulated urbanisation. According to Narain, [...] "our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water." [...] According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity.|$|E

Every {{aspect of the}} Sun Ra experience, from business practices like Saturn Records to published collections of poetry to his 35-year career in music, is a manifestation of his equations.

As Hall has put it, [...] "In this era of 'practical' things men ridicule even the existence of God. They scoff at goodness while they ponder with befuddled minds the phantasmagoria of materiality.

UFO researcher Robert Sheaffer writes in his book Psychic Vibrations that Hynek seemed to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> photographs when he later told a reporter for The Globe and Mail {{that he had never}} seen a UFO. The article states that in all the years he had been looking upward, Hynek [...] "has never seen 'what I would so dearly love to see.

2500|$|The legal {{position}} was complicated because although the accident occurred in Scotland, {{some of the}} injured subsequently died in England where the law was different. [...] In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the procurator fiscal who, if he found culpability {{on the part of}} anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with culpable homicide. [...] In England the coroner investigated death and, if the coroner's jury found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties. [...] The coroner for Carlisle, Mr T S Strong, asked for guidance from the Home Office and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way. [...] The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Lt-Col. Druitt to finish his investigation. [...] After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars or (c) a correctly kept train register, they could not <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> stationary train.

2500|$|A {{hatred of}} war, he argued in 1936, [...] "can be {{no reason for}} being false to ourselves, {{in the name of}} an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none." [...] And in 1937: [...] "We have not kept {{agreements}} we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I was trembling when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound. Lucas put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition.|$|E
2500|$|These {{events and}} the {{disagreements}} that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox. In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised {{the principles of the}} revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was [...] "overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House". When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and [...] "the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man". Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox. Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Collar Conservatives {{departs from}} {{traditional}} Republican orthodoxy {{and says that}} the Republican Party must to appeal to blue collar Americans. He says, [...] "As many as six million blue collar voters stayed home from the polls, and there's {{good reason to believe}} that a large majority of them would have voted Republican if they had voted." [...] Santorum puts forward a recipe for Republican success in which Republicans advocate for workers and not just corporations. He says that many middle class workers who have been forced into part-time jobs at big box stores or even into public assistance programs are amenable to the GOP's message if it is presented in relatable terms. He tackles education, saying the current system of government-run schools is a [...] "relic of the late 19th century" [...] and that children should not be pressured into going to college where a job or vocational training would be a better option. He critiques libertarian influence in the Republican Party, saying, [...] "There are some in my party who have taken the ideal of individualism to such an extreme that they <b>have</b> <b>forgotten</b> <b>the</b> obligation to look out for our fellow man." [...] He says the GOP should be less quick to dismiss concerns over decreasing social and economic mobility, saying that large businesses and stocks are strong, while life has become [...] "a trickle" [...] for workers. He questions rich compensation of business executives, and says that while he supports free trade, Republicans need to look at its impact on the average person and consider whether existing laws are fair.|$|E
