5|$|Unlike their {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure who was in command on the day.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman army did not {{march into}} Albania in one group. The first {{detachments}} to arrive were the Akıncı who marched through Dibra. Skanderbeg stalled this force's advance, but, once the main force arrived, the Albanians {{were not able}} to offer further resistance and withdrew. Realizing that both Ottoman commanders, Isak bey and Hamza, were familiar with the Albanian terrain and his tactics, Skanderbeg decided to adopt a new means of engagement. Normally, he would lure his enemy into a trap and then ambush them. His new tactic was very similar to his normal; however, he chose to approach it in a different manner. To make it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> followed, Skanderbeg split his forces into several groups and ordered their respective commanders to march through the forests and mountains in different directions and to never assemble or assault the Ottomans unless instructed to do so. The Albanian warriors were supplied by the locals and supply depots set throughout the mountains as they marched.|$|E

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Landlords were {{responsible}} for paying the rates of every tenant whose yearly rent was £4 or less. Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over £4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, {{there had been some}} clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847. According to James S. Donnelly, Jr., it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sure how many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{view is that}} Revelation {{alludes to}} the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars {{to agree on the}} exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves. Revelation rarely quotes directly from the Old Testament, almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Isaiah, with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, {{it is difficult to know}} whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> certain to what extent he did so consciously.|$|E
25|$|In {{the strictest}} sense, English folk music has existed since {{the arrival of}} the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain after 400 CE. The Venerable Bede's story of the {{cattleman}} and later ecclesiastical musician Cædmon indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'. Since this type of music was rarely notated, we have little knowledge of its form or content. Some later tunes, like those used for Morris dance, may have their origins in this period, but it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> certain of these relationships. We know from a reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman, that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{scientists}} who worked with Genie, including Jay Shurley, concluded based on non-linguistic evidence {{that she had been}} mentally retarded from birth and that this rendered it <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely certain about the utility of studying her language acquisition. During his sleep studies Shurley had uncovered, among a few other persistent abnormalities in her sleep, a highly elevated number of sleep spindles, which are characteristic of people born with severe retardation. However, the linguists who studied Genie firmly believed that she possessed at least average intelligence at birth and argued that the abuse and isolation she suffered during her childhood had left her functionally retarded. Curtiss specifically noted that some of Genie's linguistic capabilities, such as her clear ability to distinguish gender in her speech, were very uncharacteristic of someone born mentally retarded. Other linguists analyzing Genie's case, including Steven Pinker, have concurred with Curtiss' position.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Maginot, Metaxas and Siegfried-type lines, {{the overall}} barrier and trench system of {{flexible}} defense lines {{were hard to}} detect. Ideally, defensive positions are in enfilade or reverse slope defence positions to avoid enemy’s direct fire. It was a complex net of small objects, all of them entirely adapted to the natural topography (e.g.: natural steep slopes as anti-tank wall, trenches curving as isolines). All buildings, dugouts and obstacles are adapted to the landscape and objects (fallen trees, rocks, mounds and bushes), {{and there are no}} easily targeted large objects, while Maginot-like bunkers were <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> camouflaged enough. Concrete MG and Gun pillboxes in the Mannerheim and Árpád lines were particularly well camouflaged, and almost all of them have enfilading field of fire (mostly enfilade-defilade combination) in order to defend anti-tank obstacles against sappers, thus none of them fires direct toward enemy's lines. Because these buildings were not exposed to the enemy's line-of-sight artillery they could have been made much thinner than the Maginot-type ones therefore vastly less installation of concrete is required per kilometer compared to other lines.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts {{to come to grips with}} the infidelity. There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, but the point is: if your partner cheats on you it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely unbothered.|$|E
