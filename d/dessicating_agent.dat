The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the topical application of this <b>dessicating</b> <b>agent</b> on aphtous ulcers, and verify its efficacy in reducing pain. Fifty-seven patients, with oral minor aphtous lesions and a history of recurrent aphtous stomatitis were enrolled into this study and were assigned into two groups: 30 patients were treated with a single topical application of a <b>dessicating</b> <b>agent</b> and 27 without any treatment. A subjective evaluation of symptoms was completed by each patient using a visual analog scale (VAS) of 0 - 10.
