5|$|In North America, {{the album}} was issued as an {{enhanced}} CD, which allowed access to bonus videos, photos and more when inserted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on an Enhanced CD, and when the CD is placed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> bonus content is made available. This content includes several of Yankovic's real home videos and his commentary on them, as well as synchronized lyrics and instrumental or acoustic versions of some songs. A photo gallery is also included.|$|E
5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

5|$|The art was {{developed}} by Paul Drummond, Kevin Preston, Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Manchester, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as--needed basis meant that the art took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black and white, and then scanned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery.|$|E
5|$|The mind of William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William {{believe that they}} have less than a day before Olivia's mind will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b> These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, a {{major new}} {{extension}} {{was added to the}} Music block and a small network of computers installed. One of the rooms in the Humanities block was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cross-curricular <b>computer</b> suite. The Business Studies ICT suite was upgraded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> full <b>computer</b> suite.|$|R
50|$|With {{the support}} of the school's PTA, in January 2002, the first {{classroom}} {{on the first floor of}} Block B was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> second <b>computer</b> lab. In May 2003, the audiovisual room was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> third <b>computer</b> lab which was fully funded by the Ministry of Education.|$|R
50|$|DigiScents Inc {{was among}} the more recent pioneers of the technology, {{developing}} DigiScent (later iSmell) in 1999 as a device that would plug <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer's</b> USB port and generate scents dependent on the online content being viewed. The company ceased trading in 2011.|$|R
5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while hand-drawn animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{the novel}} was adapted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> text {{adventure}} {{game of the}} same name by the software company Trillium.|$|E

25|$|Creatures such as Trolls, the Balrog, the Ents, the fell beasts, the Wargs, the mûmakil, and Shelob {{were created}} entirely within a computer. Creatures would spend months of {{creation}} and variation as sketches before approved designs were sculpted into five-foot maquettes and scanned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b> Animators would then rig skeletons and muscles before animation and final detailed colouring scanned from painted maquettes. Treebeard had a digital face composited upon the original animatronic, which was scanned for the digital model of his longshots.|$|E

25|$|This {{chain of}} {{reactions}} {{is one of}} the reasons why Saltmod has been developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> program. It takes a number of repeated calculations (iterations) to find the correct equilibrium of the water balance, which would be a tedious job if done by hand. Other reasons are that a computer program facilitates the computations for different water management options over long periods of time (with the aim to simulate their long-term effects) and for trial runs with varying parameters.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, then {{president}} Ray Ferrie encouraged the authoring of a uniform and consistent band music book. Band member Joy Birdsley {{took on the}} enormous task of editing and producing the first edition. Then in 2000 after numerous changes and updates had been made, he took on the task yet again. This time the book was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> based music scoring program format and became a compendium of custom arrangements that is similar in format {{to many of the}} arrangements used by professional orchestras.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{drawings}} originally used at Doncaster Works for the A1 Peppercorn class had been preserved at the NRM, {{and a team}} of volunteers spent three days collating these in the autumn of 1991. The original drawings were India ink drawings on linen; these had to be scanned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>Computer</b> Aided Design (CAD) software program, as the microfilm NRM copies were not suitable for manufacturing purposes, and direct dyeline copies could not be made. About 95 percent of the original drawings were found, with 1,100 scanned by 1993, and a further 140 in 2001. A few poor-quality originals required re-drawing.|$|E
