50|$|The {{first known}} {{selection}} {{took place in}} April 1941 at Sachsenhausen concentration camp. By the summer, at least 400 prisoners from Sachsenhausen had been retired. During the same period, 450 prisoners from Buchenwald and 575 prisoners from Auschwitz were <b>gassed</b> <b>at</b> the Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centre; Hartheim Euthanasia Centre was used to kill 1,000 prisoners from Mauthausen concentration camp. Between September and November 1941, 3,000 prisoners from Dachau and several thousand people from Mauthausen and neighboring Gusen concentration camp, were <b>gassed</b> <b>at</b> Hartheim. Prisoners from the Flossenbürg, Neuengamme and Ravensbrück camps were also selected and killed. After November, another 1,000 prisoners from Buchenwald, 850 from Ravensbrück and 214 from Groß-Rosen, were <b>gassed</b> <b>at</b> Sonnenstein Castle and Bernburg. From March to April 1942, some 1,600 women were selected <b>at</b> Ravensbrück and <b>gassed</b> <b>at</b> Bernburg.|$|R

5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E

5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in {{the periodic table}} and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine.|$|E

5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> depth can be fatal. Concentrations {{which are}} acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits.

5|$|Fluorine is a {{chemical}} element with symbol F and atomic number 9. It is the lightest halogen and exists {{as a highly}} toxic pale yellow diatomic <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> standard conditions.

The adsorption property was confirmed {{and indicated that}} copernicium has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, so {{that it may be}} a <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> standard conditions.|$|E

5|$|Open circuit scuba systems {{discharge}} {{the breathing}} gas {{into the environment}} as it is exhaled, and consist {{of one or more}} diving cylinders containing breathing <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a diving regulator.

5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble metals require pure fluorine <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>at</b> 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
