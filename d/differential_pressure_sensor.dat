40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} {{differential pressure}} sensors are two {{among the most}} widely employed sensors for vortex flowmeter application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components.
