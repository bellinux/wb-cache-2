5|$|A {{royal decree}} on 26 October 1967 {{established}} an Oslo-based chief <b>inspector</b> {{who was to}} inspect the facility at least once per year, and a local <b>inspector</b> who would inspect the facility at least once per week. The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's assistant director of radio technology, Per Mortensen, was appointed chief <b>inspector,</b> while the manager of Ny-Ålesund's coast radio station was appointed assistant <b>inspector.</b> The ground station and auxiliary facilities were ready for operation in 1967. Through its history, the station had five managers: Henning Nielsen (1965–67), Roald Søfteland (1967–68), Ewald Øyen (1968–70), Einar Enderud (1970–72) and Kristian Sneltvedt (1972–74).|$|E

40|$|In {{an economy}} where {{corruption}} is pervasive, how should tax <b>inspectors</b> be compensated? The optimal compensation scheme {{must take into}} account the strategic interaction between taxpayers and tax <b>inspectors.</b> Pure “tax farming” (paying tax <b>inspectors</b> a share of their tax collections) is optimal only when all tax <b>inspectors</b> are corruptible. When there are both honest and corruptible <b>inspectors,</b> the optimal compensation scheme lies-between pure tax farming and a pure wage scheme. Paradoxically, when <b>inspectors</b> are hired beforehand, it may be optimal to offer contracts that attract corruptible <b>inspectors</b> but not the honest ones...|$|R
5|$|Cook County {{homeowners are}} {{eligible}} for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County <b>Inspector</b> General Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County <b>Inspector</b> General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez. On January, 15, 2014, a Cook County circuit court judge ruled that the County <b>Inspector</b> General {{had the authority to}} investigate the Assessor and all other independently elected County offices. On August 21, 2014, the judge ruled the Assessor must comply with the <b>Inspector</b> General's subpoena.

This change was one of the requirements for the $1.5 billion federal grant offered by the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008. Helen Lew became the Metro's first <b>Inspector</b> General on May 14, 2007, establishing the WMATA Office of <b>Inspector</b> General.

50|$|States {{that require}} {{roadworthiness}} and emissions testing as a requirement of continued licensing also require that <b>inspectors</b> be certified and/or {{licensed by the}} State. Those mandatory states require a minimum training level for state <b>inspectors</b> who typically work at fixed inspection stations. For independent pre-purchase <b>inspectors,</b> sometimes called 'for-hire' <b>inspectors,</b> states vary on licensing requirements. The {{presence or absence of}} a state license is not a guarantee of a thorough and factual pre-purchase evaluation. Rather, the defining characteristic of pre-purchase vehicle evaluators is deep automotive experience that is useful to prospective buyers. Commercial vehicle <b>inspectors</b> must meet applicable state and federal regulations.|$|R
