60|$|But {{with all}} her quick and {{profound}} feelings Venetia was thoughtful and even shrewd, {{and when she was}} alone her very love for her mother, and her gratitude for such an ineffable treasure as parental affection, would force her mind to a subject which at intervals had haunted her even from her earliest childhood. Why had she only one parent? What mystery was this that enveloped that great tie? For that there was a mystery Venetia felt as assured as that she was a daughter. By a process which she could not analyse, her father had become a forbidden subject. True, Lady Annabel had placed no <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> upon its mention; nor at her present age was Venetia one who would be influenced in her conduct by the bygone and arbitrary intimations of a menial; nevertheless, that the mention of her father would afford pain to the being she loved best in the world, was a conviction which had grown with her years and strengthened with her strength. Pardonable, natural, even laudable as was the anxiety of the daughter upon such a subject, an instinct with which she could not struggle closed the lips of Venetia for ever upon this topic. His name was never mentioned, his past existence was never alluded to. Who was he? That he was of noble family and great position her name betokened, and the state in which they lived. He must have died very early; perhaps even before her mother gave her birth. A dreadful lot indeed; and yet was the grief that even such a dispensation might occasion, so keen, so overwhelming, that after fourteen long years his name might not be permitted, even for an instant, to pass the lips of his bereaved wife? Was his child to be deprived of the only solace for his loss, the consolation of cherishing his memory? Strange, passing strange indeed, and bitter! At Cherbury the family of Herbert were honoured only from tradition. Until the arrival of Lady Annabel, as we have before mentioned, they had not resided at the hall {{for more than half a}} century. There were no old retainers there from whom Venetia might glean, without suspicion, the information for which she panted. Slight, too, as was Venetia's experience of society, there were times when she could not resist the impression that her mother was not happy; that there was some secret sorrow that weighed upon her spirit, some grief that gnawed at her heart. Could it be still the recollection of her lost sire? Could one so religious, so resigned, so assured of meeting the lost one in a better world, brood with a repining soul over the will of her Creator? Such conduct was entirely at variance with all the tenets of Lady Annabel. It was not thus she consoled the bereaved, that she comforted the widow, and solaced the orphan. Venetia, too, observed everything and forgot nothing. Not an incident of her earliest childhood that was not as fresh in her memory as if it had occurred yesterday. Her memory was naturally keen; living in solitude, with nothing to distract it, its impressions never faded away. She had never forgotten her mother's tears the day that she and Plantagenet had visited Marringhurst. Somehow or other Dr. Masham seemed connected with this sorrow. Whenever Lady Annabel was most dispirited it was after an interview with that gentleman; yet the presence of the Doctor always gave her pleasure, and he was the most kind-hearted and cheerful of men. Perhaps, after all, it was only her illusion; perhaps, after all, it was the memory of her father to which her mother was devoted, and which occasionally overcame her; perhaps she ventured to speak of him to Dr. Masham, though not to her daughter, and this might account for that occasional agitation which Venetia had observed at his visits. And yet, and yet, and yet; in vain she reasoned. There is a strange sympathy which whispers convictions that no evidence can authorise, and no arguments dispel. Venetia Herbert, particularly as she grew older, could not refrain at times from yielding to the irresistible belief that her existence was enveloped in some mystery. Mystery too often presupposes the idea of guilt. Guilt! Who was guilty? Venetia shuddered at the current of her own thoughts. She started from the garden seat in which she had fallen into this dangerous and painful reverie; flew to her mother, who received her with smiles; and buried her face in the bosom of Lady Annabel.|$|E

50|$|At Voll’s {{death in}} 1939, his art {{had already been}} {{declared}} ‘entartet’ and unwanted, {{and several of his}} major works appear to have been destroyed by the Nazis. It would require a dose of good fortune and the involvement of one of Voll’s old acquaintances, Edvard Munch, to save most of his æuvre. Voll had visited Munch unannounced in Norway in 1925, and was at first dismissed at the door. But when he showed Munch photographs of his works, he was invited in and the two artists became friends. Munch subsequently expressed admiration for what he described as Voll’s “…primordial force and deep inner calm”. During the 1930s, Munch had repeatedly expressed interest in organizing a solo exhibit of Voll’s works at the National Gallery in Oslo, but with Voll’s diminishing status and the growing regional power of Germany, this became increasingly politicized and difficult.At Voll’s death, his status had deteriorated into a <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> against exhibition issued by the Ministerium für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda in Berlin. The political pressures on Oslo lead to the abandonment of the project, but by then a sealed train wagon containing his works had reached Denmark, where it was seized, opened, and the works brought to safety. Northern Europe’s cultural elites had through the past years witnessed the destruction of unwanted art and literature in Germany with great apprehension. Many of Voll’s works had suffered similar fates, and it is likely that it was this concrete threat, which caused the Danish authorities to act. For the duration of the war, Voll’s æuvre was stored in the cellars of Christiansborg (the Danish Parliament) in Copenhagen, and in 1948 a formal exhibit of the collection was set up in the same place. After the war, Voll’s widow tried to retrieve what was left of her husband’s work in Germany, but from friends and colleagues she learned that the works remaining in Karlsruhe were so damaged - both through deliberate destruction and because of the war - that nothing of real value remained.|$|E

40|$| {{explained}} {{from the}} viewpoint of the essence-interpretation, namely the claim about so-called subordinate sciences and the claim that the principles of a science cannot be demonstrated. Especially the former posed great problems to the domain-interpretation; the genus-species and network-interpretation have a hard time showing why subordination proofs are exempt from the metabasis-prohibition, as Aristotle says. The essence-interpretation, on the other hand, can explain the exception with reference to the fundamental requirements of scientific knowledge, as they are stated by Aristotle {{in the beginning of the}} Posterior Analytics and drawn out in his theory of essential belonging. I finally consider two of Aristotle’s treatises on natural science and show that he appeals to the metabasis-prohibition in his criticisms of certain demonstrations of his fellow natural scientists. In the Generation of Animals, we find Aristotle criticising a certain proof about the sterility of mules and he unequivocally points out that the problem of this proof is metabasis. According to the domain-interpretation, this proof should somehow violate the borders of the domain of the science of biology or zoology by crossing over from another domain of a science. However, in Aristotle’s own description of the offending proof, this does not seem to be the case: all terms are zoological and there is no mention of a different science. Rather, the problem of the proof is that it did not show why the property ‘sterile’ belongs to mules from the basic essential properties of the kind to which sterility belongs. A similar result can be drawn from the analysis of a number of passages of the De Caelo. Hence, the essence-interpretation proves to be superior to the previous explanations of metabasis here, too. In the second part of the dissertation, I turn to the ancient legacy of the metabasis-prohibition. There are two reasons for this. First, by considering the two texts that deal directly with the Posterior Analytics, namely a paraphrase written by Themistius and a commentary written by Philoponus, I show that there are reasons to believe that both authors understood the metabasis-prohibition along lines similar to the essence-interpretation (Philoponus more clearly so than Themistius). Secondly, it appears that the metabasis-prohibition poses a problem for the late ancient philosophers. This comes especially to the fore in the works of Proclus, who refers to the metabasis-prohibition in his Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus (a work on cosmology and natural philosophy) and in his Commentary on Euclid’s Elements. While Proclus explicitly agrees with the metabasis-prohibition in some passages, he appears to violate it in others. This is evident when he, for instance, claims that demonstrations in natural philosophy employ theological premises and when he says that the automorphism of the numbers 5 and 6 has to be demonstrated with reference to the circle. One particular area of importance in this respect is Proclus’ doctrine of ‘geometrical atomism’, which is part of his natural philosophy. This doctrine states that the elements out of which all material reality is constructed are certain geometrical bodies (fire, for instance, is a pyramid) and that the properties of the elements (e. g. being hot) depend on the geometrical properties of these geometrical bodies. Here again it seems that we have an obvious case of metabasis (from geometry to natural philosophy). Moreover, in some sense one should even expect Proclus to violate and indeed to reject the metabasis-prohibition, for the Neoplatonists emphasize that reality and knowledge about reality possess a great pervasive unity. In seeking to solve the tension in Proclus’ view of metabasis – accepting the prohibition but also apparently violating it – my analysis came to the following conclusion. Since the ultimate justification of the metabasis-prohibition lies in the theory of essential properties, one should expect that the demonstrations that appear to be guilty of metabasis somehow violate the strictures of this metaphysical background theory. However, it turns out that this is not the case. For Proclus’ theory of essential properties, and in particular his theory of dependence of properties, differs from that of Aristotle. The way certain objects come to possess properties can be described from two directions. From the point of view of the object, it can be said that an object possess a property because it participates in a reality that is, in the hierarchy of Neoplatonic reality, higher than itself. This is the bottom-up perspective. The same relation can also be described from a top-down perspective: every part of reality derives its being from a procession from higher realities with the One, the highest Neoplatonic principle, which is located at the top of this hierarchy. One distinctive feature of this metaphysical system is that the higher element from which a lower element receives one of its properties does not have to possess this same property itself. Rather, what this higher element possesses is the power to bring about the respective property of a lower element, or even this very element itself. Building on this metaphysical background theory, Proclus aims to show how certain objects a given science deals with receive their identities and properties from higher elements of reality. In the Euclid Commentary, he outlines how demonstrations of these relations should be conceived. For instance, the automorphism of the numbers 5 and 6 has its cause in the circle and hence a demonstration why these numbers are automorphic has to start from the essence of the circle. This appears, from an Aristotelian perspective, to be a metabasis-demonstration, and indeed one of the crossings that Aristotle explicitly forbids in the Posterior Analytics (namely from geometry to arithmetic). Proclus, however, argues that automorphism is a form of circularity and that the geometrical circle is likewise a form of circularity. Both the numbers 5 and 6 as well as the geometrical circle receive their respective properties of circularity from a higher principle that neither belongs to arithmetic nor to geometry, but possess circularity in the purest way. Since Proclus holds that the circularity of the geometrical circle and the circularity of the numbers 5 and 6 have their cause in this higher principle, a demonstration revealing this relation takes the form of a subordination demonstration and is not guilty of metabasis. On the contrary, the relations that these properties have to their higher principle demand that a demonstration, if it aims at obtaining the highest form of scientific knowledge, does make the respective reference. This result suggests that the metabasis-prohibition should be understood as a purely <b>formal</b> theorem. The <b>prohibition</b> is, in accordance with the analysis of Aristotle’s argument for it, a consequence of the theory of essential properties. The concrete effects of the prohibition, i. e. the question which demonstrations are seen to be violating it, depend on the given theory of essential properties. Since Proclus’ theory differs from Aristotle’s, the two philosophers will see different demonstrations as violating the metabasis-prohibition. However, even taking into account the competing theories of essential properties, there still remains room for differing views on the question which demonstrations violate the metabasis-prohibition. For two philosophers who agree on the theory of essential properties might still give different answers to the question what the basic essential properties of a given object are. For instance, it is not at all self-evident that light propagates along straight lines, as Aristotle held. For this reason, according to Aristotle, demonstrations about the propagation of light (the science of optics) need to refer to the geometrical properties of straight lines. But a different philosopher could, while agreeing with Aristotle’s theory of essential properties, hold that light propagates along curved lines and hence he would see demonstrations about the propagation of light that make references to straight lines as committing metabasis. The metabasis-prohibition, then, is formal. The effects of its application are determined by two factors: one, the theory of essential properties; and the other, the particular views a given scientist takes towards the essence or identity of the objects he wants to conduct demonstrations about.

As many of Satsuma’s elite viewed the Ryūkyūans as culturally inferior, a number of contemporary politicians attempted to reform the kingdom in order to be more acceptable to both the Japanese rulers and to China.During this time, it is thought that the brother-sister relationship became more important than ties to wives and mothers {{largely as a result of}} the influence of state formation and the introduction of a patrilineal form of kinship.Satsuma slowly attempted to strip power from women.

Links between the court and the outlying islands that had been affected by state priestesses were transferred into the male sphere. In 1667, regional priestess had to be represented by a male official instead of being able to travel to Shuri themselves for important occasions. By 1768, they could no longer receive gifts from the king in local offices, but had to instead deliver them to their homes. The king became the major actor in rites of state, and supplanted the nūru as the central link with “Heaven.” New Ryūkyūan rites prevented women from participating in key roles.Many of these changes were met with the resistance of the Ryūkyūan people. Shō Shōken initially gained little support from other officials in taking steps against yuta. Confucianism never became popular with the common people, and traditional religious practices continued in the countryside. It is likely that the royal government had more control over the lives of peasants near major urban areas of Okinawa. Critical voices of the government in this time included the female poet Onna Nabe, whose writings indicated a strong personal connection to onarigami.The failure of the <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> against yuta was acknowledged by government, but the government’s stated ideals would not permit repealing it. Gregory Smits writes that this exemplified the “widening gap between an increasingly Confucianized central government and a peasantry that continued steadfast in its traditional religious beliefs and practices - with local officials caught in the middle,” (116).|$|E
5000|$|Tomlinson v State of Belize and State of Trinidad & Tobago 2016 CCJ 1 (OJ): The Court fully {{endorsed}} {{its decision}} in the earlier Shanique Myrie case that the 2007 Conference Decision created a binding obligation on the Member States to allow all CARICOM nationals hassle free entry and stay of six months upon arrival into their respective territories, subject to two exceptions: the right of Member States to refuse entry to “undesirable persons” and their right to prevent persons from becoming a charge on public funds. The Court agreed with the States that homosexuals, as such, cannot be categorised as ‘undesirable persons’ and concluded that homosexual CARICOM nationals {{have a right to}} freedom of movement on the same terms as any other CARICOM national. The Court held however, that Mr. Tomlinson was not in danger of being prejudiced (and the States' obligations were not breached) by the mere existence of statutory provisions in the Immigration Acts of Belize and Trinidad and Tobago {{for a number of reasons}} relating to the proper interpretation of those Acts themselves and in conjunction with other relevant legislation including: (1) section 64(1) of Belize's Interpretation Act; (2) section 3(2) of the Caribbean Community Act, 2004 of Belize; (3) the Preamble of the 1976 Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (4) section 4 the 1976 Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago; (5) relevant state practice, particularly the 2004 amendment to the Extradition (Commonwealth and Foreign Territories) Act, 1985; (6) the Data Protection Act 2011 of Trinidad and Tobago; (7) section 3 of the Immigration(Caribbean Community Skilled Nationals) Act 1996 of Trinidad and Tobago which requires an immigration officer to permit entry into Trinidad and Tobago of skilled CARICOM nationals who present a skills certificate, “notwithstanding any other written law” (as, for example, section 8 of the Immigration Act); and (7) Article 9 of the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas as transformed into the domestic law of Trinidad and Tobago through the Caribbean Community Act, 2005. The Court also accepted the argument posited by Trinidad and Tobago, that despite the <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> in section 8 of its Immigration Act, the prohibition does not apply to CARICOM nationals who are homosexual as part of an official policy. The Court however cautioned that member states should strive to ensure that national laws, subsidiary legislation and administrative practices are consistent with, and transparent in their support of, the right of all CARCICOM nationals to move freely. The Court ultimately dismissed Mr Tomlinson's claims against Belize and Trinidad and Tobago and refused the requested remedies. Noting the importance of having novel issues of Community law ventilated before the CCJ, the Court ordered that each party pay its own costs. Mr Douglas Mendes SC, appearing with Mr. Westmin R.A. James and Mr. Imran Ali, Attorneys-at-Law, for the Claimant. Ms Anika Jackson, Solicitor General of Belize, appearing with Mr Nigel Hawke, Deputy Solicitor General and Ms Samantha Matute, Attorneys-at-Law for the first Defendant (the State of Belize) and Mr Seenath Jairam SC, appearing with Mr Wayne D Sturge, Mr Gerald Ramdeen, Mr Kashka Hemans, Ms Deowattee Dilraj-Batoosingh and Ms Lesley Almarales, Attorneys-at-Law for the second Defendant (the State of Trinidad and Tobago).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cesarean {{section on}} {{maternal}} request (CSMR) could represent an avoidable quota of cesareans. In Italy, {{this is a}} topical problem of health-policy, involving ethical, juridical and medical issues. AIM AND METHODS: A 5 -questions questionnaire to quantitatively assess the perspectives of medical, juridical and ethical issues of planned CSMR was administered to obstetricians and gynecologists, midwives, lawyers and pregnant women. It was assessed to what extent those issues matter on the final decision of planning a CSMR. RESULTS: Non-homogeneous answers of stakeholders suggest different perspectives about issues on CSMR. The juridical issue {{seems to have the}} greatest impact on the final decision. CONCLUSION: Planning a CSMR associates overall with juridical issues in each group of respondents. Therefore, an obstetrician and gynecologist is unable to counsel a patient on CSMR from a medical point of view. The most direct way for reducing cesareans in Italy could be the <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> of CSMR...|$|E
40|$|Child’s play? Skills, {{regulation}} and reward amongst ‘early years’ ’ workers The persistence of gendered pay inequality some 30 {{years after its}} <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> raises questions over the mechanisms sustaining it. Recent contributions highlight the role of low skills visibility and valuation in maintaining pay inequality in predominantly female occupations. We examine the skills and rewards of early years ’ workers and the organisational processes that define them. We do so at an important juncture: when the importance and regulation of the ‘early years’ ’ sector has increased significantly; and following extensive organisational restructuring aimed at delivering pay equality. We conclude that whilst the application of more systematic forms of skill measurement have improved the relative rewards of nursery nurses, highly gendered constructions of their skills, particularly those most closely linked to mothering, continue to impact negatively on their valuation. The presence of caring activities appears to eclipse their role in education. Complex institutional and organisational factors maintain important aspects of gender inequality...|$|E
40|$|Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070 {{has focused}} {{attention}} on whether federal law preempts the prosecution of state immigration crime in local criminal courts. Absent from the current discussion, however, is an appreciation of how Arizona’s existing body of criminal immigration law—passed well before SB 1070 and currently in force in the state—functions {{on the ground to}} regulate migration. Drawing on statistical data, prosecution policies, trial-level court records, and interviews with stakeholders, this Article is the first to investigate the practice of local immigration prosecution. It does so in the hotbed of immigration enforcement—Maricopa County, Arizona—through a detailed case study of the implementation of a 2005 Arizona alien smuggling law. Specifically, this Article reveals four key aspects of the national immigration system that have shifted in the face of state criminalization: the functional definition of immigration crime, the breadth of state immigration enforcement authority, the allocation of federal resources for criminal prosecution, and the exercise of executive control over immigration policy. Through this analysis, this Article shows how Arizona, despite the <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> on state and local immigration regulation, has redefined and restructured the federal system for punishing immigration crime. In so doing, this Article fosters a richer and more accurate understanding {{of the role of the}} local prosecutor in immigration federalism...|$|E
40|$|Modification-proof {{contracts}} boost {{commitment and}} can help overcome information problems. But when such rigid contracts are ubiquitous, they can function as social suicide pacts, compelling enforcement despite significant externalities. At {{the heart of the}} current financial crisis is a contract designed to be hyperrigid: the pooling and servicing agreement (“PSA”), which governs residential mortgage securitization. The PSA combines formal, structural, and functional barriers to its own modification with restrictions on the modification of underlying mortgage loans. Such layered rigidities fuel foreclosures, with spillover effects for homeowners, communities, financial institutions,financial markets, and the macroeconomy. This Article situates PSAs in the context of theoretical and policy debates about contract rigidity, bond contract modification, and contractual bankruptcy. We propose a typology of contract rigidities, ranging from <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> on amendment (formal rigidity) to extreme collective action problems (functional rigidity). We then draw on New Deal jurisprudence for strategies to overcome each type of rigidity. These strategies include narrowly tailored legislation that renders the problematic terms unenforceable on public policy grounds, administrative restructuring mandates, and special bankruptcy regimes. The New Deal experience highlights the spillover effects of widespread contract practices, the limits of voluntary modification, and the utility of targeted government mandates to rewrite problematic terms. It also reveals the limits of such mandates. When different kinds of rigidity combine in a complex web of contracts, a comprehensive mechanism like bankruptcy may be necessary, if not always sufficient, to break the logjam. Rewriting PSAs will not resolve today’s financial crisis. Yet voluntary foreclosure prevention initiatives are unlikely to succeed as long as contract rigidities persist. The continuing foreclosure epidemic also holds an important lesson for the future: even where contract rigidity makes perfect sense for the parties, pervasive rigidities can have catastrophic consequences for financial stability and for society...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} confiscation of foreign enterprises in Indonesia {{in the early}} 1960 s. In a 28 month period from September 1963 to December 1965, at least 90 foreign companies from various countries were {{taken over by the}} Indonesian government. Collectively these companies, which included oil companies, plantations, manufacturing plants and a handful of enterprises in other fields, accounted for virtually all existing foreign direct investment in Indonesia. Moreover, in May 1965 further foreign direct investment in Indonesia was prohibited by law. The virtual elimination of foreign investment in Indonesia during this period {{was the result of a}} complex confluence of Indonesian domestic political conflict and instability, Indonesian foreign relations, and domestic economic policy, all interrelated and mutually enforcing. Moreover, these confiscations occurred in separate, distinct waves, generally based upon the nationality of the company, and until 1965 were not the result of a grand plan of the Indonesian government to eliminate foreign investment but rather ad hoc in nature, with their own reasons and logic. The seizures of British firms in two waves in September 1963 and January 1964 by non-governmental actors in actions that clearly contravened government policy resulted from domestic political conflict and instability, in particular the assertiveness of the Communist Party of Indonesia (the PKI) from 1964 - 65 as it sought to play a more forceful political role. The two waves of takeovers of Malaysian enterprises in late 1963 and American enterprises in early 1965 were both the result of Indonesia’s increasingly strident anti-imperialist foreign policy. The final wave of takeovers of all remaining companies in 1965 and the <b>formal</b> <b>prohibition</b> of new foreign investment were driven by a new program of economic self-reliance, the last economic policy implemented under President Sukarno’s Guided Democracy, in what was the pinnacle of economic nationalism in modern Indonesian history...|$|E
