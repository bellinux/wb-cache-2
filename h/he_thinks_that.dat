5|$|Homer test {{drives a}} new {{electric}} car {{so that he}} can get a free gift. After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} instead waits, the cabin gets transported to Aosagi Island. Yomogi, Mayuzumi, and Cocoro avoid the {{avalanche}} that was {{mentioned in the}} newspaper. The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing. The game ends with Satoru meeting Mayuzumi, who says she does not recognize him.|$|E
5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual {{timelines}} {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point returning to the start. Set two months after the end of series one, Mark meets Becky in a newsagent, where he is purchasing pornographic magazines. He discovers the location of Becky and Trevor's house and breaks in using Tracy's keys. However, he is forced to hide under the bed when Becky and Trevor return home. Listening to them having sex, he becomes optimistic when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> Becky begins to shout his name ("M..."). The name turns out to be Michael (Tony Gardner), Becky's solicitor with whom she is now cheating on Trevor.|$|E

25|$|The Grady sisters look {{so similar}} that {{they appear to}} be twins, though they're {{actually}} different ages (Ullman states that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> they were about eight and ten).|$|E
25|$|Li as a Buddhist {{believes}} that the difficulties of everyday life can be overcome {{with the help of}} religious philosophies. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> fame is not something he can control; therefore, he does not care about it.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> very inconsistent," [...] his pursuer continued.

The Bible says that men live after death, and <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that's</b> impossible." ...|$|R
25|$|Despite A Dog's Breakfasts murder theme, Hewlett {{wanted to}} avoid {{violence}} and gore as audience attraction, and rather produce a family film for all ages. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> younger {{members of the audience}} will enjoy the cartoon-like elements of the movie.|$|E
25|$|The diocesan bishop can {{initiate}} a process {{on his own}} initiative or {{at the request of}} the faithful to investigate the facts of an alleged apparition. The bishop may refrain from looking into it if he chooses, especially if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> not much will come of the event.|$|E
25|$|In the BBC sitcom My Family, Nick {{is a fan}} of Countdown. In the 2003 Christmas special, Richard Whiteley {{even made}} a special guest appearance, which amuses Nick. In another episode, Nick is taken aback when <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> bad news about his father is really about a {{cancellation}} of Countdown.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to Gellner and Hobsbawm, Anderson is not {{hostile to the}} idea of nationalism nor does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> nationalism is obsolete in a globalizing world. Anderson values the utopian element in nationalism.|$|R
25|$|For Steven Pinker the {{universal}} propensity toward religious belief {{is a genuine}} scientific puzzle. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> adaptationist explanations for religion {{do not meet the}} criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that evolved for other purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Twins– First and Second Twin {{know little}} about themselves– {{they are not allowed}} to, because Peter Pan does not know what Twins are (<b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> twins are two parts of the same person, which, while not entirely correct, is right {{in the sense that the}} Twins finish each other's {{sentences}} (at least, in the movie adaptation).|$|E
25|$|Zdenko Zlatar {{disagrees with}} Ravlić because <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> we cannot {{talk about the}} {{conflict}} between aristocracy and younger bourgeoisie for the rule over Dubrovnik, {{given the fact that}} the crisis of the nobility of the time was primarily political in nature, so Gundulić only condemned the split within his own ruling class, but hasn't refuted pretensions of the Dubrovnik's middle class.|$|E

60|$|He {{begins by}} assailing me with much ridiculous {{virulence}} because the chief personages in my story are puppies. They are puppies.

25|$|Padilla was {{discovered}} by the late talent manager Douglas Quijano and pushed him to audition on Star Magic. He {{was introduced to the}} media {{as a member of the}} Star Magic Circle 2013. At a press conference in 2013, Padilla said he never imagined ending up in entertainment, but <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> he is in show business for a more important reason since his family went through financial difficulties.|$|E
25|$|The Prince's bath {{before dinner}} is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} Father Pirrone. Concetta has asked Father Pirrone to tell her father that she is in love with Tancredi and that she believes her feelings to be returned. The Prince ponders his fondness for Concetta, which is based in her apparent submissiveness and placidity. However, <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> Tancredi's ambitions may require more money than Concetta will bring as her dowry. Keeping his thoughts to himself, the Prince decrees that Father Pirrone is to tell Concetta that the Prince will discuss it with her later.|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{is quick}} to assert that the focus on “production” {{does not mean that}} there will be an {{increase}} in production and labor under Eco-socialism. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the emancipation of labor and the realization of use-value will allow “the spheres of work and culture to be reintegrated”. He cites the example of Paraguayan Indian communities (organised by Jesuits) in the 18th century who made sure that all community members learned musical instruments, and had labourers take musical instruments to the fields and takes turns playing music or harvesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{the old man}} mad!" [...] exclaimed {{the young}} officer in the whale-boat, when his men had ceased rowing; [...] "does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{the bottom of the}} Ariel is made of iron, and that a rock can't knock a hole in it! or does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> she is manned with alligators, who can't be drowned!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} the man was ever engaged {{to two or three}} lovers at once," [...] she said to herself, {{alluding}} to the doctor. [...] "He knows at any rate of Lord Castlewell, and does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I am not to trouble myself about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say nowt o' that," [...] {{said the}} farmer. [...] "No doubt I had {{business}} at the mill,--lots {{to do at the}} mill."

25|$|As a moral philosopher, Mosterín {{does not}} believe in the {{existence}} of intrinsic or natural rights (neither for animals in general nor for humans in particular), but <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> any political society can create rights through legislative action. Following Hume and Darwin, and taking into account Giacomo Rizzolatti’s results on mirror neurons, Mosterín suggests that our inborn capacity for compassion, fed by knowledge and empathy, is a more solid basis for the moral consideration of non-human animals than abstract and uncheckable speculations about intrinsic rights. This fits his emphasis on the relevance of moral emotions (like compassion) to ethics, somehow comparable with the role played by perception in empirical science.|$|E
25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E
25|$|Obama and Zapatero met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time on April 2, 2009, at the G20 London Summit. Both leaders participated in the NATO Summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, where Spain committed an additional 450 troops to its previous military contingent of 778 in Afghanistan. Commentators said the decision may have been partially motivated by the Zapatero government's desire to curry favor with the new administration in Washington. Days later at the EU-U.S. Summit in Prague the two held a 45-minute meeting, and afterwards shared a photo-op for the press, where Obama called Zapatero a friend, and said <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> the two nations would establish an even stronger relationship in the years to come. This was the first formal meeting between heads of government of Spain and the United States since 2004.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. ---- thinks prisons {{could be}} made nearly self-supporting. Have you any idea of the {{difficulty}} that is found in disposing of Prison-work, or does <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Treadmills didn't grind the air because the State or the Magistracy objected to the competition of prison-labour with free-labour, but because the work could not be got? ...|$|R
