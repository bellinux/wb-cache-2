Common fillings include ground beef, shiitake mushrooms, cucumber, crumbled tofu, chopped scallions, minced garlic and toasted and ground sesame seeds. The inner surface of each fish slice is dusted with mung bean starch, the filling is placed on it and it is then folded in half and sealed. The edges of the dumplings are trimmed with kitchen scissors to create the half-moon shapes. The dumplings are then coated with mung bean starch, and cooked either in boiling water or in the steamer lined with Boston ivy leaves. Cooked dumplings are commonly served with a dipping sauce such as mustard or choganjang (soy sauce mixed with vinegar).|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of marine aquaculture systems has {{raised concerns about}} the impact that intentional (restocking) or unintentional (escapes) releases may have on natural populations. On this regard the genetic integrity of wild populations is threatened by: 1) biological invasions, 2) loss of genetic variation, 3) change of genetic architecture, and 4) loss of local adaptation. My study concerns the genetic characterization of both wild populations and (un) intentionally introduced populations as recommended by the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. This aim has been pursued focusing on three main issues. The first, on the gilthead sea bream, highlighted that farmed populations were genetically divergent from wild ones. The other two issues are related to restocking of potentially exploited natural stocks. To this end we investigated the Mediterranean basin-scale genetic structure of the grooved carpet shell; our results evidenced an overall lack of genetic structure throughout the western Mediterranean which {{may be used in}} planning future management of this natural resource. In addition, we analysed also populations of its allochthonous counterpart, the manila clam, that show relatively high levels of genetic variation suggesting that this species may cause problem to grooved carpet shell.

50|$|A {{traditional}} product {{which is}} connected with the fishing exploitation of the lagoons is the avgotaracho Messolongiou (like Japanese karasumi and Italian botargo). The mature ovaries of the <b>flathead</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (Mugil cephalus) manufactured in the traditional way as follows: the whole ovaries of flathead mullet are dissected from the fish, washed with water, salted with natural sea salt, dried under the sun and submerged in melted natural wax. This is very famous product with a great commercial value (about 140 €/kg). Also, {{this is one of}} the five products in the category of fresh fish, molluscs, crustaceans and products with protected designation of origin and geographical indication by laws of the Greek Government and the European Union.

50|$|The {{stream is}} an {{important}} seasonal freshwater artisanal fishery producing an annual catch, as of 2016, of about US$500,000 from an average weekly catch of 5 to 15kg by each fisherman. In the lower reaches of the stream, this low catch of smaller immature fish is evidence of lack of management of the fishery. Less than 1% {{to as much as}} 10% of the local population may be engaged at least part-time as fishermen, most are men. Full-time fishermen earn about US$1,000 to 2,000 per year, which is below the poverty line. Gill nets, cast nets, long lines, fish hooks and line sets, spears, traps and traditional fishing boats are used. The catch includes Snapper (Aha-an), Flagtail (Aligaman), Crab (Alimango), Red-tailed goby (Anga), Squaretail mullet (Balanak), Goby (Batinga), Silver perch (Bugaong), Otomebora Mullet (Bunak), Indo-Pacific Tarpon (Buwan-buwan), Loach goby (Dalapakan), Mountain bass (Damagan), Indian pellona (Ibis), <b>Flathead</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> (Gisaw), Gourami (Gurami), Mudfish (Halu-an), Shrimp (Hipon, Goby (Iswil), Carp (Karpa), Eel (Kasili), Spotted Scat (Kikilo), Mullet (Muli), Cyprinidae (Pait), Catfish (Pantat), Rock goby (Pigok), Mangrove red snapper (Tadlungan), Tilapia.

5000|$|The fishing villages {{located in}} and around Ennore have for many years {{depended}} on the Creek {{as a source of}} livelihood and sustenance. Owing to the excessive industrial takeover in the region for many years now the number of fish in the creek declined significantly due to the leakage of toxic waste water from factories and the dumping of toxic fly ash. A study by the Aquaculture Foundation of India and three institutions including Anna University, found high concentrations of heavy metals in the water and marine organisms {{in and around}} Ennore creek due to pollution from industries and domestic sources. This study found high levels of heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium and chromium. Species such as <b>flathead</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet,</b> a widely eaten fish had levels that hovered close to dangerous limits. Over the years, several commercially valuable fish - including tiger prawn, mud crab, striped crab, sand whiting, silver biddy, cat fish, mackerel, grey eel catfish, croaker and white prawn - have disappeared from the creek. [...] In some areas the depth of the river has become so low, that is it impossible for a small fishing boat to move on it.

5000|$|Lake Antiniotissa or Antinioti (Λίμνη Αντινιώτισσα/Αντινιώτη), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Antinioti Lagoon, {{is a small}} brackish lake on the north-east coast of Corfu, Greece near Agios Spyridon beach. It is an important wetland area and lies within a Natura 2000 nature protection area of 188 ha at {{the western edge of}} the municipal unit of Thinali. The lake's Greek name translates into English as [...] "the enemy of youth". It was once a malarial swamp and home to the anopheles mosquito, resulting in the area being uninhabited for many centuries, and it is still comparatively undeveloped. The vegetation surrounding the lake includes thickets of reed and bamboo. Inland there are orchards, olive groves and farmland, while between the lake and the sea lie sand dunes. The lake is jointly owned by the twelve principal villages of north-eastern Corfu and leased for fish farming, producing <b>flathead</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet,</b> sea bass and eel. It is also used for duck hunting. The adjacent dunes are home to the sand lily (pancratium maritimum) and the agile frog (rana dalmatina). The lake as it was in the 1930s was described by the British naturalist Gerald Durrell in his childhood autobiography My Family and Other Animals, in which it was called the [...] "Lake of Lillies". Durrell wrote that: it was a mile long, an elongated sheet of shallow water surrounded by a thick mane of cane and reed, and separated from the sea at one end by a wide, gently curving dune of white sand… It was the only place on the island where those sand lilies grew, strange misshapen bulbs buried in the sand, that once a year sent up thick green leaves and white flowers above the surface, so that the dune became a glacier of flowers.

On sandy–muddy beaches, samples were collected using seine net and on deeper sites with rocky bottoms, samples were collected by using small »dip net«. Total length of body and total weight were measured. Stomach contents were analysed using inverted microscope. Prey frequency (%F), abundance (%N) and coefficient of empty stomach (%V) were determined. Also possible food competition between different species of mullet juveniles was studied, based on space and time overlap of their recruitment. Recruitment of golden grey mullet (length category of 15 – 20 mm in samples) lasted from October to January. Analysis of lenght–weight relationship {{in the area of}} estuary of Mala Neretva showed that population has a negative alometric growth. In analyzed stomach contents from October to February, dominant were harpacticoid copepods. There was a substantial increase in the percentage of insects in March, and gammarids in December. Juveniles of <b>flathead</b> <b>grey</b> <b>mullet</b> were found in samples from September to November, with small length categories of 10 – 15 mm in September and October. Analysis of length–weight relationship established that samples on all three sites had a negative alometric growth.
