However, a transaction can cause additional effects on third parties. From {{the perspective of}} those affected, these effects may be negative (pollution from a factory), or positive (honey bees kept for honey that also pollinate neighboring crops). Neoclassical welfare economics asserts that, under plausible conditions, the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>externalities</b> will result in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, whereas those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost.|$|E

I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. Christine Ladd-Franklin,saying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician, this surprised me. The fact that I cannot believe something does not prove that it is false, but it does prove that I am insincere and frivolous if I pretend to believe it." [...] (Russell, p. 180).The basic argument for solipsism suffers a logical error as well. It is argued that, because the mind can not conclude the existence of anything external, therefore nothing external exists. But this conclusion does not follow, only that the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>externalities</b> can not be known. It is just as logically consistent that there are external realities/minds/etc. as there are not, when experience can not be verified either true or false.|$|E

5000|$|Contrasting {{with the}} allocatively, productively and {{dynamically}} efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When {{only one or}} a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss. Sources of this market power are said to include the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>externalities,</b> barriers to entry of the market, and the free rider problem. Markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of laissez faire is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called [...] "workable" [...] or [...] "effective competition". This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option by using the law to tame market operation where it can.|$|E

30|$|Self-organization in {{knowledge}} collaboration {{does not always}} produce win-win relationships among collaborators. Self-organization occurs for two reasons, {{the first of which}} is the existence of tacit knowledge (Polanyi 1962, 1966). It is difficult to a priori exclude individuals who are unable to contribute to knowledge creation through collaboration (Hayek 1945). The existing theory of coopetition (Brandenburger and Nalebuff 1997) assumes that cooperation creates a win-win relationship between two firms. Mutualism (+, +) corresponds to this type of relationship. Collective knowledge management is explicitly required in this context (Horaguchi 2014). The second reason for self-organization is the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>externalities.</b> Following Marshall (1890), the concept of an externality explains the existence of specific industry agglomerations found in certain local areas (Feldman 1994; Horaguchi 2008 a). The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>externalities</b> can be considered the source of commensalism {{in knowledge}} creation. Marshall (1890) notes that “organization aids knowledge” (book IV, chapter 1 : 115) when describing the local knowledge shared in industries.|$|E

The creation of jobs {{or the fact that}} the related industries pay taxes, cannot be considered, as such, as positive externalities, because any legal economic activity pays taxes, and the big majority also needs job demand. Time saving to the driver, and therefore eventually more personal production, cannot either be considered a positive externality, because the driver has already taken those factors into account when they opted to use their car, and therefore these factors cannot be considered, by many authors, a pure externality.|$|R

In the case of spatial dependence, following theoretical arguments from new economic geography, and endogenous growth models, this phenomenon {{has been associated with}} the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>externalities</b> that cross regional borders. However, despite the general consensus that interactions or externalities are likely to be the major source of spatial dependence, they have been modelled in a rather "ad hoc" manner in most existing empirical studies. In contrast, we advocate basing the analysis on structural growth models which include externalities across economies, applying the appropriate spatial econometrics tools to test for their presence and estimate the magnitude of these externalities in the real world.
