2500|$|The river {{continues}} southwards past railroad {{yards and}} the St. Charles Air Line Bridge. Between Polk and 18th Streets the river originally made a meander to the east; between 1927 and 1929 {{the river was}} straightened and moved [...] west {{at this point to}} make room for a railroad terminal. The river turns to the southwest at Ping Tom Memorial Park where it passes under the Chicago Landmark Canal Street railroad bridge. The river turns westward where it is crossed by the Dan Ryan Expressway; these immovable bridges have a clearance of [...] requiring large ships that pass underneath to have <b>folding</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R
50|$|A typical sailing rig for a dinghy is a gunter with a two-piece <b>folding</b> <b>mast</b> {{stepped through}} a thwart and {{resting on the}} keel. It is raised by pulling a rope called a halyard. A single-sailed rig is usually {{preferred}} over a marconi or Bermudan (with a triangular mainsail and jib) because this rig is simpler, with no stays to attach. Sprit rigs also have no boom, and the advantage that the sail can be brailed {{up out of the}} way against the mast when rowing or motoring. Lug rigs are another common single sail type used in small dinghies, both standing and balanced (with some area forward of the mast), and usable with or without a boom.|$|E
50|$|The Saab (formerly Ericsson Microwave Systems AB) GIRAFFE Radar is {{a family}} of land and naval two- or {{three-dimensional}} G/H-band (4 to 8 GHz) Passive electronically scanned array radar-based surveillance and air defense command and control systems tailored for operations with medium- and Short Range Air Defense (SHORAD) missile or gun systems or for use as gap-fillers in a larger air defense system. The radar gets {{its name from the}} distinctive <b>folding</b> <b>mast</b> which when deployed allows the radar to see over nearby terrain features such as trees, extending its effective range against low-level air targets. The first systems were produced in 1977. By 2007, some 450 units of all types are reported as having been delivered.|$|E
50|$|A dinghy {{should not}} be able to scratch the mother-boat's paint; {{therefore}} a fender made from a length of heavy rope (or a strip of polyurethane) can be tied loosely to the outside of the bulwarks. This also provides a handhold for launching, or for people overboard to climb into the boat. Many modern dinghies have a molded ridge of plastic to replace the rope. A fitted acrylic canvas cover can shed seas or act as a shade or storage cover. Traditionally it toggles to the fender-rope or is suspended from the gunter (small <b>folding</b> <b>mast)</b> but can also be tied to a few points and secured with snaps or Velcro. Depending on the design there may be a large locker under a thwart.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Berrier {{signed to}} drive the 90 with {{sponsorship}} from Hills Brothers Coffee, competing for Rookie of the Year honors. Berrier struggled {{during the course of}} the season, DNQ-ing nine times, before he was released. Brian Simo took over at Watkins Glen, before Stricklin took over the rest of the year. He signed {{to drive the}} 90 full-time in 2001, and had a sixth-place run at Michigan, but the team continued to struggle. At the EA Sports 500, Donlavey fielded the No. 91 for Rick Mast, who had lost his ride when Eel River Racing <b>folded.</b> <b>Mast</b> failed to qualify, however.|$|R
50|$|Second {{important}} {{innovation is}} the <b>mast</b> <b>folding</b> system. The <b>mast</b> {{can be raised}} or lowered by a single person controlling a single line run from the mast base {{to one of the}} genoa sheet winches. The mast is supported during the raising and lowering process by a set of metal A-frames, one set of which doubles as the lower aft shrouds when the mast is raised. The whole system does not require any adjustment to be made to the standing rigging.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{short-range}} (40 km instrumented) {{air defense}} radar with {{command and control}} capability. It employs a <b>folding</b> antenna <b>mast</b> that extends to a height of 13 m when deployed and can be integrated with an Interrogation Friend or Foe (IFF) capability. Coverage is stated to be from ground level to 10,000 m in altitude. In Swedish service the radar is designated PS-70 and PS-701 and provides target data to RBS-70 SHORADS missiles and 40mm Bofors guns. A more powerful version with a 60 kW transmitter is known commercially as Super Giraffe and in Swedish service as PS-707. These radars are no longer marketed.|$|R

50|$|After 1959, {{it served}} {{as a basis for}} the T-55K command tank which was {{equipped}} with an additional R-112 radio set, an AB-1-P/30 fuel powered accumulator charging unit, and TPN-1-22-11 night vision sight. All this additional equipment made it necessary to decrease the ammunition load for the main gun to 37 rounds and eliminate the bow machine gun. In the beginning of the 1960s, a T-55K was experimentally fitted with a Uran TV relay apparatus for battlefield surveillance. The tank was fitted with an external camera, the picture from which was relayed to a receiver in a BTR-50PU command vehicle. There was an observation camera mounted on a <b>folding</b> <b>mast</b> which was in turn mounted on a UAZ 69 car. The range within which the picture could be relayed varied between 10 and 30 km.|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} {{lightning}} striking NASA spacecraft {{and the development}} of lightning protection systems is reviewed from the Apollo 12 flight, involving a lightning strike thirty six seconds after launch, to the present date. Particular attention is paid to problems that may arise in this field in the context of planning and implementing the Space Shuttle program. The lightning protection design for Apollo is described: a <b>folding</b> <b>mast</b> mounted on top of the hammerhead crane on top of the Launcher Umbilical Tower, with a lightning rod on top. The effect of lightning storms on the launches of Apollos 12 through 17 is examined, as is the effect of lightning in the Skylab program. The lightning problems encountered by the Apollo-Soyuz mission and by the two unmanned Viking launches to Mars are discussed. The Lightning Detection And Ranging system for detecting RF emission from lightning discharges is described...|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of delivery, the CH-37 was the largest {{helicopter}} in the Western world and it was Sikorsky's first twin-engined helicopter. Two Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp radial engines were mounted in outboard pods that also contained the retractable landing gear. This left the fuselage free for cargo, which could be loaded and unloaded through large clamshell doors in the nose. The early models could carry a payload of either three M422 Mighty Mite (a lightweight jeep-like vehicle) or 26 troops. For storage, the main rotor blades folded back on the fuselage and the tail rotor <b>mast</b> <b>folded</b> forward on the fuselage.|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the surface}} {{morphology}} of secreting mast cells have been followed by scanning electron microscopy. Mast cells isolated from the rat peritoneal cavity have folds of plasma membrane that form snake- like ridges on their surfaces. Fold length varies considerably from cell to cell, whereas fold width and depth appear to remain relatively constant. To assess the possible relationship between secretory activity and surface folding, a seimquantitative method was used for measuring fold length in control and secreting populations. A positive correlation is found between secretion of histamine {{and the extent of}} membrane <b>folds</b> on the <b>mast</b> cell surface. The source of the membrane required for fold formation is probably secretory granule membrane incorporated into the plasma membranene as a result of exocytosis. Furthermore, a distinct cell type devoid of surface folds, designated as a raspberry-type cell, is found to occur {{as an integral part of}} a normal population of mast cells. This cell type is resistant to stimulation by polymyxin...|$|R
40|$|Cloned mouse {{mast cells}} resemble, by ultrastructure, {{immature}} mast cells observed in vivo. These mast cell clones {{can be grown}} {{in the absence of}} any other cells, facilitating direct investigations of their biochemistry and function. We find that cloned mast cells express plasma membrane receptors (Fc epsilon R) that bind mouse IgE with an equilibrium constant (KA) similar to that of normal mouse peritoneal mast cells. In addition, cloned mast cells do not display detectable la antigens and cannot enhance lg secretion when added to lymphocyte cultures or mediate natural killer lysis. In the presence of 1 mM sodium butyrate, cloned mast cells stop dividing and acquire abundant electron-dense cytoplasmic granules similar to those of mature mast cells. Their histamine content increases concomitant with cytoplasmic granule maturation and may exceed that of untreated mast cells by 50 - <b>fold.</b> Unlike peritoneal <b>mast</b> cells, cloned mast cells incorporate 35 SO 4 into chondroitin sulfates rather than heparin. These findings demonstrate that, unlike fully differentiated mouse peritoneal mast cells, cloned immature mouse mast cells contain no heparin and low levels of histamine. In addition, they establish that high-affinity Fc epsilon R are expressed early in mast cell maturation, well before completion of cytoplasmic granule synthesis and mediator storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a single {{intraperitoneal}} injection of polyamino acids (lysine, glutamic, aspartic) on mast cells of the rat are described. In vitro interaction of mast-cell components with these polyamino acids is also explored. Poly-DL-lysine (but not the acidic amino acids) has both immediate (minutes-hours) and long-term (days-weeks) effects on mast cells. At the dosage selected, some cells evidence rapid fusion of granules and degranulation, but without concomitant swelling; most display intracellular changes only. Neither degranulation nor granule fusion appears to be lethal. Rather, these spur the cell to greater synthetic activity which involves first the Golgi apparatus and subsequently also the endoplasmic reticulum. Early involvement of macrophages and eosinophils is described. Sequential studies after polylysine injection support the following concepts: (a) mast-cell granules exist as "physiological sets," several being confined to a common membranous "sac;" (b) each set can respond independently to applied stimuli; (c) each set can connect directly to the extracellular milieu; (d) poly-DL-lysine binds directly to the granules and stabilizes them; it is not readily digested; (e) mast-cell granules are produced directly; they do not arise by intake of exogenous polysaccharides. It is hypothesized that mast-cell granules are topologically outside the cell while held intimately within extensive cytoplasmic <b>folds</b> and recesses. <b>Mast</b> cells may function by causing intercellular connective tissue fluids to percolate over their granules which may process this fluid in some as yet undefined way(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the STS- 99 mission was to complete high resolution mapping of large sections of the Earth's surface using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM), a specially modified radar system. This radar system produced unrivaled 3 -D images of the Earth's Surface [...] The mission was launched at 12 : 31 on February 11, 2000 onboard the space shuttle Endeavour. The mission was led by Commander Kevin Kregel. The crew was Pilot Dominic L. Pudwill Gorie and Mission Specialists Janet L. Kavandi, Janice E. Voss, Mamoru Mohri, the National Space Development Agency (Japanese Space Agency) and Gerhard P. J. Thiele, from DARA (German Space Agency). The astronauts finished the mapping operations early on day 11, and then retracted the 200 foot long mast into its payload bay canister. The mast, the longest rigid structure ever deployed in space, supported the external antenna during the mapping operation. The videotape shows the <b>mast</b> <b>folding</b> into the canister. The final stowage was delayed when the three latches on {{the lid of the}} canister failed to engage as expected. After a few procedures were executed the mast canister was sealed, on the third attempt, as shown on the videotape. The video also contains several views from the STRM.
