40|$|Cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) {{have been}} of high {{interest}} since their discovery in the early 1990 s. Until now, two different subtypes, the human cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB 1 R) and the human cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB 2 R) are known. Both regulate important body functions, such as appetite, motor coordination, inflammation and host defence. Identifying new ligands at CBRs is of high importance for treating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, obesity, pain or immune deficiencies. To evaluate the efficacies and pharmacological profiles of CBR ligands sensitive and <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> <b>systems</b> analyzing compounds at a proximal level of the signal cascade are needed. Also, few years ago, alkamides of E. purpurea have been proposed to be ligands at CB 2 R. However, alkamides have only been characterized as ligands in competition binding assays. Additionally, Echinacea preparations that are efficient treating common cold do not always contain E. purpurea, but also E. pallida. The latter possesses ketoalkenes and ketoalkynes, which have neither been discussed as possible ligands nor been tested for CBR affinity at all. Hence, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to establish several functional and highly sensitive <b>test</b> <b>systems</b> to study cannabinoid receptors and their ligands at a proximal point of the signal cascade and to analyse different G-alpha-subunits, RGS-proteins and solvents.

The PanDA pilot {{is one of the}} major components in the PanDA system. It runs on a worker node and takes care of setting up the environment, fetching and pushing data to storage, getting jobs from the PanDA server and executing them. The original PanDA Pilot was designed over 10 years ago and has since then grown organically. Large parts of the original pilot code base are now getting old and are difficult to maintain. Incremental changes and refactoring have been pushed to the limit, and the time is now right for a fresh start, informed by a decade of experience, with the PanDA Pilot 2. 0 Project.

40|$|In this review, {{we discuss}} the {{developments}} of {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and place them {{in the context of their}} applications in cancer research. These methods are not only very useful for the causal analysis of the development and spread of certain tumors, they are also efficient tools for tumor diagnosis. Although a review of all of the literature in this field is not possible here, many of the major contributions are summarized along with recent work from our laboratory. Our group contributes to the goal of functional identification of tumor growth antagonizing genes. FISH and molecular analyses have shown that the short arm of human chromosome 3 is frequently deleted in kidney, lung, breast, uterus, testis and ovary carcinomas. Deletion-mapping studies have outlined several separate deletion prone regions in different tumors, namely 3 pter-p 25, p 22 -p 21. 3, p 21. 1 -p 14 and p 14 -p 12, which may contain putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Candidate suppressor genes isolated from frequently deleted regions need to be assayed for possible tumor-antagonizing ability by functional tests. We have developed a <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> <b>system,</b> the microcell hybrid (MCH) based "elimination test” (Et). The Et is based on the introduction of a single human chromosome into tumor cells of human or murine origin, via microcell fusion. The MCHs were analyzed by FISH painting and PCR for the elimination or retention of specific human chromosome 3 (chr. 3) regions after one or several passages in severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. We have defined a common eliminated region (CER) on chr. 3 p 2 I. 3. CER is approximately 1 megabase (Mb) in size. We have covered this region with PACs (bacteriophage PI based artificial chromosome) and used FISH mapping for localization and ordering PACs and cosmids on the chromosome 3 and high-resolution free chromatin/DNA fiber FISH to orient the PAC contig, to measure the lengths of PACs, and to establish their order. Activation of cellular oncogene by chromosomal translocation, which brings an oncogene under the influence of a highly active chromosome region, appears to play a pivotal role in the genesis of certain hematopoetic and lymphoid tumors. We have detected specific chromosomal translocations by FISH painting in mouse plasmacytoma (MPC), human Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and other B-cell derived tumors. We have showed in a murine sarcoma derived line (SEWA) that FISH can also be used for detection of amplified oncogene (c-myc) and the linked locus (pvt- 1). We have also applied the FISH technique for visualization of integrated and episomal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes and EBV transcripts in EBV-carrying B-cell derived human cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Development of tumor is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} multiple steps. New technologies for cloning and identifying genes playing critical role in cancer development are necessary. That {{is why we have}} focused our research on development of these approaches. The new methods include CIS, cloning of identical sequences, COP, cloning of polymorphic sequences and CODE, cloning of deleted sequences. Although these methods are based on the same combination of biochemical techniques their aims are different. These methods are fully complementary; therefore they may be applied together to analyse a given object. If one aims to clone a disease gene responsible for familial cancer syndrome, these methods may be applied as follows. CIS may be used to identify the sequences identical by descent comparing the DNA obtained from affected family members. COP may be used to find sequences that are different between affected members, and CODE would be useful to compare tumor and normal (control) samples to isolate deleted sequences (putative candidate tumor suppressor genes) and amplified sequences (putative oncogenes). COP and CODE procedures may be applied to analyse the CpG islands thus allowing direct candidate gene identification. NotI microarrays are the microarrays giving the opportunity to detect copy number and methylation changes. NotI microarrays are based on large-scale sequencing of total human NotI linking clones, which were previously shown to be tightly associated with CpG islands and genes. We have solved the main problems for genome wide screening created by the size of human genome and numerous repeat sequences by developing a new method for labelling genomic DNA where only sequences surrounding NotI sites are labelled, Nod representation (NR). A pilot experiment using NR probes demonstrated the power of the method, and we successfully detected Chr 3 NotI clones deleted in ACC-LC 5 and MCH 939. 2 cell lines. NotI arrays will speed up cancer research very significantly and can replace CGH, LOH and many cytogenetic studies, since the high- density grids with 50. 000 NotI linking clones were constructed, 22 551 unique Notl flanking sequences were generated, covering a total of 16. 2 Mb of the human genome. The candidate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) cloned by above new methods will be entered into gene inactivation test (GIT), which is a new <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> for TSGs identification. GIT is based on our hypothesis that TSG must be inactivated in growing tumors in experimental conditions as it happened in nature; this inactivation of a TSG can be achieved by mutation, deletion, methylation etc. To verify our hypothesis, known suppressor genes RB and p 53 were built into pETI and pETE vectors that permitted tetracycline/doxycycline regulated expression of the cloned genes in cancer cell lines growing not only in vitro, but in vivo as well. These cell lines are tTA producing cell lines. Wild type but not mutated RB and p 53 genes were deleted/inactivated during tumor growth in SCID mice. Furthermore, no inactivation/deletion was observed for 3 PK, MLH 1, rhoA genes even after two passages in SCID mice. The two multiple cancer regions (3 p 21. 3 T and 3 p 21. 3 C regions) were identified in lung cancer and kidney cancer. The smallest overlapping homozygous deletion (app. 100 kb) in 3 p 21. 3 C region includes 8 genes. All these genes were included in functional gene inactivation test. One gene from homozygous deletion 3 p 21. 3 T region also was included in GIT. Until now, RASSF 1 A, RASSF 1 C, Gene 21, SEMA 3 B and CACNA 2 D 2 were shown to have growth suppression activity in vitro and in vivo, and were inactivated in the tumors following SCID mice passage. The results suggested that these genes play important role in the lung and kidney pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Epithelial cancers are {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and lethal diseases in the world. They cause more than 80 % of all cancer deaths. Development of these tumors is a complex process involving more than 100 genes from different chromosomes. We know that human chromosome 3 (chr. 3) contains many of these key tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), {{some of which are}} cancer specific and others are common for different cancer types. The most widely used approach to designate a candidate gene as being a TSG is demonstration of inactivating mutations of this gene in tumor biopsies. Even such a simple requirement for mutational inactivation can be complicated in cases where expression dosage is critical, and in genes in which one allele is imprinted. In such cases, only functional approaches that can demonstrate tumor suppression activity for one of the candidate genes can help to solve the problem. Gene inactivation test (GIT) is a new <b>functional</b> <b>test</b> <b>system</b> for TSGs identification. This test is based on the functional inactivation of the analysed genes in contrast to existing tests based on growth suppression. Our hypothesis was that TSG must be inactivated in growing tumors in experimental conditions as it happened in nature. This inactivation of a TSG can be achieved by mutation, deletion, methylation etc. To verify our hypothesis, known suppressor genes RB and p 53 were built into the vectors that permitted tetracycline/doxycycline regulated expression of the cloned genes in cancer cell lines growing not only in vitro, but in vivo as well. These cell lines are tTA producing cell lines. Wild type but not mutated RB and p 53 genes were deleted/inactivated during tumor growth in SCID mice. In contrast, a non-functional mutant RB and p 53 gene were maintained. Our group has tested approximately twenty candidate genes from 3 p in SCLC lines U 2020, ACC-LC 5, prostate LNCaP and the RCC cell line KRC/Y using the GIT. These experiments led to the surprising conclusion that 3 p contains at least 10 new TSGs. TSG may be a tissue specific gene and therefore, GIT can be effective only in some cell lines. As our research is focused on human 3 p, we have collected cell lines with rearranged short arm of Chr. 3, and a few control cell lines were selected as well. The panel of cell lines included 12 cancer cell lines. Our recent results showed that GIT could be very useful in functional analysis of new and well-known TSGs. In summary, RB, P 53, NPRL 2 /G 21 RASSF 1 A, RASSF 1 C, RBSP 3, SEMA 3 B, HYAL 1, HYAL 2 and CACNA 2 D 2 demonstrated TSG activity in GIT at least in one tested cancer cell line. However, all mutated genes and wild type PL 6, RhoA, 3 PK, BLU, 101 F 6, MLH 1 and others didn't show this activity in the tested cell line(s), although they resided in frequently affected 3 p 21. 3 regions. Some of the newly discovered TSGs revealed unique features. For instance, HYAL 1 and HYAL 2 show growth inhibiting activity only in vivo. RASSF 1 A and RASSF 1 C are tissue-specific splice forms of the same TSGs. NPRL 2 is likely a new mismatch repair gene responsible for cisplatin (one of the most widely used anti-cancer drug) action. NPRL 2 nuclear protein may be involved in mismatch repair, cell cycle checkpoint signalling and activation of apoptotic pathway. RBSP 3 is the first known direct activator of RB by its dephosphorylation. These new TSGs from AP 20 and LUCA region are responsible for cell cycle control, mismatch repair, cell adhesion and angiogenesis and most likely cooperate with each other. The cloning of TSGs from Chr. 3, and the comparative analysis of genes involved in the development of RCC, SCLC, and other cancers, will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the molecular mechanisms in carcinogenesis. It will improve the possibilities of early diagnosis and will allow more effective monitoring of treatment compared with present-day therapies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} two decades, {{we have seen the}} {{emergence}} and rapid growth of system-on-chip (SOC) applications. The same trend has happened in system-in-package (SIP) applications over the past ten years. The development of the SIP technology has much benefited from the SOC technology; however, this emerging SIP technology presents very specific test challenges due to its complex design and test processes. Indeed, one major difference between an SOC and an SIP is that an SOC contains only one die on a packaged chip while an SIP is an assembled system comprised of individual dies on a packaged chip. Each die in the SIP can also use different process technology, such as silicon or GaAs, which includes a radiofrequency (RF) or micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) component. This fundamental difference implies that to test an SIP, each bare die in the SIP must be tested first before the passing bare die is packaged in the SIP. Then, a <b>functional</b> <b>system</b> <b>test</b> or embedded component <b>test</b> at the <b>system</b> level can be performed. The passing bare dies are often called known-good-die (KGD). In this chapter, we first discuss the basic SIP concepts, its difference from SOC, and show some SIP examples. We highlight the specific challenges from the testing point of view and derive the assembled yield and defect level for the packaged SIP. Next, various bare-die test techniques to find known-good-dies are described including their limitations.

Estimation of WCV-potencies based on the antibody concentration against Pertussis Toxin (PT), Filamentous-Hemagglutinin (FHA) or 69 -kDa Outer Membrane Protein (OMP) was not possible due to very low antibody responses which were not vaccine dose dependent. The anti- 92 -kDa OMP antibody response showed a poor correlation with the MPT, due to scattering. In conclusion, the protection of mice against a lethal intracerebral challenge is not related to a humoral immune response against a single 'protective' antigen, nor restricted to a single immune mechanism, but may be related to a synergistic effect of humoral responses against a wide range of 'protective' and 'non-protective' antigens. The PSPT is therefore a good alternative for the MPT and provides more precise information about immunogenicity, potency and hence on consistency in production of pertussis WCVs...|$|R
40|$|The thesis report {{presents}} a technical comparison of four different methods for sensor communication in vehicles. Local Interconnect Network (LIN), Peripheral Sensor Interface (PSI 5), Analog Current Loop (ACL) and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) have been investigated. The {{focus of the}} study is EMC characteristics, where radiated emission and susceptibility are investigated in a laboratory setup. Included in the thesis are implementation and documentation of a <b>functional</b> physical <b>test</b> <b>system,</b> much suitable for further investigation of the four studied communication methods as well as rapid implementation of other methods. The results indicate substantial differences between LIN, PSI 5, ACL and PWM both in terms of basic functionality and electromagnetic behavior. Of special interest are indications that communication circuitry might possibly be a bigger problem than the actual communication...|$|R

40|$|<b>System</b> <b>testing</b> is {{concerned}} with <b>testing</b> an entire <b>system</b> based on its specifications. In the context of object-oriented, UML development, this means that <b>system</b> <b>test</b> requirements are derived from UML analysis artifacts such as use cases, their corresponding sequence and collaboration diagrams, class diagrams, and possibly Object Constraint Language (OCL) expressions across all these artifacts. Our goal here is to support the derivation of <b>functional</b> <b>system</b> <b>test</b> requirements, which will be transformed into test cases, test oracles, and test drivers once we have detailed design information. In this paper, we describe a methodology in a practical way and illustrate it with an example. In this context, we address testability and automation issues, as {{the ultimate goal is}} to fully support <b>system</b> <b>testing</b> activities with high-capability tools...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} {{examined}} the use of virtual environments (VEs) for stroke and similar rehabilitation. To be of real benefit, it is essential that skills (re-) learned within a VE transfer to corresponding real-world situations. Many tasks have been developed in VEs, but few have shown effective transfer of training. We believe that, by softening the real/virtual divide, mixed reality technology has the potential to ease the transfer of rehabilitation activities into everyday life. We present two mixed reality systems, designed to support rehabilitation of activities of daily living and providing different mixtures of digital and physical information. <b>Functional</b> <b>testing</b> of these <b>systems</b> is described...|$|R
