40|$|The pump has {{a holder}} (2) {{for a large}} number of rollers (22) acting against the hose, while a motor (1) {{consists}} of a <b>driving</b> <b>body</b> (11, 12) and a shaft (13) driving the holder. A pressure unit (3) secures the hose in place at the rollers. The body extends at least partly inside the holder, and a bearing (5) can be mounted between them, being typically fixed to the holder. The body can have a driving sleeve (12) at the end towards the holder, a bearing for the shaft being housed inside the sleeve. This bearing can be offset in the axial direction (6) from the first one (5). The pressure unit can be formed by a flap (31, 32), and this and the rollers can be arranged to act simultaneously against several parallel hoses.

The approach is then applied to investigate the stability of rock slopes. Computational results are given, providing ample evidence of the destablizing effects induced by the seepage forces. The influence of relevant geometrical, strength and loading parameters is also discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of striking phenotypes on islands {{is a well-known}} phenomenon, {{and there has been}} a long-standing debate on the patterns of body size evolution on islands. The ecological causes driving divergence in insular populations are, however, poorly understood. Reduced predator fauna is expected to lower escape propensity, increase body size and relax selection for crypsis in small-bodied, insular prey species. Here, we investigated whether escape behaviour, body size and dorsal coloration have diverged as predicted under predation release in spatially replicated islet and mainland populations of the lizard species Podarcis gaigeae. We show that islet lizards escape approaching observers at shorter distances and are larger than mainland lizards. Additionally, we found evidence for larger between-population variation in body size among the islet populations than mainland populations. Moreover, islet populations are significantly more divergent in dorsal coloration and match their respective habitats poorer than mainland lizards. These results strongly suggest that predation release on islets has driven population divergence in phenotypic and behavioural traits and that selective release has affected both trait means and variances. Relaxed predation pressure is therefore likely to be one of the major ecological factors <b>driving</b> <b>body</b> size divergence on these islands...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{simulations}} of a dynamically stable mobile robot (Ballbot) with arms. The simulations are of Ballbot lifting its arms in various directions. A PD arm controller works independently of an LQR-designed balancing/station keeping controller. The PD controller drives the arms to follow desired trajectories. When the arms are raised, Ballbot assumes a leaning equilibrium (the physical equilibrium) {{as opposed to}} the standing equilibrium (body stands totally upright- a predefined desired equilibrium) that the LQR drives toward. The conflict between these two equilibria causes the robot to lose its balance when lifting heavy (10 kg) loads. A unified arm and station keeping/balancing controller is also described. The unified controller outperforms the independent controllers in some cases. Balancing only using arms and <b>driving</b> <b>body</b> movement with arms are briefly explored.

40|$|This study uses {{complexity}} theory {{to examine the}} space of the street. In a morpho-ecological city, process creates form just as form creates process. The process of movement is a critical form generator within the urban system. In this thesis, the urban system comprising streets/ car/pedestrian is examined. If this collection of urban modes of mobility is a complex system capable of selforganising behaviour, what effect does the ordering imposed by traffic engineering have on this system? I look at the <b>driving</b> <b>body</b> and the walking body as co-creating the city by their movement through urban space. I suggest that, through attention to the fragments of interactions enacted during these movements, we can, through design, allow for the emergence of selforganising behaviour. Urban shared streets, descendants of the ‘woonerf’, appear to function more efficiently than engineered streets, without the usual traffic ordering. The counterintuitive success of these streets implies a self-organising behaviour that is generated by the density of interaction between the inhabitants of the street. These designs potentially work as a change agent, a catalyst, operating within a complex system. This has the potential to move systems from one attractor state to another. A city built with these spaces becomes a city of enfilades; an open system of spaces that are adaptable to uses that fluctuate with time and avoid thickening the palimpsest of traffic engineering. I look at siting shared streets in Wellington, based on jaywalking, a transgressive use of the streetspace that prefigures a shared space, and changes to urban networks associated with such designs. Interaction within the city is a creative force with a structure. City design needs to consider and address this infrastructure and design for it. The infrastructure of interaction has been subsumed by the infrastructure of movement. Shared streets indicate there may not be a need for this – they can be integrated. The process of movement creates instances of interaction; therefore designing spaces of/for movement must be designed to enhance the infrastructure of interaction. The result of such interaction is not just somewhat better; it may be a phase change - catalytically better...|$|E
