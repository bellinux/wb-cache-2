40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1994 Computer virus {{programs}} are generally {{perceived to be}} a threat to the information stored by computer users. This research evaluated the impact computer viruses have on information stored by computer users. The emphasis was on the effects of computer viruses rather than on the detail of their operation. The main hypotheses involved {{the question of whether or}} not computer viruses do pose a threat to the information stored by computer users. The effect of computer viruses on the information of users in industry was measured by sending a questionnaire to 388 companies country-wide. &~ average of 2 l, 5 % of the respondents claimed detrimental effects to information stored on disk due to computer viruses. This and other data was used to guide laboratory experiments on the actual damage done by computer viruses to stored information. A set of test disks was prepared to represent programs and data of a typical PC user in industry. Fifteen different virus programs were used individually to infect the test disks. After each infection, all the test disks were inspected to ascertain damage to data, system and program files as well as to separate disk sectors. The research established that: The damage done by computer viruses to stored information is generally limited to one file or disk area. Where damage to stored information did occur, it was often reversible. Irrational user responses to virus symptoms provide a large potential source for damage to stored information. The availability of master program disks (for program <b>file</b> <b>restoration)</b> and recent, validated data backup is essential to recovery from a computer virus infection. A user can solve most problems caused by virus infections if he has a basic understanding of disk structure, i. e. tracks, sectors, sides, the FAT, etc, and of the use of disk utility programs like Norton Utilities or PCTools. The fact that some of the findings of prominent virus researchers could not be verified, suggests that virus programs could be unstable. Claims regarding the damage inflicted by viruses must be considered to be valid only for a specific copy of the virus under discussion. The importance of using original application software (to minimize the transfer of viruses and to enable program <b>file</b> <b>restoration),</b> regular back-ups (to enable data <b>file</b> <b>restoration)</b> and basic user awareness (infection prevention, symptoms, the use of anti-viral and utility programs, etc.) was emphasized. The average PC user should be able to clear up a virus infection without assistance by following the given disinfection procedure. Suggestions for further study include virus origins, generations, mutations, multiple infections, and the effect of viruses on computer networks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{technical}} environment {{continues to}} change and impact the work of digital investigations. This research provides a framework within which computer forensics investigators {{can take advantage of}} new or different types of evidence from Microsoft’s Vista operating system (“Vista”). Moreover, this paper will also indicate the many challenges that investigators will encounter when faced with the Vista platform. The focus herein will be on changes associated with new security, encryption and <b>file</b> <b>restoration</b> features. These features vary according to the version of Vista and these differences will also be discussed. This research will also detail the integrity of data recovery procedures through detailed experiments used to identify how data could be manipulated by a perpetrator in Vista as compared to previous versions of Microsoft’s operating systems. Ultimately, this paper will indicate that enhancements in security and encryption associated with Encrypted File System (EFS) as well as BitLocker Drive Encryption are very problematic for investigators. Vista has serious implications for computer forensics investigations. Nevertheless, this research will guide the digital investigator through the labyrinth of new challenges, to effect a more thorough investigation of digital evidence...|$|E

40|$|I have {{recently}} developed dmfs, a Data Migration File System, for NetBSD. This file system {{is based on}} the overlay file system, which is discussed in a separate paper, and provides kernel support for the data migration system being developed by my research group here at NASA/Ames. The file system utilizes an underlying file store to provide the file backing, and coordinates user and system access to the files. It stores its internal meta data in a flat file, which resides on a separate file system. Our data migration system provides archiving and file migration services. System utilities scan the dmfs file system for recently modified files, and archive them to two separate tape stores. Once a file has been doubly archived, files larger than a specified size will be truncated to that size, potentially freeing up large amounts of the underlying file store. Some sites will choose to retain none of the file (deleting its contents entirely from the file system) while others may choose to retain a portion, for instance a preamble describing the remainder of the file. The dmfs layer coordinates access to the file, retaining user-perceived access and modification times, file size, and restricting access to partially migrated files to the portion actually resident. When a user process attempts to read from the non-resident portion of a file, it is blocked and the dmfs layer sends a request to a system daemon to restore the file. As more of the file becomes resident, the user process is permitted to begin accessing the now-resident portions of the file. For simplicity, our data migration system divides a file into two portions, a resident portion followed by an optional non-resident portion. Also, a file is in one of three states: fully resident, fully resident and archived, and (partially) non-resident and archived. For a file which is only partially resident, any attempt to write or truncate the file, or to read a non-resident portion, will trigger a <b>file</b> <b>restoration.</b> Truncations and writes are blocked until the file is fully restored so that a restoration which only partially succeed does not leave the file in an indeterminate state with portions existing only on tape and other portions only in the disk file system. We chose layered file system technology as it permits us to focus on the data migration functionality, and permits end system administrators to choose the underlying file store technology. We chose the overlay layered file system instead of the null layer for two reasons: first to permit our layer to better preserve meta data integrity and second to prevent even root processes from accessing migrated files. This is achieved as the underlying file store becomes inaccessible once the dmfs layer is mounted. We are quite pleased with how the layered file system has turned out. Of the 45 vnode operations in NetBSD, 20 (forty-four percent) required no intervention by our file layer - they are passed directly to the underlying file store. Of the twenty five we do intercept, nine (such as vop_create()) are intercepted only to ensure meta data integrity. Most of the functionality was concentrated in five operations: vop_read, vop_write, vop_getattr, vop_setattr, and vop_fcntl. The first four are the core operations for controlling access to migrated files and preserving the user experience. vop_fcntl, a call generated for a certain class of fcntl codes, provides the command channel used by privileged user programs to communicate with the dmfs layer...|$|E

40|$|In 2002, {{the source}} of a mystery oil spill that killed large numbers of seabirds, {{especially}} Common Murres Uria aalge, in the Gulf of the Farallones, central California, was tracked to the vessel S. S. Jacob Luckenbach which sank after a collision in 1954. Matches of many oil samples have established that oil leaking from this vessel is responsible for the 2001 - 2002 and many earlier mystery oiling events in the 1990 s, especially the 1997 - 1998 Point Reyes Tarball Incidents. This vessel has been a major source of chronic oil pollution in central California, although illegal offshore dumping of tank washing and bilge dumping also is implicated as a significant source of chronic oiling by non-matches of several oil samples. Recent efforts to investigate {{the source of}} oil, remove oil from the sunken vessel, and examine impacts to seabirds are summarized. A natural resource damage claim is being <b>filed</b> and seabird <b>restoration</b> efforts are envisioned...|$|R
5000|$|DC-5 beta began {{development}} in early 2000. As {{the result of}} a substantial number of improvements, testing did not commence until June 2002 before being released in September 2002. Previous versions of DC-Art software used a source vs destination file setup termed [...] "Classic edit mode" [...] whereby each time a filter was applied to a source file it would generate a new, altered destination file tiled within the same window. Whilst this was commendable for archival purposes, for the home user or intermediate expert it resulted in too many semi-complete <b>restoration</b> <b>files.</b> DC-5 addressed this issue by introducing [...] "Fast Edit" [...] mode and a new [...] "Fast Edit" [...] history whereby each change to the original file could be reversed. In this mode, both the source and destination files became the one file on screen, whilst information regarding changes made were saved in the background to enable them to be selectively un-done.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1992, Boatmen's-First National Bank of Oklahoma {{announced}} it would vacate {{the building and the}} banking lobby. Boatmen's had acquired Leadership Bank, and chose to utilize their headquarters in Leadership Square to the immediate northwest of First National Center. Boatmen's was later acquired by NationsBank - now Bank of America - and retains the Leadership Square headquarters for their Oklahoma City operations. Since Boatmen's departure, no bank has utilized First National Center. The building was sold to a California buyer for $21 million, with plans of a major renovation of the property. The buyer was organized as two separate entities, First National I, LLC and First National II, LLC, both of which are part of the Milbank Real Estate Group, led by chief executive officer Aaron Yashouafar. [...] Renovations were begun, with plans to restore it to its 1930s glory. The buyer, however, ran out of money and filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma in October 2010. [...] Since <b>filing</b> for bankruptcy, <b>restoration</b> activities within the building have ceased, leaving the building in apparent disrepair due to the halfway completed construction projects. The famous [...] "Great Banking Hall" [...] is today used for various social events, galas, balls, and proms.|$|R
