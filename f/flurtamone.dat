40|$|The mode {{of action}} of the {{furanone}} herbicide <b>flurtamone</b> and derivatives was investigated with cress seedlings and with the unicellular cyanobacterium Anacystis. Either in the light or in the dark these compounds inhibited the formation of α- and β-carotene {{and all of the}} xanthophylls in the seedlings. Instead, phytoene, a precursor of colored carotenoids, was accumulated. In illuminated seedlings photooxidative destruction of chlorophyll was observed. The I 50 value of <b>flurtamone</b> inhibition of carotenoid biosynthesis in intact Anacystis cells and the K 1 value for interaction of <b>flurtamone</b> with phytoene desaturase with Anacystis thylakoids were 30 and 18 nanomoles, respectively. Concentrations of <b>flurtamone</b> which strongly inhibited carotenoid synthesis had no direct peroxidative activities and did not inhibit photosynthetic electron transport...|$|E
40|$|According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has {{reviewed}} the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) currently established at European {{level for the}} pesticide active substance <b>flurtamone.</b> In order to assess the occurrence of <b>flurtamone</b> residues in plants, processed commodities, rotational crops and livestock, EFSA considered the conclusions derived {{in the framework of}} Directive 91 / 414 /EEC as well as the European authorisations reported by Member States (incl. the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data, MRL proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. No information required by the regulatory framework was found to be missing and no risk to consumers was identified...|$|E
40|$|Alopecurus myosuroides and Apera spica-venti are {{the most}} {{important}} grass weeds in German cereal cropping systems. Both species show increasing resistance problems with herbicide resistant biotypes in many regions. In many cases, non target-site resistance (TSR) mechanism can be detected. In these biotypes resistance is assumingly based on non target-site-mechanisms (NTSR) and an enhanced metabolism might be responsible in the first place. Resistance in A. spica-venti biotypes can also be found against pre-emergence herbicides like diflufenican and pendimethalin. However, untill now no resistance in A. spica-venti against the active ingredients <b>flurtamone,</b> flufenacet and prosulfocarb could be detected. A. myosuroides biotypes also frequently show NTSR mechanisms. Resistance patterns are variable and predictions about the efficacy of one herbicide cannot be made based on the knowledge of the effects of another ingredient even within the same mode of action group. The resistance patterns of different A. myosuroides biotypes and crosses indicate a complex, polygenetic control of NTSR mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive 60 / 2000 /EG (WFD) {{requires}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for polluting substances. Member States {{have to set}} {{objectives for}} individual surface water bodies (Article 4 WFD). The transitional period for Directive 2006 / 11 /EC ended in 2013. Therefore, revision, adoption {{and implementation of the}} EQS for the substances on the "Indicative list of main pollutants" (see Annex VIII WFD) is needed to assess the status of the surface waters. In this context, the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) initiated a project to update the environmental quality standards (EQS) for 10 pollutants (pollutants specific for river basin according to Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (OGewV)) and to compile suggestions for environmental quality standards for 20 new chemicals. The searched data were documented data sheets according to the "Guidance Document No. 27 : Technical Guidance for Deriving Environmental Quality Standards" (EC, 2011). The derivation of EQS for the matrices to be considered was performed in accordance with the rules as laid down in the "Guidance Document No. 27 ". Within this project EQS proposals were derived for the following 30 substances: 2. 4 -D, arsenic, bezafibrate, carbamazepin, carbendazim, chloroacetic acid, chromium, dibutyltin, dimethoate, dimoxystrobin, epichlorhydrin, erythromycin, flufenacet, <b>flurtamone,</b> imidacloprid, copper, metoprolol, monobutyltin cation, monolinuron, nicosulfuron, omethoate, triphenyl phosphate, phoxim, roxithromycin, sulcotrione, sulfamethoxazole, tetrabutyltin, triclosan, uranium, zinc...|$|E
40|$|The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii {{provides}} a tractable genetic model to study herbicide {{mode of action}} using forward genetics. The herbicide norflurazon inhibits phytoene desaturase, which is required for carotenoid synthesis. Locating amino acid substitutions in mutant phytoene desaturases conferring norflurazon resistance {{provides a}} genetic approach to map the herbicide binding site. We isolated a UV-induced mutant able to grow in very high concentrations of norflurazon (150 µM). The phytoene desaturase gene in the mutant strain contained the first resistance mutation to be localised to the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-likedomain. A highly conserved phenylalanine amino acid at position 131 of the 564 amino acid precursor protein was changed to a valine in the mutant protein. F 131, and two other amino acids whose substitution confers norflurazon resistance in homologous phytoene desaturase proteins, map to distant regions in the primary sequence of the C. reinhardtii protein (V 472, L 505) but in tertiary models these residues cluster together to a region close to the predicted FAD binding site. The mutant gene allowed direct 5 µM norflurazon based selection of transformants, which were tolerant to other bleaching herbicides including fluridone, <b>flurtamone,</b> and diflufenican but were more sensitive to beflubutamid than wild type cells. Norflurazon resistance and beflubutamid sensitivity allow either positive or negative selection against transformants expressing the mutant phytoene desaturase gene...|$|E
40|$|A {{search for}} clay-surfactant based {{formulations}} with {{high percentage of}} the active ingredient, which can yield slow release of active molecules is described. The active ingredients were the herbicides metribuzin (MZ), mesotrione (MS) and <b>flurtamone</b> (FL), whose solubilities were examined {{in the presence of}} four commercial surfactants; (i) neutral: two berols (B 048, B 266) and an alkylpolyglucoside (AG 6202); (ii) cationic: an ethoxylated amine (ET/ 15). Significant percent of active ingredient (a. i.) in the clay/surfactant/herbicide formulations could be achieved only when most of the surfactant was added as micelles. MZ and FL were well solubilized by berols, whereas MS by ET/ 15. Sorption of surfactants on the clay mineral sepiolite occurred mostly by sorption of micelles, and the loadings exceeded the CEC. Higher loadings were determined for B 266 and ET/ 15. The sorption of surfactants was modeled by using the Langmuir-Scatchard equation which permitted the determination of binding coefficients {{that could be used for}} further predictions of the sorbed amounts of surfactants under a wide range of clay/surfactant ratios. A possibility was tested of designing clay-surfactant based formulations of certain herbicides by assuming the same ratio between herbicides and surfactants in the formulations as for herbicides incorporated in micelles in solution. Calculations indicated that satisfactory FL formulations could not be synthesized. The experimental fractions of herbicides in the formulations were in agreement with the predicted ones for MS and MZ. The validity of this approach was confirmed in in vitro release tests that showed a slowing down of the release o...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, an {{increasing}} occurrence {{of resistance to}} Apera spica-venti, especially to ALS inhibitors and partially to ACCase inhibitors has been reported for the new federal states, too. The dominance of winter wheat and winter rape in crop rotations associated with a unilateral application of herbicides has increased the selection pressure. In order to counter further spread of herbicide resistance, the right choice of the mode of action of the herbicide or herbicide combination and highly efficacious herbicide treatments are the methods of choice, of course {{in addition to the}} agronomic aspects, such as sowing date and crop rotation. The research determined how and to what extent dicotyledonous weeds are associated with loose silkybentgrass. Based on the results, single herbicides or herbicide tank mixes were tested to achieve the expected level of control. As a result, treatments which have achieved very high level of control against A. spica-venti and the most common dicotyledonous weeds can be recommended. A total of 191 trial sites have been included in the analysis of A. spica-venti. Using the HRAC-classification of herbicides used, groups were formed which might contribute to solving problems specifically linked to the detected resistance situation of the site. In the autumn, flufenacet-containing herbicides, such as Malibu (flufenacet, pendimethalin), Herold SC (flufenacet, diflufenican), Bacara Forte (flufenacet, <b>flurtamone,</b> diflufenican), Carmina 640 (chlortoluron, diflufenican) and Fenikan (isoproturon, diflufenican) demonstrated high efficiency against A. spica-venti. Combinations of herbicides with the HRAC classification of N and E provide further opportunities for the implementation of anti-resistance management strategies, such as Sumimax + Ciral (flumioxazin + metsulfuron, flupyrsulfuron) or Boxer (prosulfocarb) + Diflanil 500 SC (diflufenican) or Beflex (beflubutamid). When applied in spring, significant differences concerning the efficiency and robustness of sulfonylureas for the control of A. spica-venti were observed...|$|E
