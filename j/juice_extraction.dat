40|$|In certain {{varieties}} of oranges, {{an increase in}} bitterness is currently observed in <b>juices,</b> after <b>extraction,</b> restraining their industrial use. This has been explained by {{the conversion of the}} nonbitter precursor, limonoate A-ring lactone, to a bitter compound, limonin, under acidic conditions. The aim of this study was the modelling of limonin consumption in raw and sterilized orange juices by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus isolated from soil. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used for modelling bioconversion and optimization reaction conditions, as a function of temperature (23 - 37 degreesC) and limonin content (8 - 16 ppm). Initial rate of limonin consumption could be described, both in raw and sterilized orange juices, by concave surfaces with a minimum at 26 and 27 degreesC, respectively. In raw orange juice, after 7 h reaction time, the amount of converted limonin, increased with temperature. Also, the highest conversions (higher than 33 %) were achieved at high temperature (higher than 34 degreesC) and low initial limonin content. In sterilized juice, a maximum conversion of about 23 % is expected at 31 degreesC, for an initial limonin content of I I mg l(- 1). Thus, limonin bioconversion may be carried out directly in raw juice, avoiding juice sterilization. In addition, no significant decrease in reducing sugars was observed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Before 2004, the {{occurrence}} of acute Chagas disease (ACD) by oral transmission associated with food was scarcely known or investigated. Originally sporadic and circumstantial, ACD occurrences have now become frequent in the Amazon region, with recently related outbreaks spreading to several Brazilian states. These cases {{are associated with the}} consumption of açai juice by waste reservoir animals or insect vectors infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in endemic areas. Although guidelines for processing the fruit to minimize contamination through microorganisms and parasites exist, açai-based products must be assessed for quality, for which the demand for appropriate methodologies must be met. METHODS: Dilutions ranging from 5 to 1, 000 T. cruzi CL Brener cells were mixed with 2 mL of acai <b>juice.</b> Four <b>Extraction</b> of T. cruzi DNA methods were used on the fruit, and the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method was selected according to JRC, 2005. RESULTS: DNA extraction by the CTAB method yielded satisfactory results with regard to purity and concentration for use in PCR. Overall, the methods employed proved that not only extraction efficiency but also high sensitivity in amplification was important. CONCLUSIONS: The method for T. cruzi detection in food is a powerful tool in the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks as it turns epidemiological evidence into supporting data that serve to confirm T. cruzi infection in the foods. It also facilitates food quality control and assessment of good manufacturing practices involving acai-based products...|$|R
40|$|Sugar milling is {{a process}} in which juice is {{extracted}} from sugar cane stalks. Using only one mill to extract juice yields an unsatisfactory result because the bagasse leaving the mill still contains a lot of juice. Therefore, a milling tandem consisting of at least 5 mills is normally used in the sugar milling process. In order to maximize <b>extraction,</b> <b>juice</b> or water is mixed with input bagasse before being fed to each of the second and subsequent mills. This method is known as compound imbibition. This paper presents a model to simulate the operation of sugar mills that use compound imbibition. In addition to incorporating balances of fiber and dissolved solids, the model accounts for possibilities of non-ideal mixing between bagasse and imbibition water or juice. Operation data of the sugar mills are used to obtain performance parameters of all mills. The model is used to show how imbibition results in increases in both the extraction of dissolved solids and the moisture of bagasse leaving the milling process.

30|$|Citrus {{represents}} one of the major fruits in the world. The fruits belong to six genera (Fortunella, Eremocitrus, Clymendia, Poncirus, Microcitrus, and Citrus), but the major commercial fruits belong to genus Citrus which consists of several important fruits, viz. oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit, mandarins, and pomeloes (Chanthaphon et al. 2008). Orange, specifically, the sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) is the most commonly grown tree fruit in the world (Pandharipande and Makode 2012). Orange trees are cultivated extensively in tropical and subtropical climates due to the sweet fruit obtained. The fruits are peeled or cut (for bitter rind avoidance) and eaten skinned; or processed to orange <b>juice</b> by <b>extraction.</b> Orange fruits are majorly utilized by juice processing industries, with the peels categorized as wastes. Even at homes, orange peels are discarded inside waste container because people love the orange pulp for its juicy pulp and discard the peel as it does not taste as great as the pulp. In lieu of this, since the yield of orange juice is half of the fruit weight (Hashmi et al. 2012), a very large amount of orange by-product wastes are generated annually. Fernández-Lopes et al. (2004) reported that the by-products from orange juice processing pose a serious problem to the industry, given their limited applications and low added value. However, Nogueira et al. (2000) observed that the orange agro-industry is amongst the sectors producing large amounts of waste with possibilities for use. This recovery is absolutely connected to sustainable development and the marketability of these by-products. As there is always an increased concern about bringing useful products from waste, orange fruit wastes are no exceptions. Amongst the biologically active compounds (BAC) in these by-products are essential oils (EOs) and pectin.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the organic}} farming sector is rapidly {{increasing}} {{in order to}} meet the increasing demand for organic products. However, the scarce availability of organic feed for monogastric animals together with the lack of organic fertilizers are challenging the development of this sector. In this context, a Danish project called Organofinery is focusing on developing a green biorefinery platform for the production of organic protein-rich feed for monogastric animals, of biogas and of organic fertilizer. In the Organofinery concept, the freshly harvested green biomass is separated by a screw press into a green juice and a press cake. Soluble sugars contained in the green juice are fermented by specific lactic acid bacteria, leading to a drop of the pH and triggering protein precipitation. The resulting protein concentrate is purely organic and rich in non-denatured proteins, making it a high-value protein feed product for organic farming.

This study is concerned with the coagulation efficiency of a new, environmental friendly, natural coagulant extracted from common bean seeds in the primary treatment of distillery wastewater in the bioethanol production from sugar beet juice. Active coagulation components were extracted from ground seeds of common bean with 0. 5 mol/L NaCl. The obtained raw extract was used as a coagulant. The coagulation efficiency was measured by jar test at different pH values of wastewater, and a decrease in organic matter content was determined. The experiments confirmed that natural coagulant from common bean could be successfully used for the treatment of <b>extraction</b> <b>juice</b> distillery wastewater. The highest coagulation efficiencies were achieved at the pH 5. 2 with a coagulant dose of 30 mL/L, and at the pH 8. 5 with a coagulant dose of 5 mL/L, and they were 64. 71 % and 68. 75 % respectively. These encouraging results indicate that natural coagulant from common bean seeds is a potential alternative to conventional chemical coagulant/flocculant agents for treatment of wastewaters.
