40|$|ABSTRACT: A new {{procedure}} {{for evaluating the}} load capacity of single-layer rein-forced soils is presented. Slippage between the reinforcement and the granular fill is considered in the analysis. This procedure incorporates two important membrane sup-port contributions, namely normal stress membrane support and interfacial shear stress membrane support. The <b>improved</b> <b>subgrade</b> capacity due to the membrane-induced re-duction in shear stresses at the topof the subgrade is also captured. Using this procedure, it is demonstrated that a significant membrane contribution can be developed even for cases in which proper anchorage is not provided. The derived expression satisfies both vertical andhorizontal force equilibriumalong the reinforcement. The proposed analyt-ical procedure was validated by comparing the analytical results to the results from small-scale model tests performed by others. The potential usefulness of the proposed procedure is illustrated by using the resulting equations to evaluate the performance of an embankment supported on a soft foundation overlain by a reinforcing layer...|$|E

40|$|<b>Improving</b> poor <b>subgrades</b> is {{essential}} to facilitate highway construction and ensure long-term stability. Improvements include enhanced load distribution by using crushed rock "capping" layers or increasing the subbase thickness if the bearing capacity of the subgrade remains unchanged, and lime stabilization of soft clay <b>subgrades</b> <b>improves</b> the <b>subgrade</b> stiffness and strength to reduce or remove {{the need for additional}} crushed rock. However, the relative sustainability of subgrade improvement options as determined by indicators such as carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions is not immediately apparent. If capping is used, the relative depth requirements, together with variations due to different aggregates, make the lowest emissions option unclear. Lime production incurs far greater CO 2 emissions than aggregates production, but it is used in smaller quantities and the quantity truly required, as opposed to that commonly specified, requires consideration. To address these decision-making dilemmas, a methodology is presented that allows the relative sustainability, according to CO 2 emissions, to be evaluated. This methodology is illustrated through analysis of available improvement options for a typical low California bearing ratio clay subgrade by using capping, subbase thickening and lime stabilization, or a combination of these solutions. It is concluded that analysis of the relative sustainability of subgrade improvements can be informed by emissions calculations and that the lowest emissions option is heavily dependent on associated highway haulage vehicle movements. However, wider appreciation of financial, social, and environmental factors and a fundamental understanding of the role of lime stabilization are necessary if road foundations are to be constructed sustainably...|$|R

Such materials often become available in large volumes, from deep cut excavations and, if not used in nearby embankments, they must be disposed as spoil at high monetary and Environmental cost. This paper investigates the requirements for the use of poor soil materials (CBR < 5 %) in the body of highway embankments as subgrades for flexible asphalt pavements. Parametric finite-element analyses are performed to calculate the horizontal tensile strain {{at the bottom of the}} asphalt base and the vertical compressive strain at the bottom of the <b>improved</b> <b>subgrade</b> for pavement structures met in practice. These Values are compared with corresponding results of typical flexible pavements on good quality subgrades designed according to the AASHTO (1993) method. Based on this comparison, a method is proposed to determine the required thickness of the sub-base layer as a function of the sub-grade quality (expressed in terms of its CBR value), making the practical assumption that the thickness and mechanical characteristics of the asphalt surfacing and the aggregate base layer are constant in all cases.

The problem was analyzed in the first step at the component level, which consists of a single post embedded in a cohesionless soil and laterally loaded by an impactor.

From this point of view, the treatment of fine soils with lime (if needed, with lime and cement) can be considered as one of the main measures for preserving the natural environment since it fulfills the principles of minimizing the use of not-renewable natural resources and maximizing the reuse of those natural resources involved, in any case, in the construction of a road infrastructure.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 Lime {{treatment}} of soil is {{the practice of}} introducing lime to soil to <b>improve</b> <b>subgrade</b> conditions or to improve a soil's properties to meet construction aggregate qualifications. Lime treated soils commonly exhibit improvements in moisture-density, strength, and thaw performance. Although lime treatment has been practiced in many regions of the United States and Canada for several decades, it is not practiced in Alaska. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine potential of improving commonly encountered Alaskan soils with lime treatment. The two soils analyzed during this study were a silt from the Fairbanks area and a silty gravel from the Anchorage area. These soils were analyzed due to their similarity with soils encountered within regions of Alaska that are currently developed, and have potential for future development. Several laboratory tests were conducted to analyze the effect lime has on the engineering properties of both studied soils. The properties analyzed included moisture-density, strength, frost susceptibility, and thaw strength. The results of this study show lime treatment has potential to improve the engineering properties of commonly encountered Alaskan soils. The results of this study also show potential to improve Alaskan soil with low concentrations of lime during cool and short construction seasons...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 29, 2015 - June 29, 2016 Seismically-induced liquefaction represents {{a major cause of}} damage to civil infrastructure and can result in significant damage following major earthquakes. Liquefaction can occur when earthquake ground motions raise pore-water pressures in loose, sandy soil, resulting in a substantial decrease of soil strength. Owing to the potential for instability following liquefaction, geotechnical engineers often prescribe ground improvement programs to densify, drain, and/or reinforce liquefiable soils. Conventional driven timber pile ground improvement can provide a cost-effective liquefaction mitigation method, as it provides densification and reinforcement to an <b>improved</b> <b>subgrade.</b> The potential for drained timber piles to improve densification and potentially reduce in-earthquake pore pressures could allow all three improvement methodologies in one mitigation method. However, the soil densification possible with timber pile ground improvement is rarely incorporated into stability analyses because of the current lack of understanding of the amount of densification possible. This study focuses on a field trial of driven conventional and drained timber piles to investigate the effect of pile spacing, time-since-installation, and drainage on the amount of soil densification. The test site consisted of clean to silty sands with a relative density ranging from 40 to 50 percent prior to installation. Following installation of the timber piles, which ranged in spacing from two, three, four, and five pile diameters, cone penetration tests were conducted to evaluate the degree of densification. These tests were performed at approximately one week, one month, three months, and eight months following installation to evaluate the effect of time and to understand the role of fines content on the degree of densification. In general, the relative density of the soils improved to approximately 60 to 100 percent depending on the pile spacing and the presence of drainage elements. A controlled blasting test plan was also conducted at an un-improved control zone and in the improved timber pile test area {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this ground improvement alternative at reducing the excess pore-water pressures and mitigating liquefaction. The treated zones were shown to mitigate liquefaction by reducing the peak residual r[subscript u] values 0 to 22 percent and lowering the soil settlements by approximately 75 percent compared to the un-improved zone...|$|E

With the recent release of the M-E Pavement Design Guide, highway agencies are further encouraged to implement the resilient modulus test to <b>improve</b> <b>subgrade</b> design. A laboratory resilient modus test and a FWD test are usually used to obtain the resilient modulus of subgrade. However, the difference in the resilient modulus obtained from these two methods is considerably large {{due to the fact that}} these tests are conducted under different conditions. This difference gives engineers a significant confusion about how they input appropriately the resilient modulus in the MEPDG software. In the present study, FWD tests, resilient modulus (Mr) tests and physical property tests were conducted to develop the relationship between the modulus from the FWD test and the resilient modulus from the lab resilient modulus test by comparing the results obtained from the FWD test on subgrade and the laboratory repeated triaxial load test on subgrade soil samples molded at OMC in Indiana varying over different climatic conditions. Based on the results of FWD tests and laboratory tests on some Indiana subgrades, the following conclusions can be drawn: On average, the FWD modulus is about 75 % lower than the lab resilient modulus of the soil compacted at OMC.

40|$|This {{executive}} summary presents {{a summary of}} the findings of all study phases conducted to develop recommendations for the development of specifications for subgrade acceptance based on measured deflections. The rolling wheel deflectomter (RWD), portable truck-mounted deflection measurement systems, and dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) were utilized on numerous subgrade construction projects between the 1998 and 2001 construction seasons. Comparative nuclear density and soil stiffness gauge readings were also obtained at selected locations on many of the included construction projects. The research findings indicate that deflection test results may be appropriate for identifying areas of poor in-place stability within constructed subgrades. However, deflection testing alone may not provide all of the data necessary to properly differentiate acceptable and non-acceptable subgrade stabilities. It {{is important to note that}} deflection test results are related to the moisturedensity conditions at the time of testing. Soils that show acceptable results (i. e., low deflections) may subsequently weaken due to changes in moisture content, freezing/thawing, etc. In instances where subgrade acceptance is well in advance of base course application, subgrade moisture changes may result in decreased soil support. For those conditions where soil compaction has been conducted at a moisture state near optimum, surface deflections should be correlated to the achieved level of compaction. Based on the deflection data gathered during this research study from test areas which were considered as passing based on visual observations, a deflection acceptance threshold of 1. 50 inches was selected as reasonable to limit associated acceptance errors. For use within project implementations, this threshold value was recommended for use to identify potentially âfailedâ test locations. It was recommended that the project engineer retain the right to require corrective actions to <b>improve</b> <b>subgrade</b> conditions based on the magnitude and extent of failed readings...|$|R

With the recent release of the M-E Design Guide, highway agencies are further encouraged to implement the resilient modulus test to <b>improve</b> <b>subgrade</b> design. In the present study, physical property tests, unconfined compressive tests, resilient modulus (Mr) tests and Several Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) tests were conducted to assess the resilient and permanent strain behavior of 14 cohesive subgrade soils and five cohesionless soils encountered in Indiana. The applicability for simplification of the existing resilient modulus test, AASHTO T 307, was investigated by reducing the number of steps and cycles of the resilient modulus test. Results show that {{it may be possible to}} simplify the complex procedures required in the existing Mr testing to a single step with a confining stress of 2 psi and deviator stresses of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 15 psi. Three models for estimating the resilient modulus are proposed based on the unconfined compressive tests. A predictive model to estimate material coefficients k 1, k 2, and k 3 using 12 soil variables obtained from the soil property tests and the standard Proctor tests is developed. The predicted resilient moduli using all the predictive models compare satisfactorily with measured ones. A simple mathematical approach is introduced to calculate the resilient modulus. Although the permanent strain occurs during the resilient modulus test, the permanent behavior of subgrade soils is currently not taken into consideration. In order to capture both the permanent and the resilient behavior of subgrade soils, a constitutive model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) is proposed. A comparison of the measured permanent strains with those obtained from the Finite Element (FE) analysis shows a reasonable agreement. An extensive review of the M-E design is done.

40|$|A {{performance}} {{model and}} a reliability-based optimization model for flexible pavements {{that accounts for}} the effects of rehabilitation actions are developed. The developed performance model can be effectively implemented in all the applications that require the reliability (performance) of pavements, before and after the rehabilitation actions. The response surface methodology in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate pavement fragilities. To provide more flexibility, the parametric regression model that expresses fragilities in terms of decision variables is developed. Developed fragilities are used as performance measures in a reliability-based optimization model. Three decision policies for rehabilitation actions are formulated and evaluated using a genetic algorithm. The multi-objective genetic algorithm is used for obtaining optimal trade-off between performance and cost. To illustrate the developed model, a numerical study is presented. The developed performance model describes well the behavior of flexible pavement before as well as after rehabilitation actions. The sensitivity measures suggest that the reliability of flexible pavements before and after rehabilitation actions can effectively be improved by providing an asphalt layer as thick as possible in the initial design and <b>improving</b> the <b>subgrade</b> stiffness. The importance measures suggest that the asphalt layer modulus at the time of rehabilitation actions represent the principal uncertainty for the performance after rehabilitation actions. Statistical validation of the developed response model shows that the response surface methodology can be efficiently used to describe pavement responses. The results for parametric regression model indicate that the developed regression models are able to express the fragilities in terms of decision variables. Numerical illustration for optimization shows that the cost minimization and reliability maximization formulations can be efficiently used in determining optimal rehabilitation policies. Pareto optimal solutions obtained from multi-objective genetic algorithm can be used to obtain trade-off between cost and performance and avoid possible conflict between two decision policies...|$|R

With the development of highway construction in Chinaï¼more and more highway projects completed, subgrade compactness seriously influences on the highway pavement performance, The authors of this article makes the analysis for the relationship between sugrade strength and life-span of asphalt pavement, some useful conclusions are obtained from the paperâs results. The influencing factors of subgrade strength Now the popular type of pavement structure of trunk highway is the asphalt pavement in China...|$|R
40|$|Railways have {{technical}} and economic advantages, and therefore, railway traffic {{has gained a}} specific and irreplaceable position in recent years. With this background, and to satisfy their rapid development, railways will inevitably be constructed on soft soil subgrade such as soft clay subgrade. It is desired to understand the behaviour of soft clay subgrade subjected to cyclic loads when a new rail track is designed or an existing one is under maintenance. When the soft clay subgrade is subjected to the cyclic loading, excess pore pressures and axial strains keep developing with {{the increasing number of}} cycles, resulting in a decreased bearing capacity of the subgrade and excessive settlement. To <b>improve</b> the <b>subgrade,</b> prefabricated vertical band drains (PVDs) is used increasingly in popularity among a variety of techniques. With the installation of PVDs, a short radial drainage path is introduced to dissipate the excess pore pressure so that the soft clay subgrade becomes more stable subjected to train loads. This thesis covers the laboratory tests and numerical modelling. The behaviour of soft clays under cyclic loading with or without radial drainage is investigated. A series of undrained cyclic triaxial tests were conducted on specimens of reconstituted Kaolinite. Three cyclic stress ratios and four loading frequencies were used in the laboratory tests to study the performance of soft subgrade soil subjected to cyclic loading. The effects of cyclic stress ratio and loading frequency on the generation of excess pore pressures and axial strains were investigated. The roles of cyclic stress ratio and loading frequency play in influencing the stability of soft clay subgrade were discussed. The effect of strain rate for a stress controlled test on the performance of soft clays under cyclic loading was investigated. The relationship between the strain rate and either cyclic stress ratio or loading frequency were figured out, and in this way, the influence of cyclic stress ratio and loading frequency on the progressive shear failure and excessive plastic deformation were justified. Furthermore, due to a high strain rate varying from 150 to 550...|$|R
