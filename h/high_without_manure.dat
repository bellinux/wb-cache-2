40|$|Weed is a {{plant that}} is {{considered}} by farmer as nuisance and unwanted planted plant due to its bad effect to crop. The decrease of harvest occurs because of competition among weed and crop. To increase crop production, commonly farmers use chemical based pesticides and fertilizer, which is harmful to environment.

Carrot contains many vitamins which is beneficial for our health. Weed grown in the carrot field could decrease carrot harvest.

40|$|Long-term slash-and-burn experiments, when {{compared}} with intensive tillage <b>without</b> <b>manuring,</b> resulted in a huge data set relating to potential crop yields, depending on soil quality, crop type, and agricultural measures. Cultivation <b>without</b> <b>manuring</b> or fallow phases did not produce satisfying yields, and mono-season cropping on freshly cleared and burned plots resulted in rather high yields, comparable to those produced during modern industrial agriculture - at least ten-fold the ones estimated for the medieval period. Continuous cultivation on the same plot, using imported wood from adjacent areas as fuel, causes decreasing yields over several years. The high yield of the first harvest of a slash-and-burn agriculture is caused by nutrient input through the ash produced and mobilization from the organic matter of the topsoil, due to high soil temperatures during the burning process and higher topsoil temperatures due to the soil’s black surface. The harvested crops are pure, without contamination of any weeds. Considering {{the amount of work}} required to fight weeds without burning, the slash-and-burn technique yields much better results than any other tested agricultural approach. Therefore, in dense woodland, without optimal soils and climate, slash-and-burn agriculture seems to be the best, if not the only, feasible method to start agriculture, for example, during the Late Neolithic, when agriculture expanded from the loess belt into landscapes less suitable for agriculture. Extensive and cultivation with manuring is more practical in an already-open landscape and with a denser population, but its efficiency in terms of the ratio of the manpower input to food output, is worse.

There are thirty-nine plots in the field and each has received a definite treatment during this time, the aim being to compare the effect of rotations with continuous single crops, both with and without fertilizer, and to compare the effect of commercial fertilizers with that of barnyard manure. Some striking differences in yields have been obtained but no effort had been made to investigate the changes produced in the composition of the soil until 1909, when Dr. L. D. Haigh took samples from a series of the plots and determined the hygroscopic moisture, total nitrogen and acidity. The humus, total phosphoric acid and the phosphoric acid soluble in N/ 5 HC 1, total potassium, calcium, magnesium and the lime requirement by the Veitch method have since been determined on these samples and these data, as well as the determinations made by Dr. Haigh, are presented in the following thesis.

The combined effects of tillage and manure application on Lixisol properties and on crop performance were investigated at Saria, Burkina Faso, to find efficient soil management practices to improve soil fertility. A randomized block design with four treatments (hand hoeing only, hand hoeing+manure, ploughing only, oxen ploughing+manure) in three replications was started in 1990. Ten years later, total soil organic (SOC), particulate organic matter and C mineralization were measured. Initial SOC concentration was 4 mg/g and dropped to 2. 1 mg/g soil in ploughed plots <b>without</b> <b>manure</b> and to 2. 5 mg/g soil in hoed plots <b>without</b> <b>manure.</b> Manure addition mitigated the decrease of SOC in ploughed plots and even built up SOC in hoed plots, where it increased to 5. 8 mg/g soil. Manure had a large effect on the fractions in which SOC was stored. In ploughed plots, a large amount of SOC was stored in physical particles > 0. 25 mm, while in hand hoed plots the maximum SOC was stored in finer fractions. In the topsoil, hoeing and manure resulted in a higher SOC than ploughing with no manure. However, in the 15 ¿ 25 cm layer, particularly in September, particulate organic matter was greater in ploughed plots with manure than in hoed plots with manure. Crop yields were highest on ploughed+manure plots and lowest on ploughed plots with no manure.

Amounts of 195. 8 kg and 70 kg N per hectare, respectively, of sunn hemp and AS were added in the following treatments: <b>without</b> green <b>manure</b> and <b>without</b> AS; <b>without</b> green <b>manure,</b> with AS- 15 N; with green manure- 15 N and with AS; with green manure- 15 N, without AS; with green manure and with AS- 15 N. Four samples from the leaves + 3 were collected and 2 m of the sugar cane row were harvested to estimate crop yield. The results for N contents (g kg- 1), isotopic abundance of N (atoms % 15 N) in leaf + 3 samples, and sugarcane productivity were used to calculate cumulative N, nitrogen in the plant derived from the fertilizer-Ndff (% and kg ha- 1), as well as percent recovery of fertilizer N (R%). Sugarcane was analysed and pol and total recovered sugar calculated. The highest Ndff percentages were observed eight months after sugarcane planting for treatments containing green <b>manure</b> <b>without</b> mineral N, and gree...|$|R

40|$|O presente trabalho objetivou avaliar a distribuição do sistema radicular da figueira 'Roxo de Valinhos' em função da aplicação de níveis de adubação orgânica durante quatro anos. A cultura foi conduzida em Botucatu-SP, no espaçamento de 3 x 2 m, num solo classificado como Nitossolo Vermelho. Os tratamentos corresponderam a níveis crescentes de adubação orgânica com esterco de curral, {{conforme}} a recomendação de N para a cultura: testemunha (sem adubação), 25 %; 50 %; 75 %; 100 %; 125 % e 150 % da dose recomendada. A avaliação da distribuição do sistema radicular foi realizada 4 anos após a instalação da cultura, sendo que, de cada planta, foram retiradas quatro amostras a 0 - 40 cm de distância do tronco, na profundidade de 0 - 40 cm. As amostras foram submetidas à lavagem e secagem em estufa (65 ºC), para posteriormente avaliar a massa seca das raízes. O sistema radicular mostrou-se mais desenvolvido horizontalmente do que na vertical. O menor peso de raízes foi obtido sem esterco (43, 3 g), e o maior, com 150 % da dose de N recomendada (177, 7 g). The {{research had}} as purpose {{to evaluate the}} root system distribution of 'Purple of Valinhos' fig plants cultivated with manure levels, during four years. The fig orchard was planted in Botucatu-SP, at a Red Nitossolo soil with the plants designed at 3 m between lines and 2 m between plants. The treatments were constituted by increasing organic manure levels with cattle manure, according to the recommended nitrogen level for the trees: control (<b>without</b> <b>manure),</b> 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 %, 125 % and 150 % of level manure recommended. The evaluation of root system distribution were made {{four years after the}} orchard installation. From each plant were taken four samples at 0 - 40 cm distance of the stem, in the depth of 0 - 40 cm. After, the samples were washed and dried (65 ºC) for post-evaluation of the dry weight, depth and distance of the roots. It was observed that the root development was higher in the horizontal position when compared with the vertical. The bigger root weight was obtained with the application of 150 % of N level recommended and the smaller root weight was observed <b>without</b> <b>manure</b> (43, 3 g) ...|$|R

40|$|A better {{understanding}} is needed of how conservation practices affect {{the concentration of}} soil N resulting from winter application of manure. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of manure applications on the mineralization and concentration of N during the winter. The experiment was established in fields that were previously under conventional and conservation tillage with and <b>without</b> <b>manure</b> application. Dairy composted manure was applied annually in the fall prior to planting of a winter cover crop. The quantification of N released from composted manure and the amount of N uptake by plant tissues of the cover crop during winter months was determined. The concentration of N was higher in the conventional tillage plots {{at the beginning of the}} study and quickly diminished throughout the growing season. The conservation tillage plots with manure retained the most N compared to the other treatments. This treatment also had the highest plant biomass compared to the other treatments, indicating much more was retained in the plant tissues. These results show use conservation tillage in conjunction with cover crops when applying manure in winter months could potentially minimize the amount of N lost...|$|R
