5|$|The shield is {{the normal}} device for <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> coat of arms. Clergy have used less-military shapes {{such as the}} oval cartouche, but the shield {{has always been a}} {{clerical}} option. Clergy in Italy often use a shield shaped like a horse's face-armor. Clergy in South Africa sometimes follow the national style using a Nguni shield. Women traditionally display their coats of arms on a diamond-shaped lozenge; abbesses follow this tradition or use the cartouche.|$|E

40|$|Previous studies {{reveal that}} young Dutch {{children}} <b>display</b> <b>a</b> [t]-bias {{in the middle}} of words in pronunciation (e. g. van der Feest 2007; Kerkhoff 2007). First graders, however, <b>display</b> <b>a</b> -bias {{in the middle of}} words in their writings (Neijt & Schreuder 2007). The present study investigates children’s spelling and pronunciation of word medial d and t to examine this apparent contrast. It turned out that first graders started with a -bias in their spellings while later on they <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> -bias. A similar development was found for pronunciation: Kindergartners <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> [t]-bias, while second graders <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> [d]-bias instead. Our explanation is that this change is caused by overgeneralization, due to differences between Dutch pronunciation and orthography. We conclude that the orthographic system, although learned later in life, affects children’s earlier acquired pronunciation...|$|R

5|$|Between 1907 and 1911, Caragiale studied Romanian {{heraldry}} and, to this goal, read Octav-George Lecca's Familii boierești române ("Romanian Boyar Families"). Many of {{the comments}} added by him to his {{copy of the book}} are polemic, sarcastic, or mysterious, while the sketches he made on the margin include portrayals of boyars being put to death in various ways, as well as caricatures (such as a blazon <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> donkey's head, which he mockingly assigned to Octav-George Lecca himself). Several of the heraldic objects he created were destined for his own use. In June 1928, he raised a green over yellow ensign he created for the Caragiale family at his property in Fundulea. He also hoisted other symbols, including the flag of Hungary, which, he claimed, underlined his foreign origin.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} an OBE in 1974. In 1996, {{he was awarded}} honorary Irish citizenship. The honour amounts to full Irish citizenship; it is the highest honour the Irish state gives and is rarely granted. In 1994, he was made a Freeman {{of the city of}} Dublin, and was given a honorary doctorate by the University of Limerick. In 1997, he {{was appointed}} a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland. Charlton was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of his contribution to the English game. There is a life-size statue of him at Cork Airport in Ireland, representing him sitting in his fishing gear and <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> salmon.|$|E

There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> Christmas tree in the White House. In 1922 First Lady Florence Harding's illness led to a more subdued Christmas celebration at the White House and no Christmas tree.|$|R

5|$|Hennessey threw five pitches: a fastball, a slider, a changeup, a curveball, and a cutter. The fastball was Hennessey's main pitch; {{he threw}} it over 60% {{of the time}} in the majors. He did not throw it very hard, {{averaging}} speeds under 90mph in 2007 and 2008. His slider was his secondary pitch, and his changeup was his third most-used pitch. Hennessey rarely used the cutter except for in 2006, when he threw it 10.1% of the time. Henessey often was plagued by a big inning, <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> tendency to allow several runs in an inning during his starts.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> wide stylistic variation. Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, an {{exhibition}} in the Grand Palais of Paris {{was devoted to}} his work, during the annual salon of the Société des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France.
