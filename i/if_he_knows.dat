5|$|Ivan {{begins to}} recount {{the story of}} the Denial of Peter, in which Jesus foretells to Saint Peter that he will thrice deny Him before the next crowing of the cock. Peter follows Jesus upon His arrest and joins some workers in the yard {{standing}} around a fire as He is questioned. Thrice the workers suspiciously ask Peter <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> Jesus and thrice he denies his acquaintance. A cock crows and Peter, realizing what he has done, weeps.|$|E
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight {{as to whether or not}} he will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what destiny is {{and then}} {{tells him that}} he has a special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While watching the news coverage of the discovery of the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E

25|$|There {{is always}} a risk that outsiders and {{undercover}} policemen might masquerade as a mafioso to infiltrate the organization. To ensure that this does not happen, a mafioso must never introduce himself to another mafioso whom he does not personally know, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> the other through reputation. If he wants to establish a relationship, he must ask a third mafioso whom they both personally know to introduce them {{to each other in}} a face-to-face meeting. This intermediary can vouch that neither of the two is an impostor.|$|E
25|$|The naturalism of {{the figures}} {{suggests}} the artist's intention to elicit an immediate emotional response to the viewer. Neptune’s furrowed brow gives a sense of his fierce strength. His stance is set in stone, solidifying his divine power. In contrast, Triton looks somewhat submissive while he is grabbing Neptune’s thigh. His face looks {{to be full of}} anxiety as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that he should obey whatever Neptune commands him to do. His timid nature and Neptune’s dominate presence display the reality of human emotion and brings back the point of Bernini’s plan to convey myths coming to life.|$|E
25|$|Any excommunication or interdict obliges {{the person}} {{involved}} {{to refrain from}} receiving Holy Communion, but a minister is obliged to deny Holy Communion only to those on whom an ecclesiastical superior or tribunal has publicly imposed the censure or declared that it has in fact been incurred. Canon 915 thus does not apply in cases of undeclared latae sententiae (automatic) excommunication, such as that incurred, according to canon 1398, by someone who actually procures an abortion. While someone in this situation should not receive Communion until the excommunication is lifted, a priest may not {{on the grounds of}} the automatic excommunication refuse to administer the sacrament even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> of its existence.|$|E

25|$|An {{interlude}} follows {{with the}} Snow Queen and Kay talking in her ice palace throne room. Kay {{is playing with}} ice crystals when the Snow Queen asks him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what love is. He remembers Gerda, but he stays there because his heart is a lump of ice like the Snow Queen. The princess and her consort send Gerda on her way with a golden coach and attendants. While the coach travels through a dark woods, they are stopped by a gang of robbers, who take Gerda and strip the coach of its gold plate, sparing the attendants. An old hag takes Gerda, but when she is bitten on the ear by her daughter Angel, who is riding on her back, she listens to her request to keep Gerda with her other captive pets. These pets include a fox, little rabbits, the birds that were spared the Snow Queen's frost earlier, and a large reindeer, named Bucky Boy. The birds tell Gerda that they saw the Snow Queen take Kay with her to Lapland. The reindeer offers to take Gerda there. It remains for the robber girl to let Gerda and Bucky Boy go, which she does. She also releases the birds, the fox, and the rabbits, but they decide to stay with her.|$|E
500|$|Peter {{goes back}} to the Bugle and claims to have been hiding the whole time. Betty pulls him aside and tells him that she is simply too old to date him and is sorry; Peter, still downtrodden, remembers what the Rhino said and asks a {{reporter}} <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> about anyone by that name. The reporter tells him about L. Thompson Lincoln, a philanthropist who is rumored to be a dangerous crime lord. That night Peter goes to Lincoln's office as Spider-Man {{to find out if the}} rumors are true. Lincoln prefers to be called [...] "Tombstone" [...] and wields incredible strength; he pins him down and suggests that he work for him, fighting crime like usual but turning his head when it comes to his crimes. Spider-Man refuses to do so and runs off.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Radar" [...] {{runs through}} a midtempo dance groove. Spears' vocals are auto tuned and {{accompanied}} by sonar pulses and a heavy usage of distorted synthesizers. The lyrics refer to an attraction between the protagonist and a man, while she wonders <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what she is feeling. [...] "Radar" [...] received mixed reviews from critics; some called {{it one of the}} highlights of Blackout, while others felt that it was over-produced and also criticized her vocals for being processed. In July 2008, [...] "Radar" [...] charted in the top forty of Ireland and New Zealand, and inside the top-ten in Sweden. After it was released as a single from Circus, the track performed poorly on the charts and did not manage to enter the top forty in most countries. However, it became her 21st hit on the US Billboards Pop Songs chart, the most for any artist of the decade.|$|E

500|$|Michael and Bird {{investigate}} in the case, and Michael, with evidence, {{finds out}} where Rex is, and runs away. Meanwhile, Rex wakes up {{inside of a}} shed, handcuffed to the floor. He tries to dial 911 {{on the cell phone}} but Cooper comes in, interrupting him. Michael speaks to Nancy, who admits that she helped Cooper escape but didn’t know he would abduct anyone. She claims that she helped him because he claimed that he was innocent. Tara notes that Cooper had phoned Tara, and told him to go to a payphone near his police station. He goes there, and speaks to Cooper, who tells him to meet him at a warehouse. Cooper then apologizes to Rex, stating that [...] "no son should pay for the sins of the fathers", and walks out of the shack. Michael meets with him; he claims that he met him for [...] "justice", and said that he was innocent. Cooper explains that Rex will die without him, confirming that he will die from dehydration possibly soon. He goes home and takes a sleeping pill, transferring to the [...] "red reality". Later, in the [...] "red reality" [...] (where Hannah is alive and Rex isn't), he speaks with Cooper at jail. He says that he didn't do it, and asks <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> who did. He claimed that Jim Mayhew, another cop, committed the crime and framed him.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Impossible {{is used as}} an {{archetype}} or stock character supervillain. He {{is characterized}} as an evil genius or mad scientist who continually attempts {{to take control of}} the world's population. This is seen as a sub-type of the hero's journey and his calm deconstruction of his own futile, repetitive and self-destructive behaviours is compared to existentialist literature. The supervillains, especially Dr. Impossible, are portrayed as sympathetic characters afflicted with [...] "Malign Hypercognition Disorder", a psychological condition which makes highly intelligent people use their advantages to perform non-virtuous, or evil, actions. Grossman explained that from Dr. Impossible's point of view, he is not inherently evil but rejects societal norms: [...] "it's a matter of integrity — he's sticking to his principles, doing science his own way, pursuing his goals — even if it means the entire world is against him, even if he looks ridiculous in his costume, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> he's going to lose. The superheroes are taking the conformist path, and getting all the applause." [...] From the literary point of view, Grossman believes the supervillains are more interesting characters, [...] "they are usually the most dynamic characters and the most creative. ... Their plans usually start with a great invention, which gives the story all its color and energy. The hero just has to come in and smash it up." [...] Grossman admitted that much of the Dr. Impossible character was inspired by his feelings as a graduate student, [...] "On the one hand, you're supposed to be really smart, and on the other hand, it's a humiliating experience. You're psyched about your intellect and kind of arrogant, but at the same time, you're [...] in the eyes of the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|A player may {{not move}} into check or remain in check, even check by an ally. Likewise, a player may not check or checkmate an ally, and each player {{regardless}} of alliance must defend against check or threat of checkmate {{on the next}} move. (That is, if Middle and Last are allies, and First places Middle in check, Middle must answer the threat, even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> or thinks Last {{will come to the}} rescue.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{distinction}} {{is that the}} first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash and currently heading towards a heavily populated area. Even <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> for sure that innocent people will die if he redirects the plane to a less populated area – people who are [...] "uninvolved" [...] – he will actively turn the plane without hesitation. It may well be considered noble to sacrifice your own life to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of an innocent person in order to save five people may be insufficient justification.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth {{scene is}} another dream, where Serra remembers her collegiate days at [...] "The International University of I-DA-HO" [...] in 1987. [...] Young Serra listens and {{actively}} participates {{in a classroom}} discussion which focuses on topics in pseudo-science. [...] Serra places {{the age of the}} Earth at 10,000 years and classifies fossils as a ruse by Satan to [...] "trick mankind." [...] After class, Young Serra asks the professor <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> of any rituals to protect her from witchcraft. [...] The professor assures her that vigorous cunnilingus will provide the required protection, and wastes no time demonstrating.|$|E
2500|$|An umpire {{will not}} give a batsman out unless an appeal is made by the fielding side, though a batsman may walk <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> himself to be out. This is {{nowadays}} rare, especially in Tests and first-class matches for contentious decisions; however, it is the norm for a batsman to walk when he is out bowled or out to an obvious catch. If the fielding side believes a batsman is out, the fielding side must appeal, by asking [...] "How's that?"(HowzThatt), [...] "Wot Wot" [...] or [...] "How was he?" [...] (or by any other means that either umpire deems {{as a method of}} appealing).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} novel, Dumbledore {{suspects}} that Tom Riddle is somehow {{involved in the}} attacks on the muggle born students, as he says, when asked who is the culprit, [...] "not who, but how?" [...] A younger Dumbledore appears in Riddle's diary, when Harry sees his memory, and asks Riddle <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> anything about {{the attacks on the}} students. During {{the last half of the}} novel, Lucius Malfoy forces the school's other eleven governors to suspend Dumbledore as Headmaster in the wake of attacks by a basilisk in the school when the Chamber of Secrets is opened. Dumbledore is reinstated when the governors discover that Ginny Weasley was taken into the Chamber of Secrets and Lucius is found to have coerced the other governors into suspending him.|$|E
2500|$|Stan was {{introduced}} on-screen on 27 January 2014 when Shirley, Mick and Tina visit {{him at his}} rundown flat needing money to fix the rising damp in their pub, The Queen Victoria. Mick and Tina arrive at his door, but he demands to see Shirley if they want their money. Speaking of Stan's intentions behind giving the money to Shirley, West said, [...] "He’s got the money to spare {{and he wants to}} see them all together in the pub. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> where they are, he can use {{it as a way to}} get back into their lives. Also, giving someone money gives you a certain hold over them, which is what Stan wants." [...] Stan appeared again on 20 February 2014, before arriving permanently on 31 March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Zsa Zsa {{arrives in}} the show's setting of Albert Square, jumping the {{barriers}} at the tube station. She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying {{in a car crash}} in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift. She then heads to the café where she overhears Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan) breaking up with Peter Beale (Thomas Law), and she talks to Peter outside. Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) decides to hold a party at 89b George Street, and Peter invites Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Peter who lives there, and he says nobody does. They dance together and end up kissing. Lauren walks in and slaps Peter and Zsa Zsa, who fights with Lauren. Whitney intervenes, but ends up getting in the fight herself, and Zsa Zsa ends up with a cut on her forehead. When Lucy orders her out, Zsa Zsa throws punch over Lauren, Lucy and Whitney. Outside, she asks Peter <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), saying they go back a long way. Zsa Zsa visits Shirley and they talk. She is about to explain her reasons for being there when Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) comes in, and Shirley asks her to leave. Outside, Peter is waiting for Zsa Zsa. She goes to the bus stop and Peter wonders if he will see her again. She walks over to him and kisses him passionately, and says [...] "maybe", taking his keys without him knowing.|$|E
