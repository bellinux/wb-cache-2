25|$|The SS built three {{extermination}} {{camps in}} occupied Poland specifically for Operation Reinhard: Bełżec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. They were fitted with identical mass killing installations disguised as communal shower rooms. In addition, gas chambers {{were developed in}} 1942 at the Majdanek concentration camp, and at AuschwitzII-Birkenau. In German-occupied USSR at the Maly Trostinets extermination camp shootings were used to kill victims in the woods. At the Chełmno extermination camp victims were killed in gas vans whose redirected exhaust fed into sealed compartments {{at the rear of}} the vehicle. They were utilized in Trostinets as well. Neither of these two camps had international rail connections therefore the trains used to stop at the nearby ghettos in Łódź and in Minsk respectively. From there, the prisoners were taken by trucks to die. At Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor the killing mechanism consisted of a large <b>internal-combustion</b> <b>engine</b> delivering exhaust fumes to gas chambers through pipes. At Auschwitz and Majdanek, the gas chambers relied on Zyklon B pellets of hydrogen cyanide, poured through vents in the roof from cans sealed hermetically.|$|E

25|$|When Carnot {{began working}} on his book, steam engines had {{achieved}} widely recognized economic and industrial importance, {{but there had been}} no real scientific study of them. Newcomen had invented the first piston-operated steam engine over a century before, in 1712; some 50 years after that, James Watt made his celebrated improvements, which were responsible for greatly increasing the efficiency and practicality of steam engines. Compound engines (engines with more than one stage of expansion) had already been invented, and there was even a crude form of <b>internal-combustion</b> <b>engine,</b> with which Carnot was familiar and which he described in some detail in his book. Although there existed some intuitive understanding of the workings of engines, scientific theory for their operation was almost nonexistent. In 1824 the principle of conservation of energy was still poorly developed and controversial, and an exact formulation of the first law of thermodynamics was still more than a decade away; the mechanical equivalence of heat would not be formulated for another two decades. The prevalent theory of heat was the caloric theory, which regarded heat as a sort of weightless and invisible fluid that flowed when out of equilibrium.|$|E
