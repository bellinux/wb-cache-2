40|$|Abstract— 21 / 4 CrlMo {{steel and}} 11 / 4 Cr 1 / 2 Mo steel {{have been widely}} been used for hydro‐processing units such as hydro‐desulphurising and hydro‐cracking reactors. These reactor {{pressure}} vessel steels have a potential for temper embrittlement that leads to toughness degradation and a reduction of the critical flaw size for brittle fracture. These steels <b>are</b> also susceptible <b>to</b> hydrogen embrittlement, especially in aged steels where cracks may propagate in the base metal up to the critical flaw size. A vessel with adequate toughness when originally constructed may therefore embrittle during service and such changes may require pressure restrictions during start‐up and shut‐down. A survey of the literature shows composition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the controlling parameter for both temper embrittlement (TE) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE), in‐particular the presence of residual impurity elements such as P {{and the presence of}} elements such as Mo which nullify the effect of impurity segregation. Much information <b>is</b> available <b>to</b> describe embrittlement phenomena for Cr‐Mo steels. This paper reviews the mechanisms of TE and HE and describes a microstructural characterisation route which subsequently allows the structural integrity of potentially <b>embrittled</b> vessels <b>to</b> <b>be</b> examined for the purposes of remaining life assessment and plant life extension.

40|$|Five nickel-base alloys (Inconel 718, Udimet 700, Rene 41, Hastelloy X, and TD-NiCr), one cobalt-base alloy (L- 605), and an iron-base alloy (A- 286) {{were exposed}} in {{hydrogen}} at 0. 1 MN/sq m (15 psi) at several {{temperatures in the}} range from 430 to 980 C for as long as 1000 hours. These alloys <b>were</b> <b>embrittled</b> <b>to</b> varying degrees by such exposures in hydrogen. Embrittlement <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> be: (1) sensitive to strain rate, (2) reversible, (3) caused by large concentrations of absorbed hydrogen, and (4) not associated with any detectable microstructural changes in the alloys. These observations are consistent with a mechanism of internal reversible hydrogen embrittlement...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of liquid metal induced embrittlement (LMIE) {{are not well}} understood and this phenomenon is of {{a high degree of}} industrial importance. Discontinuous and continuous crack propagation in gallium-embrittled brass was studied using double cantilever beam specimens and crack propagation <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discontinuous when the imposed crack speed was less than 6 mm/s and was more or less continuous if greater. The threshold K for cracking <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> non-unique in this system and was weakly dependent on testing variables such as crosshead speed. The discontinuous crack propagation and dependence on crosshead speed <b>were</b> attributed <b>to</b> the tendency of the cracks to blunten by a process of dissolution at the crack tip. A comparison of the experimental results with existing theory suggests that crack growth may not be solely controlled by supply of <b>embrittler</b> <b>to</b> the crack tip...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen has the {{potential}} of increased use in the future as an environmentally friendly fuel. It has, however, shown a tendency <b>to</b> <b>embrittle</b> some materials. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> used in a safe manner and to exploit its full potential, it will <b>be</b> necessary <b>to</b> develop a database of material properties in hydrogen environment. The tests needed to produce this data <b>are</b> costly <b>to</b> perform (tensile test cost 25 times more and low cycle fatigue test are 55 times as expensive). Moreover, there is presently a lack of universal test methods to ensure standardized data within the hydrogen community. Each of the industries that work with hydrogen (aerospace, petroleum, fuel cells, etc.) performs tests by their own laboratory-developed methods, thus rendering cross- comparisons of material property data highly questionable. It is extremely important that data generated in a hydrogen environment <b>be</b> done <b>to</b> a standard that reduces variance to a minimum and allows direct comparison of test results from different laboratories. Doing so will assure that all data generated can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> further our understanding of the hydrogen effects and to make sure components/products designed for hydrogen are the safest and most reliable possible. This paper reviews the results of two 'round-robin' programs conducted by NASA-MSFC. These two programs examined the reproducibility and repeatability of tensile and low-cycle fatigue test results in high-pressure hydrogen environments. The studies indicated that even with the tightest controls available from current commercial standards, the reproducibility (between different laboratories) and repeatability (within a laboratory) results of the tensile tests exhibited five times the variance as in standard ambient air tests. The variance with the LCF tests were on the same order as with air tests, but that <b>was</b> due <b>to</b> the large variation present in the last Interlaboratory air program. The paper concludes with a recommendation for a program that would allow the development of improved test methods, leading to lower variance in the generation of mechanical property data in the future...|$|R
40|$|Incremental {{step load}} testing {{was used in}} {{accordance}} with ASTM F 1940 to rank a number coating processes used in the fastener industry for their propensity to cause internal hydrogen embrittlement. The results showed that coating permeability has a first order effect, while the quantity of hydrogen introduced by the process has a second order effect. Pure zinc electroplating processes, alkaline and acid, <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most <b>embrittling,</b> owing <b>to</b> the low permeability of zinc. The least embrittling processes were zinc-nickel, alkaline and acid, owing to the high permeability of Zn-Ni coatings. Non-electrolytic processes, namely phosphating, mechanical galvanising, DacrometRTM and Magni 555 RTM <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> non-embrittling. Hot dip galvanising <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>embrittling,</b> evidently due <b>to</b> trapped hydrogen being released by the thermal shock of up-quenching upon immersion in molten zinc.

40|$|Atomistic {{modeling}} methods <b>were</b> employed <b>to</b> {{investigate the}} effects of impurity elements on the metallurgy, irradiation embrittlement, and environmentally assisted cracking of nickel-base alloys exposed to nuclear environments. Calculations were performed via ab initio atomistic modeling methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. A Griffith-type fracture criterion <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> quantitatively assess the effect of elements or element pairs on the grain boundary cohesive strength. In order of most <b>embrittling</b> <b>to</b> most strengthening, the elements are ranked as: He, Li, S, H, C, Zr, P, Fe, Mn, Nb, Cr, and B. Helium is strongly embrittling (- 2. 04 eV/atom lowering of the Griffith energy), phosphorus has {{little effect on the}} grain boundary (0. 1 eV/atom), and boron offers appreciable strengthening (1. 03 eV/atom increase in the Griffith energy). Calculations for pairs of elements (H-Li, H-B, H-C, H-P, and H-S) show little interaction on the grain boundary cohesive energy, so that for the conditions studied, linear superposition of elemental effects is a good approximation. These calculations help explain metallurgical effects (e. g. why boron can strengthen grain boundaries), irradiation embrittlement (e. g. how boron transmutation results in grain boundary embrittlement), as well as how grain boundary impurity elements can affect environmentally assisted cracking (i. e. low temperature crack propagation and stress corrosion cracking) of nickel-base alloys...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} {{systematically}} investigate {{the effects of}} microstructural parameters in influencing the resistance to fatigue crack growth (FCG) in the near-threshold region under three different temper levels has been made for a {{high strength low alloy}} steel to observe in general, widely different trends in the dependence of both the total threshold stress intensity range, DELTA-K(th) and the intrinsic or effective threshold stress intensity range, DELTA-K(eff-th) on the prior austenitic grain size (PAGS). While a low strain hardening microstructure obtained by tempering at high temperatures exhibited strong dependence of DELTA-K(th) on the PAGS by virtue of strong interactions of crack tip slip with the grain boundary, a high strength, high strain hardening microstructure as a result of tempering at low temperature exhibited a weak dependence. The lack of a systematic variation of the near-threshold parameters with respect to grain size in temper <b>embrittled</b> structures appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> the wide variations in the amount of intergranular fracture near threshold. Crack closure, to some extent provides a basis on which the increases in DELTA-K(th) at larger grain sizes can be rationalised. This study, in addition, provides a wide perspective on the relative roles of slip behaviour embrittlement and environment that result in the different trends observed in the grain size dependence of near-threshold fatigue parameters, based on which the inconsistency in the results reported in the literature can be clearly understood. Assessment of fracture modes through extensive fractography revealed that prior austenitic grain boundaries <b>are</b> effective barriers <b>to</b> cyclic crack growth compared to martensitic packet boundaries, especially at low stress intensities. Fracture morphologies comprising of low energy flat transgranular fracture can occur close to threshold depending on the combinations of strain hardening behaviour, yield strength and embrittlement effects.

40|$|FeAl alloys {ge} 24 at. %Al are H {{embrittled}} by both H 2 gas {{and water}} vapor. This examines effect of H embrittlement by H 2 gas and moisture-bearing air on tensile properties and fatigue crack growth resistance of two ordered FeAl intermetallic alloys (28, 36 at. % Al) and one disordered Fe-Al alloy (16 at. % Al). Susceptibility to embrittlement varies with both Al content and ordered state. Tensile ductility of disordered low Al alloy is {{not affected by}} moisture-bearing air, and fatigue crack growth resistance is affected only slightly by moisture. However, the higher Al alloys are severely embrittled by moisture-bearing air. Oxidation of Al with concurrent release of H 2 is responsible for embrittlement of Fe 3 Al alloys. It {{is likely that the}} smaller amount of Al available for the oxidation reaction in the 16 at. % alloy precludes such embrittling reactions. In contrast, H 2 <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>embrittling</b> <b>to</b> all alloys in both cyclic and monotonic tests. Fractography shows that H 2 preferentially attacks cleavage planes in these alloys. Inherent fatigue crack growth resistance in an inert environment of the low Al disordered alloy <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much lower than that for the high Al alloys. Fatigue crack growth rate in an embrittling environment can be expressed as superposed mechanical fatigue and corrosion-fatigue components. Fatigue crack growth tests in inert and <b>embrittling</b> environments <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> isolate corrosion fatigue of the crack growth rate in Fe- 28 at. %Al. The corrosion-fatigue component displays a frequency dependence: At lower frequencies, more time is available for penetration of H ahead of the crack tip. H transport in the Fe-Al alloys occurs primarily by dislocation-assisted transport, which allows for penetration depths of 10 - 100 x the distance that can be achieved by bulk diffusion. An equation is developed for the corrosion-fatigue component of crack growth rate which includes stress intensity range and frequency dependence...|$|R

Depending on the laser processing parameters used, the laser transformation notch (LTN) undergoes either solid state transformations or a mixture of melting and solid state transformations. The effect of LTN depth on the peak impact force, the crack initiation energy and Charpy fracture energy was investigated on a C 70 S 6 carbon steel using an instrumented Charpy impact facility. It <b>was</b> reduced <b>to</b> a value < 3. 5 J by a LTN of 0. 5 mm in depth. Fracture mechanics models indicate that such a LTN can behave {{in a similar way}} to a fatigue created crack used in fracture toughness testing ie the LTN behaves as a sharp crack. Obtaining a sharp crack effect from a LTN <b>is</b> attributable <b>to</b> a combination of: a) the presence of brittle martensite, b) intergranular cracking of favourably oriented columnar grains after melting with inclusions and defects at their boundaries, c) intergranular cracking of coarse grains produced by a high austenitising temperatures and d) minor or major cracks sometimes resulting in centre – line cracking which arises during solidification. LTN <b>was</b> thus shown <b>to</b> have the potential to lead to an effective means of obtaining consistent fracture splitting of connecting rods...|$|R
40|$|Treatment: 1) The {{accretion}} was embrittled by localized {{temperature reduction}} using bagged ice over a blotter barrier. 2) The accretion was mechanically reduced with a Teflon-coated scraper, followed by stainless steel scrapers and probes. 3) Stoddard solvent was applied with cotton swabs to further reduce the tenacious accretion. Solvent solubilized the accretion, however it also mobilized it {{further into the}} fabric and this step was aborted. 4) The object {{was placed in the}} freezer overnight and once removed the accretion was further reduced mechanically as in step 2. These steps were moderately successful but the textile and accretion rapidly returned to room temperature, limiting treatment progress. 5) Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) <b>was</b> employed <b>to</b> <b>embrittle</b> the accretion. The dry ice <b>was</b> applied directly <b>to</b> the surface of the apron, as well as with a barrier of blotter and silicone release Mylar. Although both methods worked, direct application was preferred. 6) The hardened accretion was reduced mechanically, as in step 2. 7) The resulting crumbs from the gum were vacuumed using a low-suction vacuum cleaner...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used compressed gases for pneumatic (pressurized gas) systems in portable pressure tools. Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding, although in the welding arc, it reacts to oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as argon or helium. When used for MIG welding, [...] use <b>is</b> sometimes referred <b>to</b> as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as CO2 can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends <b>to</b> <b>embrittle</b> the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.|$|R
