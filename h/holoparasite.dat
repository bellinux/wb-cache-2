50|$|Some {{parasitic}} {{plants are}} generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (Cassytha spp., Cuscuta spp.) and red rattle (Odontites vernus) are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few {{or even just}} one species. Beech drops (Epifagus virginiana) is a root <b>holoparasite</b> only on American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Rafflesia is a <b>holoparasite</b> on the vine Tetrastigma. Plants such as Pterospora become parasites of mycorrhizal fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of Tryphysaria experience reduced haustorium development {{in the presence of}} other Tryphysaria. Although, the mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|Orobanche aegyptiaca, Egyptian broomrape, is a plant {{which is}} an obligate <b>holo{{parasite}}</b> from the family Orobanchaceae with a complex life cycle. This parasite is most common in the Middle East and has a wide host range including many economically important crops.|$|E
50|$|Plants usually {{considered}} <b>holoparasites</b> include broomrape, dodder, Rafflesia, and the Hydnoraceae. Plants usually considered hemiparasites include Castilleja, mistletoe, Western Australian Christmas tree, {{and yellow}} rattle.|$|R
50|$|Orobanchaceae is {{the largest}} of the 20-28 dicot {{families}} that express parasitism. It consists of all types of plant parasitism: facultative parasite, obligate parasite, hemiparasites, and <b>holoparasites.</b>|$|R
50|$|The closest {{relative}} of Dactylanthus is Hachettea from New Caledonia. Along with Mystropetalon from South Africa, they comprise the  Southern Hemisphere group Mystropetalaceae. All three are <b>holoparasites,</b> lacking chlorophyll, and are descended from hemiparasitic root parasites which could photosynthesise.|$|R
50|$|An obligate {{parasite}} or <b>holoparasite,</b> is a parasitic organism that cannot complete its life-cycle without exploiting a suitable host. If an {{obligate parasite}} cannot obtain a host it {{will fail to}} reproduce. This is opposed to a facultative parasite, which {{can act as a}} parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have evolved a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} no stems, leaves or true roots. It is a <b>holoparasite</b> of vines in the genus Tetrastigma (Vitaceae), {{spreading}} its absorptive organ, the haustorium, inside the tissue of the vine. The {{only part of}} the plant that can be seen outside the host vine is the five-petalled flower. In some species, such as Rafflesia arnoldii, the flower may be over 100 cm in diameter, and weigh up to 10 kg. Even one of the smallest species, R. baletei, has 12 cm diameter flowers.|$|E
5000|$|L. clandestina grows {{preferentially}} in wet {{or fresh}} woodlands of valley bottoms, usually near streams where it parasitizes {{the roots of}} various plants: especially the deciduous trees Populus and Salix (poplars and willows). Purple toothwort also has been recorded as parasitising {{a wide range of}} other plants, including: Acer, Alnus, Buxus, Carpinus, Corylus, Juglans, Metasequoia, Quercus, Rhododendron, Taxus and even Gunnera. [...] It is a <b>holoparasite,</b> which has neither leaves nor chlorophyll and draws its food from the roots of its hosts via suckers.|$|E
25|$|Balanophoraceae is {{a family}} of <b>holoparasites</b> with 44 species in 17 genera. For a long time, Cynomorium was usually {{included}} in this family, but it is now known to be unrelated. In 2005, Balanophoraceae was shown {{to be in the}} order Santalales, but its position within that order has not been determined.|$|R
50|$|The achlorophyllous <b>holoparasites</b> Lennoa and Pholisma {{were once}} {{regarded}} as a family, Lennoaceae, but it is now known that they form a clade that is nested within Ehretiaceae. Some {{studies have indicated that}} Hydrophyllaceae is paraphyletic if the tribe Nameae is included within it, but further studies will be needed to resolve this issue.|$|R
25|$|Four of the unplaced genera, and {{all three}} of the unplaced {{families}} of APG II consist of achlorophyllous <b>holoparasites.</b> In these, the chloroplast genes that are usually used in phylogenetic studies of angiosperms have become nonfunctional pseudogenes. If these evolve rapidly, they may be saturated with repeated mutations at the same site and consequently not be useful for phylogenetic reconstruction.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant has}} no {{chlorophyll}} and {{is unable to}} photosynthesise. It is a geophyte, spending most of its life underground, {{in the form of}} a rhizome, which is attached to the roots of its host plant; it is a <b>holoparasite,</b> i.e. totally dependent on its host. The low-growing inflorescence emerges (in spring, following winter rain), on a fleshy, unbranched stem (most of which is underground) with scale-like, membranous leaves. Dark-red or purplish, the inflorescence consists of a dense, erect, club-shaped mass, some 15-30 cm long (6-12 in), of minute scarlet flowers, which may be male, female or hermaphrodite. It is pollinated by flies, attracted to the plant by its sweet, slightly cabbage-like odour. Once pollinated, the spike turns black. The fruit is a small, indehiscent nut.|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{clarifying}} the closest {{relatives of the}} world’s largest flowers, Rafflesiaceae, whose floral diameters range fromw 11 tow 100 cm, indicated that they evolved from tiny-flowered ancestors {{in a burst of}} floral gigantism. New data now suggest that floral size evolution within Rafflesiaceae may be more dynamic than expected, with both recent and rapid changes in flower size. Charles C. Davis Over 180 years ago, a remarkable plant species was discovered in the Sumatran rain forest.

50|$|Parasitic {{behavior}} {{evolved in}} angiosperms roughly 12-13 times independently, {{a classic example}} of convergent evolution. Roughly 1% of all angiosperm species are parasitic, with a large degree of host dependence. The taxonomic family Orobanchaceae (encompassing the genera Tryphysaria, Striga, and Orobanche) is the only family that contains both holoparasitic and hemiparasitic species, making it a model group for studying the evolutionary rise of parasitism. The remaining groups contain only hemiparasites or <b>holoparasites.</b>|$|R
40|$|Orobanchaceae is {{the largest}} family among the {{parasitic}} angiosperms. It comprises non-parasites, hemi- and <b>holoparasites,</b> making this family an ideal test case for studying the evolution of parasitism. Previous phylogenetic analyses showed that holoparasitism had arisen {{at least three times}} from the hemiparasitic taxa in Orobanchaceae. Until now, however, not all known genera of Orobanchaceae were investigated in detail. Among them, the unknown phylogenetic positions of the <b>holoparasites</b> Gleadovia and Phacellanthus are the key to testing how many times holoparasitism evolved. Here, we provide clear evidence {{for the first time that}} they are members of the tribe Orobancheae, using sequence data from multiple loci (nuclear genes ITS, PHYA, PHYB, and plastid genes rps 2, matK). Gleadovia is an independent lineage whereas Phacellanthus should be merged into genus Orobanche section Orobanche. Our results unambiguously support the hypothesis that there are only three origins of holoparasitism in Orobanchaceae. Divergence dating reveals for the first time that the three origins of holoparasitism were not synchronous. Our findings suggest that holoparasitism can persist in specific clades for a long time and holoparasitism may evolve independently as an adaptation to certain hosts...|$|R
40|$|Mixotrophic plants take - {{aside the}} sun’s energy - {{energetic}} advantage of organic sources {{which can be}} described as parasitism, probiosis, symbiosis or saprotrophism. <b>Holoparasites</b> like broomrape (Orobanche minor L.) or clover dodder (Cuscuta epithymum ssp. trifolii) are limited to their host plants. Orchids live on different probioses and symbioses. Also thistles (Cirsium arvense L) occur as mixotroph plants and develop to weeds. Their occurrence shows different nutritional patterns. Aspects of new scientific results are discussed. Hints to regulation of thistles on this basis are given...|$|R
40|$|The Parasitic Plant Genome Project has sequenced {{transcripts}} {{from three}} parasitic species and a nonparasitic relative in the Orobanchaceae {{with the goal}} of understanding genetic changes associated with parasitism. The species studied span the trophic spectrum from free-living nonparasite to obligate <b>holoparasite.</b> Parasitic species used were Triphysaria versicolor, a photosynthetically competent species that opportunistically parasitizes roots of neighboring plants; Striga hermonthica, a hemiparasite that has an obligate need for a host; and Orobanche aegyptiaca, a <b>holoparasite</b> with absolute nutritional dependence on a host. Lindenbergia philippensis represents the closest nonparasite sister group to the parasitic Orobanchaceae and was included for comparative purposes. Tissues for transcriptome sequencing from each plant were gathered to identify expressed genes for key life stages from seed conditioning through anthesis. Two of the species studied, S. hermonthica and O. aegyptiaca, are economically important weeds and the data generated by this project are expected to aid in research and control of these species and their relatives. The sequences generated through this project will provide an abundant resource of molecular markers for understanding population dynamics, as well as provide insight into the biology of parasitism and advance progress toward understanding parasite virulence and host resistance mechanisms. In addition, the sequences provide important information on target sites for herbicide action or other novel control strategies such as trans-specific gene silencing. © 2012 Weed Science Society of America.

40|$|Parasitic {{plants are}} a {{constraint}} on agriculture worldwide. Cuscuta reflexa is a stem <b>holoparasite,</b> which infests most dicotyledonous plants. One exception is tomato, which is resistant to C. reflexa. We discovered that tomato responds {{to a small}} peptide factor occurring in Cuscuta spp. with immune responses typically activated after perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). We identified the cell surface receptor-like protein CUSCUTA RECEPTOR 1 (CuRe 1) as essential for the perception of this parasite-associated molecular pattern. CuRe 1 is sufficient to confer responsiveness to the Cuscuta factor and increased resistance to parasitic C. reflexa when heterologously expressed in otherwise susceptible host plants. Our findings reveal that plants recognize parasitic plants {{in a manner similar}} to perception of microbial pathogens, with potential for engineering resistance to parasitic plants in crops...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{shows the}} results of histo-anatomical {{research}} studies made on five species of parasitic plants in Romania, species within the Orobanche genus: Orobanche arenaria Borkh., O. cernua Loefl., O. major Boissen., O minor Sutton and O. purpurea Jacq. The authors investigate the structure of vegetative and reproductive organs (haustoria, stem, leaf, flower) of five species, presenting thus a series of common or different traits of the five holoparasitic species. The analysis of the haustorium in holoparasitic plants has allowed {{the identification of the}} presence, within the haustorium parenchyma, of woody tissue; there can be observed direct contact between the woody vessels of the haustorium and the ones of the host plant on the sections. These aspects prove the fact that <b>holoparasites</b> extract {{a large part of the}} water with mineral nutrients of the host plant, this observation completing the literature data, that states the idea that <b>holoparasites</b> use only the organic solutions from the host plant. The distribution pattern of the vascular tissues, as well as the formation manner of the haustoria and their exogenous origin, prove once more that the haustoria does not represent a root or a metamorphosed stalk, but a specialized organ, perfectly adapted to its absorption function. The Orobanche leaves, reduced to scales, have an extremely simple structure; their mesophyll is reduced, and that is strongly correlated with the loss of their photosynthetic capacity. The mechanical tissue is well developed in the Orobanche species we have investigated...|$|R

50|$|Some orchids, such as Neottia and Corallorhiza, lack chlorophyll, so {{are unable}} to photosynthesise. Instead, these species obtain energy and {{nutrients}} by parasitising soil fungi through the formation of orchid mycorrhizas. The fungi involved include those that form ectomycorrhizas with trees and other woody plants, parasites such as Armillaria, and saprotrophs. These orchids are known as myco-heterotrophs, but were formerly (incorrectly) described as saprophytes as it was believed they gained their nutrition by breaking down organic matter. While only a few species are achlorophyllous <b>holoparasites,</b> all orchids are myco-heterotrophic during germination and seedling growth, and even photosynthetic adult plants may continue to obtain carbon from their mycorrhizal fungi.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} leaf {{dry matter}} δ 18 O and δ 13 C in parasitic plants and their hosts growing in southwestern Australia. Parasite/host pairs included two mistletoe species, three species of holoparasites, and five species of root hemiparasites. Among these parasite functional types, significant variation {{was observed in}} parasite/host isotopic differences for both δ 18 O (P< 0. 0001, n= 65) and δ 13 C (P< 0. 0001, n= 64). Mistletoes were depleted in both 18 O and 13 C compared to their hosts; parasite/host differences were − 4. 0 % for δ 18 O (P< 0. 0001) and − 1. 9 % for δ 13 C (P< 0. 0001). The lower δ 18 O in mistletoe leaf dry matter compared to their hosts {{is consistent with the}} frequently observed high transpiration rates of these parasites. Root hemiparasites were also depleted in 18 O and 13 C compared to their hosts, but not to the same extent as mistletoes; parasite/host differences were − 1. 0 % for δ 18 O (P= 0. 04) and − 1. 2 ‰ for δ 13 C (P= 0. 0006). In contrast to mistletoes and root hemiparasites, holoparasites were enriched in both 18 O and 13 C compared to their hosts; parasite/host differences were + 3. 0 % for δ 18 O (P< 0. 0001) and + 1. 5 % for δ 13 C (P= 0. 02). The enrichment in 18 O for <b>holoparasite</b> dry matter did not result from more enriched tissue water; <b>holoparasite</b> tissue water δ 18 O was less than host leaf water δ 18 O by a difference of − 3. 8 % when sampled at midday (P= 0. 0003). Enrichment of holoparasites in 13 C compared to their hosts is consistent with a generally observed pattern of enrichment in heterotrophic plant tissues. Results provide insights into the ecology of parasitic plants in southwestern Australia; additionally, they provide a context for the formulation of specific hypotheses aimed at elucidating mechanisms underlying isotopic variations among plants...|$|E
40|$|Floral scent {{is likely}} {{important}} to the pollination of parasitic plants, despite {{that it has not}} been well-studied. We studied the pollination ecology of the North American stem <b>holoparasite</b> Pilostyles thurberi (Apodanthaceae) at two field sites in Texas. To identify effective pollinators, we collected floral visitors to P. thurberi flowers, observed their foraging behavior, and looked for P. thurberi pollen on their bodies. Augochloropsis metallica bees (Halictidae) and eumenine potter wasps (Vespidae) were pollinators. P. thurberi flowers are visually inconspicuous but produce a strong fruity fragrance. GC/MS analysis of whole floral extracts and dynamic headspace samples revealed the fragrance to be an unusually simple bouquet of raspberry ketone and several eugenols. Comparison of scent profiles to those from uninfected host plants (Dalea formosa) allowed putative separation of parasite and host volatiles. This is the first report of the constituents of floral fragrance in Apodanthaceae...|$|E
40|$|Rafflesia is a <b>holoparasite</b> that {{is facing}} {{extinction}} in nature. The Center for Plant Conservation Bogor Botanic Gardens LIPI has been pioneering ex situ conservation using grafting methods. However, ex situ conservation using seed innoculation {{has been a}} challenge. Studies on the viability testing of Rafflesia seeds aims to provide viable seeds for supporting the ex situ conservation programs based on seed innoculation methods. In particular, the aims of our recent research were: (1) to investigate the morphological characters of the seeds; (2) to determine a method for viability testing the seeds. The seeds of R. arnoldii and R. patma were used in this research. Firstly, the morphological characters of the seeds were observed under a binocular microscope. The viability test using bioassay procedures was as follows: (1) reagent preparation; (2) pre-staining; (3) embryo exposure; (4) staining, and (5) assessment.

40|$|The plastid genomes of some nonphotosynthetic {{parasitic}} {{plants have}} experienced an extreme reduction in gene content {{and an increase}} in evolutionary rate of remaining genes. Nothing is known of the dynamics of these events or whether either is a direct outcome of the loss of photosynthesis. The parasitic Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae, representing a continuum of heterotrophic ability ranging from photosynthetic hemiparasites to nonphotosynthetic <b>holoparasites,</b> are used to investigate these issues. We present a phylogenetic hypothesis for parasitic Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae based on sequences of the plastid gene rps 2, encoding the S 2 subunit of the plastid ribosome. Parasitic Scrophulariaceae and Orobanchaceae form a monophyletic group in which parasitism can be inferred to have evolved once. Holoparasitism has evolved independently at least five times, with certain holoparasitic lineages representing single species, genera, and collections of nonphotosynthetic genera. Evolutionary loss of the photosynthetic gene rbcL is limited to a subset of holoparasitic lineages, with several <b>holoparasites</b> retaining a full length rbcL sequence. In contrast, the translational gene rps 2 is retained in all plants investigated but has experienced rate accelerations in several hemi- as well as holoparasitic lineages, suggesting that there may be substantial molecular evolutionary changes to the plastid genome of parasites before the loss of photosynthesis. Independent patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous rate acceleration in rps 2 point to distinct mechanisms underlying rate variation in different lineages. Parasitic Scrophulariaceae (including the traditional Orobanchaceae) provide a rich platform for the investigation of molecular evolutionary process, gene function, and the evolution of parasitism...|$|R
50|$|Parasitism also evolved within aquatic {{species of}} plants and algae. Parasitic marine plants are {{described}} as benthic, meaning that they are sedentary or attached to another structure. Plants and algae that grow on the host plant, using it as an attachment point are given the designation epiphytic (epilithic is the name given to plants/algae that use rocks or boulders for attachment), while not necessarily parasitic, some species occur in high correlation with a certain host species, suggesting that they rely on the host plant {{in some way or}} another. In contrast, endophytic plants and algae grow inside their host plant, these have a wide range of host dependence from obligate <b>holoparasites</b> to facultative hemiparasites.|$|R
