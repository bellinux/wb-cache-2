Overview Compared with liquid fuel, gas fuel has many different characteristics in terms of components, calorific value and combustion, which leads to its special burning law in engine cylinder and causes a lot of to-be-solved problems to the supercharging of engine. As a result, before supercharging <b>gas</b> <b>engine,</b> {{it is necessary to}} know the burning law of gas fuel in cylinder and take proper measures to guarantee the possibilities of supercharging so as to increase the dynamic property and economy of the engine and decrease its thermal load.

25|$|Currently {{there are}} several {{companies}} manufacturing aftermarket internal combustion engine (ICE) motor conversion kits for conventional bicycles.

Staton-Inc., a motorized bicycle manufacturer of long standing, also uses a rack-mount with either a tire roller-mount (friction drive) or a chain-driven, geared transmission. Other manufacturers produce kits using small two- or four-stroke <b>gas</b> <b>engines</b> mounted in the central portion of the bicycle frame, and incorporating various types of belt- or chain-driven transmissions and final drives.

25|$|In principle, {{gasification}} {{can proceed}} from {{just about any}} organic material, including biomass and plastic waste. The resulting syngas can be combusted. Alternatively, if the syngas is clean enough, it {{may be used for}} power production in <b>gas</b> <b>engines,</b> gas turbines or even fuel cells, or converted efficiently to dimethyl ether (DME) by methanol dehydration, methane via the Sabatier reaction, or diesel-like synthetic fuel via the Fischer–Tropsch process. In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of gasification is that using the syngas (synthesis gas H2/CO) is potentially {{more efficient than}} direct combustion of the original fuel {{because it can be}} combusted at higher temperatures or even in fuel cells, so that the thermodynamic upper limit to the efficiency defined by Carnot's rule is higher or (in case of fuel cells) not applicable. Syngas may be burned directly in <b>gas</b> <b>engines,</b> used to produce methanol and hydrogen, or converted via the Fischer–Tropsch process into synthetic fuel. Gasification can also begin with material which would otherwise have been disposed of such as biodegradable waste. In addition, the high-temperature process refines out corrosive ash elements such as chloride and potassium, allowing clean gas production from otherwise problematic fuels. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity.|$|E

25|$|The {{ignition}} system {{used in the}} Model T was an unusual trembler coil system to drive the spark plugs, as used for stationary <b>gas</b> <b>engines,</b> rather than the expensive magnetos that were used on other cars. This ignition also made the Model T more flexible as to the quality or type of fuel it used. The need for a starting battery and also Ford's use of an unusual AC alternator located inside the flywheel housing encouraged the adoption of electric lighting (standard fitment as of 1915), rather than oil or acetylene lamps, but it also delayed the adoption of electric starting, which was not offered until 1919. The Model T engine was produced for replacement needs, as well as stationary and marine applications until 1941, well after production of the Model T had ended. It was also utilized in the drivetrain of the Fordson tractor, which was produced in the US until 1928, and in Ireland until 1964.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in mining methods (e.g. {{longwall}} mining), hazardous gas monitoring (such as safety-lamps or {{more modern}} electronic gas monitors), gas drainage, electrical equipment, and ventilation have reduced {{many of the}} risks of rock falls, explosions, and unhealthy air quality. Gases released during the mining process can be recovered to generate electricity and improve worker safety with <b>gas</b> <b>engines.</b> Another innovation {{in recent years is}} the use of closed circuit escape respirators, respirators that contain oxygen for situations where mine ventilation is compromised. Statistical analyses performed by the US Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds. However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, even in 2006, mining remained the second most dangerous occupation in America, when measured by fatality rate. However, these numbers include all mining, with oil and gas mining contributing the majority of fatalities; coal mining resulted in only 47 fatalities that year.|$|E
