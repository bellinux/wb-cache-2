5000|$|The {{physical}} {{risks for}} <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> genetic testing done are very minimal. The most common requirement is a blood sample.

In many cases, people who find out they are carries can become angered or even enraged that they carry a genetic defect that could be passed on to their child. These results can play a role in determining if a couple will have a child together. If both parents are carriers for the same genetic disorder, there is a twenty-five percent chance that any child they have could be affected. When a person finds out they are a carrier, they are always encouraged to talk to a genetic counselor. If both partners are carriers for the same genetic disease, the choice to have a child together can become much more difficult.|$|R

40|$|We {{begin the}} paper by laying out a simple {{methodology}} {{that allows us}} to determine whether firms are credit constrained, based on how they react to changes in directed lend-ing programs. The basic idea is that while both constrained and unconstrained firms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained firms will use it to expand production, while un-constrained firms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We the apply this methodology to firms in India that became eligible for directed credit {{as a result of a}} policy change in 1998. Using firms that were already <b>getting</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> credit before 1998 to control for time trends, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit.
