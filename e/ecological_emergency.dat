Through a close reading of what Chantal Mouffe (2013) describes as a multiplicity of social spaces, where the students engage in practices that reveal new and novel ways of creating social relationships and sites of learning, we will interrogate how cross disciplinary practise across art and design delivers participatory experiences designed to scale from local to national to international contexts, examining performative pedagogy not as mimicry but performance as activation.

40|$|Cinematic Affect in a Time of <b>Ecological</b> <b>Emergency</b> is {{situated}} within a moving image practice that applies methods aligned with essayist cinema and video installation, {{as well as}} historical avant-garde film. The project was initiated in response to subjective experiences of ecological devastation, which induced a personal state of melancholy. It works from the position that another tactic for progressing discourses around anthropogenic climate and geological change might be poetic or affective modes that are often present in the aforementioned moving image practices. The research aims to eschew ‘fact’ based representational modes, for contemplative, expressive and ambiguous registers of visual and aural inquiry. The iterative studio practice is composed {{of a range of}} moving image experiments and approaches, including extensive field investigations in locations linked tenuously or specifically to fossil fuel production and consumption. Through research into a variety of cinematic devices, conclusions were reached, which led to the application of creative constraints in the composition of the works. These techniques include, high-speed cinematography, ultra-long or ultra-wide lenses, formal composition and camera movement. The project has been guided by the belief that the sensate realm holds greater political potential for filmmakers than tactics that use didactic means to tell a ‘story’ about the crisis. Thus, the project has explored in some detail the concepts of affect and sensation, through the philosophies of Gilles Deleuze. In addition, it locates theoretical provocations that have contributed to my thinking and making, with the objective to reveal the political potential of grief (Judith Butler) and the ‘politics implicit in aesthetics’ (Jacques Rancière). Rancière’s notion of the invisible becoming visible at a moment of rupture and Butler’s argument configured by Levinasian ethics and her post- 9 / 11 experiences of living in the United States have been important influences. Writers and thinkers whose discourses are focussed {{on the subject of the}} ecological crisis situate the subject historically with the help of Felix Guattari’s transversal ‘ecosophy,’ while Timothy Morton’s ‘Ecological Thought’ and Jane Bennett’s ‘vital materialist’ positions are enlisted as methods for reflecting on the ‘uncanny’ experience of living in a time of <b>ecological</b> <b>emergency.</b> From the position of thinking through the poetic and political potential of art, Cinematic Affect in a Time of <b>Ecological</b> <b>Emergency</b> has turned to Robert Smithson, Agnes Denes and Buster Simpson. Chantal Akerman, Chris Marker and Werner Herzog provided insights into essayist modes of cinema through their distinct methods of practice. Chris Welsby’s and Richard Mosse’s films and installations are reviewed in relation to their capacity to extract the invisible and make it seeable through the material. The creative outcomes produced during this research are two video works. The first, Crude, is an essayist film that attempts to see and hear some of the elusive signs of anthropogenic climate change in order to make what is invisible, visible, to evoke contemplations on the subject of ecological crisis, through affective cinematic devices. Crude is accompanied by Flight, a series of filmed passenger jet stream or contrails — forming a database of a particular type of human presence and movement. The work seeks to evoke a space of contemplation, uneasiness, and sadness by engaging with the residual and stratified signs of our collective impact on our environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecological}} emergency’ describes {{both our}} emergence into, {{and the way}} we relate within, a set of globally urgent circumstances, brought about through anthropogenic impact. I identify two phases to this emergency. Firstly, there is the anthropogenic impact itself, interpreted through various conceptual models. Secondly, however, is the increasingly entrenched commitment to divergent conceptual positions, that leads to a growing disparateness in attitudes, and a concurrent difficulty with finding any grounds for convergence in response. I begin by reviewing the environmental ethics literature in order to clarify which components of the implicit narratives and beliefs of different positions create the foundations for such disparateness of views. I identify the conceptual frameworks through which moral agency and human responsibility are viewed, and that justify an ethical response to the <b>ecological</b> <b>emergency.</b> In particular, I focus on Paul Taylor's thesis of 'respect for nature' as a framework for revising both the idea that we are ‘moral’ and the idea that we are ‘agents’ in this unique way, and I open to question the idea that any response to the <b>ecological</b> <b>emergency</b> need be couched in ethical terms. This revision leads me to formulate an alternative conceptual model that makes use of Timothy Morton’s idea of enmeshment. I propose that we dramatically revise our idea of moral agency using the idea of enmeshment as a starting point. I develop an alternative framework that locates our capacity for responsibility within our capacity for realisation, both in the sense of understanding, and of making real, sets of conditions within our enmeshment. I draw parallels between this idea of ‘realisation as agency’ and the work of Dōgen and other non-dualists. I then propose a revised understanding of ‘the good’ of systems from a biophysical perspective, and compare this with certain features of Asian traditions of thought. I consider the practical implications of these revisions, and I conclude that the act of paying close attention, or realising, contains our agency, as does the attitude, or manner, with which we focus. This gives us the basis for a convergent response to the ecological emergency: the way of our engagement that is the key to responding to the ecological emergenc...|$|E

40|$|The article {{begins with}} the {{redefinition}} of complexity and risk. Indeed, phenomena such as earthquakes, pandemics, <b>ecological</b> <b>emergencies,</b> and {{issues related to the}} development of echnology highlight the unique and reciprocal relationship between complexity and risk. However, modernity endeavoured to simplify complexity and to erase the connection of the latter with any issue concerning risk. Despite its negative results, whose ineffectiveness and dangerousness have at the present become unmistakably clear, the attitude in favour of simplification succeeded in becoming the forma mentis of modern science, politics, culture, ethics, etc. Yet, in the last decades a new trend seems to have arisen, namely the one focusing on the “governance” of complexity and of the related risks. If considered under a socio-political point of view, its aim is to succeed in efficiency, whilst maintaining democracy. This can be achieved through the advancement of dialogue, the appreciation of diversities, and the enhancement of pluralism. Hence, the pars construens of the article focuses on the notion of responsibility, and tries to highlight its fruitfulness for the socio-political “governance” of complexity...|$|R

It's necessary a change of paradigm: from an approach based on the competition and on the logic of continuous growth to a systemic vision, based on the collaboration, the awareness and the rediscovery of qualitative values.

40|$|Abstract. The Louisiana Coastal Area {{presents}} {{an array of}} rich and urgent scientific problems that require new computational approaches. These problems are interconnected with common components: hurricane activity is aggravated by ongoing wetland erosion; water circulation models are used in hurricane forecasts, <b>ecological</b> planning and <b>emergency</b> response; environmental sensors provide information for models of different processes with varying spatial and time scales. This has prompted programs to build an integrated, comprehensive, computational framework for meteorological, coastal, and ecological models. Dynamic and adaptive capabilities are crucially important for such a framework, providing the ability to integrate coupled models with real-time sensor information, or to enable deadline based scenarios and emergency decision control systems. This paper describes the ongoing development of a Dynamic Data Driven Application System for coastal and environmental applications (DynaCode), highlighting the challenges of providing accurate and timely forecasts for hurricane events.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Understanding {{the various}} methods of triage in {{different}} situations and locations {{is one of}} the most important needs of the training staff, especially nurses. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and practice of nurses working in the emergency department. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional, descriptive-analytic study was carried out with the participation of 73 nurses working in the emergency department of Ahwaz University of Medical Sciences affiliated hospitals who were enrolled in the study in 2017. The data gathering tool includes a questionnaire for the Features of the individual characteristics and the knowledge and practice of emergency personnel from triage systems in Iran [α = 0. 3]. Data were analyzed using descriptive-inferential statistics in SPSS version 20. Findings: Results showed that 87. 7 % [64 people] had poor knowledge, 12. 3 % [9 people] had moderate knowledge about different methods of triage, and 93. 2 % [68 people] had moderate performance and 6. 8 % [5 people] had poor performance to use different methods of triage. The mean total score of nurses 'knowledge was 20. 55 ± 8 and the mean score of nurses' performance was moderate [44. 64 ± 8. 82]. Statistical analysis showed a significant statistical relationship.

40|$|The idea of {{an ideological}} {{potentiality}} for architectural re cycling is obviously anything but unprecedented. All along the 20 th Century art first and then architecture became critically conscious of an attitude of re-using, re-creating, re-manipulating physical and conceptual materials that had been there forever, from the Roman stones to Diocleziano’s Palace in Split, from Duchamp’s Mona Lisa with Moustache to Andy Warhol, from the Superstudio’s proposal to build {{on top of the}} Colosseum to the more recent Palais de Tokyo. What happened in the last years is that this infinite legacy came to react with <b>ecological</b> and social <b>emergencies,</b> creating the conditions for a very interesting phase for architectural research, design, criticism, eventually pushing us to reshape our academic curriculums and programs. All this made in fact clear to all how architecture between {{the end of the second}} millennium and the start of the third has had to learn how to deal with full and void, the existing and the new, urban and anti-urban, and always with the same know-how and the same project intensity, keeping clearly in mind the fact that it is no longer possible to consider these dyads in terms of a pure dialectic opposition. More specifically, the growing mass of buildings of every type, nature and value that end their life cycle on our territories has made clear the inadequacy of the traditional cultures of restoration and reuse before the myriad houses, schools, public buildings, factories, warehouses that in most cases didn't deserve a conservative approach, and that for another thousand reasons weren't and aren't worth demolishing. Hence, what we urgently need is a recycling culture—to Re-cycle—that is as bold and unfaithful as mainstream restoration is attentive and (not always sincerely) faithful to the original, and just as fast, uncanny and indeterminate as the usual approach to "reuse" is pedantic, punctilious and Architecture is a negotiable art, which produces its language via the mediation of three different types of claims: those of a technical nature, those related to its own history and the rules inherent to the discipline, and those of society and its times. When the architect's productive, creative or political obsession decides to identify architecture entirely or prevalently with one of these three claims, it exposes it to the risk of self-referentiality, it undermines its social utility, it dangerously dries up its sources of energy. To us, Re-cycle is a perfect device to credit the relation with society an appropriate role in the design process, i. e. it is a possible and accessible solution to many of the problems of contemporary architecture, obsessed by self-referentiality and technolog...|$|R
