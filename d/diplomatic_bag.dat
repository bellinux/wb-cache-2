Seale {{writes that the}} bomb had been manufactured by Abu Nidal's technical committee, who had delivered it to Syrian air force intelligence. It was sent to London in a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag</b> and given to Hindawi. According to Seale, it was widely believed that the attack {{was in response to}} Israel having forced down a jet, two months earlier, carrying Syrian officials to Damascus, which Israel had supposed was carrying senior Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April the men {{informed}} their landlord {{that they}} were going to Bristol for a week and then returning to Iraq, stated that they would no longer require the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 (BST) on 30 April. Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and submachine guns), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag</b> belonging to Iraq. Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in Lexham Gardens in South Kensington, the six men arrived outside the embassy.|$|E
5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag.</b> On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing eyelash noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{perfectly}} secure {{channels in}} the real world. There are, at best, only ways to make insecure channels (e.g., couriers, homing pigeons, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags,</b> etc.) less insecure: padlocks (between courier wrists and a briefcase), loyalty tests, security investigations, and guns for courier personnel, diplomatic immunity for <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags,</b> and so forth.|$|R

25|$|A seaman {{aboard the}} ships of the United States Lines since {{his arrival in}} the United States, Erich Strunck went to the United States from Germany in 1927.

Sebold convinced him that it would be too risky to do so.|$|E
500|$|Guy Liddell, {{who worked}} for MI5, {{recorded}} {{that there was a}} breach in security at the embassy on [...] 1943, which was later reported by ISOS, Intelligent Service Oliver Strachey. The leak involved an embassy diplomat bag and two agents. On , Liddell talked to Stewart Menzies, head of British Secret Intelligence Service. Through the discussion, Liddell learned that the leak of the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag</b> occurred during or after the air attaché brought it back from Cairo, which put not-yet-deployed re-ciphering tables at risk and required the abandonment of the tables. There were also missing blueprints for a gun at the office of a military attaché. Menzies stated that there was an investigation underway at the embassy, but nothing more was said about the leak for a few months.|$|E

50|$|Key {{elements}} of diplomatic law are the immunity of diplomatic staff, the inviolability of the diplomatic mission and its grounds, {{and the security}} of diplomatic correspondence and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags.</b> Famous cases involving the breaking of diplomatic laws includes the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, the shooting of a British police woman from the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984, and {{the discovery of a}} former Nigerian Minister in a diplomatic crate at Stansted airport in 1984.|$|R
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the second World War, Blunt could not get a job with Field Security of army intelligence due to his Communist background, so he appealed to Liddell, who got Blunt a job in MI5. For MI5 (although he passed the same information to the Soviets), he headed an operation that surreptitiously examined the contents of <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>bags</b> from neutral countries' embassies in London. In carrying out this operation, Blunt mostly employed ravens and swallows to seduce the bag couriers.|$|R
50|$|In {{contemporary}} practice, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags</b> {{are indeed}} used for exactly this purpose. An illustration is the strenuous protest made by German diplomats in Poland {{in the late}} 1920s when a cypher machine being shipped to the German Embassy in Warsawa commercial version of the famous Enigma machinewas mistakenly not marked as protected baggage and was opened, under protest, by Polish Customs. It was released to them, supposedly without many apologies (and with still more protest), but had perhaps been subjected to inspection by Polish cryptography personnel.|$|R
50|$|The {{safe passage}} of {{diplomatic}} baggage is {{guaranteed by the}} Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and for reasons of state secrecy, the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag</b> does not go through normal airport baggage-checks and must not be opened, x-rayed, weighed, or otherwise investigated by customs, airline security staff, or anyone else for that matter. The bag is closed with a tamper-proof seal and has its own diplomatic passport. The Queen's Messenger and the messenger's personal luggage {{are not covered by}} special rules, however, so although the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag,</b> covered by the passport, is not checked, the messenger and the messenger's personal luggage go through normal security screening.|$|E

25|$|From Gibraltar Avoceta {{made her}} usual round trip to Lisbon and back (2–15 September). In Lisbon she {{embarked}} dozens of refugees from German-occupied Europe: UK subjects who had escaped {{the fall of}} France and had been denied leave to remain by the authorities in neutral Spain and Portugal. Most were women and children, some of them of French or Spanish origin, several following their husbands to the UK. Once back in Gibraltar Avoceta also embarked survivors rescued {{from the loss of}} Aguila. Her cargo included cork, 573 sacks of mail and some <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags.</b>|$|R
50|$|The key {{exchange}} {{problem is}} how to exchange whatever keys or other information are needed {{so that no one}} else can obtain a copy. Historically, this required trusted couriers, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags,</b> or some other secure channel. With the advent of public key / private key cipher algorithms (i.e., asymmetric ciphers), the encrypting key (aka, the public key of a pair) could be made public, since (at least for high quality algorithms) no one without the decrypting key (aka, the private key of that pair) could decrypt the message.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1984 Dikko Affair, {{a former}} Nigerian {{government}} minister, Umaru Dikko, was kidnapped {{and placed in}} a shipping crate in an attempt to transport him from the United Kingdom back to Nigeria for trial.

50|$|Afterwards, {{while he}} was working for the army in Romania, {{documents}} show that Hudson recruited Stephen Zollner, a Hungarian Jew buying timber for the British government around eastern Europe, to retrieve the treasure.

50|$|Dikko and Shapiro {{were placed}} in one crate (dimensions 1.2 x 1.2 x 1.5 meters), while Mossad agents Alexander Barak and Felix Abithol {{occupied}} a second. However, proper documentation that would have ensured that the cargo could not be inspected was not provided. The crates were also not labeled as <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags,</b> as required by Article 27(4) of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. As a result, customs officials who had received an all-points bulletin alerting them to the kidnapping while the crates were being processed at the airport were able to open the crates without violating the convention and foil the kidnapping. Dikko {{was taken to a}} hospital; he was uninjured.|$|R
50|$|The Shanghai Post Office {{controlled}} all post {{within the}} Settlement, but post coming in or {{going out of}} the treaty port was required {{to go through the}} Chinese Imperial Post Office. In 1922 the various foreign postal services, the Shanghai Post Office and the Chinese Post Office were all brought together into a single Chinese Post Office, thus extending the 1914 membership of the Chinese Post Office to the Universal Postal Union to Shanghai Post Office. Some other foreign countries refused to fall under this new postal service's remit, however: for many years, Japan was notable as sending almost all its mail to Shanghai in <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bags,</b> which could not be opened by postal staff.|$|R
5000|$|To {{ensure that}} the flights did not violate Sweden's neutrality, the {{aircraft}} carried civilian markings and were operated by crews who were nominally [...] "civilian employees" [...] of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). They carried small, high value cargoes such as precision ball bearings and machine-tool steel, as well as <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Bags.</b> Important passengers were also carried in an improvised [...] "cabin" [...] in the bomb bay. One such notable passenger was the physicist Niels Bohr, who was evacuated from Stockholm in 1943 in order to join the British Mission on the Manhattan Project. The flight almost ended in tragedy since Bohr did not don his oxygen equipment as instructed, and passed out. He would have died had not the pilot, surmising from Bohr's lack of response to intercom communication {{that he had lost}} consciousness, descended to a lower altitude {{for the remainder of the}} flight. Bohr's comment was that he had slept like a baby for the entire flight.|$|R
50|$|The Dikko {{affair was}} a joint Nigerian-Israeli attempt to kidnap Umaru Dikko, a former Nigerian {{civilian}} government minister {{living in the}} United Kingdom, in 1984, and secretly transport him back to Nigeria in a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag.</b> The kidnapping took place, but the transportation was unsuccessful. After it was foiled, the political fallout seriously damaged relations between Nigeria and the United Kingdom for years.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>{{diplomatic}}</b> <b>bag,</b> {{also known}} as a diplomatic pouch, is a container with certain legal protections used for carrying official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government or other diplomatic, consular, or otherwise official entities. [...] The physical concept of a [...] "diplomatic bag" [...] is flexible and therefore can take many forms (e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, crate or even a shipping container). Additionally, a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag</b> usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter interference by unauthorized third parties. The most important point is that {{as long as it is}} externally marked to show its status, the [...] "bag" [...] has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It may only contain articles intended for official use. [...] It is often escorted by a diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentine {{government}} used a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>bag</b> {{to smuggle}} several limpet mines to their embassy in Spain, {{to be used}} in the covert Operation Algeciras, in which Argentine agents were to blow up a British warship in the Royal Navy Dockyard at Gibraltar. The plot was uncovered and stopped by the Spanish police before the explosives could be set.|$|E
40|$|One {{route for}} the {{smuggling}} of wildlife parts, such as rhino horn and elephant ivory, could be closed {{without the need}} for new international conventions or treaties (B. I. Kaaria and N. L. Muchiri Proc. 9 th Int. Conf. Environ. Compliance Enforc. 204 – 208; 2011). Rogue diplomats must be stopped from exploiting their consular immunity to flout customs regulations and support this illicit trade. The scale of the problem is unquantifiable, but anecdotal evidence indicates that it is widespread. <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>bags</b> containing horn were reported to be evading customs checks as long ago as the 1980 s (E. B. Martin Pachyderm 21, 28 – 34; 1996). In 2011, a South Korean diplomat was caught smuggling ivory (see go. nature. com/fuo 43 s). Countries could adopt the UK practice of giving full immunity only to diplomats who are accredited to that country; others who pass through British territory are subject to regular checks. Because there are few direct flights between African and Asian capitals, diplomats would run the risk of also being checked at European airports when changing flights. Apprehending diplomats carrying illegal materials would generate negative publicity, forcing countries to punish errant civil servants and reduce the problem. Immunity should not mean impunit...|$|R
50|$|During the {{negotiations}} in 1666 with Münster in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, William found himself {{opposed by the}} Elector of Brandenburg. In 1670, while attempting to get Brandenburg to join the French alliance in the Franco-Dutch War, William also asked the elector about his opinion of a successor for Leopold I, who was sick at the time. William suggested again Louis XIV as the next Emperor, but Brandenburg preferred the Duke of Neuburg. When William went to leave, he was delayed by the disappearance {{of some of his}} baggage, which included his money and <b>diplomatic</b> papers. The <b>bags</b> turned up the next day without the money, so William considered it simple theft. He did not notice that his papers had been searched, and that the document detailing his discussions and plans for the Emperor's replacement was missing. This document would show up again as evidence of his treason against the Emperor at his trial. In 1671, the Elector of Brandenburg spoke many times to Leopold against the influence that William was wielding on behalf of France, and the Emperor became more strongly opposed to William's work.|$|R
40|$|Diplomatic {{immunity}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} elements of foreign relations, dating back as far as Ancient Greece and Rome. Today, it is a principle that has been codified into the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations regulating past customs and practices. Consuls and international organizations, although their privileges and immunities are similar to diplomatic personnel, do differ and are regulated by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the United Nations International Immunities respectively. These Conventions have been influenced by past practices and by three theories during different era’s namely exterritoriality, personal representation and functional necessity. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations further provides certain immunities and privileges to different levels of diplomatic officials, their staff and families. Privileges and immunities will be considered under various main categories, namely the diplomatic mission, the diplomatic official, diplomatic staff, and families. Each category receives privileges and immunities, for example immunities enjoyed by the diplomatic mission include mission correspondence and <b>bags.</b> <b>Diplomatic</b> officials enjoy personal inviolability, immunity from jurisdiction and inviolability of diplomats’ residences and property. The staff and families of diplomatic officials too enjoy privileges and immunities. The problem of so many people receiving privileges and immunities is that there is a high likelihood of abuse. Abuses that arise are various crimes committed by diplomats, their staff and families. They are immune from local punishment and appear to be above the local law. Although the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provides remedies against diplomats, staff and families who abuse their position, it gives the impression that it is not enough. Various Acts in the United Kingdom, United States and the Republic of South Africa will be analysed in order to ascertain what governments have done to try and curb diplomatic abuses. Each will be considered and found that although they have restricted immunity from previous practices it still places the diplomats’ needs above its own citizens. Thus several suggestions have been put forward and argued whether they are successful in restricting immunity comprehensively. Such suggestions are amending the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations; using the functional necessity theory to further limit immunity; forming bilateral treaties between States as a possible means to restrict or limit; and lastly establishing a Permanent International Diplomatic Criminal Court. The key question to be answered is whether diplomatic immunity is needed for the efficient functioning of foreign relations between States...|$|R
