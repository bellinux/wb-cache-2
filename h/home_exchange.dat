We present the time-varying characteristics of both firm and country-level convergence speed parameters. Furthermore, we empirically verify and visually corroborate the comparative dynamics of convergence with respect to short sales restrictions, trading time differences, and market-tier measures proxied by the Morgan Stanley Capital International indices. We conclude that enhancement in market efficiency accelerates the reversion to the parity of ADR-pairs. ...|$|R
