25|$|Fish Hawk {{also was}} {{outfitted}} to conduct general scientific {{research related to}} fisheries, including depth sounding, measuring {{the temperature of the}} sea bottom, and collecting marine animals and plants. She had a hoisting winch with 1,000 fathoms (6,000 feet; 1,829 meters) of steel cable for trawling and dredging, an otter trawl, a 9-foot (2.75-meter) beam trawl, an 11-foot (3.6-meter) beam trawl, a 17-foot (5.2-meter) beam trawl, Blake and Chester rake dredges, and a tangle bar, the latter an iron axle and wheels with <b>deck</b> <b>swabs</b> or bundles of rope yarn on chains that Fish Hawk could drag along the sea bottom to capture marine animals and plants. For hydrography, she had a sounding machine with 600 fathoms (3,600 feet; 1,097 meters) of piano wire, deep-sea reversing thermometers, and density salinometers.|$|R
60|$|Several Moorish seamen {{were going}} about with bared legs and arms, swishing {{water on the}} <b>decks</b> and <b>swabbing</b> up the blood, {{with which they were}} bespattered. Most of these men were more or less wounded and bandaged, for the crew of the {{merchantman}} they had attacked had offered a desperate resistance, knowing well the fate in store for them if captured.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The petter {{for you if}} you vas, you seven-foot stock-fish,' cried {{my enemy}} the cooper, whose aspect was not {{improved}} by a great strip of plaster over his eye. 'You might have learned something petter than to pull on a rope, or to <b>swab</b> <b>decks</b> like a vrouw all your life.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{deepwater}} sailor of to-day needs know none {{of these}} things. And he doesn't. He pulls and hauls as he is ordered, <b>swabs</b> <b>decks,</b> washes paint, and chips iron-rust. He knows nothing, and cares less. Put him in a small boat and he is helpless. He will cut an even better figure on the hurricane deck of a horse.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} not {{designed}} well for passenger carrying, sanitary provisions were totally inadequate, and the doctors were soon overwhelmed, and themselves caught typhus. The <b>decks</b> were never <b>swabbed</b> properly {{and there was no}} cleaning undertaken below decks; contemporary accounts mention the dreadful smell and the lack of sanitation. Bodies were bundled into mattresses in tens and thrown overboard during the voyage.|$|R
6000|$|... "The bos’en {{seemed to}} take a hand in {{everything}}. We used to do everything by his whistle, it was never {{out of his mouth}} scarcely, and I’ve known that man to dream of it o’ nights, and sit up in his sleep an’ try an’ blow his thumb. He whistled us to <b>swab</b> <b>decks,</b> whistled us to grub, whistled us to every blessed thing.|$|R
60|$|Captain Blood {{paced the}} poop of his ship {{alone in the}} tepid dusk, and the growing golden {{radiance}} of the great poop lantern in which a seaman had just lighted the three lamps. About him all was peace. The signs of the day's battle had been effaced, the <b>decks</b> had been <b>swabbed,</b> and order was restored above and below. A group of men squatting about the main hatch were drowsily chanting, their hardened natures softened, perhaps, by the calm and beauty of the night. They were {{the men of the}} larboard watch, waiting for eight bells which was imminent.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Knocked to pieces? You'd say so if so be {{you could}} see her! Gad, her sides be {{battered}} like an old penny piece; the shot be still sticking in her wales, and her sails be like so many clap-nets: we have run {{all the way home}} under jury topmasts; and as for her <b>decks,</b> you may <b>swab</b> wi' hot water, and you may swab wi' cold, but there's the blood-stains, and there they'll bide. [...] . The Cap'n had a narrow escape, like many o' the rest--a shot shaved his ankle like a razor. You should have seen that man's face in the het o' battle, his features were as if they'd been cast in steel.' ...|$|R
