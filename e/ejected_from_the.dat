5|$|By this time, the {{collision}} of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies should be underway. Although this {{could result in the}} Solar System being <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> newly combined galaxy, it is considered unlikely to have any adverse effect on the Sun or planets.|$|E
5|$|In November 1988, B-1B (s/n 85-0063) {{from the}} 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near Tye, Texas after a {{fire broke out}} above the left engines. All four crew members {{successfully}} <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In Armstrong’s {{biography}} First Man, astronaut Bill Anders {{is quoted}} as describing the LLTV as “a much unsung hero of the Apollo Program”. Although Armstrong had to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LLRV, no astronaut ever had to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> LLTV, and every Lunar Module pilot through the final Apollo 17 mission trained in the LLTV and flew to a landing on the Moon successfully.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's {{existence}} the orbits of comets are unstable and eventually dynamics dictate that a comet must either collide with the Sun or a planet or else be <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Solar System by planetary perturbations.|$|E
5|$|The {{main and}} halo rings consist of dust <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> moons Metis, Adrastea, and other unobserved parent bodies {{as the result}} of {{high-velocity}} impacts. High-resolution images obtained in February and March 2007 by the New Horizons spacecraft revealed a rich fine structure in the main ring.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, a frock was a loose, long garment with wide, full sleeves, such as {{the habit}} of a monk or priest, {{commonly}} belted. (This is {{the origin of the}} modern term defrock or unfrock, meaning [...] "to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> priesthood".) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{material}} <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> volcano mainly {{consisted of}} water vapor, along with smaller amounts {{of carbon dioxide}} and sulfur dioxide. Further study by airborne monitors suggests that the materials were not oxidized much, and little of the concentration contained sulfates, less than 20%.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> surfaces of Jupiter's four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} game of the tournament, Canada and the Soviet Union became engaged in a violent bench-clearing brawl while Canada was leading 4–2. Consequently, the game was {{declared}} null and void, and both teams were <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tournament; while the Soviets were out of medal contention, Canada was playing for the gold medal and were guaranteed at least a bronze.|$|E
50|$|NanoSail-D2: NanoSail was {{designed}} to demonstrate deployment of a compact solar sail boom system. Although NanoSail originally failed to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> FASTSAT as planned, two weeks after launch, on January 17, 2011, it ejected, and successfully deployed its sail three days later.|$|R

5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, {{but they can also}} use distraction with an ink cloud <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ink sac. The ink is thought to reduce the efficiency of olfactory organs, which would aid evasion from predators that employ smell for hunting, such as sharks. Ink clouds of some species might act as pseudomorphs, or decoys that the predator attacks instead.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters. Secondary craters form when large blocks <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter {{on the side of the}} crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbit of}} Thebe lies near {{the outer edge}} of the Thebe gossamer ring, which is {{composed}} of the dust <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> satellite. After ejection the dust drifts in the direction of the planet under the action of Poynting–Robertson drag forming a ring inward of the moon.|$|E
5000|$|A Turkish {{fighter jet}} crashed near an {{airport in the}} Kurdish city of Diyarbakır on Dec. 12, the {{military}} said, but the pilot was able to safely <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plane. According to a government spokesman the plane had fallen due to a possible technical malfunction. Also PKK militants took responsibility for the downed Turkish jet.|$|R
50|$|The second {{new vehicle}} is the Car Slug or the TIAF 660. This is {{a car with}} a {{360-degree}} vulcan cannon attached. Its secondary fire is an oversized Enemy Chaser. Of particular interest is that <b>the</b> player cannot <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, meaning they die when its destroyed, and will subsequently respawn in a new Car Slug.|$|R
50|$|Within {{seconds of}} the goose strike, the plane pancaked short of the base {{perimeter}} fence onto a public highway and caused the plane to immediately and violently lose structural integrity. The two observers did not witness any evidence of Freeman <b>ejecting</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stricken aircraft, {{but it was too}} close to the ground for a parachute to open properly in any event.|$|R
5|$|To {{keep the}} {{survivors}} safe, Alyx and Gordon opt {{to take a}} different train. They manage to escape just as the reactor begins to detonate; the energy sends out the Combine's message. Several pods containing Combine Advisors are <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Citadel as it detonates. The resulting shockwave catches the train, derailing it.|$|E
5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced there. This area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|After the Committee's {{first and}} second reports were considered, the Lords passed the bill 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999. During the session, Earl of Burford, son of the Duke of St Albans, {{launched}} a protest at the constitutional implications of the bill from the Woolsack, and was <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chamber. Once the Lords settled the differences between their {{version of the bill}} and the Commons version thereof, the Bill received Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of parliament. The Act then came into force the same day.|$|E

5|$|Bird's nest fungi {{were first}} {{mentioned}} by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia (1601). Over {{the next couple}} of centuries, these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds, and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature. For example, the French botanist Jean-Jacques Paulet, in his work Traité des champignons (1790–3), erroneously suggested that peridioles were <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Siegel, who {{is deeply}} {{skeptical of the}} {{existence}} of an undiscovered new planet in the Solar System, nevertheless speculates that at least one super-Earth, which have been commonly discovered in other planetary systems but have not been discovered in the Solar System, might have been <b>ejected</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Solar System during a dynamical instability in the early Solar System. Hal Levison thinks that the chance of an ejected object ending up in the inner Oort cloud is only about 2%, and speculates that many objects must have been thrown past the Oort cloud if one has entered a stable orbit.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{contemplated}} {{for use in}} the Vietnam War the F-106 {{never saw}} combat, nor was it exported to foreign users. Following the resolution of initial teething problems – in particular an ejection seat that killed the first 12 pilots to <b>eject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft [...] – its exceptional performance made it very popular with its pilots. After the cancellation of their own Avro Arrow, the Canadian government briefly considered purchasing the F-106C/D.|$|R
