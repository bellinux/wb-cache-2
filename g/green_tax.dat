In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members.

40|$|As part of {{environmental}} fiscal reform initiatives the South African government proposed, inter alia, increases in vehicle customs and excise duties (ad valorem) and the licensing fees of fuel-inefficient vehicles. Consequently it is {{proposed that the}} existing ad valorem excise duties on motor vehicles be adjusted to incorporate carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions as an environmental criterion from 1 March 2010. The purpose of these proposed vehicle <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> is to discourage the acquisition and use of vehicles with higher carbon dioxide emissions and fuel-inefficient vehicles. The prospects of it achieving the aforementioned purpose could however {{be affected by the}} design of the proposed vehicle <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> and the provisions of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962. An extended literature review (non-empirical study) was performed. Literature on studies in Japan, European Union countries and fiscal reform instruments implemented in United States were reviewed. Certain weaknesses in, and alternatives for, the proposed vehicle <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> were noted. The focus on consumers is probably the most important weakness which could be addressed by the implementation of a “feebate” policy (with the focus on vehicle manufacturers and “fuel economy technology”). Based on {{the findings of this study}} it is also apparent that certain provisions of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 do allow for a tax deduction if the proposed vehicle <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> are incurred (depending on the category of the taxpayer). The possible tax deduction could impair the ability of the proposed vehicle <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> affecting purchasing and usage behaviour. As section 23 (d), of Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, currently does not prohibit these deductions possible amendments thereto should also be considered.

40|$|This report explores {{public opinion}} on a new and {{promising}} concept—green transportation taxes and fees. These are taxes and fees set at variable rates, with higher rates for more polluting vehicles and lower rates for those that pollute less. This approach to transportation taxes and fees adapts the traditional transportation finance system to achieve two critical public benefits at once: encouraging drivers to choose more environmentally-friendly transportation options and raising revenue for needed transportation programs. To test public support for <b>green</b> transportation <b>taxes</b> and fees, the authors conducted a random telephone survey of 1, 500 Californians that asked respondents their views on five hypothetical tax and fee options: a flat-rate and a green vehicle registration fee, a flat-rate and a green mileage fee, and a “feebate” program for new vehicle purchases under which more-polluting vehicles would be charged a tax and less-polluting vehicles would receive a rebate. The survey {{results show that the}} concept of <b>green</b> transportation <b>taxes</b> and fees strongly appeals to Californians. The survey tested this in two ways: by testing support for the three hypothetical <b>green</b> transportation <b>tax</b> and fee policies, and also by comparing support levels for flat-rate versus green versions of two taxes. Majorities of the respondents supported all three <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> and fees tested. Another striking finding from the survey is that support for the <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> and fees did not vary greatly by population subgroups; a diverse range of Californians supported the <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> and fees.

2500|$|GPO policy {{proposes a}} concept known as <b>green</b> <b>tax</b> shifting, which it classifies under {{the broad context}} of {{ecological}} fiscal reform. In general, the party proposes gradual but significant reductions in all income and corporate taxes (or taxes on so-called [...] "earned income"), funded {{by the introduction of}} new resource-based taxes applied at the point of entry into the economy (for example, carbon taxes). The Green Party also proposes introduction of a system of land value taxation, which would replace the current value assessment-based property tax system and would be meant to discourage urban sprawl and increase land use efficiency. Central to the GPO's tax policies is the concept of revenue neutrality, in which any new taxes (i.e., those on resources and consumption) are complemented by a reduction in other forms of taxation (generally income and corporate taxes). This mixture of libertarian and free-market income tax policies with a shift towards consumption/resource taxation is one of the clear differences between the Ontario Greens and the three main provincial parties. For example, while the NDP {{and to a lesser extent}} the Liberals aim to create social equity through progressive taxation of already-earned income, and the Conservatives do not necessarily view social equity to be the role of government, the Greens prefer allowing individuals/businesses to contribute by paying more for what they use (resources, energy) and the pollution/side-effects that they create. The GPO claims that this system is more fair and more economically desirable, because it only punishes individuals and businesses who operate without regard for society and the environment, while accentuating the ability of truly efficient and responsible businesses to prosper without hindrance. Critics of these policies, however, oppose these taxation methods because they view them as examples of regressive taxation (rather than progressive taxation)due to the fact that they would have a bigger economic impact that would be felt in the everyday lives of lower-income groups. They point out that since these policies don't take into account the person's income/ability to pay, they would naturally create greater economic hardship the lower down the income ladder one is (as in any amount of money that is set to a flat rate would represent a greater portion of one's income the less money they make, hence placing the tax burden on the shoulders of the poorest in society because although everyone would be paying the same amount, [...] "x" [...] amount of dollars is far more significant to a lower-income person than a higher-income person).|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{taxes are}} argued {{to be the}} key to more {{effective}} environmental protection in developing countries. This paper investigates whether such taxes have the necessary public support to be successfully implemented in different contexts, including countries outside the Western and European spheres. Applying a multilevel analysis approach, using data from the World Values Survey and International Social Survey Programme, interaction effects between values, political and social trust, and perceived quality of government institutions (QoG) are explored. It is hypothesized that if people lack trust in public authorities to implement <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> in an efficient, fair and uncorrupt manner, they will be less likely to support such taxes despite their strong pro-environmental values or trust in other people. The results show that people with green values are more likely to support environmental taxes if they live in high QoG countries. The effect of social trust on support for <b>green</b> <b>taxes,</b> however, appears to be contingent on individual-level political trust rather than the quality of government institutions. These interactions are encouraged to be further explored, since they appear to vary across countries and datasets. Some explanations for public support for <b>green</b> <b>taxes</b> might not hold in all contexts, as is illustrated by findings here. While support for environmental taxes is found to be relatively high in some developing countries, low QoG in these contexts might cause low compliance in practice. Internationally, public aversion towards higher taxes to protect the environment is still relatively high...|$|R
