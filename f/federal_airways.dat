50|$|In the 1940s and 1950s {{air travel}} {{increased}} at a greater rate than air traffic control's {{ability to handle}} the traffic. In normal clear weather pilots could fly without air traffic control but when inclement weather occurred, pilots would obtain clearance from air traffic control and fly on the <b>federal</b> <b>airways</b> at 50 to 100 miles separation. Frequently, weather would overload the system and cause delays up to 1,000 miles away.|$|E
50|$|Initially, war {{shortages}} of VHF radio equipment prevented the system from being widely deployed. The first operational {{installation of a}} VAR was in Matawan, New Jersey in 1944. By 1948, the Civil Aeronautics Authority had built 68 VAR installations on various <b>federal</b> <b>airways</b> across the United States. Quickly overtaken by the more advanced VOR system, VARs never replaced LFR as the primary airway navigation system of the United States. The last VAR was decommissioned in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Other {{controlled}} airspace is designated as Class E, this includes {{a large part}} of the lower airspace. Class E airspace exists in many forms. It can serve as a surface-based extension to Class D airspace to accommodate IFR approach/departure procedure areas. Class E airspace can be designated to have a floor of 700' AGL or 1,200' AGL, or a customized floor of any other altitude. Class E airspace exists above Class G surface areas from 14,500' MSL to 18,000 MSL. <b>Federal</b> <b>airways</b> from 1,200 AGL to 18,000 MSL within 4 mi of the centerline of the airway is designated Class E airspace. Airspace at any altitude over 60,000' (the ceiling of Class A airspace) is designated Class E airspace.|$|E
50|$|The MEA {{prescribed}} for a <b>Federal</b> <b>airway</b> or segment, RNAV low or high route, or other direct route {{applies to the}} entire width of the airway, segment, or route. MEAs for routes wholly contained within controlled airspace normally provide a buffer above the floor of controlled airspace consisting of at least 300 feet within transition areas and 500 feet within control areas. MEAs are established based upon obstacle clearance over terrain and man-made objects, adequacy of navigation facility performance, and communications requirements, although adequate communication at the MEA is not guaranteed. The MEA does, however, assure acceptable navigational signal coverage and meets obstacle clearance requirements between those fixes.|$|R
50|$|Chunghwa post had {{contracted}} with aviation {{groups such as}} China National Aviation Corporation and China <b>Airways</b> <b>Federal</b> to deliver airmail on the Shanghai-Hankow, Nanking-Peking, and the Hankow-Canton routes in early 1929. It was on the Nanking-Peking route, where renown early-20th century poet Xu Zhimo caught a flight, but died as the airmail-carrier plane operated by China <b>Airways</b> <b>Federal</b> under contract, crashed in rough weather.|$|R
50|$|On April 12, 1956, {{the city}} of Huntsville {{approached}} {{the commander of the}} U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Agency to talk about a new <b>federal</b> <b>airway.</b> It was decided that a control tower would be established at Redstone AAF and it would serve as the control tower for military and commercial flights until a new Huntsville Airport was built. After the establishment of the control tower, the control tower of Memphis, Tennessee agreed to handle air traffic for Huntsville through the Redstone Control Tower. The airstrip operated 24 hours a day, seven days a week from July 1956 until November 1969, when it was changed to its current schedule of 13 hours a day, five days a week.|$|R
50|$|If the {{airspace}} is not Class A, B, C, or D, and {{is controlled}} airspace, {{then it is}} Class E airspace. Class E airspace extends upward from either the surface or a designated altitude to the overlying or adjacent controlled airspace. When designated as a surface area, the airspace is configured to contain all instrument procedures. Also in this class are <b>federal</b> <b>airways,</b> airspace beginning at either 700 or 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL) used to transition {{to and from the}} terminal or en route environment, and en route domestic and offshore airspace areas designated below 18,000 feet MSL. Unless designated at a lower altitude, Class E airspace begins at 14,500 MSL over the United States, including that airspace overlying the waters within 12 NM of the coast of the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, up to but not including 18,000 feet MSL, and the airspace above FL 600.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a Stinson Detroiter SM-1F operated by China <b>Airways</b> <b>Federal</b> in Republic of China and was contracted by Chunghwa Post. It was originally General Zhang Xueliang's private airplane, and Xu took the lift free. The {{aircraft was}} also carrying 500 lbs of mail. It had a nickname of Jinan.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was operated by China <b>Airways</b> <b>Federal</b> in the Republic of China and was contracted by Chunghwa Post. It departed from Ming Gugong Airport in Nanking, heading to Nanyuan Airport in Beiping (now Beijing). The passenger, Xu Zhimo, was intending {{to attend an}} architectural lecture given by the well-known architect Lin Huiyin in Beiping. Because of Xu's fame as a poet, the crash shocked the literary community in China.|$|R
50|$|The {{postal service}} in China can be dated {{back to the}} Shang Dynasty. The Customs Post Office of the Qing Empire was {{established}} in 1878 by Robert Hart {{at the suggestion of}} the foreign powers, with branch offices in five major trading cities. On 20 March 1896, the Customs Post Office became the Great Qing Post, which in 1911 became independent of the customs service. The Great Qing Post became the Chunghwa Post in 1912. Chunghwa postal service had signed a contract with the China <b>Airways</b> <b>Federal</b> group in 1929 to transport airmail on the Shanghai-Hankow, Nanjing-Beijing, and Hankow-Guangzhou routes. Chunghwa Post had functioned as the main postal service provider of Mainland China until 1949.|$|R
2500|$|Originally named Baer Army Air Base (or more colloquially, [...] "Baer Field"), {{the base}} {{was named after}} Paul Baer, a Fort Wayne native, born in 1894. A 16 victory Flying ace, he flew with the Lafayette Escadrille and the 103d Aero Squadron American Expeditionary Force Air Service during World War I and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Honor, and the French Croix de Guerre. He {{continued}} to fly after the war, opening air mail routes in South America, and participating in many aviation experiments. He was killed on 9 December 1930 while flying mail and passengers for Chinese <b>Airway</b> <b>Federal,</b> Inc. [...] His Loening C-2-H amphibian crashed on takeoff from Shanghai, China.

50|$|On November 19, 1931, Xu Zhimo {{prepared}} to leave Nanking to attend a lecture given by Lin Huiyin at a university in Peking. He boarded a China <b>Airways</b> <b>Federal</b> Stinson Detroiter, an aircraft contracted by Chunghwa Post to deliver airmail on the Nanjing-Beijing route. However, when the flight arrived in the Jinan area, the flight encountered severe fog, leaving the pilot with no clear view to land. The plane descended into the mountainous area below unnoticed as both the pilots were looking for the course according to the map. When the aircraft was aiming to turn left {{to go back to}} the course again, it hit the peak of a mountain and broke off the right wing. The plane spun out of control and crashed into the mountains near Tai'an City, in Shandong province. Xu Zhimo, who suffered from fatal cerebral trauma and several cuts on his body, was killed instantly as well as one of the two pilots. The first officer however, survived the initial impact, but also perished due to protracted rescue.|$|R
