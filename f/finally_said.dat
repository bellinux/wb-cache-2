25|$|In early May 1990 {{one of the}} two A researchers, Kevin Wolf, {{acknowledged}} the possibility of spiking, but said that the most likely explanation was tritium contamination in the palladium electrodes or simply contamination due to sloppy work. In June 1990 an article in Science by science writer Gary Taubes destroyed the public credibility of the A tritium results when it accused its group leader John Bockris and one of his graduate students of spiking the cells with tritium. In October 1990 Wolf <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> that the results were explained by tritium contamination in the rods. An A cold fusion review panel found that the tritium evidence was not convincing and that, while they couldn't rule out spiking, contamination and measurements problems were more likely explanations, and Bockris never got support from his faculty to resume his research.|$|E

500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do and I think people have <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.

500|$|When Gray {{originally}} {{tested for}} Dallas, {{the role of}} Sue Ellen was merely that of a background character. The actress recounts that the part was a [...] "mere walk-on" [...] and there hadn't been any need for a formal audition. In fact, Gray had to do an impromptu audition over the telephone because the role was not considered important enough to bring in another actor to test for the part, though the actress later stated that Newhart innkeeper Mary Frann was also considered to play the character while the producers were casting the show. In an interview with TV Guide, Gray confirmed: [...] "She [...] had the part. Victoria Principal was a brunette, and so was I, and Mary was a blonde, and [...] wanted that [...] contrast. But the casting director [...] kept bugging them until they <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> 'OK, we'll read her.'" [...] Once the show was picked up for a full season, Gray and fellow actor Steve Kanaly (Ray Krebbs) were both upgraded to starring roles.|$|E
500|$|After the 1971 playoffs, Chamberlain had {{yet another}} offer to fight heavyweight boxing legend Muhammad Ali. The 15-round fight {{would have taken}} place on July 26, 1971 in the Houston Astrodome but Chamberlain refused. The {{potential}} Chamberlain-Ali match was predicated on Ali beating Joe Frazier in a fight scheduled for early 1971. However, Frazier defeated Ali to hand Ali his first professional loss. As a result, Chamberlain declined the fight through a contractual escape clause. In a 1999 interview, Chamberlain stated that boxing trainer Cus D'Amato wanted to train him for the fight, and they offered Ali and him $5 million each to battle each other. Chamberlain checked back {{with his father and}} <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> no. Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had also offered Chamberlain a record-setting contract on the condition that Chamberlain agree to give up what Cooke termed [...] "this boxing foolishness." [...] This {{was not the first time}} a Chamberlain-Ali fight had been explored, as offers had also been made in both 1965 and 1967. In 1967, recently retired NFL star Jim Brown acted as Chamberlain's manager, but Ali's manager Jabir Herbert Muhammad backed out of the Chamberlain-Ali match which was slated to take place at Madison Square Garden.|$|E

He demurred a little, {{saying he would}} gladly do so if the {{translation}} were ready, but that the war would be over before the book was out, Mr. Seward having authoritatively limited its duration to a small number not of weeks but of days. Mr. Scribner <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> perhaps but half believing in the possibility, that {{if it could be}} ready in a week he would publish it. [...] "It shall be done," [...] was her reply, and she went home and went to work, working twenty hours of every twenty-four, receiving the proofsheets at night and returning them with fresh copy in the morning. The week lacked several hours of its completion when the work was finished, and in a fortnight the book was out, and its message rang from Maine to California.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> that's it. I went to her one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very good at that, in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first act}} was rather long and {{contained}} an unusual number of sentimental pieces. [...] As opening night approached, Gilbert became increasingly apprehensive. [...] Would the audience accept this serious, sentimental tone {{from one of}} the duo's [...] "comic" [...] operas? [...] Gilbert and Sullivan cut two songs from Act I and part of the Act I finale, partly to decrease the number of sentimental pieces near the beginning of the opera. [...] Gilbert, always nervous himself on opening nights, came backstage before the performance on opening night to [...] "have a word" [...] with some of the actors, inadvertently conveying his worries to the cast and making them even more nervous. [...] Jessie Bond, who was to open the show with a solo song alone on stage, <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> to him, [...] "For Heaven's sake, Mr. Gilbert, go away and leave me alone, or I shan't be able to sing a note!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1932, {{a fourth}} {{approach}} to the bridge was suggested: Oil Plant Road. [...] This street (whose upper portion {{is now known as}} North Arlington Ridge Road, and whose lower portion is now part of Wilson Boulevard) began near Key Bridge and ended at the northern edge of Arlington National Cemetery — very close to the northern tip of Columbia Island. Local citizens suggested either linking Oil Plant Road to Memorial Avenue or building a bridge that would allow the street to cross Boundary Channel and access Arlington Memorial Bridge. Arlington County Manager Roy S. Braden <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> on February 1 that he would make a decision on which approach to recommend by the end of April 1932. One federal official tried to force the issue. Representative Clifton A. Woodrum attempted to earmark funds for a bridge aligned with the proposed Lee Highway approach. But these funds were deleted {{on the floor of the}} United States House of Representatives.|$|E

2500|$|Billy May (1916–2004), a trumpeter and an {{arranger}} for {{the civilian}} band, Billy May was hired from Charlie Barnet's band by Glenn Miller and joined in 1940. Miller and May had a wary relationship with each other. According to Will Friedwald, by 1942, May {{was ready to}} resign from the Miller band. A few reasons were, Miller refused to record half of May's arrangements and May objected to the regimented style of Miller's band. But since Miller was joining the military, he convinced May to stay on until the band broke up. May <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> around 1995, after a life of heavy drinking and going to rehabilitation for alcoholism, that working with Glenn Miller [...] "helped me immensely. I {{learned a lot from}} Glenn. He was a good musician and an excellent arranger." [...] He became a much-coveted arranger and studio orchestra leader after that band broke up, going on to work with Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney, Anita O'Day, and Bing Crosby, among other singers of the post-war era.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} meeting with Bukharin, the {{telephone}} rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment. A voice from The Kremlin said, [...] "Comrade Stalin wishes to speak with you." [...] According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb. [...] "He was totally unprepared for such a conversation. But then he heard his voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line. The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar thou form: 'Tell me, {{what are they saying}} in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'" [...] Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia. Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam. In an [...] "eager fumbling manner" [...] Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry. Stalin <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> in a mocking tone of voice: [...] "I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade," [...] and put down the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|Sacco and Vanzetti awaited {{execution}} in their cells at Charlestown State Prison, [...] and both men refused a priest several times on their last day, {{because they were}} militant atheists. Their attorney William Thompson asked Vanzetti {{to make a statement}} opposing violent retaliation for his death and they discussed forgiving one's enemies. Thompson also asked Vanzetti to swear to his and Sacco's innocence one last time, and Vanzetti did. Celestino Madeiros, whose execution had been delayed in case his testimony was required at another trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, was executed first. Sacco was next and walked quietly to the electric chair, then shouted [...] "Farewell, mother." [...] Vanzetti, in his final moments, shook hands with guards and thanked them for their kind treatment, read a statement proclaiming his innocence, and <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me." [...] All three executions were carried out by Robert G. Elliott, the state executioner. Following the executions, death masks were made of the men.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
2500|$|After {{listening}} to the track [...] "Saxon" [...] performed by Nicki Minaj and production duo Chase & Status, Rihanna got {{in contact with the}} latter and wanted to collaborate. Chase & Status had a pair of sessions with Rihanna and worked together for a few weeks in an undisclosed location. The songs they worked on had a dubstep vibe, although Rihanna had some disagreements with the duo. In October 2009, she concluded recording sessions with Tricky Stewart and The-Dream. Dream and Tricky flew out to Paris and played a few songs for Rihanna which included [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Rockstar 101." [...] "Hard" [...] stood out from all the songs because she felt that it had such an arrogance in it. In the song [...] "Rockstar 101," [...] guitarist Slash contributed a bass guitar on the track while [...] "Photographs" [...] is a duet with singer-songwriter will.i.am. In addition, Ester Dean co-wrote the fourth single from the album, [...] "Rude Boy". [...] "The Last Song" [...] {{was one of the last}} tracks crafted for the album. Rihanna recorded the song within the final twelve hours of the album's conception; [...] "when the label <b>finally</b> <b>said</b> we had 12 hours to turn in the album, I was like, Okay, I have to do it. I just drank some red wine, dimmed the lights, got in the booth and sang it", she explained.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have <b>finally</b> <b>said,</b> 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E
