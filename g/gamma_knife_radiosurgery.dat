40|$|BackgroundStereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{is widely}} applied to deliver additional dose to {{head and neck}} tumors. However, its safety and efficacy remains equivocal. MethodsOne hundred eighty‐four patients with primary head and neck cancers treated between January 1990 and August 2012 with <b>Gamma</b> <b>Knife</b> stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsTwo hundred fifteen sites were treated with <b>Gamma</b> <b>Knife</b> stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> among 184 patients. Fifty‐one percent of patients received concurrent external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), 72 % had prior surgery, and 46 % received chemotherapy. Most (44 %) had squamous cell carcinoma and most patients (65 %) were treated for recurrent disease. With a median follow‐up of 17. 3 months, 12 ‐month local control was 82 %. Late effects occurred in 59 patients with the most common being temporal lobe necrosis (15 patients). ConclusionRadiosurgery can provide tumor control for patients with head and neck cancers involving the skull base.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} a procedure for Leksell <b>gamma</b> <b>knife</b> (LGK) <b>radiosurgery</b> in a lateral position, {{for treatment of}} far-lateral intracranial lesions. METHODS: Positioning of the patient in the lateral decubitus position during LGK treatment switches the x and y axis coordinates. This increases {{the range of the}} x axis from 52 to 148 mm to 40 to 160 mm (i. e. 12 mm in each direction). RESULTS: Conversion of the coordinates of the isocenters is easily performed with simple mathematical algorithms and does not impair the precision of target positioning at the isocenters during LGK radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: LGK treatment in the lateral decubitus position is a simple accurate procedure for the treatment of far-lateral lesions that cannot be reached with normal supine positioning.

40|$|International audienceHippocampal {{sclerosis}} is {{the most}} common cause of pharmacoresistant epilepsy amenable for surgical treatment and seizure control. The aim of this article is to review and evaluate the published literature related to the outcome of the surgical treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and to describe the future prospects in this field. Surgery of MTLE associated with HS achieves long-term seizure freedom in about 70 % (62 - 83 %) of cases. Seizure outcome is similar in the pediatric population. Mortality following temporal resection is very rare (< 1 %) and the rate of definitive neurological complication is low (1 %). <b>Gamma</b> <b>knife</b> stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> used as a treatment for MTLE would have a slightly worse outcome to that of surgical resection, but would provide neuropsychological advantage. However, the average latency before reducing or stopping seizures is at least 9  months with radiosurgery. Regarding palliative surgery, amygdalohippocampal stimulation has been demonstrated to improve the control of epilepsy in carefully selected patients with intractable MTLE who are not candidates for resective surgery. Recent progress in the field of imaging and image-guidance should allow to elaborate tailored surgical strategies for each patient in order to achieve seizure freedom. Concerning therapeutics, closed-loop stimulation strategies allow early seizure detection and responsive stimulation. It may be less toxic and more effective than intermittent and continuous neurostimulation. Moreover, stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy is a recent approach leading to hopeful results. Closed-loop stimulation and stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy may provide a new treatment option for patients with pharmacoresistant MTLE. Mesial temporal lobe surgery has been widely evaluated and has become the standard treatment for MTLE associated with HS. Alternative surgical procedures like <b>gamma</b> <b>knife</b> stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> and amygdalohippocampal stimulation are currently under assessment, with promising results...|$|R

40|$|OBJECT: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} outcomes in patients with 3 ̆e/= 10 CNS metastases treated with <b>Gamma</b> <b>Knife</b> stereotactic <b>radiosurgery</b> (GK-SRS).
