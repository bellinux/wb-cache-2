40|$|Interest in the {{phenomenon}} of religion and the Internet extends {{to the use of}} the Internet by radical or extremist religious groups. Recent events in international terrorism have led government agencies and the academic community to conclude that the Internet plays a role in the radicalisation of individuals towards extremist violence. The literature on the extremism and radicalisation reflects an acknowledgement, although developing understanding, of the role of the Internet in the process of individual radicalisation towards extremist ideologies. Much of the examination of this phenomenon is conducted through content analysis examining how extremist groups incorporate the use of new media into their recruitment and communication strategies. Motivated by the question of what compels individuals to engage with extremist content on the Internet, this article proposes a different approach to examining {{the phenomenon}} of extremism on the Internet: one that mirrors the shift in media research from textual analysis to a focus on the audience and the context of media use. The first half of this article examines how the Internet and social media practices represent a discursive relocation of the Islamic tradition of discussing religious disputes. The second half explores the contemporary context of Muslim audiences and their media needs and relates this to {{the phenomenon of}} <b>Internet</b> <b>radicalisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent global {{events that}} have brought to light the use of new {{technologies}} by terrorist groups have focused attention {{on the role of}} the internet in the radicalisation of vulnerable individuals and groups towards a violent extremism. In 2007, the case of Abdul Basheer, a law graduate in Singapore arrested for attempting to join the Taliban in Afghanistan drew attention to the use of the Internet as a source of inspiration and information for would be terrorists. More recently Sydney man Belal Khazaal became the first person to be convicted on the charge of making a document connected with assisting in a terrorist act after using material already available on the internet to develop his own publication "The Rules of Jihad- Short Judicial Rulings and Organisational Instructions For Fighters And Mujahideen Against Infidels". Both cases point to the developing role of the Internet in the process of radicalisation and suggest that the Internet has become an important tactical tool in the terrorists ’ repertoire. The role of the Internet in radicalisation and the extent to which it contributes to the process through which latent beliefs translate into violent actions is not fully understood. However, with the developing strand of terrorism studies that deals with the diffusion of intent as an integral component of counter terrorism efforts has come an understanding of terrorism as a battle of words and ideas. Nowhere is this more evident than on the <b>internet.</b> <b>RADICALISATION</b> Radicalisation may be described as a process by which individuals progress from a passive or inactive belief in...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} radicalisation of Muslims in the UK. The {{aim is to}} map current state of radicalisation of Muslims in the UK, with specific focus on British radical groups, strategy and initiatives of Britons {{in the process of}} deradicalization. The theoretical part is focused on the identification of potential causes of the radicalisation process and on the characteristic profile of radicals, more emphasis is given to an examination {{of the role of the}} <b>internet</b> in <b>radicalisation.</b> Attention has been payed to statistical demo-graphic data, dynamics and the subject of the British Muslim population based on the Census data of 2011. The practical part of the thesis is devoted to a description of British radical groups and their influence in the UK. The final chapter discusses the Contest strategy, preventive initiatives and targeted individualised intervention to counter radicalisation in the UK...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the results from exploratory primary research {{into the role of}} the <b>internet</b> in the <b>radicalisation</b> of 15 terrorists and extremists in the UK. In recent years, policymakers, practitioners and the academic community have begun to examine how the internet influences the process of radicalisation: how a person comes to support terrorism and forms of extremism associated with terrorism. This study advances the evidence base in the field by drawing on primary data from a variety of sources: evidence presented at trial, computer registries of convicted terrorists, interviews with convicted terrorists and extremists, as well as police senior investigative officers responsible for terrorist investigations. The 15 cases were identified by the research team together with the UK Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and UK Counter Terrorism Units (CTU). The research team gathered primary data relating to five extremist cases (the individuals were part of the Channel programme, a UK government intervention aimed at individuals identified by the police as vulnerable to violent extremism), and ten terrorist cases (convicted in the UK), all of which were anonymised. Our research supports the suggestion that the internet may enhance opportunities to become radicalised and provide a greater opportunity than offline interactions to confirm existing beliefs. However, our evidence does not necessarily support the suggestion that the <b>internet</b> accelerates <b>radicalisation</b> or replaces the need for individuals to meet in person during their radicalisation process. Finally, we didn 2 ̆ 7 t find any supporting evidence for the concept of self-radicalisation through the internet. Authored by Ines von Behr, Anais Reding, Charlie Edwards, and  Luke Gribbon...|$|R
40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{interface}} between terrorism and the internet and presents contemporary approaches to understanding violent extremism online. The volume focuses on four issues in particular: terrorist propaganda on the internet; radicalisation and the internet; counter campaigns and approaches to disrupting internet radicalisation; and approaches to researching and understanding {{the role of the}} <b>internet</b> in <b>radicalisation.</b> The book brings together expertise {{from a wide range of}} disciplines and geographical regions including Europe, the US, Canada and Australia. These contributions explore the various roles played by the Internet in radicalisation; the reasons why terroristic propaganda may or may not influence others to engage in violence; the role of political conflict in online radicalisation; and the future of research into terrorism and the internet. By covering this broad range of topics, the volume will make an important and timely addition to the current collections on a growing and international subject. This book will be of much interest to students and researchers of cyber-security, internet politics, terrorism studies, media and communications studies, and International Relations...|$|R
40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{interface}} between terrorism and the Internet and presents contemporary approaches to understanding extremism online. The main themes covered in the book are: Terrorist propaganda on the internet; Internet radicalisation; Counter campaigns and approaches to disrupting internet radicalisation; Approaches to researching and understanding {{the role of the}} <b>internet</b> in <b>radicalisation.</b> Together, these four themes can be loosely grouped into two broad foci: (i) the phenomenon of online radicalisation through explorations of terrorists’ use of the internet; and, (ii) responses to this phenomenon through explorations of the policy and research agendas dealing with the growing influence of the internet in violent extremism. As such the book covers issues ranging along the gamut of how terrorists use the internet to how governments are responding to the increasing risk posed by exposure to online terroristic content. Existing books on terrorism and the internet tend to cover only one discrete aspect, such as terrorist use of the internet for propaganda, or are grounded in only one research discipline such as information technology. This book brings together expertise from different disciplines and different regions (Europe, the US, Canada and Australia) in a volume that explores some of the outstanding questions, such as the role of the internet in radicalisation; the reasons why terroristic propaganda is or is not influencing violent extremists; the role of political conflict in online radicalisation and the future of research into terrorism and the internet. This range of interests has never before been covered by a single volume and the book will make a unique and timely addition to the current collections on a growing and international market. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber-security, internet politics, terrorism studies, media and communications studies, and IR generally...|$|R
40|$|The {{internet}} {{is at the}} centre of modern life. It can facilitate understanding between people of different cultures and promote a sense of global community. At the same time, however, {{it can be a}} powerful tool for terrorists to promote extremist ideology and hatred. The writings of terrorist groups are regularly posted on websites in our region. And extremists use various web forums and chat rooms to entice new recruits. Convicted terrorists have given evidence about the influence of the internet in their recruitment and communication strategies. Although the internet has become an important tool for tactical operations such as bombings, psychological warfare and fundraising, the focus in this paper is on its use as a tool to radicalise potential supporters. This study found that the internet has contributed to radicalisation, will probably grow in regional significance, and might become the dominant factor in radicalisation in the region. And it’s not just passive websites that are important in this context: social networking sites of all kinds, such as blogs and forums, are evolving rapidly. This paper discusses several policy approaches to counter the use of the <b>internet</b> for <b>radicalisation</b> in our region. These include blocking sites, creating counternarrative websites to promote tolerance, and intelligence-led methods to tackle the problem. In preparing this report, the authors canvassed a range of views among officials in Australia and the region, {{as well as those of}} industry representatives and community stakeholders. The project was carried out jointly by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. We are grateful to the authors and all those, from both organisations, involved in the production of the report. The report makes an important contribution to understanding how terrorist organisations use the internet in our region and provides clear pathways for policy development to counter online radicalisation at the national and regional levels...|$|R
