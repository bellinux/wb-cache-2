5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the <b>fuzing</b> system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project had only three teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first have to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E
25|$|In January 1950, Bell {{began to}} study what nuclear warheads were {{available}} for RASCAL. The W-5 Nuclear Warhead was initially considered. On 20 August 1950 the Special Weapons Development Board (SWDB) authorized a W-5/RASCAL integration effort. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was responsible for developing the <b>fuzing</b> system for the RASCAL warhead. No provision was made for surface burst at this time. In April 1952 fuze development was shifted to Bell which resulted because it was USAF policy to make airframe contractors responsible for nuclear weapons <b>fuzing</b> since this system needed to be integrated with the missile's guidance system. Bell developed two complete <b>fuzing</b> systems, airburst or surface burst. Then in March 1956 the W-5/RASCAL program was canceled.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the United States {{upgraded}} D5 missiles with arming, <b>fuzing</b> {{and firing}} (AF) {{system that allows}} them to target hardened silos and bunkers more accurately.|$|E
50|$|Field {{artillery}} used {{manual time}} <b>fuze</b> setting, at its simplest this uses a hand ‘key’ or wrench {{to turn the}} <b>fuze</b> nose to the required setting. Manual <b>fuze</b> setters are set at the <b>fuze</b> length and then used to set the <b>fuze,</b> this {{has the advantage of}} ensuring that every <b>fuze</b> is correctly and identically set. Electronic <b>fuzes</b> are designed use electronic setters to transfer data electronically, early ones required an electrical contact between the <b>fuze</b> and the setter. These have been superseded by induction <b>fuze</b> setters that do not require physical contact with the <b>fuze.</b> Electronic setters may also check <b>fuze</b> functioning in a ‘Go/No Go’ test.|$|R
50|$|A contact <b>fuze,</b> impact <b>fuze,</b> {{percussion}} <b>fuze</b> or direct-action (D.A.) <b>fuze</b> (UK) is the <b>fuze</b> that {{is placed}} in the nose of a bomb or shell so that it will detonate on contact with a hard surface.|$|R
50|$|Broadly, <b>fuzes</b> {{function}} {{on impact}} (percussion <b>fuzes)</b> or at a pre-determined time period after firing (time <b>fuzes).</b> However, by the 18th century time <b>fuzes</b> were aimed {{to function in}} the air and in the 1940s proximity <b>fuzes</b> were introduced to achieve more precisely positioned airburst. Therefore, the terms ‘percussion’ and ‘airburst’ are generally used here unless ‘time’ <b>fuzes</b> are being explicitly described.|$|R
25|$|It is, however, {{unlikely}} that a well-funded belligerent {{with nuclear weapons}} would waste their weapons with <b>fuzing</b> to explode below or on the surface, as both test shot Baker, and Castle Bravo were respectively. Instead, to maximize the range of city blast destruction and immediate death, an air burst is preferred, as the ≈500 meter explosion heights of the only nuclear weapons used on cities, Little Boy and Fat Man also attests to. Moreover, with air bursts {{the total amount of}} radiation contained in the fallout, in units of activity/Becquerel, is somewhat less than the total that would be released from a surface or subsurface burst, as in comparison, depending on the height of burst, little to no neutron activation or neutron induced gamma activity of soil occurs from air bursts.|$|E
500|$|The B-1B {{no longer}} carries nuclear weapons; its nuclear {{capability}} was disabled by 1995 with {{the removal of}} nuclear arming and <b>fuzing</b> hardware. [...] Under provisions of the New START treaty with Russia, further conversion were performed. These included modification of aircraft hardpoints to prevent nuclear weapon pylons from being attached, removal of weapons bay wiring bundles for arming nuclear weapons, and destruction of nuclear weapon pylons. The conversion process was completed in 2011, and Russian officials inspect the aircraft every year to verify compliance.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Gadget" [...] was a {{laboratory}} euphemism for a bomb, {{from which the}} laboratory's weapon physics division, [...] "G Division", took its name in August 1944. At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity Test device as it {{had yet to be}} developed, but once it was, it became the laboratory code name. The Trinity Gadget was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the Fat Man used a few weeks later in the bombing of Nagasaki. The two were very similar, with only minor differences, the most obvious being the absence of <b>fuzing</b> and the external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>fuzes</b> {{have to be}} {{set before}} being loaded into the breech, {{although}} {{in the case of}} impact <b>fuzes</b> it may be very simple matter of selecting the delay option if required, 'instantaneous' being the factory set default. However, airburst <b>fuzes</b> have to have the required <b>fuze</b> length set. Modern <b>fuzes</b> invariably use a <b>fuze</b> length in seconds (with at least tenths) that reflect the required time of flight. However, some earlier time <b>fuzes</b> used arbitrary units of time.|$|R
50|$|HE shells can {{be fitted}} with other <b>fuzes.</b> Airburst <b>fuzes</b> {{usually have a}} {{combined}} airburst and impact function. However, until the introduction of proximity <b>fuzes,</b> the airburst function was mostly used with cargo munitions—for example, shrapnel, illumination, and smoke. The larger calibers of anti-aircraft artillery are almost always used airburst. Airburst <b>fuzes</b> {{have to have the}} <b>fuze</b> length (running time) set on them. This is done just before firing using either a wrench or a <b>fuze</b> setter pre-set to the required <b>fuze</b> length.|$|R
50|$|The {{final section}} of the report {{described}} how mechanical <b>fuzes</b> for artillery shells were being discontinued in favour of electrical <b>fuzes</b> and mentioned that bombs already had electrical <b>fuzes.</b> Mayer described the working of bomb <b>fuzes</b> and described electrical time <b>fuzes.</b> He also mentioned {{an idea for a}} proximity <b>fuze,</b> i.e. a <b>fuze</b> that detonates a warhead at a set distance from a target. The <b>fuze</b> he described sensed its target by changes in partial capacitances, which in practice turned out to be impracticable. He mentioned its anti-aircraft applications and its use in anti-personnel artillery shells, an application which was later employed by the Allies. Mayer concluded by mentioning that the <b>fuzes</b> were manufactured by Rheinmetall in Sömmerda, Thüringen.|$|R
2500|$|BMP-3K (komandnyi) – Tactical command variant, {{includes}} additional radio R-173, an intercom {{for seven}} users, an AB-R28 independent portable power unit, a navigation device TNA-4-6 and the [...] "Ainet" [...] round <b>fuzing</b> capability. The BMP-3K lacks the bow {{machine guns and}} has its whip antennas mounted on the rear hull. Crew: 3+3.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2016, MBDA further {{proposed}} a new [...] variant of Brimstone 2 for the AH-64E Apache. It would specifically be for non-armoured targets in {{land and sea}} domains, but will not compromise Brimstone's anti-armour capability. It will have a cockpit-selectable trajectory, which will allow line-of-sight engagement (flat trajectory) and high and low missile flight profiles to avoid close-in obstacles; a cockpit-selectable capability that allows the pilot to determine the elevation and impact angle on the target to maximise weapon effect; and {{a new set of}} warhead 'modes, which includes delayed, airburst, impact and proximity <b>fuzing.</b> This weapon will be known as the Future Attack Helicopter Weapon (FAHW).|$|E
2500|$|The Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a United States Army [...] {{program to}} develop a {{precision}} guidance system for existing 155mm artillery shells. The prime contractor is Alliant Techsystems and the project team includes Interstate Electronics Corporation. In operation the PGK will screw into {{the nose of the}} projectile much like the existing fuze. However, as well as the <b>fuzing</b> function it will provide a GPS guidance package and control surfaces to correct the flight of the shell. [...] This is analogous to the addition of a Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail-kit to a dumb iron bomb, creating a precision guided munition. [...] Production started in 2009.|$|E
50|$|A {{proximity}} <b>fuze</b> is a <b>fuze</b> that detonates {{an explosive}} device automatically when {{the distance to}} the target becomes smaller than a predetermined value. Proximity <b>fuzes</b> are designed for targets such as planes, missiles, ships at sea and ground forces. They provide a more sophisticated trigger mechanism than the common contact <b>fuze</b> or timed <b>fuze.</b> It is estimated that it increases the lethality by 5 to 10 times, compared to these other <b>fuzes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Fuzes</b> may be {{delivered}} fitted to shells or in separate containers, {{in the latter}} case the shell itself has a plug that has to be removed before fitting the <b>fuze.</b> Historically, <b>fuzed</b> HE shells were provided with a standard impact <b>fuze</b> that had to be removed and replaced by a time <b>fuze</b> when airburst was required.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fuze</b> {{assembly}} {{may include}} {{more than one}} <b>fuze</b> function. A typical combination would be a T & P ("Time & Percussion") <b>fuze</b> with the <b>fuze</b> set to detonate on impact or expiration of a preset time, whichever occurred first. Such <b>fuzes</b> were introduced around {{the middle of the}} 19th century. This combination may function as a safety measure or as an expedient to ensure that the shell will be actuated no matter what happens and hence not be wasted. The United States called mechanical T & P <b>fuzes</b> ‘mechanical time super quick’ (MTSQ). T & P <b>fuzes</b> were normal with shrapnel and HE shells (including proximity <b>fuzes),</b> but were not always used with high bursting carrier shells.|$|R
2500|$|In the era {{the advice}} was {{originally}} given, {{the most common}} nuclear weapons were weapons comparable to the US Fat Man and Soviet Joe-1 in yield. The most far-reaching dangers that initially come from the nuclear explosion of this, and higher, yield weapons as airbursts, are the initial flash/heat and blast effects and not from fallout. This {{is due to the}} fact that when nuclear weapons are detonated to maximize the range of building destruction, that is, maximize the range of surface blast damage, an airburst is the preferred nuclear <b>fuzing</b> height, as it exploits the mach stem phenomenon. This phenomenon of a blast wave occurs when the blast reaches the ground and is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle the reflected wave and the incident wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, this is known as the 'Mach stem' (named after Ernst Mach) and is a form of constructive interference and consequently extends the range of high pressure. While Air-burst <b>fuzing</b> also increases the range that peoples skin will have a line-of-sight with the nuclear fireball. However, as a result of the high altitude of the explosion, most of the radioactive bomb debris/ is dispersed into the stratosphere, with a great column of air therefore placed between the vast majority of the bomb debris/fission reaction products and people on the ground for a number of crucial days before it falls out of the atmosphere in a comparatively dilute fashion, this [...] "delayed fallout" [...] is henceforth not an immediate concern to those near the blast. On the other hand, the only time that fallout is rapidly concentrated in a potentially lethal fashion in the local/regional area around the explosion is when the nuclear fireball makes contact with the ground surface, with an explosion that does so, being aptly termed a surface burst. For example, in the Operation Crossroads tests of 1946 on Bikini Atoll, using two explosive devices of the same design and yield, the first, Test Able (an air burst) had little local fallout, but the infamous Test Baker a near surface shallow (underwater burst) left the local test targets badly contaminated with radioactive fallout.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{guns were}} {{procured}} in France in 1917, the weapon being declared standard for Army use in November 1922, although their first military use was in Africa in 1921 during the assault at Turiet Hamed. The gun was also built under license at Trubia and {{were used by}} the Regimientos de Artillería Pesados (Heavy Artillery Regiments). One was captured by revolutionaries in the Trubia factory during the Asturian miners' strike of 1934, although it was ineffective {{due to the lack}} of <b>fuzing</b> for their shells; the gun was damaged when a dynamite cartridge bundle used as substitute for fuzeless shells exploded inside. [...] The gun was heavily used during the Spanish Civil War by both sides. During the SCW and World War II some guns were used as coastal defence weapons to try improve Spanish coastal defences as nothing more suitable was available. It remained in service until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern equipment. There are many surviving pieces, of Spanish and French construction, in museums and as monuments around Spain.|$|E
2500|$|Green Grass/Violet Club was {{the first}} UK-deployed weapon to {{dispense}} with the crude polonium and beryllium impact or crush type initiators used in Fat Man and other early US weapons together with the British Blue Danube and Red Beard. Instead it used an electronic neutron initiator (ENI) known as Blue Stone. This had the great advantage of being adjustable, allowing the neutron burst to be triggered at precisely the right moment. The burst heights of Green Grass were optimized for either maximum overpressure without allowing fireball contact with the ground, or to maximise the ground area subjected to a 6 psi overpressure; respectively [...] and [...] above ground level A barometric fuze was used, backed-up by an adjustable clockwork timer fuze with impact fuses as a final fail-safe. Most of these mechanisms originated from Blue Danube although the radar altimeter fuze was omitted. The electrical power for these <b>fuzing</b> mechanisms and the firing mechanisms of the 72-lens, [...] implosion device came from lead-acid accumulators located in {{the tail of the}} Blue Danube casing. These were commercially sourced six-volt motorcycle batteries.|$|E
50|$|An {{artillery}} <b>fuze</b> or fuse is {{the type}} of munition <b>fuze</b> used with artillery munitions, typically projectiles fired by guns (field, anti-aircraft, coast and naval), howitzers and mortars. A <b>fuze</b> is a device that initiates an explosive function in a munition, most commonly causing it to detonate or release its contents, when its activation conditions are met. This action typically occurs a preset time after firing (time <b>fuze),</b> or on physical contact with (contact <b>fuze)</b> or detected proximity to the ground, a structure or other target (proximity <b>fuze).</b> <b>Fuze,</b> a variant of fuse, is the official NATO spelling.|$|R
50|$|The M224 rounds {{have three}} <b>fuze</b> types: The Multioption <b>Fuze</b> (M734), the Point-Detonating <b>Fuze</b> (M525), and Timer <b>fuze.</b> The M734 {{is used for}} the M720 HE round and can be set to {{function}} as proximity burst, near-surface burst, impact burst, or delay burst.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{projectile}} drawing, an Auxiliary Detonating <b>Fuze</b> is {{screwed onto}} {{the bottom of}} the Mechanical Time <b>Fuze.</b> This is because the time <b>fuze</b> primer does not have enough explosive shock to detonate the relatively insensitive Explosive [...] "D". The Auxiliary <b>fuze</b> uses an intermediate explosive that is set off by the time <b>fuze</b> primer, and in turn, sets off the Explosive [...] "D".|$|R
2500|$|An {{originally}} classified 1984 US interagency {{intelligence assessment}} states that {{in both the}} preceding 1970s and 80s, the Soviet and US military were already following the [...] "existing trends" [...] in warhead miniaturization, of higher accuracy and lower yield nuclear warheads, this is seen when assessing the most numerous physics packages in the US arsenal, which in the 1960s were the B28 and W31, however both quickly became less prominent with the 1970s mass production runs of the 50 Kt W68, the 100 Kt W76 and in the 1980s, with the B61. This trend towards miniaturization, enabled by advances in inertial guidance and accurate GPS navigation etc., was motivated by a multitude of factors, namely the desire to leverage the physics of equivalent megatonnage that miniaturization offered; of freeing up space to fit more MIRV warheads and decoys on each missile. Alongside the desire to still destroy hardened targets but while reducing the severity of fallout collateral damage depositing on neighboring, and potentially friendly, countries. As {{it relates to the}} likelihood of nuclear winter, the range of potential thermal radiation ignited fires was already reduced with miniaturization. For example, the most popular nuclear winter paper, the 1983 TTAPS paper, had described a 3000 Mt counterforce attack on ICBM sites with each individual warhead having approximately one Mt of energy; however not long after publication, Michael Altfeld of Michigan State University and political scientist Stephen Cimbala of Pennsylvania State University argued that the then already developed and deployed smaller, more accurate warheads (e.g. W76), together with lower detonation heights, could produce the same counterforce strike with a total of only 3 Mt of energy being expended. They continue that, [...] if the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts, would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst <b>fuzing</b> – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets. This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 Interagency Intelligence assessment, which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors {{to reduce the amount of}} smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter. Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with <b>fuzing</b> for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, local fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute global fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode.|$|E

50|$|Initially {{there were}} HE and {{shrapnel}} shells, both {{fitted with a}} time <b>fuze.</b> <b>Fuze</b> No.199 was igniferous (i.e. powder-burning) with a maximum running time of 30 seconds. <b>Fuzes</b> No. 106 and 107 were mechanical time fuses; both proved unsatisfactory. <b>Fuze</b> No. 208, with a maximum running time of 43 seconds, became the standard <b>fuze.</b> A great improvement in 1942 was the introduction of Machine <b>Fuze</b> Setter No. 11, on Mounting Mk. IIC and Carriage Mk. IIIA, which raised the rate of fire to 20 rounds per minute.|$|R
50|$|Most {{artillery}} <b>fuzes</b> are nose <b>fuzes.</b> However, base <b>fuzes</b> {{have been}} used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells.

The <b>fuze</b> has three prongs with a central post for attaching a trip wire. The <b>fuze</b> is triggered by either pressure applied to the prongs or tension on an attached tripwire.|$|R
50|$|Butterfly {{bombs in}} a submunitions {{container}} {{could have a}} mixture of different <b>fuzes</b> fitted to increase disruption to the target. Additionally, when a single <b>fuze</b> type with two operating functions was fitted (e.g. type 41), bombs in a submunitions container could have either or both possible <b>fuze</b> settings selected by the Luftwaffe ground crew. <b>Fuze</b> variants such as the 41A, 41B, 70B1, 70B2, etc., also existed. These variants were inserted into the <b>fuze</b> pocket via a bayonet fitting (the <b>fuze</b> was held in place via two steel clips) but otherwise functioned identically.|$|R
5000|$|Anti-handling {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} used in <b>fuzes</b> since at least 1940, in, for example, Luftwaffe's ZUS-40 anti-removal <b>fuze</b> [...] which was used during the London Blitz and elsewhere. ZUS-40s were designed to fit underneath most Luftwaffe bomb <b>fuzes.</b> When a delayed-action bomb containing a ZUS-40 was dropped on a target, the impact when it hit the ground freed a ball-bearing inside the ZUS-40, thereby arming a spring-loaded firing pin. However, so long as the main bomb <b>fuze</b> remained inside its <b>fuze</b> well, the cocked firing pin in the ZUS-40 was prevented from springing forward. ZUS-40s were often fitted underneath a type 17 clockwork long delay <b>fuze,</b> which gave between 2 and 72 hours delayed detonation. Rendering safe a type 17 <b>fuze</b> was normally a simple and straightforward process i.e. unscrew the <b>fuze</b> locking ring, remove the <b>fuze</b> from its pocket {{in the side of the}} bomb and unscrew the gaine. However, fitting a ZUS-40 underneath a type 17 <b>fuze</b> made the render-safe process much more complicated and dangerous. Removing the main time-delay <b>fuze</b> more than 15 millimetres from its <b>fuze</b> pocket (without neutralising the anti-handling device underneath) automatically released the cocked firing pin inside the ZUS-40, which sprang forward to strike a large percussion cap, thereby causing detonation of the bomb and the death of anyone nearby. Because the ZUS-40 was designed to be concealed underneath a conventional bomb <b>fuze,</b> it was very difficult to know whether a particular bomb was fitted with an anti-handling device or not. In any case, many electrically fired German bomb <b>fuzes</b> already had a pendulum-based [...] "trembler" [...] switch which triggered detonation if the bomb was subjected to rough handling. Some German anti-handling <b>fuzes</b> were even more dangerous to EOD personnel, such as the type 50 and 50BY <b>fuzes.</b> These were normally fitted to 250/500 kg bombs and contained two mercury tilt switches which detected vertical or horizontal movement. The <b>fuzes</b> fully armed themselves approximately 30 seconds after hitting the ground. Subsequently, if the bomb was moved in any way, the mercury switch triggered detonation. To complicate matters still further, German bombs could have two separate <b>fuze</b> pockets fitted, with different <b>fuze</b> types screwed into each one. As a result, one bomb could incorporate two separate anti-handling devices working independently of each other e.g. a type 17 clockwork <b>fuze</b> with a ZUS-40 hidden underneath it screwed into one <b>fuze</b> pocket, and a type 50BY in the other. Even comparatively small air-dropped munitions could incorporate an anti-handling feature e.g. the type 70 <b>fuze</b> fitted to Butterfly bombs. However, <b>fuzes</b> with an integral anti-handling feature were not only found in air-dropped bombs. For example, the T.Mi.Z.43 <b>fuze</b> (dating from 1943) fitted to Teller mines automatically triggered detonation if (in an attempt to render the mine safe) the pressure plate was unscrewed. Although the designs of these anti-handling <b>fuzes</b> varied, all were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel who had the task of rendering them safe.|$|R
