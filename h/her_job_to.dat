Although Sita wanted Mary to teach her music, Mary's short temper diminishes her confidence and Rao takes over her music lessons.|$|E

After an unsuccessful World Cup in 2000, Taylor left <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> become a full-time cricketer. Over the subsequent five years, she developed into one of the leading batsmen in women's cricket, but after another failure in the 2005 World Cup she resumed her career alongside cricket.|$|E

5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As {{she did not want to}} be a cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} relocated <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> the Pentagon, {{because they}} {{felt that she was}} spending too much time around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about the Lewinsky affair than he declared to the grand jury.|$|E

During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the Late Show with David Letterman, Letterman brought {{up some of the}} issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether she had any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E

This award, along with 2 others at the same ceremony, increased Polwart's profile not just in the folk community but also in the wider musical arena.|$|E
25|$|As Ted Dexter was contesting Jim Callaghan's {{constituency}} in the General Election M.J.K. Smith led the MCC on {{its last}} tour of South Africa, though Dexter joined the team after his inevitable defeat {{at the ballot}} box. Though {{not as strong as}} they would be in a few years South Africa had Graeme and Peter Pollock, Eddie Barlow, Colin Bland and Denis Lindsay and were expected to win on their home turf as England had no recognised fast bowlers. Barrington was made a tour selector and unexpectedly granted permission to bring his wife Ann to South Africa, so she quit <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> join him on the tour. Fears that she would affect his form were put to rest with innings of 76, 24 not out, 169, 2, 169 not out and 82 running up the First Test, where his 148 not out (in 432 minutes) set up a surprise innings victory on a spinning wicket. With a weak bowling attack Barrington's leg-spin was encouraged and he took 5/29 and 4/25 against South African Universities. In the Second Test England enforced the follow on after another Barrington century – 121 – was brought up with a six as he added 191 with Dexter for the third wicket, but Colin Bland dug in for 144 not out as South Africa held out for a draw. The Third Test at Cape Town saw Barlow refusing to walk after giving a catch to Peter Parfitt and being given not out. He made 138 and South Africa 501/7 after winning the toss. This caused a furore as the England players refused to acknowledge his hundred and was only calmed down by an apology. The matter was re-opened by Barrington who was given not out at 49, then walked off as his had snicked the ball to Lindsay. It made little difference to the game, England made 442 in another draw, but in the South African second innings he impersonated Jim Laker and took 3/4, his best bowling in Tests. Barrington opened the batting with Geoff Boycott and made 14 not out impersonating W.G. Grace. He captained the MCC in a tour match against the Orange Free State, made 3 and 34 not out and won by 7 wickets. Moving on to Johannesburg Barrington advised Smith to field on the moist wicket after winning the toss, but South Africa made 390/6 and though he made 93 and 11 it was only due to a gritty 76 not out from Boycott that England survived. Against Griqualand West Barrington took his best first-class figures of 7/40 (9/69 in the match) and England went into the Fifth Test needing a draw to win the series. Trevor Goddard won the toss and South Africa made 502, but too slowly to force a result. Boycott made 117 and Barrington 72 in England's even slower reply and the game was drawn. England won the series 1–0, the last team to beat the Springboks until 1997–98. Barrington was the chief scorer with 508 runs (101.60) in the Tests and 1128 runs (86.76) on the tour. He also topped the tour bowling averages with 24 wickets (7.25), but leg-spin was out of fashion and was barely used in the Tests. Even so, he was named the South African Cricket Annual Cricketer of the Year 1965.|$|E

Appalled by the idea of recruiting someone from his marketing team as an actress, the vice-president refused. When Parineeti Chopra told Sharma she was leaving <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> attend acting school he advised her to meet the company's casting director, who asked her to do a [...] "dummy audition for fun". Chopra remembered [...] "fooling around with a camera" [...] and delivering lines by the character Geet from the film Jab We Met, never expecting producer Aditya Chopra to see the tape. However, when the producer saw the tape he was impressed with her acting. With Sharma describing her [...] "phenomenal" [...] in the screen test, Chopra was signed to a three-film deal; Chopra's colleagues later told her she was a [...] "misfit in an office situation".|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{during his}} junior year of high school, Bass {{received}} a call from Justin Timberlake and his mother, Lynn Harless, who asked Bass if he would be interested in auditioning for the pop group NSYNC after the group's original bass singer, Jason Galasso, had quit. Timberlake's vocal coach (who had worked with Bass during his time as a Mississippi Show Stopper) recommended Bass as a replacement. Bass was accepted into the group after auditioning {{in front of the other}} bandmembers and Lou Pearlman, and soon left school to move to Orlando, Florida, and rehearse full-time. Bass has said that he did not know how to dance before he joined NSYNC, and therefore found much of the group's choreography difficult to learn. According to an episode of VH1's Driven, Jan Boltz, president of BMG's German division, offered NSYNC a recording contract under the condition that they replace Bass, whose dancing, he felt, [...] "wasn't at the same level as all the others." [...] However, the other members of the group refused to accept the contract without Bass, and the group's manager, Johnny Wright, convinced Bolz that Bass's dancing would quickly improve. Bolz conceded, and the group soon moved to Munich, Germany to record their first album with BMG. 'N Sync began extensive touring in Europe, and Bass's mother quit <b>her</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> tour with the group as a chaperone, as Bass was still a minor.|$|E
