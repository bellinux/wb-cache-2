We {{face the}} {{question}} of how to produce a scale space of image intensities relative to a scale space of objects or other characteristic image regions filling up the image space, when both images and objects are understood to come from a population. We argue for a schema combining a multi-scale image representation with a multi-scale representation of objects or regions. The objects or regions at one scale level are produced using soft-edged apertures, which are subdivided into sub-regions. The intensities in the regions are represented using histograms. Relevant probabilities of region shape and inter-relations between region geometry and of histograms are described, and the means is given of interrelating the intensity <b>probabilities</b> and <b>geometric</b> <b>probabilities</b> by producing the probabilities of intensities conditioned on geometry. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for supporting the decision and policy making related to the optimal determination of shifts and fares of taxi services in a major city.

The model is based on an econometric model with the inclusion of an elastic demand, which allows the estimation of the optimal values for the two decision variables of the problem: fare structure and the taxi fleet size. The model also accounts for a full-day time period instead of the one-hour time frame models used in most of the taxi models, which allows for providing insights on the daily duration and distribution of the shifts that should be defined by the policy makers.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{economic}} and theoretical foundations of insolvency risk measurement and capital adequacy rules. The proposed new measure of insolvency risk is constructed by disentangling assets, debt and equity at the micro-prudential firm level. This new risk index is the Firm Insolvency Risk Index (FIRI) which is symmetrical, proportional and scale invariant. We demonstrate that the balance sheet can be shown to evolve with a fractal pattern. As such we construct a fractal index that can measure the risk of assets. This index can differentiate between the similarity and dissimilarity in asset risk, and it will also possess the properties of being self-similar and invariant to firm characteristics that make up its asset composition hence invariant to all types of risk derived from assets. Self-similarity and scale invariance across the cross section allows direct comparison of degrees of risk in assets. This is by comparing the risk dissimilarity of assets. Being naturally bounded to its highest upper bound, (0, 2], the fractal index is able to serve like a risk thermometer. We assign <b>geometric</b> <b>probabilities</b> of insolvency P (equity is equal or less than 0 conditional on debt being greater than 0). Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{mesoscopic}} fluctuations {{is applied to}} inhomogeneous solids consisting of chaotically distributed regions with different crystalline structure. This approach {{makes it possible to}} describe statistical properties of such mixture by constructing a renormalized Hamiltonian. The relative volumes occupied by each of the coexisting structures define the corresponding <b>geometric</b> <b>probabilities.</b> In the case of a frozen heterophase system these probabilities should be given a priori. And {{in the case of a}} thermal heterophase mixture the structural probabilities are to be defined self-consistently by minimizing a thermodynamical potential. This permits to find the temperature behavior of the probabilities which is especially important near the points of structural phase transitions. The presense of these structural fluctuations yields a softening of a crystal and a decrease of the effective Debye temperature. These effects can be directly seen by nuclear gamma resonance since the occurrence of structural fluctuations is accompanied by a noticeable sagging of the Mössbauer factor at the point of structural phase transition. The structural fluctuations also lead to the attenuation of sound and increase of isothermic compressibility. Comment: 1 file, 18 pages, RevTex, no figure...|$|R
