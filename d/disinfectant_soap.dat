40|$|Watergate {{made me a}} lawyer. On August 8, 1974, Richard Nixon {{resigned}} {{the office}} of President of the United States. 1 Three weeks later, I returned to college to begin my junior year. I was a pre-med biochemistry major scheduled {{to spend most of}} the fall semester surrounded by beakers, spectrophotometers, test tube racks, glass slides, and fumes of formaldehyde and acetone. During the summer, as the evidence against the President mounted and impeachment moved from the realm of the fantastic to virtual certainty, the prospect of a life among the petri dishes grew less and less alluring. I will confess that some of this disenchantment undoubtedly arose from a persistent inability, demonstrated in two passes through organic chemistry, to grasp the molecular configurations made possible by the hexagonal geometry of the carbon atom. Nonetheless, the most powerful source of my disquiet was the realization, growing for a year and more as I watched the televised hearings before Senator Sam Ervin 2 ̆ 7 s Watergate Committee, and then the proceedings of the House Judiciary Committee as it agonized toward a vote on articles of impeachment, that I was far more interested in what these men and women were doing than in all the cytosis, osmosis, and symbiosis of all the microorganisms ever spawned. 2 * 6 It was not merely the theater of Watergate that drew me in, though the drama of the thing was undeniable. After all, one can be mesmerized by the grisly spectacle of a train wreck without feeling any urge to become an engineer. What captivated me was the people of Watergate, principally the legislators on the Senate and House committees, but also members of the Watergate Special Prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s Office, and even members of the Nixon administration itself [...] elected or appointed officials, partisan politicians mostly, and certainly no saints [...] who, on balance, acted with firmness, integrity, and restraint. As a Democrat and no special fan of Richard Nixon, 3 my particular heroes were the obvious ones: Archibald Cox, Sam Ervin, Peter Rodino, Barbara Jordan. But I think even then I admired them as much for their caution and their obvious and unfeigned sense of the gravity of the task they had undertaken as for their investigative prowess, their rhetoric, their wit, or their ultimate success in forcing a flawed and corrupt president from office. And even back then, despite my instinctive rooting interest in the Democrats, I came away from Watergate with a deep respect for those Republicans in and out of Congress who [...] despite the personal and political cost [...] insisted on finding the truth, refused to blink at what they found, and finally, sadly, repudiated their own leader. 4 I wanted to be like these people, wanted a part, however small, in the high drama of American public life. The immediately obvious point was that nearly all of the players in Watergate (both the heroes and the villains) were lawyers. And so, in the fall of 1974, I abandoned the study of the natural world, took up the study of history and politics, and resolved to go to law school. Twenty-five years later, after law school, two decades of practice as a trial lawyer, and {{at the beginning of a}} second career as a legal academic, to my immense surprise, I found myself playing a (very) small part in the second presidential impeachment of my lifetime as the co-author of the official statement of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to the House Judiciary Committee on the meaning of “high Crimes and Misdemeanors. ” * 7 5 Of course, we know how that came out. President Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate. 6 By the time this Article reaches print, he will have completed his term. Irremediably stained, but defiant. Disgraced and diminished, but persistently, almost perversely popular. The fall of Richard Nixon was tragedy in the classic sense. A commanding personality clawed to the heights of power and was then brought low when crippling flaws in his character led him into conduct that was a serious affront to democratic government. The Clinton impeachment was vulgar farce. 7 A surpassingly agile politician with an adolescent sex drive and an urge for self-preservation that far outstripped any sense of personal honor was attacked by opponents who missed their quarry and destroyed or diminished themselves by trying to elevate a squalid extramarital sexual encounter into an affair of state. For me at least, the effect of watching Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s descent was all that the ancient Greek commentators on the drama could have wished for in the spectator of a tragedy: pity, terror, catharsis, enlightenment, an aspiration to nobler things. By contrast, the dominant emotion inspired by Bill Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s escape from early retirement was * 8 the urge to bathe with strong <b>disinfectant</b> <b>soap</b> [...] and then to retreat into the countryside to take up beekeeping, or some other occupation as removed as possible from the contemplation of American law and politics. This radical contrast in my reactions to the impeachment controversies that stand at either end of my life in the law so far has led me to ask three questions. First, were the Nixon and Clinton affairs truly as different as my memory makes them? Were the villains of Watergate as villainous and the heroes as heroic as I remember them? Were nearly all the players on both sides of l 2 ̆ 7 affaire Lewinsky as shallow and fatuous as they seemed? Or to put the question in broader historical context, was the impeachment of Bill Clinton truly distinct, not only from Watergate, but from all of the other (fortunately few) occasions on which a president was seriously threatened with removal from office? Second, if the Clinton impeachment really was as bizarre, unprecedented, and unsettling an event as it seemed, how could such a thing have happened? Finally, what are the implications for the future of the presidency, and more generally, for the project of governance in America, of the incredible but incontrovertible fact that a president of the United States was impeached and nearly stripped of his office for lying about sexual infidelity...|$|E

40|$|The aims of this {{extended}} essay are {{to identify}} what types of bacteria are present at school environment and what type of cleaning product {{is the most effective}} at decreasing their growth when the surfaces are cleaned manually. In other words, bactericidal properties of various cleaning agents are compared within the scope of this study. My research question is: “Is there a statistically significant mean difference between the selected cleaning products, which are named as soft soap, multi-purpose cleaner 1 and 2, alkaline disinfectant and alkaline surface cleaner, in terms of their bactericidal effects on bacterial flora found in school environment?” It was hypothesized that; there would be a significant mean difference in terms of bactericidal effect in between the cleaning agents used. Alkaline disinfectant would be the most effective, followed by the other alkaline products (alkaline surface cleaner and soft soap), and then the neutral products (multi-purpose cleaners). In order to test the hypothesis, bacterial samples were collected from each student’s desk before and after wiping with each product. According to the variety and amount of bacteria that grow after overnight incubation, types of bacteria present, and bactericidal actions of the products were determined. Amount of bacteria was reported in colony forming units per milliliter, and the units were counted by microbiologists. Resultantly, alkaline surface cleaner reduced the largest number of colony forming units, followed by alkaline <b>disinfectant,</b> soft <b>soap</b> and multi-purpose cleaners respectively. Cheaper multi-purpose cleaner reduced more units than the expensive one, so it was concluded that the expensive was not worth its price.

40|$|In this project, {{the aim was}} to {{test the}} {{bactericidal}} efficiency of an hand antiseptic called SOW, by comparing it to a regular <b>soap.</b> <b>Disinfectants</b> are used to reduce the bacteria on the hands of the hospital staff to diminish the risk of contamination of the bacteria to other patients. Disinfectants in hospitals are tested often because the hospital acquired diseases are seen commonly in Turkey and it is necessary to be hygienic in order to prevent those diseases. If a disinfectant material is not effective, it can cause the bacteria to spread to other patients and it would cause diseases. Soap is a widely used disinfectant and is cheaper than SOW. In order to understand whether SOW is effective or not, soap is used as a comparator. There are several methods for testing the efficiency of a disinfectant. It is necessary to find out which of the testing methods is more suitable to get more accurate results. In this experiment, the surgical hand antisepsis method was chosen because the disinfectant, SOW, was going to be used in hospitals. In the experiment, the 14 staff who work in Hacettepe University Hospital were chosen. They were asked to wash their hands with regular soap and then they were divided into two groups, seven in each, one using the SOW while the other does not. Both of the groups put their hands into petri dish. After the incubation of the buyyon into petri dishes, the bacterial colonies were counted. By using statistical tests, it was found out that both of the disinfectants were effective. Afterwards, by calculating the percent decreases in colony counts after disinfectant use, the statistical analysis showed that there was not a meaningful difference in the efficiency of both disinfectants in terms of reducing bacterial colonies. In conclusion, these results suggest that SOW is not a superior <b>disinfectant</b> compared to <b>soap</b> and both can be used in hospitals to reduce the contamination of bacteria. ...|$|R

40|$|This master’s {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on space and material requirements {{for the implementation of}} additional professional assistance in preschools. In the theoretical part of the thesis, we described the legal acts regulating preschool education of special needs children in Slovenia, the programmes that organize preschool education of special needs children, the additional professional assistance, and the mobile special educational service which usually offers assistance in preschools. We also discussed inclusion and work satisfaction. In the empirical part of the thesis, we developed a new grading scale which helped us determine the state of space and material requirements for the implementation of additional professional assistance in seven preschools which agreed to cooperate in researching their educational organization. The grading scale was filled out by specialized professionals who offer their assistance to these preschools. We then statistically processed the results and presented them in tables and descriptions. We determined that there are no statistically important differences between preschools when it comes to ensuring appropriate space requirements for the implementation of additional professional assistance. However, there are considerable statistical differences in ensuring material requirements for the implementation of additional professional assistance. The results also show that professionals believe that the areas for additional professional assistance are not as well equipped as other areas of preschools. They also report that there is often a lack of basic health products (e. g. wipes, <b>soap,</b> <b>disinfectants)</b> in preschools. Based on these results, we prepared guidelines for preschools and included information about positive and negative aspects of their current space and material requirements provided by their additional assistance professionals...|$|R

The paper is based on a study which centred on the Asian Foundation/UNDP Jua Kali Project on the past and present skill upgrading training for the entrepreneurs in Nairobi Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The author used simple random sampling technique to select a sample of 45 respondents for the study. Forty-five semi-structured questionnaire were administered to these respondents out of which 40 were returned constituting a response rate of 89 per cent. Quantitative analysis using descriptive statistics was used to describe distribution of findings. Findings indicated that most of the respondents were between the age group 20 - 25 with an average of 23 years. The majorities were not married constituting 75 per cent. The education levels of business owners in the sampled enterprises were high with 47. 5 per cent of all business owners having passed secondary school while 25 per cent had had college education. In addition, majority of the respondents had work experience of less than 5 year because many joined the training programme from secondary schools. Forty-five per-cent of the respondents had had previous technical training with a number of entrepreneurs critical of the training they had received terming the courses as too basic, too theoretical or too general. The enterprises encountered in the field ranged from metal work, screen printing, herbal <b>soap,</b> <b>disinfectants,</b> detergents, weaving/tie and dye.
