The character was originally going to be an integral part of the movie, but was removed due to Gunn feeling there were too many characters.

25|$|Synergism often {{occurs when}} two {{elements}} are combined; {{it is an}} interaction between two elements that causes an effect greater than the combined effects of each element separately. Synergism {{is evident in the}} combining of scaffold material and topography with cellular therapies, neurotrophic factors, and biomimetic materials. Investigation of synergism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> after individual techniques have proven to be successful by themselves. The combinations of these different factors need to be carefully studied in order to optimize synergistic effects.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia {{has never}} {{experienced}} a serious no-confidence vote before {{and it is}} unclear what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> if, in the unlikely event, Abdullah loses the vote; whether a snap election is held, or whether the King dissolves parliament, or whether a new leader is given the opportunity to form a new government. No Malaysian Prime Minister has ever faced a vote of no-confidence presented by a member of his own coalition before. The Barisan Nasional has 140 lawmakers in the 222-member Parliament, enough to defeat any vote against Abdullah who is also president of the UMNO.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{neurotrophic}} {{factors are}} being intensely studied {{for use in}} bioartificial nerve conduits because they are necessary in vivo for directing axon growth and regeneration. In studies, neurotrophic factors are normally {{used in conjunction with}} other techniques such as biological and physical cues created by the addition of cells and specific topographies. The neurotrophic factors {{may or may not be}} immobilized to the scaffold structure, though immobilization is preferred because it allows for the creation of permanent, controllable gradients. In some cases, such as neural drug delivery systems, they are loosely immobilized such that they can be selectively released at specified times and in specified amounts. Drug delivery <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> beyond the basic addition of growth factors to nerve guidance conduits.|$|E

500|$|Serial numbers became commonplace {{after the}} United States passed the Gun Control Act of 1968. [...] This law {{mandated}} that all guns manufactured or imported {{into the country}} have a serial number. Prior to 1968, many firearms either {{did not have a}} serial number or the serial numbers were not unique and were reused by a manufacturer on multiple firearms. [...] If a recovered weapon has had the serial numbers altered or destroyed, examiners can attempt to recover the original numbers. [...] The two main methods for the restoration of serial numbers are magnetic particle inspection and chemical restoration. [...] It is recommended that magnetic particle inspection be performed first due to the nondestructive nature of the method. [...] If magnetic particle inspection fails, chemical restoration <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> in the forensic analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Christian {{meditation}} is differentiated from contemplation {{which involves}} {{a higher level}} of focus and detachment from the surroundings and environment. The word contemplation (coming from the Latin root templum, i.e. to cut or divide) means to separate oneself from the environment. Saint John of the Cross called contemplation [...] "silent love" [...] and viewed it as an intimate union with God. Contemplation with the rosary <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> beyond scriptural meditation. This {{does not mean that the}} Gospel is ignored during contemplation, but that the focus moves toward the love of God.|$|E
