25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects.

I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal {{as if it were}} an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we <b>give</b> <b>our</b> students nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.|$|E
25|$|Seydlitz was sighted {{at about}} 2400 by Marlborough, who did nothing. The second {{ship in the}} squadron, Revenge (Captain Kiddle) {{challenged}} the unidentified ship, and received the wrong response, but took no action. Agincourt (Captain Doughty) {{at the rear of}} the line spotted her but did not challenge her so as not to <b>give</b> <b>our</b> division's position away. Light cruisers Boadicea and Fearless (Captain Roper) also spotted Seydlitz, but followed the example of the battleships and did nothing. Roper stated that by the time he could identify the ship, it was too late to fire a torpedo at her (Fearless was capable of 25 knots compared to Seydlitz's maximum 16 knots because of the damage). Seydlitz, already badly damaged and unable to put up much of a fight, was able to limp back to Germany.|$|E

500|$|Kershaw {{started the}} 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but {{did so by}} walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, {{throwing}} just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, [...] "I didn't <b>give</b> <b>our</b> team any kind of chance.

[...] However, Ray Misson, the head of Melbourne University's arts education department, described the serial's depiction of a lesbian as [...] "a real advance."

An eight-man single elimination tournament was then planned to determine the inaugural champion. The tournament was to start on February 4 and conclude on February 6, 2010 at The Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the tapings of ROH's television program Ring of Honor Wrestling. Regarding the new championship addition, ROH President Cary Silkin said, [...] "We’ve been talking about adding a secondary championship for some time. Not only will this give the athletes of Ring of Honor another tremendous goal to work towards, it will also <b>give</b> <b>our</b> great partner, HDNet, a championship that {{is sure to be}} defended on the television program.

500|$|Modelling atomic {{behaviour}} under incident {{electromagnetic radiation}} using [...] "virtual oscillators" [...] at the absorption and emission frequencies, {{rather than the}} (different) apparent frequencies of the Bohr orbits, led Max Born, Werner Heisenberg and Kramers to explore different mathematical models. They {{led to the development}} of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. The BKS theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. The most provocative element of BKS – that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically – was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger. In light of these results, Bohr informed Darwin that [...] "there is nothing else to do than to <b>give</b> <b>our</b> revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible".|$|E
500|$|Air Force {{running back}} Leotis Palmer {{was having the}} best season of his career heading into the San Francisco Bowl. During the regular season, he {{accumulated}} 537rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns and 113passing yards for two touchdowns. Palmer and the Falcons had already clinched the season's rushing title, cementing their status as the No.1 rushing team in the country after West Virginia—the second-place team—failed to gain sufficient yardage in its final game to pass the Falcons. Despite finishing with the top-ranked rushing offense, none of Air Force's offensive linemen received postseason honors. [...] "It should <b>give</b> <b>our</b> players a lot of incentive for next year. Hopefully, if we repeat next year, maybe we'll get two or three on there. You certainly don't accumulate the number of yards we do unless you have people up front doing their job," [...] DeBerry said at the time.|$|E

[...] The New York Dramatic Mirror praised the production and commented on the clear adaptation of Shakespeare's work, resulting in an unusually clear presentation of the story. Another review in The Moving Picture World praised the film in a follow-up to the first review, commenting on the ephemeral nature of the productions by saying [...] "Few, indeed, will be the releases of the month to surpass this, and few, indeed, are the pictures that seem so complete and in every way satisfactory." ...|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers.

That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to <b>give</b> <b>our</b> fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{assessing}} Davies's {{political career}} the historian Alun Morgan notes certain inconsistencies: while calling for unity among leftist factions, Davies frequently rebelled against agreed Labour Party policies. He championed democracy, individual {{liberty and the}} rights of small nations, yet gave the Soviet Union his unvarying and uncritical support. However, he was consistent in certain core areas, often in defiance of official Labour policy: unremitting hostility to US foreign policy, opposition to the party's post-war defence policies (specifically on issues concerning American bases in Britain, rearmament in West Germany, and [...] development of the Polaris submarine programme), and above all commitment to the needs and interests of his Merthyr constituents. His dedication to his own agenda brought him into frequent conflict with party managers, and led to withdrawals of the party whip throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Stating his position in a 1948 letter to the Labour Party general secretary Morgan Phillips, he wrote: [...] "Our movement embraces millions of men and women, and not merely a few hundred MPs and a few dozen... members of the National Executive. I am habitually inclined to <b>give</b> <b>our</b> millions my first thoughts and consideration." [...] Davies's popularity with the voters of Merthyr Tydfil remained constant; he secured 75 per cent or more of the vote in each of the general elections of 1955, 1959, 1964 and 1966.|$|E
