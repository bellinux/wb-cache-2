40|$|The {{combination}} of wavelet analysis methods with data-driven models is a prevalent approach to conducting hydrological time series forecasting, {{but the results}} {{are affected by the}} accuracy of the wavelet decomposition of the series. The choice of <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> {{is one of the key}} factors for the wavelet decomposition. In this paper, the data of daily precipitation and streamflow time series measured in the upper reach of the Heihe River Basin in Northwest China were used as an example, and the influence of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> on wavelet-based hydrological time series forecasting was investigated. The true components of the precipitation series were identified, and the modeling results using 10 decomposition levels and two decomposition types were compared. The results affirmed that the wavelet-based modeling performance is sensitive to the choice of <b>decomposition</b> <b>level,</b> which is determined by the time series analyzed, but has no relation with the decomposition type used. The essence of the choice of <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> is to reveal the complex variability of hydrological time series under multi-temporal scales, and first knowing the true components of series could guide the choice of <b>decomposition</b> <b>level.</b> Through this study, the relationship among original series' characteristics, the choice of <b>decomposition</b> <b>level,</b> and the accuracy of wavelet-based hydrological time series forecasting can be more clearly understood, and it can be an improvement for wavelet-based data-driven modeling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The wavelet de-noising {{approach}} {{is one of}} the most efficient techniques for noise reduction. Except for the mathematical elegancy in its theoretical aspect, a successful application requires appropriate determination on the <b>decomposition</b> <b>level.</b> This paper proposes a novel approach to selecting an appropriate <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> by applying the Gamma test on the noisy data to estimate the noise variance. A number of experiments were carried out on a set of smooth signals corrupted by white Gaussian noise to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and a set of traffic flow data was used to demonstrate the application of the proposed approach on the real-world de-nosing task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed {{approach is}} effective to determine the <b>decomposition</b> <b>level...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} wavelet {{transform}} {{which offers a}} tunable Q-factor in each <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> and retains the translation-invariant property as well. Rational-dilation wavelet transform, whose Q-factor could be tuned before decomposition, has a finer time-frequency localization ability than common dyadic wavelet transform. However, the fixing of its Q-factor in every <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> restricts the freedom of frequency-domain partition, and also the up-sampler and down-sampler in its decomposition destroys translation-invariant property. We firstly analyze the decomposition and reconstruction {{of a kind of}} rational-dilation wavelet transform, and then discuss a transform that provides a tunable Q-factor in each <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> and keeps the translation-invariant property. Also, this method is expanded to two-dimensional case. Finally, we show the advantages of the method in time-frequency localization via the application in DEM generalization.

40|$|The wavelet {{threshold}} denoising {{method is}} an effective noise suppression approach for noisy laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy signal. In this paper, firstly, the noise sources of LIBS system are summarized. Secondly, wavelet multi-resolution analysis and wavelet threshold denoising method are introduced briefly. As {{one of the major}} factors influencing the denoising results in the process of wavelet threshold denoising, the optimal <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> selection is studied. Based on the entropy analysis of noisy LIBS signal and noise, a method of choosing optimal <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> is presented. Thirdly, the performance of the proposed method is verified by analyzing some synthetic signals. Not only the denoising results of the synthetic signals are analyzed, but also the ultimate denoising capacity of the wavelet threshold denoising method with the optimal <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> is explored. Finally, the experimental data analysis implies that the fluctuation of the noisy LIBS signals can be decreased and the weak LIBS signals can be recovered. The optimal <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> is able to improve the performance of the denoising results obtained by wavelet threshold denoising with non-optimal wavelet functions. The signal to noise ratios of the elements are improved and the limit of detection values are reduced by more than 50 % by using the proposed method...|$|E

30|$|At {{the final}} stage, the {{anaglyph}} synthesis {{is performed using}} the improved disparity map. To generate an anaglyph, the neighboring frames in a grid dictated by the disparity map should be re-sampled. During numerous simulations, the bilinear, sinc and NNIs were implemented to find an anaglyph with a better 3 D perception. The NNI showed a better performance during the simulations and it was sufficiently fast {{in comparison with the}} other investigated interpolations. Thus, the NNI was chosen to successfully create the required anaglyph in this application. The NNI is performed for each pair of neighboring frames in the video sequence. NNI [19] that uses this framework changes the values of the pixels to the closest neighbor value. To perform the NNI in the current <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> and to form the resulting disparity map, intensity of each pixel is changed. The new intensity value is determined by comparing a pixel in the low resolution disparity from i th <b>decomposition</b> <b>level</b> with the closest pixel value in the actual disparity map from (i - 1)th <b>decomposition</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{non-redundant}} directional transform and shift-invariant transform based on even-stacked cosine-modulated filter banks (ECFBs). M-band dual-tree wavelet transform (MDTWT) recently proposed has rich directional selectivity and near shift-invariance. However, {{it has two}} problems. First, it is not critically-sampled transform. Second, it cannot achieve shift-invariance at all <b>decomposition</b> <b>levels.</b> For these problems, we show a solution based on ECFBs. Critically-sampled ECFBs provide non-redundant transform with rich directional selectivity. Further-more, oversampled ECFBs with oversampling ratio of 2 can assure the shift-invariance at any <b>decomposition</b> <b>levels.</b> Moreover, ECFBs can be designed from only one prototype filter and guarantee linear phase.

In this research, a wavelet-based image sharpening algorithm was developed to enhance shadow areas independently using the defected cloudy image information. The developed algorithm is applied locally by boosting the image high frequency content in the shadow areas using the defected image de-noised wavelet coefficients. Image entropy {{was used as a}} measure to determine the change in wavelet coefficient values.
