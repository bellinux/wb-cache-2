40|$|MM - P&DMOne {{aspect of}} HIV/AIDS that remains a burning issue for many researchers, health workers and health {{institutions}} like Masoyi ACTS Clinic, a healthcare centre in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa that treats chronic diseases, is that HIV/AIDSrelated stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> (S <b>and</b> D) threatens {{to continue to}} undermine any progress made {{in the areas of}} prevention, treatment and support. Social responses of fear, denial, stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> continue to accompany the epidemic. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how people living in Masoyi area perceive HIV/AIDS-related stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination,</b> their experience of it and the way they are dealing with it. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was used. One of the main findings of the study of the focus groups in the area was that while HIV/AIDS-related stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> are prevalent, both internalized and perceived stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> were much more prevalent than the external stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> were found to be primarily driven by fear of perceived or felt stigma and physical, social, verbal or institutional stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> were only secondary drivers. The study calls for a new thinking when dealing with stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination.</b> This new thinking should take cognizance of the influence of internalized stigma on people living with HIV/AIDS...|$|R

40|$|There is no {{question}} that the stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> associated with HIV and AIDS can be reduced through intervention. The inclusion of stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> reduction as a critical component of achieving an AIDS-free generation in recent UNAIDS, UN and PEPFAR political initiatives is promising. Yet national governments need evidence on effective interventions at the individual, community and societal levels in order to strategically incorporate stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> reduction into national AIDS plans. Currently, the heterogeneity of stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> reduction approaches <b>and</b> measurement makes it challenging to compare and contrast evaluated interventions. Moving forward, it is critical for the research community to: (1) clearly link intervention activities to the domains of stigma to be shifted; (2) assess the stigma domains in a consistent manner; and (3) link stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> reduction with HIV prevention, care and treatment outcomes (e. g., uptake, adherence and retention of ART). These steps would further advance the scientific evidence base of stigma <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> reduction <b>and</b> allow for the identification of effective interventions that could be scaled up by national governments...|$|R

40|$|Stigma {{has been}} {{identified}} {{as one of the most}} important obstacles for a successful integration of people with mental illness into the society. Research about stigma has shown negative attitudes among the public towards people with mental illness. Studies so far have, however, put little emphasis on how these negative attitudes are perceived by the mentally ill persons. The aim of the present study was to investigate acceptability and internal consistency of the Swedish versions of two stigma scales, the Devaluation <b>and</b> <b>Discrimination</b> scale <b>and</b> the Rejection experiences scale. Forty individuals were subject to an interview, which also comprised assessments of needs for care, quality of life, therapeutic relationship and empowerment. The results showed that both the Devaluation <b>and</b> <b>Discrimination</b> scale <b>and</b> the Rejection experiences scale had a good internal consistency and acceptability. Stigma in terms of perceived devaluation <b>and</b> <b>discrimination</b> was found to be most markedly associated with empowerment and rejection experiences was found to be most associated with the number of previous psychiatric admissions. It is concluded that the Swedish versions of the Devaluation <b>and</b> <b>Discrimination</b> scale <b>and</b> the Rejection experiences scale may well be used in further studies of stigma among people with mental illness...|$|R
