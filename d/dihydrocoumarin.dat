40|$|Serine proteases are {{attractive}} {{targets for the}} design of enzyme inhibitors since they are involved in the etiology of several diseases. Within the class of serine proteases, HLE {{is one of the most}} destructive enzymes in the body. It is implicated in the promotion or exacerbation of a number of diseases including pancreatitis, acute respiratory syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. Thrombin, a trypsin-like serine protease, plays a dual role in thrombogenesis, including fibrin formation and platelet activation. As a result, thrombin constitutes one of the most widely studied targets for antithrombotic strategy. Numerous inhibitors of serine proteases have been reported during the past three decades. Among them, coumarin-type molecules displayed a high inhibitory potency towards various serine proteases. At that time, halomethyl <b>dihydrocoumarins</b> have been shown to behave as the first general suicide inhibitors of serine protease. These molecules inhibit several proteases such as human leucocyte elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase, thrombin, urokinase and human plasmin. Isocoumarins are very effective as mechanism-based inhibitors of serine proteases. Pharmacomodulation on the 3 -alkoxy- 4 -chloroisocoumarins and the 3 -alkoxy- 7 -amino- 4 -chloroisocoumarins led to strong inhibitors of numerous serine proteases such as HLE, human factor XIa and XIIa, thrombin, urokinase and kallikrein. Recently, a series of coumarins characterised by an alkyl, aryl ester, amide, thioester or ketone in the position 3 and an electrophilic chloromethyl moiety in the position 6 have been developed.

40|$|While {{synthetic}} polymers {{have largely}} supplanted natural materials {{because of their}} low cost, concerns exist regarding their long-term sustainability. Most current commodity plastics are derived from petroleum, which is non-renewable. Furthermore, items constructed from current commodity materials persist in the environment for decades. Although bio-sourced and biodegradable polymers are commercially available, their widespread application is limited by high costs and physical properties that are inferior to those of comparable petroleum-based polymers. We have developed a family of bio-derived polyesters via the copolymerization of epoxides with cyclic esters that exhibit exceptional thermal properties compared to those of commercial bio-derived polyesters. We report the alternating copolymerization of <b>dihydrocoumarin</b> with epoxides catalyzed by chromium salen complexes. <b>Dihydrocoumarin</b> is a promising monomer because it is relatively inexpensive and {{can be obtained from}} renewable resources. This process provides access to a variety of perfectly alternating polyesters with high molecular weights and narrow polydispersities. Atactic poly(cyclohexene dihydrocoumarate) and poly(cyclopentene dihydrocoumarate) were found to be semicrystalline by differential scanning calorimetry. The alternating copolymerization of propylene oxide with terpene-based cyclic anhydrides catalyzed by chromium, cobalt, and aluminum salen complexes is also reported. The use of the Diels-Alder adduct of [alpha]-terpinene and maleic anhydride as the cyclic anhydride comonomer results in amorphous polyesters that exhibit glass transition temperatures of up to 109 °C. The aluminum salen complex exhibits exceptional selectivity against transesterification and epimerization side reactions, which allows these copolymerizations to be run to full conversion. The resulting polyesters are highly alternating and have high molecular weights and narrow polydispersities. Finally, we report an optimized process for the copolymerization of less bulky tricyclic anhydrides with excess PO that achieves full monomer conversion with minimal side reactions to produce well-defined aliphatic polyesters. The rates of undesirable transesterification and epimerization are controlled by i) the ratio of aluminum salen complex to cocatalyst and ii) the Lewis acidity of the aluminum salen complex. Optimal selectivity and activity are achieved through a careful balance of these two parameters. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Effective DNA repair enables {{cancer cells}} to survive DNA damage induced by {{chemotherapeutic}} or radiotherapeutic treatments.

DHC exposure in the human TK 6 lymphoblastoid cell line also caused concentrationdependent increases in p 53 acetylation and cytotoxicity. Flow cytometric analysis to detect annexin V binding to phosphatidylserine demonstrated that DHC increased apoptosis more than 3 -fold over controls. Thus, DHC inhibits both yeast Sir 2 p and human SIRT 1 deacetylases and increases p 53 acetylation and apoptosis, a phenotype associated with senescence and aging.

40|$|The plant {{secondary}} metabolite and common food additive <b>dihydrocoumarin</b> (DHC) is an inhibitor of the Sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases.

Here we report that exposure to the polyphenol DHC led to defects in several Sirtuin-regulated processes in budding yeast including the establishment and maintenance of Sir 2 p-dependent silencing by causing disassembly of silent chromatin, Hst 1 p-dependent repression of meiotic-specific genes during the mitotic cell cycle. As both transient and prolonged exposure to environmental and dietary factors have the potential to lead to heritable alterations in epigenetic states and to modulate additional Sirtuin-dependent phenotypes, we examined the bioavailability and digestive stability of DHC using an in vivo rat model and in vitro digestive simulator. Our analyses revealed that DHC was unstable during digestion and could be converted to melilotic acid (MA), which also caused epigenetic defects, albeit less efficiently. Upon ingestion, DHC was observed primarily in intestinal tissues, but did not accumulate over time and was readily cleared from the animals.

Hydrolysis of DFP was stimulated equally well by 1 mM MgCl 2, MnCl 2 or CoCl 2, to a lesser extent by 1 mM CdCl 2 but not at all by 1 mM CaCl 2. No 45 Ca 2 +-binding activity was detected for purified SMP 30, suggesting that SMP 30 is not a calcium-binding protein, as others previously stated. Despite the sequence similarity between SMP 30 and a serum paraoxonase (PON), the inability of SMP 30 to hydrolyze PON-specific substrates such as paraoxon, <b>dihydrocoumarin,</b> γ-nonalactone, and δ-dodecanolactone indicate that SMP 30 is distinct from the PON family. We previously established SMP 30 knockout mice and have now tested DFPase activity in their livers. The livers from wild-type mice contained readily detectable DFPase activity, whereas no such enzyme activity was found in livers from SMP 30 knockout mice. Moreover, the hepatocytes of SMP 30 knockout mice were far more susceptible to DFP-induced cytotoxicity than those from the wild-type. These results indicate that SMP 30 is a unique DFP hydrolyzing enzyme in the liver and has an important detoxification effect on DFP.

Earlier studies on the toxicology of organophosphate pesticides revealed that having low serum PON 1 activity increases the senstivity to the acute effects of organophosphate compounds. Following determination of the sequence of the gene encoding PON 1, identification of polymorphisms that lead to differences among people in the activity and level of expression of the enzyme, led to the idea that people with low PON 1 activity may be more sensitive to organophosphate poisoning. In studies carried out in recent years, it was shown that injection of purified PON 1 to animals that are exposed to organophosphate pesticides, and thus increasing serum PON 1 levels artificially, it was possible to reduce the toxic effects of certain organophosphates like chlorpyrifos and diazinon; but this application was observed to be ineffective against parathion exposure. Even though recognized as the enzyme that hydrolyzes paraoxon, paraoxonase activity of PON 1 is a bit weak. In studies carried out in recent years, it was observed that injection of purified PON 1 protects against chlorpyrifos and diazinon but was not effective against parathion exposure. In order {{to be used as a}} prophylactic agent against organophosphate exposure, PON 1 ’s catalytic efficiency has to be increased and the enzyme has to be obtained in adequate amounts. In recent years, using protein engineering methods, changes were made to some amino acids of PON 1, these PON 1 variants were expressed in bacterial systems at sufficient levels and increase in enzyme activity against some organophosphates were obtained. In this review, first, general aspects of organophosphates, action mechanism and poisonings are addressed; then, the role of PON 1 in organophosphate metabolism and recent advances in the research intended for improving PON 1 so that it can be used as an antidote in organophosphate poisonings are empasized...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{and genetic}} factors {{influence}} epigenetic states and affect cellular processes. Environmental factors cause heritable changes in gene expression patterns by affecting regulators of epigenetic processes. The plant secondary metabolite <b>dihydrocoumarin</b> (DHC), which {{is produced in}} several botanicals and is commonly used as a food, tobacco, and cosmetic additive, inhibits the Sir 2 p/SIRT 1 family of NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases. In S. cerevisiae, Sir 2 p maintains silent chromatin at the HM loci, telomeres, and rDNA, whereas in mammals, SIRT 1 regulates gene expression and other cellular processes. DHC causes disassembly of silent chromatin leading to loss of silencing at reporter and endogenous genes. Examination of the bioavailability and digestive stability of DHC in vivo and in vitro revealed that DHC was unstable and converted to melilotic acid (MA), a less bioactive compound. DHC did not accumulate to high levels in most rat tissues and was cleared from the animals 6 hr after DHC was administered. MA was present in the blood plasma, interstitial fluid, and urine of the animal and DHC was not detected in these samples suggesting that the conversion of DHC to MA occurs rapidly in the animals and is potentially catalyzed by enzymes in the bloodstream. To confirm that lower concentration of DHC could inhibit Sir 2 p activity independent of DHC hydrolysis to MA, α-factor confrontation assays were performed in strains lacking the multidrug transporter PDR 5. ^ Genetic factors also influence epigenetic processes. Asf 1 p, a chromatin assembly factor required for H 3 K 56 ac by Rtt 109 p, binds H 3 /H 4 dimers. Deletion of ASF 1 leads to defects in silencing and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. These phenotypes are attributed to H 3 K 56 ac as strains lacking RTT 109 and H 3 K 56 R mutants have similar phenotypes to asf 1 δ strains. To separate genetically the role of Asf 1 p in chromatin assembly and H 3 K 56 ac from DNA damage repair and binding to Rad 53 p, mutations {{were made to the}} surface of histone H 3 that is bound by Asf 1 p. These mutations resulted in phenotypes that mimicked an asf 1 δ in all phenotypes tested except for H 3 K 56 ac. H 3 K 56 ac remained acetylated in all mutants tested, indicating that the H 3 -Asf 1 p interaction was not disrupted or the requirement for interaction between Asf 1 p and H 3 for H 3 K 56 ac had been bypassed in these mutants. These results appear to challenge the current understanding in the field as these phenotypes have previously been attributed to loss of H 3 K 56 ac. ^ Together, these two studies demonstrate the effects of a dietary factor, DHC, and genetic factors, Asf 1 p and H 3 /H 4, on epigenetic processes in the cell. ...|$|E
