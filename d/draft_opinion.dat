25|$|In his <b>draft</b> <b>opinion,</b> Jackson {{attributed}} sweeping {{powers to}} the President. He concluded that (1) the President has the inherent authority to create military tribunals, (2) this authority {{could not be}} regulated by Congress, and (3) this power was {{by virtue of his}} power as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{to his old}} role as Executive Secretary, Truesdale {{pushed the}} board to re-establish Rule 76–1, a {{procedural}} rule established by the Board in 1976. The rule required that, if {{three members of the}} Board had agreed to a <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> and no dissent had yet circulated, the opinion would be issued within two weeks if no dissent was circulated within that time. On September 30, Truesdale formally asked the Board to re-establish the rule, but the Board declined in favor of other approaches to improve the speed with which decisions were issued.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{analyzed}} {{both the}} history and purposes of the Articles of War {{to conclude that the}} Articles are not applicable to enemy combatants – rather, they were meant to protect U.S. civilians in times of military government. [...] Although it would seem that his <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> is at odds with his later views of the President's war powers, specifically in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer in which he interpreted Congress's ability to restrict the President's powers rather generously, there are substantive differences between the two cases. Youngstown concerned an exercise of presidential power in a domestic matter against civilians in an undeclared war. It was very different from the scenario present in Quirin, in which the President seized enemy combatants and did not address the internal functioning of the government.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the court}} issued a {{unanimous}} opinion in Quirin, {{the road to}} the final decision was marked by disagreement. Justice Douglas wrote that it was unfortunate that the court agreed to take the case. He stated that [...] "while it was easy to agree on the original per curiam, we almost fell apart when it came to write the views." [...] Chief Justice Stone, for his part, was very concerned with the court's reputation, specifically because he did not want the court to be perceived as just standing by while six men were executed. [...] He pushed for a unanimous opinion. [...] Despite Stone's views, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote a concurring <b>draft</b> <b>opinion,</b> expressing his disagreement with portions of the Court's opinion. [...] Over time, his concurring draft got longer and longer and evolved into a typewritten memorandum. [...] This memorandum was written two years before his dissent in Korematsu v. United States and a decade before his famous concurrence in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. [...] It provides insight into Jackson's views on the scope of the President's constitutional war powers.|$|E

50|$|The justice {{writing the}} opinion {{for the court}} will produce and {{circulate}} a <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> to the other justices. Each justice's law clerks {{may be involved in}} this phase. In modern Supreme Court history only a few justices, such as former Justice Antonin Scalia, have regularly written their own first drafts. Once the <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> has been reviewed, the remaining Justices may recommend changes to the opinion. Whether these changes are accommodated depends on the legal philosophy of the drafters as well as on how strong a majority the opinion garnered at conference. A justice may instead simply join the opinion at that point without comment.|$|E

25|$|Each Supreme Court justice hires several law Clerks {{to review}} {{petitions}} for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and <b>draft</b> <b>opinions.</b> Associate justices are allowed four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four.

50|$|The {{working method}} {{adopted by the}} Commission when {{providing}} opinions is to appoint a working group of rapporteurs (primarily from amongst its members) which advises national authorities {{in the preparation of}} the relevant law. After discussions with the national authorities and stakeholders in the country, the working group prepares a <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> on whether the legislative text meets the democratic standards in its field and on how to improve it on the basis of common experience. The <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> is discussed and adopted by the Venice Commission during a plenary session, usually in the presence of representatives from that country. After adoption, the opinion becomes public and is forwarded to the requesting body.|$|E

5000|$|According to Justice Liu, when a case {{is granted}} review, the Chief Justice assigns {{the case to}} a justice, who, after the parties finish briefing, then prepares a <b>draft</b> <b>opinion.</b> [...] Each justice writes a {{preliminary}} response to the <b>draft</b> <b>opinion,</b> and if the assigned justice is in the minority, she may ask the Chief Justice to reassign the case to someone in the majority. [...] The Court then hears oral arguments and, immediately afterwards, meet alone to vote. [...] The California Constitution requires suspension of the justices’ salaries if the Court fails to then file a decision within 90 days. The Court issues unanimous opinions in 77% of cases, compared to 43% by the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|E

50|$|Justice Jackson {{was in the}} {{hospital}} from March 30 to May 17, 1954. It is reported that Chief Justice Warren visited Jackson in {{the hospital}} several times, and discussed both Jackson’s <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> and Warren’s drafts. One suggestion that Warren took from Jackson was adding the following sentence: “Negroes have achieved outstanding success in the arts and sciences, {{as well as in the}} business and professional world.” This quote is tied to the arguments in Part 4 of Jackson’s <b>draft</b> <b>opinion.</b> On May 17, 1954, Jackson went to the Court from the hospital, so that he could be there the day that the Brown decision was handed down. When the Brown decision was handed down, a full court was present, to emphasize the unanimity of the decision. Robert H. Jackson died on October 9, 1954, and so there was not enough time between Brown and the death of Jackson to fully explore his views on desegregation.|$|E

[...] "Writing to Boskey about the Fifth and Sixth Amendments challenge..., Stone {{admitted}} that 'I think statement in the <b>draft</b> <b>opinion</b> is right but my authorities are meager.'" [...] With a creative flair, Boskey proposed to Stone the so-called [...] "satisfactory alternative method" [...] to give the Court the standing to review the Saboteurs Case.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the common}} law, {{judicial}} opinions themselves have legal effect through {{the rule of}} stare decisis. But because of their crushing caseloads (about 200 matters per justice per year), the courts of appeal are permitted to take the shortcut of selecting only the best opinions for publication. This way, they can <b>draft</b> <b>opinions</b> fast and quickly dispose {{of the vast majority}} of cases, without worrying that they are accidentally making bad law. About 7% of their opinions are ultimately selected for publication and become part of California law.|$|R

However, in <b>drafting</b> <b>opinions,</b> the Chief Justice enjoys additional influence in case disposition if in the majority through his power to assign who writes the opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The Chief Justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other Justices do not and is paid slightly more ($255,500 per year for the Chief Justice and $244,400 per year for each Associate Justice).|$|R
