50|$|Annuity {{contracts}} in the United States {{are defined by}} the Internal Revenue Code and regulated by the individual states. Variable annuities have features of both life <b>insurance</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>products.</b> In the U.S., annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies, although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to non-profits to reduce taxes. Insurance companies are regulated by the states, so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others. Their federal tax treatment, however, is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. Variable annuities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms {{doing business in the}} United States).|$|R
40|$|Using {{data for}} the life {{insurance}} industry during 1990 - 1995, we empirically test for a relationship between a firm's output choice and measures of X-efficiency. Our empirical evidence suggests that diversification across multiple <b>insurance</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>product</b> lines resulted in greater X-efficiency than a more focused production strategy. The analysis {{in this article is}} consistent with the proposition that managers of multiproduct firms are able to achieve greater cost efficiencies than their counterparts in more focused firms by sharing inputs and efficiently allocating resources across product lines in response to changing industry conditions. Our findings are important since they justify the existence of multiproduct firms in the absence of cost complementarities and identify product diversification as a source of efficiency in the life insurance industry that should be recognized by managers, policyholders, and regulators.

40|$|Numerous <b>insurance</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>products</b> {{offered by}} the private {{financial}} industry contain embedded investment guarantees. In these products the contributions are invested on the capital market, which involves investment risk for the client. To protect the contribution payers against this risk the modern pension frames include performance guarantees. It is important that these guarantees are priced correctly because improper pricing and provision policy may lead to bankruptcy. This paper proposes a pricing model for maturity guarantees embedded in retirement saving plans. A deterministic guaranteed rate of return and periodic contributions are considered. Since maturity guarantees have long-term character, an approach is needed that models the long-run behaviour of the market prices of securities. For this reason this paper uses the geometric Brownian motion with Markov switching. For guarantee pricing WEBB’s (2003) option pricing for Markov switching model is applied, {{which is based on}} the Esscher transform. The second part of the paper analyses the risk of shortfall in respect to three shortfall risk measures: the shortfall probability, the shortfall expectation and the mean expected loss...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone marketing is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, <b>insurance,</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>products,</b> say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, <b>investments,</b> and <b>insurance</b> parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to non-financial services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|R

50|$|In the 1980s, one of South Africa’s {{oldest and}} largest {{financial}} services companies, Old Mutual, began an expansion drive in Europe, the United States, and Asia.Although it had opened an office in Southern Rhodesia in 1927, Old Mutual was not particularly active {{in the rest of}} sub-Saharan Africa. Makamba realised that the combination of Old Mutual’s new focus on expansion and its lack of penetration of the African market represented an enormous business opportunity.During the 1980s Makamba became a consultant, selling <b>insurance</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>products</b> to individuals and organisations on behalf of Old Mutual. Within a record eight months in 1980, he had generated one million American dollars’ worth of sales. According to research, most of the top insurance consultants globally reach the one million dollar target only in their 30 months in the business. As a consequence of his feat, Makamba qualified {{as a member of the}} Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT)Known as the premier association of financial professionals, the MDRT is an international, independent association of nearly 38,000 of the world's leading life insurance and financial services professionals from more than 450 companies in 79 countries.

40|$|Credit life insurance, which repays {{some or all}} of a borrower's {{outstanding}} debt in the event of death, has been a controversial subject for many years. Critics assert that, despite regulations that limit tied sales, pressure on loan officers to generate fee income through cross selling creates an incentive for coercion of borrowers. Allegedly, some sales techniques leave the consumer with the false impression that the purchase of credit insurance was necessary to obtain the loan. This article measures the frequency with which creditor efforts to sell credit insurance transform the sales message from persuasive to coercive. A methodology is developed for measuring the impact of coercive selling pressure applied to borrowers at the point of sale. Data used to measure the effect of coercive pressure are taken from an extensive survey of borrowers conducted during 1993. Not only are public policy concerns about coercion in the selling of credit insurance addressed, but more generally the article offers a methodology to quantify the influence of the customer's point-of-sale experience on the decision to purchase any financial service. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Financial institutions in recent years have become a smorgasbord of deposit, transaction, loan, <b>insurance,</b> and <b>investment</b> <b>products.</b> It has become axiomatic for banks and credit unions that survival against nonbank competitors requires establishing additional relationships with existing depositors through the cross selling of other products.
