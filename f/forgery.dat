5|$|After {{the trial}} it was {{revealed}} that Nazir had previously been cautioned for using threatening behaviour in 1999 and fined for resisting arrest. The two Labour politicians, Akhtar and Choudhary, who provided Ali's references were later jailed themselves for <b>forgery</b> in relation to vote rigging.|$|E
5|$|The authors detail {{commonly}} used disinformation tactics by the Soviet intelligence agencies, including <b>forgery</b> as covert operation {{in order to}} fool target dupes into believing such fabricated documents were real. Additionally, the writers explain how Soviet covert spies were able to bring agents of influence into their fold and do their bidding, whether knowingly or through social influence as a useful idiot.|$|E

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a <b>forgery.</b> Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} {{cited as a}} source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire Life is a <b>forgery,</b> written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>forgeries</b> {{were often}} {{produced}} in small sheets of 25, {{which are still}} sometimes found complete. Many old stamp collections include Spiro <b>forgeries</b> due to their wide distribution and a greater acceptance of <b>forgeries</b> as [...] "space fillers" [...] before 1900.|$|R

50|$|During {{his long}} {{association}} with the International Society for Japanese Philately, Tyler co-authored a number of monographs on forged Japanese stamps: <b>Forgeries</b> and Imitations of the Dragon Stamps of Japan, in 1971, The Wada Cherry Blossom <b>Forgeries,</b> in 1974, and The Koban <b>Forgeries</b> of Japan in 1979.|$|R
5|$|Critics of {{evolution}} commonly appeal to past scientific hoaxes {{such as the}} Piltdown Man <b>forgery.</b> It is argued that because scientists have been mistaken and deceived in the past about evidence for various aspects {{of evolution}}, the current evidence for evolution is likely to also be based on fraud and error. Much of the evidence for evolution {{has been accused of}} being fraudulent at various times, including Archaeopteryx, peppered moth melanism, and Darwin's finches; these claims have been subsequently refuted.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} in a political controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, with instructions to investigate Alan Durward's claim to the earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a <b>forgery</b> on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals had seized power. During the months preceding this denunciation, Albin was once again out of Scotland; on 4 March 1257 his presence was once again recorded at Durham.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who {{founded the}} very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred. Eormenred was the older of the two, and may have held the title of regulus, perhaps {{implying}} that he held the junior kingship of Kent. He appears to have died before his father, leaving Eorcenberht to inherit the throne. An additional son, Ecgfrith, is mentioned in a charter of Eadbald's, but the charter is a <b>forgery,</b> probably dating from the eleventh century.|$|E

5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to <b>forgery</b> than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a <b>forgery</b> are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E
5|$|Fraud and <b>forgery</b> are {{described}} in detail; in particular coin counterfeiting by mixing copper with silver, or even admixture with iron. Tests had been developed for counterfeit coins and proved very popular with the victims, mostly ordinary people. He deals with the liquid metal mercury, also found in silver mines. He records that it is toxic, and amalgamates with gold, so is used for refining and extracting that metal. He says mercury is used for gilding copper, while antimony is found in silver mines and is used as an eyebrow cosmetic.|$|E
5000|$|Many <b>forgeries</b> still escape detection; Han van Meegeren, {{possibly}} the most famous forger of the 20th century, used historical canvasses for his Vermeer <b>forgeries</b> and created his own pigments {{to ensure that they}} were authentic. He confessed to creating the <b>forgeries</b> only after he was charged with treason, an offense which carried the death penalty. So masterful were his <b>forgeries</b> that van Meegeren was forced to create another [...] "Vermeer" [...] while under police guard, to prove himself innocent of the treason charges.|$|R
2500|$|Wise {{became a}} noted bibliographer, collector, forger, and thief. [...] He parlayed his {{international}} {{reputation as a}} collector of books and an exposer of forgers and <b>forgeries</b> into a career in creating and selling <b>forgeries.</b> He privately printed nearly 300 works of English authors, {{some of which were}} debunked as <b>forgeries</b> by Carter and Pollard.|$|R
50|$|Pierre Grassou de Fougères is {{a mediocre}} painter who lives off {{painting}} <b>forgeries</b> commissioned {{by an old}} swindler and art-dealer named Elias Magus.

Magus resells these <b>forgeries</b> for a large profit {{to members of the}} Petite bourgeoisie who are incapable of appreciating good art.|$|R
5|$|In 1191, monks at {{the abbey}} {{claimed to have}} found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere {{to the south of}} the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of {{contemporary}} historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious <b>forgery</b> to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury's foundation, and increase its renown.|$|E
5|$|In {{defense of}} the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} that the language itself offered no evidence of <b>forgery.</b> King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a <b>forgery</b> by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about {{the authenticity of the}} work.|$|E
5000|$|In the 16th century, imitators of Albrecht Dürer's {{style of}} printmaking {{improved}} {{the market for}} their own prints by signing them [...] "AD", making them <b>forgeries.</b> In the 20th century the art market made <b>forgeries</b> highly profitable. There are widespread <b>forgeries</b> of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, and Henri Matisse.|$|R

50|$|Knowledge is an {{important}} tool in helping to detect fakes and <b>forgeries.</b> A person {{who is able to}} identify some of the most obvious <b>forgeries</b> can save {{a lot of money in}} expertising fees, though the information may not yet be enough to establish that a stamp is genuine. Earee's Album Weeds, and Serrane's Vade Mecum are only two books in the vast literature about stamp <b>forgeries.</b>|$|R
5|$|Radiocarbon dating {{determined}} that the papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner widely believed to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern <b>forgery</b> written on a scrap of medieval papyrus.|$|E
5|$|The Mar Saba {{letter was}} {{attributed}} to Clement by Morton Smith, but there remains much debate today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph or a modern <b>forgery.</b> If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} was legitimised by {{the provisions}} of the Papal Bull Laudabiliter, issued by Adrian IV in 1155. The bull encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system. Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of Laudabiliter, and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a <b>forgery.</b>|$|E
