The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{included}} two overarching objectives. Through a systematic {{review of the}} literature published between 1990 and 2012, the first objective aimed to assess whether <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured would result in higher costs compared to <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>insured.</b> Studies that quantified the actual costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured in the U. S. were included. Based upon 2009 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the second objective aimed to assess and compare the self-reported health of populations with four different insurance statuses. The second part of this study involved a secondary data analysis of both currently insured and currently uninsured individuals who participated in the MEPS in 2009. The null hypothesis was that there were no differences across the four categories of health insurance status for self-reported health status and healthcare service use. The alternative hypothesis was that were differences across the four categories of health insurance status for self-reported health status and healthcare service use. Methods: For the systematic review, three databases were searched using search terms to identify studies that actually quantified <b>the</b> cost of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured. Thirteen studies were selected, discussed, and summarized in tables. For the secondary data analysis of MEPS data, this study compared four categories of health insurance status: (1) currently uninsured persons who will become eligible for Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) healthcare reforms in 2014; (2) currently uninsured persons who will be required to buy private insurance through the PPACA health insurance exchanges in 2014; (3) persons currently insured under Medicaid or SCHIP; and (4) persons currently insured with private insurance. The four categories were compared on the basis of demographic information, health status information, and health conditions with relatively high prevalence. Chi-square tests were run to determine if there were differences between the four groups in regard to health insurance status and health status. With some exceptions, <b>the</b> two currently <b>insured</b> groups had worse self-reported health status compared to the two currently uninsured groups. Results: The thirteen studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review included: (1) three cost studies from 1993, 1995, and 1997; (2) four cost studies from 2001, 2003, and 2004; (3) one study of disabilities and one study of immigrants; (4) two state specific studies of uninsured status; and (5) two current studies of healthcare reform. Of the thirteen studies reviewed, four directly addressed the study question about whether <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured was more or less expensive than <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>insured.</b> All four of the studies provided support for the study finding that <b>the</b> cost of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured would generally not be higher than insuring those already insured. One study indicated that <b>the</b> cost of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured would be less expensive than <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> population currently covered by Medicaid, but more expensive to <b>insure</b> than <b>the</b> populations of those covered by employer-sponsored insurance and non-group private insurance. While the nine other studies included in the systematic review discussed the costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured population, they did not directly compare <b>the</b> costs of <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured population with the costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently <b>insured</b> population. For <b>the</b> MEPS secondary data analysis, the results of the chi-square tests indicated that there were differences in the distribution of disease status by health insurance status. As anticipated, with some exceptions, the uninsured reported lower rates of disease and healthcare service use. However, for the variable attention deficit disorder, the uninsured reported higher disease rates than <b>the</b> two <b>insured</b> groups. Additionally, for the variables high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and joint pain, <b>the</b> currently <b>insured</b> under Medicaid or SCHIP group reported a lower rate of disease than <b>the</b> two currently <b>insured</b> groups. This result {{may be due to the}} lower mean age of <b>the</b> currently <b>insured</b> under Medicaid or SCHIP group. Conclusion: Based on this study, with some exceptions, <b>the</b> costs for <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured should not exceed healthcare-related costs for <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> currently uninsured. The results of the systematic review indicated that the U. S. is already paying some of the costs associated with <b>insuring</b> <b>the</b> uninsured. PPACA will expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans who are currently uninsured, as the individual mandate and insurance market reforms will require. Because many of the currently uninsured are relatively healthy young persons, the costs associated with expanding insurance coverage to the uninsured are anticipated to be relatively modest. However, for the purposes of construing these results, it is important to note that once individuals obtain insurance, it is anticipated that they will use more healthcare services, which will increase costs.

5000|$|The duty {{to settle}} is of {{greatest}} import in the scenario where <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> {{may have some}} liability exposure (i.e., {{there is some evidence}} apparently linking <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> to <b>the</b> plaintiff's alleged injuries), the plaintiff has evidence of substantial damages which may exceed policy limits, and the plaintiff makes a settlement demand (either to <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> or directly to a defending insurer) which equals or exceeds policy limits. In that situation, the insurer's interests conflict with the insured's interests, because the insurer has an incentive to not immediately settle. That is, if the insurer refuses to settle and the case then goes to trial, there are only two possible outcomes: (1) <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> loses and <b>the</b> insurer must pay the ensuing judgment against <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> up to <b>the</b> policy limits, or (2) <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> wins, meaning both <b>the</b> <b>insured</b> and <b>the</b> insurer bear no liability. If the first outcome occurs, then it is essentially [...] "nothing gained nothing lost" [...] from the insurer's point of view, because either way it will pay out its policy limits.
