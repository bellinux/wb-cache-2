5|$|Many of the Vietnamese {{evacuees}} {{were allowed}} to enter the United States under the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act. The 1975 Act appropriated $455million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of Indochinese refugees. In all, 130,000 Vietnamese refugees came to the United States in 1975. Thousands more escaped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from {{his first year in}} Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|Alaska senator Ernest Gruening {{remained}} a staunch backer {{of the project}} from its inception to its cancellation, {{and made it a}} major personal political priority. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most of the Alaska Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the project. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization. Among the group's members was Ted Stevens, who was appointed in 1968 as one of Alaska's representatives to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress {{to finally}} build the Fort Circle Drive, many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly {{questioning}} whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness. After all, by this time, Washington had grown past {{the ring of}} forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, Lajjun was {{replaced}} by Jenin as the administrative capital of the sanjak which now included the Sanjak of Ajlun. By the 19th century it was renamed Sanjak Jenin, although Ajlun was separated from it. Zahir al-Umar, who became the effective ruler of the Galilee {{for a short period}} {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, was reported to have used cannons against Lajjun in the course of his campaign between 1771-1773 to capture Nablus. It is possible that this attack led to the village's decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed. By that time, Lajjun's influence was diminished by the increasing strength of Acre's political power and Nablus's economic muscle.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's {{political}} career began in 1969, {{as an intern}} for Congressman William A. Steiger during the Richard Nixon Administration. He then joined the staff of Donald Rumsfeld, who was then Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity from 1969–70. He held several positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the US Justice Department, that the Ford administration could use to limit damage from an article, published by The New York Times, in which investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications {{as part of a}} highly classified program, Operation Ivy Bells.|$|E
5|$|Gatorade, {{now owned}} by PepsiCo, is today sold in some eighty {{countries}} and over fifty various flavors. In contrast to the forty-three dollars that Cade and his team spent {{to make the first}} experimental batch of Gatorade in 1965, Gatorade prompted the evolution of a multibillion-dollar sports drink industry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed; as of 2007, over seven billion bottles of Gatorade were being sold annually in the United States. While he was surprised by its commercial success as a sports drink, Cade took greater pride in Gatorade's use in hospitals, in post-operative recovery and to treat diarrhea-related dehydration in infants and young children. Cade's other research included hypertension, exercise physiology, autism, schizophrenia and kidney disease. His research into carbo-loading substantiated the early claims of Swedish researchers, and he also invented a hydraulic football helmet that substantially reduced the risk of concussion to football players.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} {{the completion of}} the fort, numerous telegraph lines were laid between Fort Corcoran, War Department offices in Washington, and other forts in Northern Virginia. According to a July 1863 report on the operations of the military telegraphs in the Army of the Potomac, six telegraph lines ran between Fort Corcoran and Washington, five between Corcoran and Fort Ethan Allen, two between Corcoran and Alexandria, and one each to two observation points southwest of the fort. Throughout the remainder of the war, Fort Corcoran remained an important communications center for the entire Arlington Line system of defenses, eventually connecting to over 30miles of telegraph wire at the time of Robert E. Lee's surrender.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} {{the creation of}} Anarky, both Norm Breyfogle and Alan Grant experienced changes in their personal and professional lives which they attributed to that collaboration. Each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding. In particular, their time developing the Anarky series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate, discussion, and mutual respect.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities in November 1918 the role of the AN in the former German colonies in New Guinea had become primarily one of civil administration, although it continued to provide a garrison for the next two and a half years.

Despite the AN having seen no further action {{following the}} initial seizure of the colony, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed the climate and a range of tropical diseases, such as malaria, had resulted in dozens of fatalities before the deployment concluded.

5|$|Opera, as {{a musical}} and {{theatrical}} genre, {{began to emerge}} during {{the early part of}} Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> followed. At some point, {{the section of the}} highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a corduroy road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E
5|$|The French and Indian War (1754–1763) {{led to the}} {{migration}} of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin.
