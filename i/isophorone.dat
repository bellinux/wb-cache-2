25|$|Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic {{isocyanates}} {{are used}} in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend to darken on exposure to light. The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (<b>isophorone</b> diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI).|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol {{is used as}} a {{protecting}} {{group for}} carbonyl groups in organic synthesis. Treating a ketone or aldehyde with ethylene glycol in the presence of an acid catalyst (e.g., p-toluenesulfonic acid; BF3·Et2O) gives the corresponding a 1,3-dioxolane, which is resistant to bases and other nucleophiles. The 1,3-dioxolane protecting group can thereafter be removed by further acid hydrolysis. In this example, <b>isophorone</b> was protected using ethylene glycol with p-toluenesulfonic acid in moderate yield. Water was removed by azeotropic distillation to shift the equilibrium to the right.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogenation is {{a useful}} means for {{converting}} unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. [...] Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. [...] Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene, {{can be converted to}} alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, <b>isophorone</b> diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer <b>isophorone</b> diisocyanate, is produced from <b>isophorone</b> nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.|$|E
2500|$|Isocyanates {{are very}} {{reactive}} materials. This makes them useful in making polymers but also requires special care in handling and use. [...] The aromatic isocyanates, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are more reactive than aliphatic isocyanates, such as hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) or <b>isophorone</b> diisocyanate (IPDI). Most of the isocyanates are difunctional, that {{is they have}} exactly two isocyanate groups per molecule. An important exception to this is polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate, which {{is a mixture of}} molecules with two, three, and four or more isocyanate groups. In cases like this the material has an average functionality greater than two, commonly 2.7.|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, Kharash {{discovered}} that Grignard reagents add to cyclohexenone in presence of Cu(I) resulting in 1,4-addition instead of 1,2-addition. [...] This work foreshadowed extensive {{studies on the}} conjugate additions to enones with organocuprates. Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition. The 1,4-addition mechanism of cuprates to enones goes through the nucleophilic addition of the Cu(I) species at the beta-carbon of the alkene to form a Cu(III) intermediate, followed by reductive elimination of Cu(I). In the original paper describing this reaction, methylmagnesium bromide is reacted with <b>isophorone</b> with and without 1 mole percent of added copper(I) chloride (see figure).|$|E

50|$|<b>Isophorone</b> is not {{naturally}} available. Various {{techniques are}} available for obtaining <b>isophorone.</b> The most common and used method includes an self-condensation of acetone with KOH. For this reaction a dehydrogenated acetone allows {{one of the side}} faced carbon atoms to attack the central carbon atom (the carbonyl carbon) of another acetone molecule. Hereby a diacetone alcohol (4-hydroxy-4-methylpentan-2-one)(1) forms. A follow up dehydration reaction of diacetone alcohol yields (mesityl oxide)(2) and the rest product, water. Dehydrogenated acetone is then able to further react via an addition reaction with mesityl oxide (Michael reaction) to 4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxoheptan-1-ide (3), which successively attacks its own carbonyl carbon to form 3-hydroxy-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexan-1-one(4).
