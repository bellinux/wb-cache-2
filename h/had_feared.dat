5|$|When {{it became}} clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as the emperor <b>had</b> <b>feared,</b> his next step was to choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh. Though he {{was made}} a lieutenant-general, both of British and Hanoverian forces, he {{remained}} in England, and, with {{a seat in the}} House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views, and soon became a leader of the right of the party. King George <b>had</b> <b>feared</b> that Ernest, like some of his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which {{led to the formation of}} the Addington Government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy developed. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.|$|E

5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's near-miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth if it were to hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by nine feet (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she <b>had</b> <b>feared</b> for her safety.|$|E
5|$|Their embittered {{season ended}} as many pundits <b>had</b> <b>feared.</b> In the Japanese Grand Prix {{at the end}} of lap 46, Senna made his move at the Casino Chicane. Prost, turning into the corner, turned into his teammate's path {{resulting}} in a collision and the cars sliding interlocked down the escape road. Prost, thinking the World Championship was over, climbed out of his stalled car. To separate the cars, the marshals pushed Senna's McLaren backwards onto the track. This left it in a dangerous position, so they pushed it forwards again. As they did so, Senna bump-started the engine. He drove through the chicane and rejoined. The nose of his car was damaged and he had to pit, but he rejoined only five seconds behind the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini. On lap 50, Ayrton sliced past Nannini at the chicane to take the lead and won the race. But it was Nannini who appeared on the top step of the podium, race officials having excluded Senna for missing the chicane. McLaren appealed the decision, but the FIA Court of Appeal not only upheld the decision but fined Senna US$100,000 and gave him a suspended six-month ban. Thus Prost clinched his third driver's title in controversial circumstances.|$|E

30|$|An {{exemplification}} of foundationalism {{could be}} a consideration of person x towards her sister x*. Person x* is the twin sister of x and so x believes, since she is a normal human being with fears, hopes and wishes, that her sister for her part <b>has</b> <b>fears,</b> hopes and wishes, too. According to that, person x could be pretty sure {{about the fact that}} person x* will <b>have</b> <b>fears,</b> hopes and wishes for the future, which is a properly justified belief about the future. On that foundation, person x could act to improve her sister’s wellbeing in the future, e.g., train her in playing hockey. The important thing is that because she has a basic belief about her sister <b>having</b> <b>fears,</b> hopes and wishes, she could form a non-basic but justified belief about the future.|$|R

25|$|On {{the night}} of June 12, Grant again {{advanced}} by his left flank, marching to the James River. He was able to disguise his intentions from Lee, and his army crossed the river on a bridge of pontoons that stretched over 2,100 feet (640 m).

25|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{was also a}} lot worse than FitzGerald <b>had</b> <b>feared.</b> Fine Gael had to jettison its plans for tax cuts {{in the run-up to the}} election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's shock defeat in Dáil Éireann on the evening of 27 January 1982.|$|E

However since 1858 the West of Fife company <b>had</b> <b>feared</b> an incursion by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, which had proposed {{a line from}} North Queensferry; if successful, such a line would seriously reduce the profitability of the West of Fife company, and consideration was given to a merger with the North British Railway.|$|E

25|$|Pintarić was {{captured}} on 20 January 1974. The police learned of his whereabouts and surrounded {{the house in}} which he was hiding. After brief negotiations, Pintarić surrendered without resistance. He was tried for two murders, an attempted murder, and endangering his neighbors by shooting at their homes. He admitted the crimes, but pleaded not guilty, arguing that he was provoked into murder while intoxicated. On 18 November 1974 he was pronounced guilty and sentenced to death, an outcome Pintarić <b>had</b> <b>feared</b> the most. However, to his relief, this was quickly commuted to 20 years imprisonment, the maximum prison term under the law.|$|E
25|$|The defendants' radical {{politics}} {{may have}} played a role in the verdict. Judge Thayer, though a sworn enemy of anarchists, warned the defense against bringing anarchism into the trial. Yet defense attorney Fred Moore felt he had to call both Sacco and Vanzetti as witnesses to let them explain why they were fully armed when arrested. Both men testified that they had been rounding up radical literature when apprehended, and that they <b>had</b> <b>feared</b> another government deportation raid. Yet both hurt their case with rambling discourses on radical politics that the prosecution mocked. The prosecution also brought out that both men had fled the draft by going to Mexico in 1917.|$|E

Since neither of the two had been declared fit they had not undergone official doping tests. However, Pakistani officials told cricket sources off the record that the team management <b>had</b> <b>feared</b> that they would fail the doping tests as it was likely traces of Nandrolone were still present in their system.|$|E
