5|$|Due to sea ice {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E

5|$|Plaque of Martyrs – The plaque {{came into}} being as the seal {{for the city of}} Lichfield. The disputed story of 999 Christian martyrs who were killed by the Romans under pagan Emperor Diocletian in Lichfield in 288 CE is {{depicted}} in the stonework of the monument. It was located {{on the front of the}} Guildhall until, in 1744 during the Victorian restoration of the Guildhall the plaque was taken down a placed in storage. It emerged again in 1864, when it was moved to a rockery on the eastern side of the Museum Gardens.

5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} a second one as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump {{through a series of}} seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bottomless pit causes death; running out of lives incurs a game over screen.|$|E

In 1701 Ursúa y Arezmendi realised that the road {{was in such a}} poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucatán. He wrote to the King of Spain, requesting that Petén be transferred from the jurisdiction of Yucatán to the Audiencia Real of Guatemala. In 1703 Ursúa's petition was granted, with the condition that the ecclesiastical authority over Petén would pass to the Dominican Order.|$|E

5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, in Hidalgo, about 100families {{required}} evacuation {{across the}} municipalities of Tlanchinol and Orizatlán due to heavy rain, with 7.09in (180.1mm) recorded in the latter. The rainfall triggered more than 80landslides statewide, and two {{were killed in a}} rockslide near the town of Jacala. Swollen rivers in El Arenal and Huejutla caused two drownings. Total damage from Arlene reached Mex$2.6billion (US$207.4million) across Hidalgo. In response, the state government allocated a total Mex$17million (US$1.45million) for rehabilitation works. Downpours in the state of Puebla triggered landslides that cut off roads to traffic. Toppled trees struck a home in the municipality of Zihuateutla, killing its inhabitant. In Tlacotepec municipality, a girl was left missing after <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rushing stream; by July4, officials confirmed she had drowned. After hours of prolonged rainfall, concerns arose over the potential overflow of a dam in the municipality of Tlatlauquitepec. Three houses sustained damage in Eloxochitlán as a consequence of excessively saturated soils, and another collapsed in Atempan. Elsewhere in Puebla, mud and flood waters reached 1.6ft (0.5m) in a school after a nearby river overflowed.|$|E

5|$|In 695, al-Hajjaj {{entrusted}} Ibn al-Ash'ath with 6,000 horsemen and {{the campaign}} against the Kharijite rebels under Shabib ibn Yazid ibn Nu'aym al-Shaybani. Although not large, this group benefited from Shabib's tactical skill and inflicted a number of defeats on Umayyad forces. Advised by the general al-Jazl Uthman ibn Sa'id, Ibn al-Ash'ath pursued the Kharijites but displayed great caution {{in order to avoid}} <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> trap. As a result, the governor of al-Mada'in, Uthman ibn Qatan, wrote to al-Hajjaj criticizing Ibn al-Ash'ath's leadership. Al-Hajjaj responded by giving command to Uthman, but when the latter attacked Shabib, the Umayyad army suffered a heavy defeat, losing around 900 men and fleeing to Kufa; Uthman himself was killed, while Ibn al-Ash'ath, who lost his horse, managed to escape {{with the help of a}} friend and reached Kufa after an eventful journey. There he remained in hiding until al-Hajjaj granted him pardon.|$|E
5|$|In San Blas, {{strong winds}} from the {{hurricane}} {{damaged or destroyed}} 95% of the homes, with 1,540houses damaged and 8,800people affected. There, large commercial shrimp boats were swept up to 900feet (275m) inland from their docks. An elderly woman died in the city when the wall of her house collapsed on her. Large portions of the city were covered with building debris and sand washed from the ocean. Elsewhere in Nayarit, flying debris killed a person in Santiago Escuintla. There, two elderly men drowned, one by <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> river. Both were {{believed to have been}} killed during the storm as they fled their homes.

5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E

As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha tries {{to catch them}} but fails; <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> lake, he faces a near-death {{experience}} and learns about his past life in 1609. In that year, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha), commander of the Udayghad army. King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back. Her cousin, Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in battle, {{and he does not}} wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhirava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Homer stays true to {{his word}} and remains calm. However, his new calm {{demeanor}} has taken away Bart's inspiration for his cartoon, so Bart and Milhouse set up a trap for Homer to trigger another outburst.

Homer reaches home and happens upon Bart's trap, but he keeps his calm throughout its run, causing lumps to develop on his neck. The trap ends with Homer <b>falling</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pool full of green paint, prompting him to go berserk and storm through town. The police restrain him and Homer is admitted to the hospital. Dr. Hibbert arrives and tells Marge that Bart actually saved Homer's life by enraging him.
