5|$|About {{forty years}} after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was {{established}} on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203, {{which suggests that}} Ragnall may {{have been responsible for}} its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald. Be that as it may, there is no hard evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred, such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles. However, the price <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.|$|E
5|$|As a newly {{inducted}} {{member of}} the Scions, the player follows Thancred to Thanalan to investigate abductions and the theft of crystals along trade routes in the area. The culprits {{are members of the}} Amalj'aa beast tribe who capture the adventurer to be sacrificed to their primal god, Ifrit. The attempt fails as the Echo protects the player from Ifrit's brainwashing. The adventurer counters by defeating Ifrit and is hailed as a hero, with emissaries from all three Grand Companies jockeying <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> recruiting said hero. While attending rallies at each of the three cities honoring the memory of those fallen at Carteneau, the player meets the twins Alphinaud and Alisaie who question the purpose of such nationalist displays. The adventurer's next mission is to forge relations with the Sylphs of the Black Shroud, a peaceful beast tribe whose radical sect once summoned Ramuh to defend the forest from Garlean incursion. While searching for the Sylph elder, the player encounters Lahabrea for the first time—an immortal Ascian bent on destroying the Mothercrystal. The Scions, Thancred in particular, resolve to investigate this new foe.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{smuggling}} of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century AD Byzantine historian Menander Protector wrote {{of how the}} Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sasanian Persian ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Istämi, the Göktürk ruler of the Turkic Khaganate, was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sasanian king of kings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> travelling through Persian territories to trade with the Byzantines. Istämi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sasanian king, the latter had {{the members of the}} embassy killed by poison. Maniakh, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istämi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 AD and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also an alliance against Sasanian Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy under Zemarchus to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.|$|E

25|$|In a {{milestone}} {{for the process}} of the free elections, Casimir's nephew, Louis I of Hungary, became king after the agreement between him, Casimir III the Great and the Polish nobility (Privilege of Buda). Louis had no sons, which created another dilemma for the succession of the Polish throne. In an attempt to secure the throne of Poland for his line, he gathered the nobles and sought their approval to have one of his daughters retained as the queen regnant of Poland in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Privilege</b> <b>of</b> Koszyce (1374).|$|E
25|$|This {{percolation}} {{of architectural}} style was {{not confined to}} private houses, but to civic architecture too: an illustrious architect added to civic pride; and when an architect was too expensive for the civic coffers, {{for a fraction of}} the price he would judge a competition between local architects, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> designing a town hall or church. This is exactly what happened in Aylesbury. John Vanbrugh judged two sets of plans for the County Hall (now Aylesbury Crown Court).

25|$|In the Eastern provinces, {{cultural}} precedent ensured a {{rapid and}} geographically widespread dissemination of cult, extending {{as far as}} the Augustan military settlement at modern-day Najran. Considered as a whole, these provinces present the Empire's broadest and most complex syntheses of imperial and native cult, funded through private and public initiatives and ranging from the god-like honours due a living patron to what Harland (2003) interprets as privately funded communal mystery rites. The Greek cities of Roman Asia competed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> building high-status Imperial cult centres (neocorates). Ephesus and Sardis, ancient rivals, had two apiece until the early 3rd century AD, when Ephesus was allowed an additional temple, to the reigning emperor Caracalla.

25|$|When {{he assumed}} sole {{control of the}} Roman empire in 30 BC, the emperor Augustus {{was faced with a}} {{pressing}} strategic anomaly. Although Rome had subjugated all Gaul up to the Rhine and much of Illyricum, the Alpine region which separated these possessions from Italy and from each other remained outside Roman control and in the hands of independent mountain tribes. These were warlike and troublesome, alternately attacking and robbing transient Roman troops and supply convoys or exacting exorbitant tolls from them <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> using the key Alpine mountain passes e.g. the Salassi, who reportedly ambushed Julius Caesar on one occasion by hurling rocks on his army, charged Messalla extortionate fees for supplies and forced the escaping murderer of Caesar Decimus Brutus to pay a toll of one denarius per man to allow his army to cross the Great St Bernard Pass in 43 BC. That Rome's overland communications with its transalpine territories should be thus held to ransom was no longer tolerable, especially as Augustus was intent on advancing the Roman sphere of control as far as the Danube river.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{the kings}} of Poland denounced the Order of holding lands {{rightfully}} theirs, specifically Chełmno Land and Polish lands that would be conquered later, such as Pomerelia (also Pomorze Gdańskie or Pomerania), Kujawy, and Dobrzyń Land. Furthermore, {{the rule of the}} Teutonic Knights was seen as increasingly anachronistic—taxes (customs) and the system of grain licenses (every trader had to pay large fees <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> trading grain) hindered economic development in the province. At the same time the nobility sought a larger say in the running of the country, and were looking enviously at neighboring Poland, where the Polish nobility enjoyed wider privileges. The Knights were also accused of violating the few existing privileges of the nobility and the cities. Craftsmen were discontented because of competition from so-called partacze, or artisans settled by the Knights near their castles. Kashubians, Poles, Germans, and Prussians were slowly melting into one nation, and as national differences disappeared, the common goals of all the ethnic and social groups of Prussia became more prominent, and the Prussian estates leaned increasingly towards Poland.|$|E

However, a Florida appellate court ruled that there was no violation in the state requiring her to show her face to a camera in a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> driving. The prevailing view in Florida is currently that hiding one's face on a form of photo identification defeats the purpose of having the picture taken, although 15 other states (including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Louisiana) have provisions that allow for driver's licenses absent of an identifying photograph in order to accommodate individuals who may have a religious reason to not have a photograph taken. In 2012, a string of armed robberies in Philadelphia were committed by people disguised in traditional Islamic woman's garb; Muslim leaders were concerned that the use of the disguises could put Muslim women in danger of hate crimes and inflame ethnic tensions.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 a legal {{challenge}} was mounted, {{asserting that the}} levy on employers was unlawful as a discriminatory tax.

5000|$|The {{question}} of Monmouthshire's status {{continued to be}} a matter of discussion, especially as Welsh nationalism and devolution climbed the political agenda in the 20th century.
