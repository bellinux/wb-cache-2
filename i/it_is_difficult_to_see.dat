Semi-rigid stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later {{in the same year}} a private document of Coimbra cited him, although still just as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why he was never consecrated.

Blücher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat". Steele (2014) writes: [...] "Blücher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington. The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Blücher. As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank. Wellington was able to shift to the offensive".|$|E
500|$|Political {{scientist}} Joseph Nye {{commented that}} [...] "while the Riga summit relaxed {{some of these}} caveats to allow assistance to allies in dire circumstances, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and the US are {{doing most of the}} fighting in southern Afghanistan, while French, German, and Italian troops are deployed in the quieter north. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how NATO can succeed in stabilizing Afghanistan unless it is willing to commit more troops and give commanders more flexibility." [...] The controversy surrounding the differences in contributions to Afghanistan indeed remained after the summit. For instance, during March 2007 British commanders accused the NATO members that refused to fight in the conflict-ridden south (in non-emergency situations) as causing [...] "huge resentment" [...] and a sense of betrayal, and undermined the credibility of the alliance.

The river flows briefly to the south, passing Cowdray on the east bank, which is a scheduled ancient monument. It consists of a medieval fortified house, which is partly ruined, although some of it has been reused. It is situated within Cowdray Park, a grade II* listed landscaped park, which forms the grounds for Cowdray House, a nineteenth-century mansion some [...] further east.

500|$|The French Lives {{provided}} Shelley {{with a way}} {{to celebrate}} literary women, particularly salonniéres. In her life of Madame de Sévigné, Shelley celebrates [...] "her chaste widowhood; her loyalty as a friend; [...] her maternal devotion". However, Orr writes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a pattern in the way Shelley addresses gender issues in these volumes. She argues that [...] "the most consistent 'feminism' displayed throughout [...] lies in her examination of French attitudes toward love, marriage, and sexuality". Shelley sympathetically portrays customs such as taking lovers, explaining the custom in the context of France's arranged marriages. Overall, Orr explains, Shelley's [...] "historical sympathy for the varied circumstances of women's relationships mirrors her personal practice of understanding and assisting those of her women friends who transgressed moral norms". The biographies of Roland and Staël focus on their abilities and the social forces that both helped and hindered them from succeeding. Shelley argues that women are as intellectually capable as men, but lack a sufficient education and are trapped by social systems such as marriage that restrict their rights. The emphasis that Shelley places on education and reading reflect the influence of her mother's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). In these two biographies, Shelley reinforces contemporary gender roles {{while at the same time}} celebrating the achievements of these women. She describes Roland through traditionally feminine roles: ...|$|E
500|$|The debt {{taken on}} by the Glazers to finance the {{takeover}} was split between the club and the family; between £265million and £275million was secured against Manchester United's assets, putting the club into debt {{for the first time}} since James Gibson saved them in 1931. This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds: Citadel, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital. The total amount was £660million, on which interest payments came to £62million a year. The club stated, [...] "The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year, which is why lenders want to invest in the club... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market."

[...] Under the terms of the Glazers' refinancing, as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010, the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14.25% to 16.25%, resulting in annual payments of around £38million.|$|E
