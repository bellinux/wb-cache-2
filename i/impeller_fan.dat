5000|$|The Dyson Air Multiplier fans, and the Imperial C2000 {{series range}} hood fans, have no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts except their {{oscillating}} and tilting head. The airflow is generated using the Coandă effect; a small quantity of air from a high-pressure-bladed <b>impeller</b> <b>fan,</b> {{contained in the}} base rather than exposed, drives a large airmass via a low-pressure area created by the airfoil. [...] The US Patent & Trademark Office initially ruled that Dyson's patent was not an improvement on the Toshiba patent on a nearly identical bladeless desktop fan granted in 1981.Air curtains and air doors also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or door. Air curtains are commonly used on open-face dairy, freezer, and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening, usually generated by a fan {{in the base of}} the cabinet.|$|E
40|$|Using our {{previous}} {{experience with the}} Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) electrometer, we have designed {{a new type of}} aerodynamic electrometer. The goal of the research was to measure the buildup of electrostatic surface charge on a stationary cylindrical insulator after windborne granular particles have collided with the insulator surface in a simulated dust storm. The experiments are performed inside a vacuum chamber. This allows the atmospheric composition and pressure to be controlled in order to simulate the atmospheric conditions near the equator on the Martian surface. An <b>impeller</b> <b>fan</b> was used to propel the dust particles at a cylindrically shaped insulator under low vacuum conditions. We tested the new electrometer in a 10 mbar CO 2 atmosphere by exposing two types of cylindrical insulators, Teflon (1. 9 cm diameter) and Fiberglass (2. 5 cm diameter), to a variety of windborne granular particulate materials. The granular materials tested were JSC Mars- 1 simulant, which is a mixture of coarse and fine (< 5 microns diameter) particle sizes, and some of the major mineral constituents of the Martian soil. The minerals included Ottawa sand (SiO 2), iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3), aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) and magnesium oxide (MgO). We also constructed a MECA-like electrometer that contained an insulator capped planar electrode for measuring the amount of electrostatic charge produced by rubbing an insulator surface over Martian and lunar soil simulants. The results {{of this study indicate that}} it is possible to detect triboelectric charging of insulator surfaces by windborne Martian soil simulant, and by individual mineral constituents of the soil simulant. We have also found that Teflon and Fiberglass insulator surfaces respond in different ways by developing opposite polarity surface charge, which decays at different rates after the particle impacts cease...|$|E

The Be'zier surface patch for surface representation was used {{to bridge the gap between}} the rather separate fields of drafting and finite-element analysis because the surfaces are defined by analytical functions which allow systematic and controlled variation of the shape and provide continuous derivatives up to any required degree. The objectives of {{this research}} were achieved by establishing : (i) A package which interpretes the engineering drawings of plate and shell structures and prepares the Be'zier net necessary for surface representation. (ii) A general purpose stand-alone meshed-surface modelling package for surface representation of plates and shells using the Be'zier surface patch technique. (iii) A translator which adapts the geometric description of plate and shell structures as given by the meshed-surface modeller to the form needed by the finite-element analysis package.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{optimizing}} {{the design of}} radial <b>fan</b> <b>impeller</b> using finite element analysis. Most manufacturing concerns spend more than a 60 % of their money for materials. The design of turbo machinery has been practiced {{in the last half}} of the previous century with increasing degree of sophistication. This trend of development is not complete because design of any turbo machine is interdisciplinary process involving aerodynamics, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, stress analysis, vibration analysis, the selection of materials, and the requirements for manufacturing. So, products have not reached a level of full maturity. Today there is considerable room for further development of most turbo machinery products when looked at with the perspective of the broadest possible design world and when it comes to development at the design stage then various types of analysis of every component are performed on computer before the first prototype is built. Among these the major one end the most frequently used in the manufacturing of any mechanical part is stress analysis. As the mass of the fan is directly related to the thickness of the impeller parts hence our objective in this project is to minimize the thickness, keeping in consideration the operating restrictions and design parameters. This work concentrates on to generate the finite element model of backward curved aerofoil radial <b>fan</b> <b>impeller</b> which behaves mathematically like structure model & carry out stress analysis using ANSYS software. The analysis was carried out using the default thickness of the impeller of the radial fan. This results in massive weight of the fan, leading to large vibrations and one of the reasons to failure. Ways were found out to reduce all these things, so the analysis was carried using various reduced thicknesses of the impeller and the optimum thickness of the impeller parts found for the safe stress and strain limits. This value analysis/Engineering results in material reduction, cost reduction with reduced vibrations for the desired design and operating conditions. The basic procedures and issues involved in the Finite Element Analysis of a radial fan are also outlined.

Measurements with one and two 1 -D hot wire probes in the rotating frame of reference unveiled strong local velocity fluctuations in the same frequency range which, however, were found to be spatially correlated well only within a small portion of the discharge area. From a rotor speed variation it became obvious that the radiated acoustic power in this particular Strouhal number range scales approximately with the 4 th power of the speed.
