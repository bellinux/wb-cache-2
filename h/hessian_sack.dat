50|$|In 1999-2000, {{the mill}} had 1,939 looms for <b>hessian,</b> 1,103 for <b>sacking</b> and 234 for carpet backing cloth (CBC). The looms in {{operation}} were 1085 for <b>hessian,</b> 726 for <b>sacking,</b> and 172 for CBC. Budgeted weaving production was 19,002 ton of hessian, 34,609 ton of sacking and 6,004 ton of CBC for the year. Actual production, {{on the other}} hand, was 10,284 ton of hessian, 21,236 ton of sacking, and 3,254 ton of CBC. The mill had 515 officers, 1,561 support staff and 16,443 workers. Man-days per ton estimated for 1999-2000 were 218 for <b>hessian,</b> 94 for <b>sacking</b> and 131 for CBC, which were 189, 88 and 112 respectively in 1995-1996. The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of <b>hessian,</b> <b>sacking</b> and CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a ton of hessian per ton was 1,672 kg, a ton of sacking 1,494 kg and a ton of CBC 1,813 kg. The comparative figures for 1999-2000 were 1,281 kg for hessian, 1,104 kg for sacking, and 1,447 kg for CBC.

The jury heard no {{forensic}} evidence which linked Hughes {{to the death}} of Sophie Hook, but they received valuable information from three witnesses. Hughes's father Gerald told the jury that his son had admitted the murder to him shortly after he was arrested and being held in custody at a local police station (although Hughes himself has always denied that any such confession took place). Jonathan Carroll, a 30-year-old career criminal who was in prison at the time he testified, told the jury that he had seen Hughes carrying a <b>hessian</b> <b>sack</b> along a Llandudno street on the night of Sophie's murder, and that he had caught a glimpse of a naked body in the sack - Carroll himself admitted he {{was in the process of}} stealing property from the garden of a house when he saw this happening. A third witness, convicted child sex offender Michael Guidi, testified that Hughes had boasted to him a few years before that he would like to [...] "rape a girl of 4 or 5". The jury also heard details of the injuries that Sophie had sustained in the attack, many of which had been inflicted before she died.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{the implications of}} sub-Saharan Africa’s transport gap for young people. In urban and rural areas, wherever transport services are deficient, or households lack the economic purchasing power to acquire transport equipment or pay fares, much everyday transport work needed to sustain the family and household is delegated to young people, especially girls. In most regions this involves putting the load {{in some sort of}} receptacle – perhaps a plastic container, metal bowl, <b>hessian</b> <b>sack,</b> cardboard box, or a locally woven basket – and then balancing it on the head, which is often protected by a small coil of cloth to make the burden more comfortable. Water and fuel commonly predominate among the loads being carried, even in urban areas, because of the widespread absence of piped water and electricity, but other items such as agricultural produce and groceries are also regularly transported in this way. Loads are carried to sustain the household directly, in terms of providing water, fuel and food, but also to enable participation in the cash economy...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{commissioned}} for the Marks of Honour exhibition/project at the Foam Museum of Photography, Amsterdam. Thirteen internationally recognised photographers were each invited to contribute a piece paying homage to a photobook that influenced their work. I chose Hay on the Highway (1993), which looks at farming communities in Finland and asks questions about sustainability, recycling and organic farming. Hay on the Highway inspired my conceptual approach to photography, collaboration, performance and subversion {{of the documentary}} genre and I had been searching for this rare book since 1995. For Marks of Honour I produced photographic self-portraits on the road (highway) metaphorically searching for this mythical book, using cardboard signs saying 'Hay on the Highway': this became a performance piece (also referencing my earlier photobook The Hitcher). I combined the new images with my re-representation of the original book, and made boxes from recycled cardboard, etched with {{the design of the}} book's cover; the original book was placed in it on a bed of hay along with my images and cardboard signs. The box was then placed in a specially produced <b>hessian</b> <b>sack.</b> For the exhibition my self-portraits were framed on the wall, and the other artwork was installed along with the original book in a vitrine. The book documenting the project, Don’t talk Bullshit, What are You Doing? was published alongside the exhibition, in a limited edition, with a set kept in the Marks of Honour archive. Marks of Honour as a whole constitutes a singular library and system of reference on some enduring influences in contemporary photography. Each work contains the original photobook and its complementary homage. The project was funded by the Foam and private collectors, and has been exhibited at Kaune Sudendorf Gallery, Cologne and the Kassler Photo Festival, Kassel, 2009; The Photographers' Gallery, UK, 2010...|$|E

50|$|Hessian {{is often}} used to make sacks and bags to ship goods such as coffee beans and rooibos tea; these contrivances are known as gunny sacks. It is {{breathable}} and thus resists condensation and associated spoilage of contents. It is also durable enough to withstand rough handling in transit; these properties have also led to its use for temporary protection as wet covering to prevent rapid moisture loss in the setting of cement and concrete in the construction industry. Hessian is also commonly used to make effective sandbags; <b>hessian</b> <b>sacks</b> filled with sand are often used for flood mitigation in temporary embankments against floodwaters or field fortifications.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Bangladesh, jute mills are {{producing}} conventional yarns heavier than 275 tex. These {{are used as}} <b>hessian,</b> <b>sacking,</b> carpet backing cloth etc. For diversified uses of jute it is most essential to produce medium count yarn of 241 to 275 tex. In this regard, slip draft spinning machine has been studied. This machine is capable to produce yarn of 241 to 280 tex at flyer speed of 2900 rpm to 4850 rpm. But there is a relation between flyer speed and yarn breakages of the machine. In addition spinning efficiency of the machine also depends on the yarn breakages. Through a series of experiment, a relation has been established between flyer speed and yarn breakages of the experimental machine for production of jute yarn...|$|R

25|$|The chief {{problems}} which Fourteenth Army would face were logistical. The advancing troops {{would need to}} be supplied over crude roads stretching for far greater distances than were ever encountered in Europe. Although expedients such as locally constructed river transport and temporary all-weather coverings for roads (made from coarse <b>hessian</b> <b>sacking</b> material impregnated with bitumen and diesel oil) were to be used, transport aircraft were to be vital for supplying the forward units. Disaster threatened as early as 16 December 1944, when 75 American transport aircraft were abruptly transferred to China, where the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go was threatening American airfields. Although aircraft were hastily transferred from the Mediterranean theatre to replace those despatched to China, continuing threats to deprive Fourteenth Army of the support of American transport aircraft were to be a constant concern for Slim during the forthcoming battles.|$|R
50|$|The PoWs {{were very}} talented {{and most of}} the {{productions}} were written by themselves.

In the late 1920s he began to create, apparently for private amusement, a series of eccentric, caricature-like watercolors that reveal a knowledge of works by such modern figures as Emil Nolde and Alfred Kubin. These often satirical commentaries are unlike any of his other, more formal works, and are described by later critics as revealing both a scurrilous sentiment [...] and a debt to German Expressionism. These sometimes anguished images are the pieces that have endured, and are of greatest interest to contemporary audiences, who see in them a psychological reflection of the time between the wars in Vienna.|$|R

50|$|In this context, the {{construction}} of the slab hut was something of an achievement. The building method is an improvised version of fencing construction techniques used to construct a basic dwelling of hardwood slabs nailed and wired to posts and rails. It demonstrates the family's need to make do with what they could find or afford, rather than reflecting a tradition of craftmanship or even bush carpentry. Many mining families in the district lived in dwellings constructed of posts, flattened kerosene tins and <b>hessian</b> <b>sacks</b> and strained economic circumstances meant that many families were not able to hold on to their selections. In fact, the Allan family property is now an isolated piece of freehold land within an area of former selections that reverted to Crown land when previous owners were unable to sustain a living. The resilience and tenacity that was necessary for the Allan and Price families to be able to hang on to their selection and indeed consolidate and develop it, is demonstrated by the length of time that the hut was used as a dwelling.|$|R
