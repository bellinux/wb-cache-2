2500|$|AC/DC {{recorded}} six {{music videos}} for the album which {{were recorded in}} Breda, in the Netherlands. The songs they used for the videos were [...] "Back in Black", [...] "Hells Bells", [...] "What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> Money Honey", [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long", [...] "Let Me Put My Love into You", and [...] "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution", and were basic performance videos. Most of these remained officially unreleased until [...] "Back in Black", [...] "Hells Bells", [...] "What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> Money Honey", and [...] "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution", {{as well as the}} 1986 video for [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] which was filmed for the Who Made Who album, were released on the Family Jewels DVD. The original video for [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long" [...] was later released on the promo DVD Back in Black: The Videos and on the Backtracks box sets. One thing to note about both videos is the original 1980 video features drummer Phil Rudd, who appears on the actual track, while the 1986 video features Simon Wright who replaced Rudd in 1983. However, Rudd would return in 1994. This {{is not the first time}} Wright appeared in an AC/DC video for a track originally recorded with Rudd. Rudd appeared on Flick of the Switch (1983) while Wright appeared on the tour and videos for that album. [...] "Let Me Put My Love into You" [...] still remains unreleased but can be viewed on YouTube. A video for [...] "Shoot to Thrill", combining 2009 live footage of the group and scenes from Iron Man 2, was released in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Back in Black was {{released}} on 25 July 1980, {{less than half a}} year after Scott's death. AC/DC were nervous about the future, with Angus saying they were a [...] "bit jittery" [...] during recording. However, the album proved to ease the band's worries, as it became their best selling, most popular and critically respected album. Not only did it go to no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, its success meant AC/DC were the first band since The Beatles to have four albums in the British Top 100 simultaneously, as Highway to Hell, If You Want Blood You've Got It, and Let There Be Rock all re-entered the charts right after Back in Black {{was released}}. In the US, the single [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long"/"Have a Drink on Me" [...] became AC/DC's first Top 40 hit in the country, peaking at no. 35. The title track, along with [...] "Hells Bells", [...] "Shoot to Thrill", [...] "You Shook Me All Night Long", and [...] "Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution" [...] all became fan favorites and staples of the band's live performances. The other songs on Back in Black were largely ignored after the mid-1980s although [...] "What <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> Money Honey" [...] was revived during the 2001 tour. The 2015 tour brought back [...] "Have a Drink on Me" [...] and [...] "Given the Dog a Bone".|$|E
