5|$|An {{aftermarket}} {{electric vehicle}} conversion is the modification {{of a conventional}} internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) or <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> (HEV) to electric propulsion, creating an all-electric or plug-in <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|E
5|$|A plug-in <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> (PHEV or PHV), {{also known}} as a plug-in hybrid, is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> with {{rechargeable}} batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E

25|$|A plug-in <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> (PHEV) is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{that uses}} {{rechargeable}} batteries, or another energy storage device, {{that can be}} recharged by plugging it in to an external source of electric power. A PHEV shares the characteristics both of a conventional <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle,</b> having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine (ICE), and of an all-electric vehicle, having a plug to connect to the electrical grid. Most PHEVs are passenger cars {{but there are also}} PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans, utility trucks, buses, trains, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{need for}} a {{bidirectional}} DC/DC converter in <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> is studied. Here, a universal power electronic interface {{that can be used}} in any type of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (EV), <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (HEV) and plug-in <b>hybrid</b> <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (PHEV) is discussed. This power electronic converter interfaces the energy storage device of the vehicle with the motor drive and the charging unit. The fully directional converter is capable of working in buck or boost modes in any direction with a non-inverted output voltage. The output of the converter is improved with a feedback control loop. This is verified with MATLAB/SIMULINK (MATLAB version R 2010 a).
