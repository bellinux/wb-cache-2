40|$|Abstract — Fixed-die {{floorplanning}} is {{an important}} problem in the modern physical design process. An effective floorplanning algorithm is crucial to improving both the quality and the timeto-market of the design. In this paper, we present an analytical floorplanning algorithm {{that can be used}} to efficiently pack soft modules into a <b>fixed</b> <b>die.</b> The locations and sizing of the modules are simultaneously optimized so that a minimum total wire length is achieved. Experiments on the MCNC and GSRC benchmarks show that our algorithm can achieve above a 90 % success rate with a 10 % white space constraint in the <b>fixed</b> <b>die,</b> and the efficiency is much higher than that of the simulated annealing based algorithms for benchmarks containing a large number of modules.

40|$|In this research, a {{study of}} the effect of a <b>die</b> <b>half</b> angle on the {{extrusion}} process has been performed. The experiments were conducted at room temperature around 27 °C. Two types of taper die with different <b>die</b> <b>half</b> angles (45 ° and 60 °) were prepared. The test lubricants used were paraffinic mineral oil VG 460 and Refined, Bleached and Deodorized (RBD) Palm stearin. The material of the workpiece (billet) was annealed with A 1100 aluminium. The experimental results were focused on the extrusion load, tool and workpiece surface roughness and plastic deformation of the workpiece. The resultant relative velocity was calculated using a visioplasticity method. The results shows that a taper angle of 60 ° recorded higher resultant relative velocity with a lower extrusion load and surface roughness compare to the taper angle of 45 °. The comparison study between Paraffinic Mineral Oil and RBD Palm Stearin shows no significant effect in both taper angles tested...|$|R
