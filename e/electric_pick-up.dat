5000|$|In {{addition}} to developing the modern tetrachordo bouzouki, Manolis Hiotis {{was a pioneer}} the use of amplification for the instrument, which {{he may have been}} using as early as 1945. However, the earliest documented use of amplification for the bouzouki comes from a 1952 photograph, showing Vasilis Tsitsanis and Yiannis Papaioannou playing bouzoukis, each with an <b>electric</b> guitar-style <b>pick-up</b> attached in the soundhole. There are also numerous photographs between 1953 and 1959 showing bands in which both vocalists and bouzouki players are using microphones for amplification. [...] By 1960 special bouzouki pickups (such as the German [...] "Ideal") were being produced and permanently mounted in the instruments. [...] Similar pickups are widely used by several Greek artists today and come in active and passive versions.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Development of an {{intensity}} setter, {{which in a}} rational law changes the opening thyristor the voltage regulator and effectively to changing power supply voltage stator windings of the electric pump deepening, ensuring a smooth start in a wide range. Methodology. Electric submersible pump belongs to the small inertia electric, since it is not significant total moment of inertia, not exceeding two moments of inertia of the motor and static moment on the shaft does not exceed {{forty percent of the}} nominal torque. For technical requirements that electric acceleration time should have no less than twenty seconds or more. Office starting modes of electric submersible pumps economically justified using thyristor voltage regulator by forming the dial changes the intensity of the necessary legislation in time voltage feeding the stator windings. This ensures a smooth start right rotor of the electric submersible pump. Results. A block diagram of the intensity setter that is: with control unit, two units that form the exponential voltage supply emitter follower and regulatory elements. The mathematical expressions for voltage at the stator windings of the motor, changing exponentially, opening the angle of thyristor power unit thyristor the voltage regulator, which is determined through the initial angle of opening. Provided formula for pick-up voltage and minimum voltage, time constants, which are determined from the basic equations of motion and mechanical characteristics of the electric motor. Analytical investigated by the voltage dependence violation by changing the time constant flowing and growing exhibitor supply voltage stator electric circuit deepening pump. Originality. Proposed in the initial time on the stator windings of the <b>electric</b> <b>pick-up</b> voltage is applied. Under the influence of this voltage, motor rotor begins to accelerate. At the same time, pick-up voltage decreases the minimum startup voltage varies exponentially in which the rotor of the electric motor continues to rotate more steadily. Now the voltage at the motor stator windings increases exponentially to the nominal voltage of the supply network. This start flowing smoothly for the right time to establish nominal rotor speed of the motor. Practical value. Developed dial allows you to increase the intensity of the electric motor acceleration time and reduce the dynamic loads of the electric submersible pump...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMars lacks an {{intrinsic}} dipole magnetic field, creating a scenario where {{the solar wind}} directly interacts with the upper atmosphere and newly created ions can be picked up and swept away by the background convection <b>electric</b> field. These <b>pick-up</b> ions can directly escape or precipitate back into the atmosphere and induce atmospheric sputtering of neutrals. Sputtering {{is believed to be}} one of the main drivers of atmospheric escape during the early epochs of our solar system when the solar activity and EUV intensities were much higher than the present day. Using the March 8 th ICME event and other extreme solar wind events, we simulate three phases of the Mars-solar wind interaction using fluid and kinetic models and compare the predicted heavy ion precipitation with MAVEN observations in order to derive heavy ion precipitation and the first set of data-based sputtering rates. The fluid model reproduces the observed features in the solar wind density, velocity and magnetic field seen along the MAVEN orbit during the March 8 th ICME event, and the subsequent precipitation shows strong agreement with other published predictions of sputtering in extreme conditions...|$|R
