40|$|The Darwin {{theory of}} {{evolution}} by natural selection is based on three principles: (a) variation; (b) inheritance; and (c) natural selection. Here, <b>I</b> take these <b>principles</b> {{as an excuse to}} review some topics related to the future research prospects in Animal Breeding. With respect to the first <b>principle</b> <b>I</b> describe two forms of variation different from mutation that are becoming increasingly important: variation in copy number and microRNAs. With respect to the second <b>principle</b> <b>I</b> comment on the possible relevance of non-mendelian inheritance, the so-called epigenetic effects, of which the genomic imprinting is the best characterized in domestic species. Regarding selection <b>principle</b> <b>I</b> emphasize the importance of selection for social traits and how this could contribute to both productivity and animal welfare. Finally, I analyse the impact of molecular biology in Animal Breeding, the achievements and limitations of quantitative trait locus and classical marker-assisted selection and the future of genomic selectio...|$|R

Since being rapid construction {{and increasing the}} quality of building production, industrialised building systems are preferred in construction industry. Qualified engineers and architects are required during design and installation phase of these systems. Design education of four industrialised building systems for low rise residential at undergraduate level is discussed in this study.
