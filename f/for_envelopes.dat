60|$|Then Woollacott began, {{and told}} me briefly the whole story. He had {{consulted}} with the superintendent and Sir Theophilus, {{without saying a word}} to me about it, and had kept a close watch upon all the letters that came for Mactavish. A rare Anglo-Saxon coin is not a chattel that one can easily get rid of every day; and Woollacott shrewdly gathered from what Sir Theophilus had told him that Mactavish (or whoever else had stolen the coin) would be likely to try to dispose of it as far away from England as possible, especially after all the comments that had been made on this particular Wulfric in the English newspapers. So he took every opportunity of intercepting the postman at the front door, and looking out <b>for</b> <b>envelopes</b> with foreign postage stamps. At last one day a letter arrived for Mactavish with an Italian stamp and a cardinal's red hat stamped like a crest on the flap of the envelope. Woollacott was certain that things of that sort didn't come to Mactavish every day about his ordinary business. Braving the penalties for appropriating a letter, he took the liberty to open this suspicious communication, and found it was a note from Cardinal Trevelyan, the Pope's Chamberlain, and a well-known collector of antiquities referring to early Church history in England, and that it was in reply to an offer of Mactavish's to send the Cardinal for inspection a rare gold coin not otherwise specified. The Cardinal expressed his readiness to see the coin, and to pay a hundred and fifty pounds for it, if it proved to be rare and genuine as described. Woollacott felt certain that this communication must refer to the gold Wulfric. He therefore handed the letter to Mrs. Mactavish when the postman next came his rounds, and waited to see whether Mactavish any day afterwards went to the post to register a small box or packet. Meanwhile he communicated with Emily and the superintendent, being unwilling to buoy me up with a doubtful hope until he was quite sure that their plan had succeeded. The superintendent wrote immediately to the Cardinal, mentioning his suspicions, and received a reply to the effect that he expected a coin of Wulfric to be sent him shortly. Sir Theophilus, who had been greatly interested in the question of the coin, kindly offered to take Emily over to Rome, {{in order to get the}} criminating piece, as soon as it arrived, from Cardinal Trevelyan. That was, in turn, the story that they all told me, piece by piece, in the Central Station at Rome that eventful morning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{provides}} a direct dynamic modeling approach <b>for</b> <b>envelope</b> signals in resonant inverters driven by modulated inputs (AM or FM). Based on the sinusoidal approximation, this approach decomposes the modulated input into its fundamental component plus two dominant sidebands. The system response is then {{found by the}} summation of {{the responses to the}} three individual inputs. Following this conception, the small signal transfer functions <b>for</b> <b>envelope</b> signals in a resonant inverter are then derived. Some simple but useful results for these transfer functions are presented, which link the transfer functions of envelope signals to the transfer functions of the resonant tank and simplify hand calculations. This modeling approach is verified with simulation and experimental results by studying the dynamic responses of output current envelope to bus voltage and switching frequency. I...|$|R

40|$|Just-noticeable {{differences}} (jnd's) in {{the center}} frequency of bandlimited harmonic complexes were measured for normal hearing subjects. A triangular and a trapezoidal spectral envelope were used. The center frequency ranged from 2000 to 2100 Hz <b>for</b> the triangular <b>envelope</b> and from 2000 to 2200 Hz <b>for</b> the trapezoidal <b>envelope.</b> <b>For</b> both <b>envelope</b> shapes the values 100, 200, and 400 dB/oct {{were used for the}} slope. The fundamental frequency was 100 Hz for all complexes. A three-interval, three-alternative forced-choice task was used. All measurements were performed with and without roving of the signal level. Without roving, the jnd's were in most cases about a factor of 1. 5 smaller than with roving. The bandwidth and the center frequency were factors having the major influence on the jnd's. <b>For</b> the triangular <b>envelope,</b> the jnd's were smallest for center frequencies that were halfway between two signal components. <b>For</b> the trapezoidal <b>envelope,</b> the jnd's were smallest for center frequencies that coincided with a signal component. <b>For</b> the triangular <b>envelope,</b> the smallest jnd's for each slope were about half the value of those <b>for</b> the trapezoidal <b>envelope.</b> In the case of the smallest jnd's <b>for</b> each spectral <b>envelope</b> shape, the jnd's were smaller when the spectral slope was steeper. Part of the. data <b>for</b> the triangular <b>envelope</b> can be explained by modulation depth discrimination data. The data <b>for</b> the trapezoidal <b>envelope</b> can be interpreted in terms of a spectral profile comparison. The remaining part might be interpreted either in terms of a temporal mechanism, or of the mentioned spectral profile comparison. It is argued that, for this spectral comparison, the ear probably combines information over a limited frequency range by comparing the spectral profiles of the two presented stimuli, rather than comparing individual component levels.

40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) envelope comprises a surface gp 120 and a transmembrane gp 41. The cytoplasmic domain of gp 41 contains cysteine residues (C 764 and C 837) which are targets for palmitoylation and were reported to be required <b>for</b> <b>envelope</b> association with lipid rafts and assembly on budding virions (I. Rousso, M. B. Mixon, B. K. Chen, and P. S. Kim, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 : 13523 - 13525, 2000). Several infectious HIV- 1 clones contain envelopes that have no gp 41 cytoplasmic cysteines. Since no other gp 41 amino acid is a target for palmitoylation, these clones imply that palmitoylation is not essential <b>for</b> <b>envelope</b> trafficking and assembly. Here, we show that HIV- 1 envelope mutants that lack gp 41 cytoplasmic cysteines are excluded from light lipid rafts. Envelopes that contained residues with bulky hydrophobic side chains instead of cysteines retained their association with heavy rafts and were nearly fully functional for incorporation into virions and infectivity. Substitution of cysteines with alanines or serines eliminated raft association and more severely reduced envelope incorporation onto virions and their infectivity. Nevertheless, the A 764 /A 837 mutant envelope retained nearly 40 % infectivity compared to the wild type, even though this envelope was excluded from lipid rafts. Our results demonstrate that gp 41 cytoplasmic cysteines that are targets for palmitoylation and are required <b>for</b> <b>envelope</b> trafficking to classical lipid rafts are not essential for HIV- 1 replication...|$|R
