40|$|Five {{methods for}} surface {{roughening}} (Coarse <b>emery</b> <b>papers,</b> Pasting small glass spheres, Pasting sand, Chemical corrosion and CNC machining) were studied experimentally {{to choose the}} best method to produce three different grades of surface roughness for solid (Carbon steel) spherical particles of five diameters (10, 14, 18, 22 and 25) mm accelerated with rotation in Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids. The results showed that coarse <b>emery</b> <b>papers</b> method gives irregular surface roughness and to measure the surface roughness it must be made of a plane sample so the devices of surface roughness measurement can predict the value of surface roughness and this is impossible to be produced with coarse <b>emery</b> <b>papers</b> (for the sphere and the plane sample with the same grade of surface roughness). Both pasting small glass spheres and sand gives regular and measurable surface roughness but they are irrelevant for the rotation of solid spherical particles because of the broking of roughened surface after a small period of time because of the liquid's resistance to the accelerated spheres motion. The chemical method gave one grade of surface roughness only and it is relevant and the surface roughness is measurable. The CNC machining method was the best method, it gave three different grades of surface roughness which were (74, 176 and 243) µm...|$|R

3000|$|... 316 [*]L {{stainless}} steel sheets were used as the metal substrate. Before coating, {{the surface of the}} metal was ground with grade 400 – 2000 <b>emery</b> <b>papers</b> gradually, then degreased in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water for 10 [*]min, respectively. The coating was formed on the steel substrate by the dip-coating method. Firstly, the 316 [*]L {{stainless steel}} sheet was immersed in the sol for 3 [*]min and withdrawn at a speed of 12 [*]mm/min. After natural drying in an air flow, the sample was dried in the oven at 100 °C for 10 [*]min. In order to obtain coatings with different thickness, the above-mentioned operation was repeated for several times. Then the sample was heat-treated in a muffle furnace at 250 °C for 30 [*]min, and at 500 °C for 60 [*]min. Finally, the coated sample was immersed in boiling water for 10 [*]min, and thermally treated in the muffle oven again at 500 °C for 10 [*]min to eliminate the crack defects in the coating.|$|R
50|$|After cooling, faded brakes usually {{perform as}} well as before, with no visible change to the brake shoes and/or pads. However if the brakes have been {{excessively}} hot for a prolonged period of time, glazing can occur on both of the friction linings of the shoes and pads.When this happens, the contacting surfaces of the linings will have a smooth, shiny appearance, and will not perform as efficiently to slow the vehicle under braking.This glazing can be easily removed by either gently using <b>emery</b> <b>paper</b> on them, or by driving the vehicle carefully whilst implementing light use of the brakes for several miles.|$|E
50|$|Using a {{thin coat}} of polish can prevent tarnish from forming over these metals.

30|$|An {{evaluation}} of the adhesive shear strengths also revealed {{the effect of the}} adherend material on the adhesive bond strength. Similar observations have been previously made, with researchers noting that the stiffer, stronger adhrends possessed stronger bond strengths. The A 1 displayed higher adhesive bond strengths for steel in comparison to both aluminum alloys, with adhesive shear strengths for the steel alloy being at least twice those of the aluminum alloys. The difference in adhesive shear strengths with adherend material was not as distinct  with the  A 2 adhesive. There was not much disparity observed between the adhesive shear strengths for the steel and aluminum alloys, except for adhesive strenghts observed at surface roughness values obtained with the 320 grit SiC <b>emery</b> <b>papers.</b> Although the maximum adhesive shear strength was observed with the steel alloy, the lowest shear strength was also observed with this alloy.  Therefore, the type of adhesive  would also influence the extent the adherend material  impacts the bond strength.|$|R
30|$|Gravimetric {{experiments}} {{were conducted on}} test coupons of dimension 3 [*]×[*] 3 [*]×[*] 0.14 cm. Before each experiment, the coupons were abraded using <b>emery</b> <b>papers</b> (grades 200 – 1000) washed with distilled water and dried in acetone and warm air. The coupons were then weighed and suspended in beakers containing the test solutions using glass hooks and rods. Tests were conducted under total immersion conditions in 300 ml of the aerated and unstirred test solutions. The coupons were retrieved after 3 h, immersed in 20 % NaOH solution containing 200 g[*]l− 1 of zinc dust, scrubbed with bristle brush under running water, dried and reweighed. The weight loss was taken as {{the difference between the}} initial and final weights of the coupons.
