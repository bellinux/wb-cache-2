40|$|BackgroundInterest {{in global}} health and {{international}} mission trips among medical student and resident trainees is growing rapidly. How these electives and international mission experiences affect future practice {{is still being}} elucidated. No study has identified if participation <b>in</b> international surgical <b>missions</b> during residency is a predictor of participation <b>in</b> international surgical <b>missions</b> <b>in</b> practice after training completion. MethodsAll trainees of our plastic surgery residency program from 1990 to 2011, during the implementation of optional annual international surgical missions, were surveyed {{to determine if the}} graduate had gone on a mission as a resident and as a plastic surgeon. Data were compared between graduates who participated <b>in</b> <b>missions</b> as residents and graduates who did not, from 1990 to 2011 and 1990 to 2007. ResultsOf Plastic Surgery graduates from 1990 to 2011 who participated <b>in</b> international <b>missions</b> as residents, 60 % participated <b>in</b> <b>missions</b> when <b>in</b> practice, versus 5. 9 % of graduates participating <b>in</b> <b>missions</b> <b>in</b> practice but not residency (P< 0. 0001). When excluding last 5 years, graduates participating <b>in</b> international <b>missions</b> <b>in</b> practice after doing so as residents increases to 85. 7 %, versus 7. 41 % who participate in practice but not residency P< 0. 002. ConclusionsResults reveal plastic surgeons who participate <b>in</b> international surgical <b>missions</b> as residents participate <b>in</b> international surgical <b>missions</b> <b>in</b> practice at higher rates than graduates who did not participate <b>in</b> <b>missions</b> during residency. International missions have significant intrinsic value both to trainee and international communities served, and this opportunity should be readily and easily accessible to all plastic surgery residents nationwide...|$|R

5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role <b>in</b> <b>Mission</b> Control. He would have been lead flight director on the first manned Apollo mission (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was <b>in</b> <b>Mission</b> Control, but under the circumstances there was little he could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft retired as a flight director to concentrate on management and mission planning.

He held the position until his 1982 retirement from NASA. During his retirement, Kraft has consulted for numerous companies including IBM and Rockwell International, and he published an autobiography entitled Flight: My Life <b>in</b> <b>Mission</b> Control.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Mission</b> Mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} missions, each with objectives {{that range from}} collecting coins to attacking enemies. In each mission, the player controls a pre-specified character. There are seven levels with eight missions in each. After completing each mission, the player's performance is given a grade of stars (three, two, or one) or letters (A, B, C, D, or E). After all eight missions in a level are complete, the player must complete a boss mission {{to advance to the}} next level. Once the first six levels are complete, and the rank of at least one star has been obtained on every mission, the seventh level is unlocked.|$|E

Spanish settlers had established missionsâincluding one on Fort George Island named San Juan del Puerto that eventually gave the nearby St. Johns River its nameâbut their frequent battles with the Timucua and a decline <b>in</b> <b>mission</b> activity curbed development. When the British controlled Florida, they established several plantations in the region. Richard Hazard owned the first plantation on Fort George Island in 1765, harvesting indigo with several dozen enslaved Africans. Spain regained ownership of Florida in 1783 after the American Revolution and recruited new Americans with promises of free land.|$|E
