40|$|This NebGuide {{explains}} how ram lambs can be most efficiently {{used in a}} breeding program and provides management suggestions for a successful program. Are you planning to use a ram lamb this breeding season? If so, you should consider the capabilities and limitations of ram lambs. It may be true that some well-grown, aggressive, vigorous, highly fertile ram lambs can settle 50 ewes and maybe more. However, these rams are exceptions. A good rule to follow for practical ram management is 15 to 20 <b>ewes</b> <b>for</b> a ram lamb and 35 to 50 <b>ewes</b> <b>for</b> a mature ram...|$|R

50|$|One {{well known}} group of {{substances}} which are toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are teratogens - substances which cause birth defects - of which (S)-thalidomide is {{possibly the most}} notorious. Another group of substances which has received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are the so-called endocrine disruptors. However, many substances which are toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> do not fall into either of these groups: lead compounds, for example, {{are considered to be}} toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> given their adverse effects on the normal intellectual and psychomotor development of human babies and children.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} an economic feasibility {{study of a}} 5, 000 head, cooperatively owned, sheep operation for leafy spurge control. The objectives were 1) determine the return on investment of the cooperative, 2) determine the proposed structure of the cooperative, and 3) ascertain the amount of capital investment required by members in the cooperative. Three sheep flock management alternatives were initially considered for the cooperative. These were 1) winter lambing, 2) spring lambing, and 3) fall lambing. The fall lambing scenario {{was determined to be}} infeasible because of logistics associated with gathering and transportation of pregnant ewes and lack of grazing pressure on leafy spurge throughout the grazing season. The total capital investment per <b>ewe</b> <b>for</b> the winter lambing scenario was more than the spring lambing scenario - - $ 301 and $ 216, respectively. The expected net income generated by the winter lambing scenario was negative. The minimum break-even lamb selling price or lambs sold per <b>ewe</b> <b>for</b> the winter lambing scenario was $ 84. 10 /cwt and 1. 33, respectively. The spring lambing scenario returned $ 124, 000 annually. The minimum breakeven lamb selling price or lambs sold per <b>ewe</b> <b>for</b> the spring lambing scenario was $ 59. 51 /cwt and 0. 94, respectively. The expected return on investment (50 % equity) for cooperative members with the spring lambing scenario, assuming a 50 -acre leafy spurge infestation in a 100 -acre pasture and new fence, was 16 percent (stocking rate of 1 ewe and lambs per acre of leafy spurge). While these returns are not a guarantee of success for the spring lambing alternative, they do provide an indication of the potential that such a cooperative may have.
