Airport Network is the first not-metro project {{of the company and}} it remained free until the modernization of equipment in January 2016. Since July 2016 the network has again become free. In December 2015 AURA wireless network was launched in the Aeroexpress terminal at Paveletsky railway station, in April 2016 — in the terminal at Sheremetyevo airport. The contract between MaximaTelecom and Aeroexpress implies launching the WiFi connection in the remaining terminals in Domodedovo and Vnukovo airports, and at Belorussky and Kievsky railway stations. In September 2016 the company will start the monetization of Wi-Fi network in Aeroexpress train.|$|E
40|$|As the {{efficiency}} of computer graphic rendering methods is increasing, generating realistic models is now becoming a limiting factor. In this paper we resent a new technique to enhance already existing geometry models of real world objects with textures reconstructed from a sparse set of unregistered still photographs. The aim of the proposed technique is the generation of n early photo-realistic models of arbitrarily shaped objects with minimal effort. In our approach, we require neither a prior calibration of the camera nor a hgh precision of the user's interaction. Two main problems {{have to be addressed}} of which the first is the recovery of the unknown positions and parameters of the camera. An initial estimate of the orientation is calculated from interactively selected point correspondences. Subsequently, the unknown parameters are accurately calculated by minimising a blend of objective functions in a 3 D- 2 D projective registration approach. The key point of the proposed method o <b>f</b> <b>registration</b> is a novel filtering approach which utilieses the spatial information provided by the geometry model. Second, the individual images have to be combined yielding a set of consistent texture maps. We present a robust method to recover the texture from the photographs thereby preserving high spatial frequencies and eliminating artifacts, particularly specular highlights. Parts of the object not seen in any of the photographs are interpolated in the textured model. Results are shown for three complex example objects with different materials and numerous self-occlusions...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{framework}} to perform <b>f</b> nonrigid surface <b>registration.</b> It {{is based on}} various extensions of an iterative algorithm recently presented by several researchers (Besl, Zhang, Chen, Menq, Champleboux) to f rigidly register surfaces represented {{by a set of}} 3 D points, when a prior estimate of the displacement is available. Our framework consists of three stages: First, we search for the best f rigid displacement to superpose the two surfaces. We show how to efficiently use curvatures to superpose principal frames at possible corresponding points in order to find a prior rough estimate of the displacement and initialize the iterative algorithm. Second, we search for the best f affine transformation. We introduce differential information in points coordinates: this allows us to match locally similar points. Then, we show how principal frames and curvatures are transformed by an affine transformation. Finally, we introduce this differential information in a global criterion minimized by extended Kalman filtering. Third, we locally deform the surface. Instead of computing a global affine transformation, we attach to each point a f local affine transformation varying smoothly along the surface. We call this deformation a locally affine deformation. All these stages are illustrated with experiments on various real biomedical surfaces (teeth, faces, skulls, brains and hearts), which demonstrate the validity of the approach...|$|R
