25|$|Stephen gave over $1 {{million to}} Sir John A. Macdonald's {{government}} from 1882 to 1890, {{knowing full well}} the important part it played in the successful completion of the CPR when their finances <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> short of precarious. But, Stephen {{refused to accept the}} argument that the CPR owed its existence to the government. He became engaged in a very public battle over several years with John Norquay concerning the unpopular monopoly clause, but had to concede to public pressure in 1888, allowing the construction of branch lines south of the CPR main line. Though a financier of undoubted reputation, Stephen did not excel in public debate. He resigned as President of the CPR in 1888 and approved the appointment of Sir William Cornelius Van Horne to succeed him.|$|E
25|$|Stephenson and {{the other}} {{salesmen}} and office seekers who maneuvered for control of Indiana's Invisible Empire lacked both the ability {{and the desire to}} use the political system to carry out the Klan's stated goals. They were uninterested in, or perhaps even unaware of, grass roots concerns within the movement. For them, the Klan <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a means for gaining wealth and power. These marginal men had risen {{to the top of the}} hooded order because, until it became a political force, the Klan had never required strong, dedicated leadership. More established and experienced politicians who endorsed the Klan, or who pursued some of the interests of their Klan constituents, also accomplished little. Factionalism created one barrier, but many politicians had supported the Klan simply out of expedience. When charges of crime and corruption began to taint the movement, those concerned about their political futures had even less reason to work on the Klan's behalf.|$|E
25|$|The {{participants}} received a life ban from Caribbean cricket in 1983. In many instances, they were ostracised socially and professionally, {{such was the}} hostility toward players that complied with the South African apartheid system. In contrast, the players commented on a warm reception from both blacks and whites in South Africa and the tour {{may have been a}} positive influence on relations between races. It {{was one of the few}} occasions when white and black people had played sport together in South Africa. The players' bans were lifted in 1989 (although Lynch appeared in ODI's for England a year earlier against the touring West Indians) but the only tour member who played for West Indies again was Moseley, at the age of 32 (two tests in the 1989-90 home series against England: though he did not take many wickets, his appearance was chiefly notable for breaking Graham Gooch's hand, forcing Gooch - now England's captain - to miss the remainder of the series). Stephenson and Clarke had very successful first-class careers in South African and English domestic cricket: and Stephenson in particular could perhaps be thought unlucky not to be given a chance in Test cricket, given the precedent set by Moseley's selection and the fact that his performances in the English county championship <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> short of spectacular.|$|E

25|$|After Jesse Owens {{returned}} from the 1936 Olympics, Robinson befriended him. Despite his fame from his four Olympic track wins, undermining Adolf Hitler's claims of Aryan supremacy, Owens found most of the offers {{that had been made}} to employ him <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> more than publicity stunts that had no substance. Robinson was the one exception, finding work for Owens within a few months of his return to the U.S. Robinson also introduced Owens to his manager, Marty Forkins, who secured a series of demonstration races for Owens which were viewed by many as degrading to the dignity of an Olympic athlete, most notably an event in Cuba in which Owens raced against a horse. As a result, Forkins and Robinson were viewed as having taken advantage of Owens. According to Forkinsâ€™ son, Robinson had told Owens that he should start running demonstration races that would both earn money for him and keep him in the public eye. Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified. Moreover, the events paid Owens well and provided him with a source of funds when no one else was offering him employment or helping him financially. Owens made a gift to Robinson of one of his four Olympic gold medals, as a gesture of gratitude for the help Robinson had given him.|$|E
500|$|Weatherill did {{not accept}} Whatton's defence. He {{continued}} to maintain that the delays in staunching the blood flow were [...] "unforgivable", and that with Huskisson obviously dying there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> to lose by attempting surgery. He {{also pointed out that}} if Huskisson had been fit enough to dictate a will, he may well have been fit enough to withstand an operation.|$|E
500|$|Commander Lawrence of the United States Navy {{returned}} from a successful war cruise having defeated the sloop HMS Peacock. He was promoted to captain for his victory, and received orders to take command of USS Chesapeake. It was not a command that he particularly wanted. He had hoped for the larger frigate [...] instead. Lawrence travelled to Boston. He found {{that most of the}} former crew of Chesapeake had left over a dispute over prize money and had since been replaced. Lawrence's prior experience of the British Navy worked against him. In his former battle with HMS Peacock the warship had been bravely fought, but the British gunnery <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> less than atrocious. His crew was laden with good seamen; however, they lacked the time working together that was needed to change a collection of good seamen into an efficient fighting crew. Lawrence's assumptions concerning the poor quality of the opposition would leave him over-confident in facing the adversary he was about to encounter.|$|E

But, if it was still there, they would bring the press corps out." [...] After a May 4, 2006 meeting, {{according}} to Gaubatz, he called a reporter at the Washington Times, who called Weldon's office to get confirmation. That inquiry, Gaubatz said, scuttled the project.|$|E
2500|$|Shmuel Tamir, Gruenwald's attorney, {{claimed that}} {{this was one of}} the main reasons he felt that Kastner <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a German collaborator, to save his family and perhaps for money. In Kastner's defense, Eli Reichenthal says that at the point when the three paratroopers reached Budapest, what {{motivated}} Kastner's decisions were the risk to the deal (which Kastner believed was real and therefore could save many more Jews) and Eichmann's blackmail (having Kastner's family together with the Hungarian Zionist leadership on the train). This was something Kastner could not reveal at the trial; [...] "I had reasons" [...] was his answer to Senesh's mother.|$|E
2500|$|First and foremost, {{the press}} was not barred from {{entering}} the convent grounds. Nor were they restricted in any way in their approach to the incident, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> shy of sensational. On 5 December, the Singapore Tiger Standard published on its front page a photograph of Maria standing holding hands with the Reverend Mother. There were several more pictures on page 2, under the headline: Bertha knelt before Virgin Mary Statue. The Malay press retorted. The Utusan Melayu published on 7 December three photographs of Maria weeping and being comforted by a nun, as well as articles about Maria's [...] "lonely and miserable" [...] life in the convent.|$|E

2500|$|The coup {{was welcomed}} by the public, {{according}} to numerous polls. Not {{only was the}} coup itself marked by favorable public opinion in several independent polls, but also public approval of the Fujimori administration jumped significantly {{in the wake of}} the coup. Fujimori often cited this public support in defending the coup, which he characterized as [...] "not a negation of real democracy, but on the contraryâ€¦ a search for an authentic transformation to assure a legitimate and effective democracy." [...] Fujimori believed that Peruvian democracy <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>nothing</b> more than [...] "a deceptive formality â€“ a facade".

2500|$|In {{response}} to the political deadlock, on 5 April 1992, Fujimori {{with the support of}} the military carried out a presidential coup, also known as the autogolpe (auto-coup or self-coup) or Fujigolpe (Fuji-coup) in Peru. He shut down Congress, suspended the constitution, and purged the judiciary. The coup was welcomed by the public, according to numerous polls. Not only was the coup itself marked by favorable public opinion in several independent polls, but also public approval of the Fujimori administration jumped significantly in the wake of the coup.
