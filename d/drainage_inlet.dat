40|$|The HY- 8 culvert {{hydraulic}} analysis {{program has been}} used by engineers for decades to design new culvert crossings and analyze existing culvert crossings. HY- 8 uses the methods described in FHWA’s HDS- 5 manual, last updated in January 2012. HY- 8 performs 1 -D Hydraulic analysis on culvert crossings with multiple culvert barrels. HY- 8 determines if an hydraulic jump occurs and if it does, the location of the jump. HY- 8 can analyze broken back culverts as well as horizontal and adversely sloped culverts. It is also used to design energy dissipation structures using methods described in FHWA’s HEC- 14 manual. This presentation will demonstrate the newest feature of HY- 8, Culvert Design for Aquatic Organism Passage as described in FHWA’s HEC- 26 manual. HY- 8 can be downloaded free of charge from the following FHWA Hydraulic Engineering website: [URL] The Hydraulic Toolbox is an intuitive computer program containing a suite of calculators that perform many of the routine hydrologic and hydraulic computations needed by highway hydraulic engineers and roadway designers. The following calculators are included in the previous version of the Toolbox: roadway hydrology, open channel flow, weir flow, pavement <b>drainage,</b> <b>inlet</b> capture/bypass, ditch inlet capture/bypass, detention basin routing, channel lining design (vegetation, rolled erosion control products, and rock), multiple riprap sizing applications (channel bank revetments; bridge piers, abutments, and guide banks; spur dikes; embankment overtopping; culvert outlets; open-bottom culverts; and wave attack), riprap filter design, gradation analyses via pebble count or digital image, ditch inlet capture/bypass calculator, and culvert assessment tool. Each of the calculators has the following support functions available: Plotting capabilities with printing and export options A Notes module for documenting information sources and/or input parameter qualifications A Report module for documenting all input and output data for any one or combination of calculators Hydraulic Toolbox also incorporates a profile system that allows the user to define their own riprap classification system and culvert assessment profiles. This presentation will demonstrate the utility and function of two of the most recent calculators added to the Toolbox, i. e. the Bridge Scour Calculator and the Horizontal Grade Inlet Analysis. This presentation will also cover the new map or plan view feature, which will allow the user to define a location for their calculators and visually represent their project.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in urban drainage modelling {{allow for a}} more realistic coupling of the two-dimensional (2 D) surface and one-dimensional (1 D) sub-surface drainage domain exchanging water through storm drain inlets instead of a sub-catchment approach based on manholes. Experience has shown, however, that comprehensive records of storm drain inlet locations are often missing or incomplete, preventing users accessing the full benefit of these modelling capabilities. Therefore, this study developed a GIS routine to generate synthetic storm drain inlet locations {{for the purpose of}} urban flood modelling. Hydrodynamic model results for a synthetically generated and surveyed storm drain inlet network were obtained using the CityCAT 1 D/ 2 D system. On a catchment scale the flow field (surface and flow captured by inlets) simulated by the network of synthetic storm <b>drainage</b> <b>inlets</b> shows satisfactory results when compared with that simulated using the actual network. The results also highlight the sensitivity of the inflows to relatively small changes in terms of the location of storm drain inlets and the effectiveness of storm drain inlets in ponding areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{activities}} {{summarized in}} this paper included the testing of three representative stormwater control devices that were located at storm <b>drainage</b> <b>inlets.</b> The two proprietary devices utilized screening and filtering (using filter fabric and a coarser mesh). A conventional catchbasin inlet, having a sump, was also tested for comparison. These devices were monitored in Stafford Township, NJ, to evaluate their removal effectiveness for stormwater pollutants. Twelve paired samples collected at each device represented composite inflow and outflow stormwater. The samples were split into filtered and unfiltered components for extensive analyses of conventional and toxic pollutants. The experimental design was capable of identifying significant pollutant removals of at least 15 to 50 % at a 95 % confidence level, depending on the pollutant. The only significant pollutant removals were found during tests of a conventional catchbasin having a suitable sump. The median removal rates were about 30 % for suspended solids, about 40 % for turbidity, about 15 % for color, and about 20 % for total solids. No other pollutants {{were found to be}} significantly reduced. However, the coarse screened inlet device was found to significantly reduce the discharges of trash and other large debris. Unfortunately, flows passing through trapped material caught on the screen had increased concentrations of suspended solids and volatile solids, probably due to washing of decomposing large organic material through the screen. The filter fabrics tested in the laboratory showed about 50 % removals for suspended solids and COD, but they rapidly clogged, significantly shortening their run times and minimizing any benefit from their use. This research was conducted in partial fulfillment of cooperative agreement no. CR 819573 under the sponsorship of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency...|$|R

40|$|Pluvial {{flooding}} {{in urban areas}} may derive from the limited or temporarily reduced efficiency of surface drainage, even when the underlying storm sewers are properly designed. This study focuses {{on the impact of}} uncertainties in the operational condition of the surface drainage system on pluvial flood hazard. The flood propagation model FLURB- 2 D is implemented on a selected study area in the town of Genoa (Italy). Synthetic hyetographs based on the Chicago and bivariate copula methods with suitable return periods are used as input. While simulating the design rainfall, inlet operational conditions are varied stochastically using a Monte Carlo approach. Results confirm that microtopography has the potential to impact the efficiency of surface drainage and consequently to produce local flooding, with significant water depth in zones of flow concentration. Furthermore, the derived inundation maps allow the highlighting of areas with insufficient design of the surface <b>drainage</b> system (<b>inlet</b> size and positioning) ...|$|R

40|$|Background & Objectives: Congenital heart {{diseases}} are neglected especially in world’s poorest nations {{and appear to}} be ignored and unexplored dimension of health. The exact prevalence and spectrum of congenital heart diseases in Nepal is largely unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the local experience on the magnitude and the pattern of congenital heart disease in order to increase the awareness of the public and health policy makers on its burden in Nepal. Materials & Methods: This is an observational hospital based study carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Eastern Nepal. The duration of this study was from April 2015 to July 2016. The echocardiography reports of all patients clinically suspected of having congenital heart disease were retrieved, and their diagnostic details were extracted. Only patients of day one of life to 14 years of age were included. Congenital heart diseases like bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse and various inherited cardiomyopathies were excluded. Results: A total of 330 echocardiograms were performed for clinically suspected congenital heart disease.   The mean age of study population was 22. 31 ± 34. 08 months with male to female ratio of 1. 2 : 1. 23 % of clinically suspected congenital heart disease cases turned out to have normal echocardiography. Acyanotic congenital heart disease was most common (81. 5 %) followed by cyanotic congenital heart disease (14. 2 %) and obstructive congenital heart disease (4. 3 %). Atrial septal defect was found to be the most common form of acyanotic congenital heart disease (52 %) which was followed by ventricular septal defect (28. 8 %) and patent ductus arteriosus (14. 8 %). Tetralogy of Fallot and double outlet right ventricle were the most common form of cyanotic CHD representing 44. 4 % of all cyanotic patients. Pulmonary stenosis was the most common obstructive congenital heart disease observed in this study population (63. 6 %). Rarer entities, like d-transposition of great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries, various types of total anomalous pulmonary venous <b>drainage,</b> double <b>inlet</b> left ventricle, interrupted aortic arch, Shone complex, etc. were also observed, however represented only the minority of the study population. Conclusion: The spectrum of congenital heart disease seen in this study very likely and only represents the tip of the iceberg. Public awareness programmes and training of health care personnel needs to be emphasized in order to facilitate its early diagnosis and improve its outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{cities and}} {{communities}} are experiencing ever growing {{problems related to}} urban pluvial flooding. This is due primarily to inefficient <b>drainage</b> <b>inlets</b> and overloaded sewer systems. In fact, existing drainage systems rapidly reach their maximum capacity and tend to work pressurized even {{in the case of}} medium-entity storms. Damage and losses caused by flood events in urban areas, primarily life and economic losses and traffic disruption, can be significant. Moreover, this situation is destined to worsen in the immediate future due to the fervent urbanization process and the ongoing climate changes. This research is therefore aimed at investigating this type of event, because to guarantee an efficient working of the drainage systems is a prerequisite in modern societies. Specifically the broader objective of the study is to contribute to an improvement of urban flood management by enhancing urban drainage modeling and storm motion forecasting. In order to achieve such scope the following detailed tasks were performed: 1. Investigation of the various LiDAR Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) available for the drainage modeling of a study area. From literature review it is evident that a great effort has been made to improve existing hydraulic models and to develop new ones. Nevertheless, little interest has been devoted to evaluate the effects of the use of different available LiDAR DTMs on hydraulic modeling. The research is therefore motivated by the need to know how LiDAR DTMs with different detail scale (LiDAR DSM first, LiDAR DSM last and LiDAR DTM bare earth with overlapped building) can affect the hydraulic modeling of drainage networks. Every DTM is in fact characterized by a variable presence of non-ground surface features, such as cars, buildings or vegetation, that will influence surely the hydraulic response of the urban catchment differently. Consequently every data set was studied by GIS-based analysis methods, such as calculation of surface depressions, in order to evaluate whether the consideration of all the non-ground features is necessary for hydraulic modeling purposes, or whether the use of a less detailed LiDAR DTM, adequately improved, could be an approachable solution. 2. Analysis of improvements brought by a dual drainage approach in simulating the behavior of a drainage network during extreme rain events, compared to the use of a conventional methodology. Another question that justifies the work carried out by the author and presented in the thesis is related to the need of improving available urban drainage modeling. Most of these models are in fact based on process simplifications that are far removed from reality, such as assuming that when water leaves the sewer it is stored in a virtual reservoir and does not follow the natural flow paths, i. e. the effect of local topography is neglected. This approach provides a very biased image of flooding process. Consequently the research was aimed at quantifying capabilities and limits of two urban drainage modeling with diverse sophistication level. The first one was based on the classical hypothesis according to which the drainage system is composed only of the sewer system, that is to consider that stormwater, once entered the sewer system, can no longer leave this system coming back to the surface. Instead the second one was based on the dual drainage approach, i. e. it was assumed that the urban drainage system was composed of a surface network and the sewer network. The evaluation of the best approach was performed by comparing the water volume distributions in the sewer network and the number of surcharged sewer trunks resulting from hydraulic simulations. Specifically the issues relative {{to the development of the}} most complicated model, that is the dual drainage one, were studied in more detail: the influence of buildings and DTM resolution on the surface network definition, and the introduction of criteria to be taken into account for pond filtering parameters were the topics deepened through the use of an innovative methodology, the AOFD tool (Automatic Overland Flow Delineation). 3. Study of the potentials of a dense network of rain gauges in forecasting storm movements for flood prevention purposes. This research was performed because, currently, methods for rainfall prediction are mainly based on radar measurements. However rain gauge data are often available whereas radar data are not. Furthermore radar instruments enable the investigation of convective cells motion, whereas rain gauges data allow the analysis of the movement of rainfall patterns recorded on the ground, that is more important for hydraulic modeling. Consequently storm movement parameters, velocity and direction, were derived by analyzing rainfall data trough available storm tracking procedures. The method proposed by Diskin was tested and, in particular, the extent to which the choice of the reference feature in the hyetograph and the location of the recording stations inside the catchment can affect the results of the methodology was studied in detail. The quality of the elaborations was estimated by comparing the results obtained with other physical phenomena which are related to storm movement, such as wind movement data. In particular statistical analysis, based on the computation of the correlation coefficient and root mean square deviation between storm and wind data sets, were performed. With the results from the research presented herein, it is expected that: 1. DTM enhancement methods generate hydraulically corrected DTMs that can potentially lead to improvements in urban pluvial flood modeling. 2. more realistic simulations of the drainage system are performed by developing dual drainage models. In this way engineers could aim at minimizing both the costs of construction of new works and maintenance of existing structures by evaluating systematically the effectiveness of all the possible design solutions. Actually, the use of such a modeling will have to push them to optimize the working conditions of both the surface and sewer networks when evaluating flood control and mitigation measures. 3. rain gauges are considered as valid alternatives in rainfall movement prediction, to be taken into account in areas where radar measurements cannot be obtained yet. In fact the results of the elaborations will demonstrate how such instruments, that are more approachable than radar ones for economical and practical reasons, are very useful in forecasting the movements that future storm events can make in a monitored area. Similar information could be also used in connection with hydraulic models, previously calibrated for the same study area,in order to evaluate in advance the possible flood-prone areas. In addition the analysis of the results, obtained by considering an ever decreasing number of recording stations, will give interesting information to municipalities having limited budget for equipping themselves with an adequate number of such instruments.
