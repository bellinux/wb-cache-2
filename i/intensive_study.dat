5|$|Beyond architecture, Burges {{designed}} metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, {{furniture and}} stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, {{a series of}} lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. However the revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century {{has led to a}} renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.|$|E
5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, in 2008, the GOI {{adopted the}} World Health Organization {{standards}} for measuring and monitoring the child growth and development, {{both for the}} ICDS and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM).

25|$|During the 1970s, the College also established, with generous {{assistance}} from the Mellon Foundation, a now widely imitated freshman seminar program. It allows first-year students to participate, with faculty who also serve as their academic advisers, in <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> of a topic of hopefully mutual interest. Interdisciplinary study became a focus of the curriculum as well, {{with the creation of}} majors in behavioral studies, neuroscience and Russian Studies, and minors in such fields as American studies, arts administration and museology, business management, dance, public health and writing.|$|E

While there she also devoted <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> to the masenqo, a traditional one-stringed bowed instrument. While in Addis Ababa, she spent six months as a Fulbright Professor at Addis Ababa University in the Theater Arts Department, which {{was at that time}} under the chairmanship of Tesfaye Gessesse.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of possible explanations for flying saucers have been put forward. One {{of the most common}} states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, hubcaps and dustbin lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after <b>intensive</b> <b>study.</b> An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed all tests when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The social {{conscience}} that {{was raised in}} the early 19th century helped to elevate the awareness of mental illness and its treatment. A leading advocate of reform for mental illness was Dorothea Dix, a Massachusetts woman who made an <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> of the conditions that the mentally ill were kept in. Dix's report to the Massachusetts state legislature along with the development of the Kirkbride Plan helped to alleviate the miserable conditions for many of the mentally ill. Although these facilities often fell short of their intended purpose, reformers continued to follow Dix's advocacy and call for increased study and treatment of mental illness.|$|E
25|$|The {{corresponding}} percentile of each scaled score {{varies from}} test to test—for example, in 2003, a scaled score of 800 in both {{sections of the}} SAT Reasoning Test corresponded to a percentile of 99.9, while a scaled score of 800 in the SAT Physics Test corresponded to the 94th percentile. The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are due {{to the content of}} the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> (often {{in the form of an}} AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only those who know they will perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.|$|E
25|$|In {{the area}} of Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve local populations were deemed extinct in 1998. The populations of {{butterflies}} at Jasper Ridge had {{been the subject of}} <b>intensive</b> <b>study</b> and research at the lead of Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich. Ehrlich had studied the Jasper Ridge populations since 1960 and researchers were able to examine 70 years of climate data and conclude that gigantic fluctuations in local climate probably hastened the demise of the Jasper Ridge Bay checkerspot populations. Ehrlich contends that prior to Spanish settlement of California the Bay checkerspots were almost certainly ubiquitous in California. It was the inadvertent import of invasive plant species in the hay that settlers fed cattle that brought unnatural competition for the native plants that sustained the Bay checkerspot.|$|E
