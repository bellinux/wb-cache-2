5|$|The organisms which parasitize <b>fungi</b> {{are known}} as mycoparasitic organisms. Certain species of the Pythium genus, which are oomycetes, have {{potential}} as biocontrol agents against certain <b>fungi.</b> <b>Fungi</b> can also act as mycoparasites or antagonists of other <b>fungi,</b> such as Hypomyces chrysospermus, which grows on bolete mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|A fungus (plural: <b>fungi</b> or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of {{eukaryotic}} organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, <b>Fungi,</b> which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most <b>fungi</b> are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. <b>Fungi</b> include symbionts of plants, animals, or other <b>fungi</b> and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. <b>Fungi</b> perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, <b>fungi</b> have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by <b>fungi</b> are used industrially and in detergents. <b>Fungi</b> are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. <b>Fungi</b> can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E

5|$|Although {{commonly}} {{included in}} botany curricula and textbooks, <b>fungi</b> are {{more closely related}} to animals than to plants and are placed with the animals in the monophyletic group of opisthokonts.

5|$|<b>Fungi</b> are {{the sources}} of many types of {{medicinal}} drug including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and statins.

5|$|<b>Fungi</b> create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. <b>Fungi,</b> mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. <b>Fungi</b> cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. <b>Fungi</b> are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings.

The <b>fungus</b> causes brown rot of pine wood, in which {{cellulose}} and hemicellulose are broken down, leading to brown discoloration and shrinkage of wood.

5|$|In agriculture, <b>fungi</b> may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other <b>fungi</b> via the competitive exclusion principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other <b>fungi</b> that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these <b>fungi</b> in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic <b>fungi</b> can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic <b>fungi</b> of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or forage grasses with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>fungi</b> are parasites on plants, animals (including humans), {{and other}} <b>fungi.</b> Serious {{pathogens}} of many cultivated plants causing extensive damage and losses to {{agriculture and forestry}} include the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, tree pathogens such as Ophiostoma ulmi and Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease and Cryphonectria parasitica responsible for chestnut blight, and plant pathogens in the genera Fusarium, Ustilago, Alternaria, and Cochliobolus. Some carnivorous <b>fungi,</b> like Paecilomyces lilacinus, are predators of nematodes, which they capture using an array of specialized structures such as constricting rings or adhesive nets.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>fungi</b> have {{important}} symbiotic relationships with organisms from most {{if not all}} Kingdoms. These interactions can be mutualistic or antagonistic in nature, {{or in the case of}} commensal <b>fungi</b> are of no apparent benefit or detriment to the host.|$|E

5|$|Most <b>fungi</b> lack an {{efficient}} {{system for the}} long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some <b>fungi,</b> such as Armillaria, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar {{to the roots of}} plants. As eukaryotes, <b>fungi</b> possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure <b>fungi</b> and animals do not have. <b>Fungi</b> produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the <b>fungi</b> and plants.|$|E
5|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} between {{plants and}} <b>fungi</b> {{is one of}} the most well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with <b>fungi</b> and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.|$|E
5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal <b>fungi</b> that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil. This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the <b>fungi</b> with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the <b>fungi</b> actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
