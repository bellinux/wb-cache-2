500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] is an uptempo power pop song, with guitar {{lines and}} pop hooks. Critics made {{comparisons}} with works by Kelly Clarkson, particularly the song [...] "Since U Been Gone". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] {{is written in}} the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of F5. It has a basic sequence of F–Dm–Dm–Gm/B–F as its chord progression. The song's lyrics chronicle the protagonist's on-off relationship with an indecisive boy as she sings that [...] "Something about you is so addictive". Lovato explained: [...] "So it's about, basically, being in a relationship where you break-up and you make-up, and you break-up and it's like 'Here we go again, we just <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> over and over'." ...|$|E

I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Milliken {{prevented}} {{an early}} federal election by breaking a tie {{vote on the}} second reading of Bill C-48, {{an amendment to the}} 2005 federal budget, which was a confidence motion.

The Speaker does not vote except {{in the case of a}} tie, and must vote, by precedent, in such a way as to keep the matter open for further consideration if possible (i.e. passing C-48 to allow further debate for a third reading).

5000|$|There are {{different}} methods of singulation, {{but the most}} common is [...] "tree walking", which involves asking all tags with a serial number that starts with either a 1 or 0 to respond.

It <b>keeps</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> until it finds the tag it is looking for. Note that if the reader has {{some idea of what}} tags it wishes to interrogate, it can considerably optimise the search order. For example with some designs of tags, if a reader already suspects certain tags to be present then those tags can be instructed to remain silent, then tree walked without interference from them, and then finally they can be queried individually.|$|R

50|$|The HUSS Swing Around is an {{amusement}} park ride formerly manufactured by HUSS. It was HUSS Maschinenfabrik's first ride model, debuted in 1969.

They <b>keep</b> on <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> during the ride, in bigger and bigger increments until the very end, where they all swing out, using pneumatic pressure. Most parks require riders to be 42 inches tall to ride; anyone under 48 inches tall must ride with an adult.|$|R

During the process a series of recurrent themes emerged that were explored in the catalogue accompanying the final exhibition. Themes included; the role of the image, frameworks for difference, one medium to another, controlled collaboration. As described in the catalogue: "The masters was/is the chance to engage with practice from the outside. What is it, we do? Why do we do it? What <b>does</b> <b>this</b> tell us about ourselves? And then - Should we <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> things <b>this</b> way?" " Ultimately our design practice evolves or withers on the strength of communal understanding; without the ability to be self reflexive the narrative that drives our approach remains singular and stagnates; The Masters by practice has set in train a process of recording and self renewal. " "What we came to understand through the conversations initiated by this programme was that as much as any building project we had designed our practice; bringing our personal and shared experiences from other practices to form the idea of an entity we called tandem.

50|$|Quantum mechanics, however, {{provides}} a ready explanation, via {{the mechanism of}} quantum tunnelling. The quantum tunnelling theory of alpha decay, independently developed by George Gamow and Ronald Wilfred Gurney and Edward Condon in 1928, was hailed as a very striking confirmation of quantum theory. Essentially, the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus by quantum tunnelling its way out. Gurney and Condon made the following observation in their paper on it:It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary ‘instability’ of the nucleus; but in the following note it is pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence {{of the laws of}} quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis... Much has been written of the explosive violence with which the &alpha;-particle is hurled from its place in the nucleus. But from the process pictured above, one would rather say that the &alpha;-particle almost slips away unnoticed.The theory makes the assumptions that the alpha particle can be considered an independent particle within a nucleus that is in constant motion, but held within the nucleus by nuclear forces. There is, in addition, a very small but decidedly non-zero probability that it will tunnel its way out. An alpha particle with a speed of 1.5&times;107 m/s within a nuclear diameter of approximately 10−14 m will thus collide against the potential barrier of the nuclear force more than 1021 times per second, and yet for some radioisotopes it will need to <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> for as long as 13 billion years before managing to escape, so the probability of escape is extremely low.|$|E
