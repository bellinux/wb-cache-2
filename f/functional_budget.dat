The IMF considers public expenditure management (PEM) {{to be an}} important instrument for reducing poverty. Tracking changes in the composition of overall expenditure of the budget should demonstrate that resources released through the Enhanced HIPC Ini~tiative facilitate an increase in poverty-reduction spending. The article is devoted to two tools, budget classification and public accounting, within the context of French speaking African countries. Budget classification comprises economic classification, administra~tive classification, and functional classification.

The National Health System budget in 2002 was of over 28, 000 million Euros. The bulk of the budget, over 90 %, goes towards patient care and treatment, with specialised care, and specifically hospitals the main destination for funds. Hospitals constitute an important part of the tertiary sector with a series of specific characteristics, unknown to many, that make them different from the other companies in the services sector.

On the other hand, reducing too much test power might lead to test escape and reliability problems. Thus, to avoid these issues, test power has to map the power consumed during functional mode. Existing works target the generation of functional test programs able to maximize the {{power consumption}} in functional mode of microprocessor cores. The obtained power consumption {{will be used as}} threshold to tune the power consumed during testing. This paper investigates the impact of re-using such functional test programs for testing purposes. We propose to apply them by exploiting existing DfT architecture to maximize the delay fault coverage. Then, we combine them with the classical at-speed LOC and LOS delay fault testing schemes to further increase the fault coverage.

40|$|This thesis explores {{accounting}} {{change in}} UK hospitals, from 1880 to 1974. Using a processual approach (Porter, 1981 Pettigrew, 1987 Bhimani, 1993 Dawson, 2003) to historical investigation {{the focus is}} on three accounting 'events': the introduction of Burdett's uniform system of accounts in 1893 the introduction of annual departmental costing in 1956, and the introduction of <b>functional</b> <b>budgeting</b> in 1974. There is a duality to the research which explores both the role of change agents and the contextual environment within which change takes place. For the first event, contextual factors such as the growth in hospital care, early 'managerialism' and moral concerns are first explored. These are identified as important in stimulating interest in accounting change, from both internal and external groups and institutions, but it is internal groups that take control of accounting reform. It is argued that economic, professional and technological forces were crucial in the spread of these accounts. The second event takes place after the nationalisation of voluntary hospitals in 1948 with an emphasis on the process of change after nationalisation. The interaction of dominant individuals, groups and institutions, as well as political and economic forces are all explored in an effort to explain the how and why of change. The role of the medical profession in the departmentalisation debate is discussed, together with possible explanations for the reluctance to adopt new management accounting techniques. The final event was preceded by a renewed interest in the concept of efficiency (Klein, 1995) and the thesis examines a number of managerial initiatives between 1956 and 1974. It suggests that there was a cautious approach to change among both accounting practitioners and civil servants and this, together with a disappointing response to previous accounting reform, combines to prevent more radical accounting change. The thesis adds to the limited information on public sector accounting and suggests that the controversies surrounding the introduction, and use, of 'new' accounting technologies are part of a long process which {{can be traced back to}} the pre-nationalised voluntary hospitals and constitute a recurring theme throughout the life of the NHS...|$|R
40|$|The {{architectural}} {{layout design}} problem, which {{is concerned with}} the finding of the best adjacencies between functional spaces among many possible ones under given constraints, can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and can be solved with an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). We present functional spaces and their adjacencies in form of graphs and propose an EA called EvoArch that works with a graph-encoding scheme. EvoArch encodes topological configuration in the adjacency matrices of the graphs that they represent and its reproduction operators operate on these adjacency matrices. In order to explore the large search space of graph topologies, these reproduction operators are designed to be unbiased so that all nodes in a graph have equal chances of being selected to be swapped or mutated. To evaluate the fitness of a graph, EvoArch makes use of a fitness function that takes into consideration preferences for adjacencies between different <b>functional</b> spaces, <b>budget</b> and other design constraints. By means of different experiments, we show that EvoArch can be a very useful tool for architectural layout design tasks. Department of Computin...|$|R

At the same time, there still remains the issue of linking budget expenditures to specific results achieved by specific budget programs which defines the necessity of applying modern approaches to carrying out M&E. This study presents an analysis of the current state of M&E in Ukrainian public expenditure program management and offers some solutions which could improve its functioning.

40|$|Nursing {{services}} are a costly {{item in the}} hospital budget, yet their justification is usually based on precedent and anecdote. Patient classification systems enable quantification of the nursing load on a daily basis. This methodology for determining {{the size of the}} nursing staff, however, has not gained widespread use because it tends to formalize existing staffing patterns. At the Johns Hopkins Hospital, physicians and nurses drew up a list of activities that should be performed for patients and that need to be considered in budgeting for nursing services. The largest and most variable components of the nursing workload are the tasks specified by physicians' orders and the nursing care plan. A computerized information system which communicates these orders {{can also be used to}} quantify these components of the nursing workload, since standard times to perform these tasks have been documented. The variability of these tasks from day to day and from patient to patient is the source of most of the problems of staffing. Other components of the workload, such as patient education, depend on the nursing program desired and must be added separately. Budget decisions can then be based upon the specific nursing functions which the hospital desires to perform. The technique of <b>functional</b> activity <b>budgeting</b> can also be used for the utilization review of physicians' use of nursing services...|$|R
40|$|This unit is {{designed}} to provide you with an understanding of the use of management accounting information within a business organisation. You will develop abilities and learn the financial techniques used to assist decision making in relation to costing, budgeting, pricing and investments. Specifically, you will learn how to prepare an operating statement to cost a product, process or service. You will also consider the use of alternative costing methodologies (full/absorption versus marginal) within the decision-making processes of organisations. In addition you will learn how to compare budgeted activity with actual activity and analyse the resultant variances. Finally, the unit will consider capital investment projects and the basic techniques used to estimate potential returns. There are four outcomes within this unit. Each outcome {{is designed}} to provide you with essential knowledge and understanding regarding a specific area of management accounting. Outcome 1 : You will be provided with skills and develop abilities in the preparation of an operating statement. You will be shown initially how to classify costs between direct and indirect costs, and between variable and fixed costs. Secondly, you will be shown techniques to allocate and absorb overheads to the operating activities of an organisation. Thirdly, techniques associated with the determination of profit (using mark-up and margin) will be shown. These areas will be collated to provide you with sufficient knowledge and understanding to produce an operating statement for an organisation. Outcome 2 : The focus is on the development of an understanding of marginal costing and its application in relation to the provision of relevant data to inform short-term decision making. A comparison of different costing methodologies (full/absorption versus marginal) will be made. You will be encouraged to calculate the effect of changing costs and revenue levels (associated with alternative courses of action) on total contribution. You will also be shown how to calculate break-even point and the number of units required to achieve the desired level of profit. Outcome 3 : You will be shown how to construct the <b>functional</b> <b>budgets</b> of an organisation, although this will not be formally assessed. This understanding will assist you to develop skills and abilities in the comparison of budgeted activity with actual activity. You will be shown how to construct a flexed budget and to determine the resultant variances as well as the possible causes of the variances. It would be useful if a suitable spreadsheet package were used to aid calculation of the variances, although you will be shown the mechanics involved in calculating the appropriate variances. Outcome 4 : You will develop skills and abilities in the application of investment appraisal techniques (both traditional and discounted cash flow) as an aid to longerterm decision making. This will include an examination of the effects of limited funds on selecting projects as well as the normal appraisal techniques. Once again, the use of a suitable spreadsheet package would be a useful tool to aid calculation of the net present value factors. The effects of taxation will be excluded from the analysis. ...|$|R

Animal-attached sensors provide invaluable data to describe behavior of cryptic species, such as cetaceans, and are increasingly {{used to assess}} anthropogenic disturbance effects. Tag deployment and handling may itself alter the behavior of study animals {{and there is a}} need to assess if and when behavior recovers to an undisturbed level. Not all behavioral changes have fitness consequences, and our goal is to derive metrics that can be linked to fitness implications, such as time and energy allocation to different functional behaviors. Here we detail an approach that incorporates biological knowledge and multiple streams of tag-recorded data in a hidden state-switching model to estimate time series of functional behavioral st ates for 12 sperm whales off Norway. Foraging, recovery and resting states were specified in the hidden state model by state-dependent likelihood structures. Comparison of hidden state models revealed a parsimonious set of input time series, and supported the inclusion of a less informed 'silent active' state. There was a high agreement between state estimates and expert classifications. We then used the estimated states in time series models to test three hypotheses for behavioral change during suction-cup tag deployment procedures: change in behavioral states, change in prey capture attempts and locomotion cost, given behavioral state. Sperm whales spent 34 % less time at the sea surface and 60 % more time in non-foraging silent active state in the presence of the tag boat (''tagging period'' 0. 1 - 2. 8 h) than during post-tagging baseline period (1. 8 - 20. 8 h). No comparable pre-tagging baseline data were available. Nevertheless, time-decaying models of tagging effects were not retained in model selection, indicating a short-term effect that ceased immediately after the tagging period. We did not find changes in energetic proxies, given behavioral state, however changes in <b>functional</b> state <b>budget</b> indicate costs in terms of lost feeding opportunities and recovery time at surface. These results are useful to quantitatively identify data periods that should not be considered baseline behavior within tag recordings. This functional state approach proves effective to quantify disturbance in terms of time and energy allocation that is based upon general principles that can be applied to other species and biologging applications.
