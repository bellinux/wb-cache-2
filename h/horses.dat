5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} <b>horses</b> {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million <b>horses,</b> donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas.

Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with <b>horses.</b> In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as <b>horses.</b> Logging with <b>horses</b> can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E

5|$|Although popular legends {{claim that}} Sable Island <b>horses</b> swam ashore from the island's many shipwrecks, or were {{introduced}} by 16th-century Portuguese explorers, {{this is not}} supported by historical or genetic evidence. In reality, the <b>horses</b> were deliberately introduced to the island during the 18th century. The first recorded <b>horses</b> were brought by a Boston clergyman, the Reverend Andrew Le Mercier, in 1737 but most were stolen by passing mariners. The present-day <b>horses</b> are thought by most historians and scientists to have descended mostly from <b>horses</b> seized by the British from the Acadians during the Expulsion of the Acadians. The Acadian <b>horses</b> were descendents of several shipments of French <b>horses,</b> including members of the Breton, Andalusian and Norman breeds, later crossed with <b>horses</b> from New England, including Spanish Barbs. The Boston merchant and shipowner Thomas Hancock purchased some Acadian <b>horses</b> and transported them to Sable Island in 1760, where they grazed the island as pasture.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{investigate}} the frequency of sensitization to <b>horse</b> allergens and clinical symptoms in <b>horse</b> riders. Material and Methods: A total of 42 <b>horse</b> riders and 50 healthy individuals were examined by means of skin prick tests for a panel of <b>horse</b> and common animal allergens, and pulmonary function tests were done by spirometry. Results: The rate of sensitization to <b>horse</b> allergens was 31 % as proven by the skin prick test in <b>horse</b> riders whereas <b>horse</b> sensitization was not seen in the control group. Occupational allergy symptoms were reported by 19 <b>horse</b> riders. Two <b>horse</b> riders with no history of clinical symptoms showed positive skin reactions to <b>horse</b> allergens. Conclusions: To decrease the high risk of occupational sensitization among <b>horse</b> riders, workplace conditions should be improved to reduce the load of airborne <b>horse</b> allergens...|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray.

5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, <b>horses</b> bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with <b>horses</b> that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger <b>horses</b> from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign <b>horses</b> were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish <b>horses</b> were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin <b>horses</b> with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred <b>horses</b> to create cavalry <b>horses.</b> Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred <b>horses</b> created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling <b>horses,</b> and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Carrossier Normand was considered the best carriage <b>horses</b> available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage <b>horses,</b> coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster <b>horses</b> in the breed, used for sport, and larger <b>horses,</b> used for agricultural work. The lighter <b>horses</b> eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and Anglo-Norman (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier <b>horses</b> became the Norman Cob. In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. When the original Carrossier Normand became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.|$|E

5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process <b>horses</b> are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control.
