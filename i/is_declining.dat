5|$|The {{production}} function is concave in two dimensions and quasi-convex in three dimensions. This {{means that the}} longer Robinson works, the more coconuts {{he will be able}} to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour <b>is</b> <b>declining.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the brown}} honeyeater <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> {{in some areas}} such as the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, overall its {{population}} levels and distribution are sufficient to have it described by the IUCN as being of least concern for conservation.|$|E
25|$|The numbers {{one through}} four <b>are</b> <b>declined.</b> Éka <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a pronominal adjective, though the dual form does not occur. Dvá appears {{only in the}} dual. Trí and catúr <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> irregularly.|$|R

For example, for mortuus, mortua, mortuum (dead), mortua <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> {{like a regular}} first-declension noun (such as puella (girl)), mortuus <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a regular second-declension masculine noun (such as dominus (lord, master)), and mortuum <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a regular second-declension neuter noun (such as auxilium (help)).|$|R
5|$|Women are {{football}} spectators, watching live {{games in}} rural and remote {{areas of the}} country. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by the African Union of Broadcasting and Supersport International.

5|$|The brown honeyeater {{population}} <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> in the Wheatbelt {{region of}} Western Australia {{as a result}} of the clearing of native vegetation. Numbers are increasing in urban areas, particularly in parks and gardens and around farms; however, the new habitats have increased the incidences of death from cats, cars and collisions with windows. Overall the population is sufficiently large and widespread for the brown honeyeater to be considered by the IUCN to be of least concern for conservation.|$|E
5|$|The {{natural range}} of Potamon fluviatile is highly fragmented, and covers parts of many {{countries}} with a Mediterranean coastline. It {{is found in}} mainland Italy and on the Balkan Peninsula from Dalmatia to the Axios River in Greece. It is also found {{on a number of}} islands, including Sicily, Malta and Gozo, the Ionian Islands, Aegean Islands, Sporades and Andros in the Cyclades. Although the species as a whole is widespread, it <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> in numbers, and these insular populations are particularly vulnerable.|$|E
50|$|Masculine {{indefinite}} adjectives <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> like nouns of {{the first}} declension, and feminine indefinite adjectives <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> like nouns of the fourth declension.|$|R

Other numerals such as διακόσιοι (diakosioi, [...] "two hundred"), τριακόσιοι (triakosioi, [...] "three hundred") etc. and χίλιοι (chilioi, [...] "thousand") <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> regularly like adjectives. Other numerals including two <b>are</b> not <b>declined.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} {{is not well}} known {{and appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is almost certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management strategy {{is similar to the}} impact of such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This strategy <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} has a large, {{currently}} unquantified range; its world population is also unknown, but includes an estimated 52–96 million individuals in Europe. Although population trends {{have not been}} evaluated, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that <b>is,</b> <b>declining</b> more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species' conservation status is evaluated {{at the global level}} as being of least concern.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adjectives}} whose suffix is -ώδης, -ώλης or -ήρης <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> like εὐώδης. The rest {{raise the}} accent in several forms. These adjectives <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> this way: ...|$|R
5000|$|... fruma <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> weak like blinda [...] "blind" [...] {{except that}} the {{feminine}} <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> according to the ei-stems like managei [...] "multitude", e.g. feminine nominative frumei.|$|R

Ūnus, ūna, ūnum <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a 1st and 2nd declension pronoun with -īus in the genitive, and -ī in the dative. Duo <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> irregularly, tria <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a 3rd declension plural adjective, -centī (hundred) numerals decline like 1st and 2nd declension adjectives, and mīlia <b>is</b> <b>declined</b> like a 3rd declension i-stem neuter noun: ...|$|R
5|$|While the long-toed {{salamander}} {{is classified as}} least concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development negatively affect the salamander's habitat and have put new perspectives and priorities into its conservation biology. Conservation priorities focus at the population level of diversity, which <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> at rates ten times that of species extinction. Population level diversity is what provides ecosystem services, such as the keystone role that salamanders play in the soil ecosystems, including the nutrient cycling that supports wetland and forested ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but lately, have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector <b>is</b> <b>declining.</b> Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E

5000|$|Adjectives <b>are</b> rarely <b>declined</b> for any purpose. They can <b>be</b> <b>declined</b> {{for number}} {{when they are}} used as {{substitutes}} for nouns (as in, [...] "I'll take the reds", meaning [...] "I'll take the red ones" [...] or as shorthand for [...] "I'll take the red wines", for example). Also the demonstrative determiners this and that <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> for number, as these and those. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can <b>be,</b> <b>declined</b> for gender, at least in writing: blond (male) and blonde (female). Adjectives <b>are</b> not <b>declined</b> for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The article is never regarded as declined in Modern English, although formally, the words that and possibly she correspond to forms of the predecessor of the (sē m., þæt n., sēo f.) as it <b>was</b> <b>declined</b> in Old English.|$|R
5|$|Numbers have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel {{is thought to be}} due to pesticides. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky. There are indications that this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.|$|E
5|$|Osteopathic {{physicians}} have historically entered primary care fields {{at a higher}} rate than their M.D. counterparts. Some osteopathic organizations make claims to a greater emphasis on the importance of primary care within osteopathic medicine. However, the proportion of osteopathic students choosing primary care fields, like that of their M.D. peers, <b>is</b> <b>declining.</b> Currently, only one in five osteopathic medical students enters a family medicine residency (the largest primary care field). In 2004, only 32% of osteopathic seniors planned careers in any primary care field; this percentage was down from a peak in 1996 of more than 50%.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry <b>is</b> <b>declining,</b> despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
50|$|Adjectives exist, like in English, with positive, {{comparative}} and superlative forms. Superlative adjectives <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> {{according to}} {{the first and second}} declension noun paradigm, but comparative adjectives <b>are</b> <b>declined</b> {{according to the}} third declension noun paradigm.|$|R

5|$|The tansy beetle (Chrysolina graminis) is {{a species}} of leaf beetle. It {{measures}} 7.7–10.5mm in length and has a characteristic bright metallic green colouration. The common name derives from the tansy plant on which they often feed as both larvae and adults. In addition to the nominotypical subspecies, which repeats the specific name, C. graminis graminis, there are five further distinct subspecies of tansy beetle, which, collectively, have a Palearctic distribution, although {{in the majority of}} countries where it is found the species <b>is</b> <b>declining.</b> In the United Kingdom it is designated as 'Nationally Rare' and this localised population, centred on York, North Yorkshire, {{has been the subject of}} much recent research.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} mainly by river engineering {{and water pollution}} in densely populated regions. The species' population trend is overall stable, but <b>is</b> <b>declining</b> in some areas (Germany), while in other areas it is expanding (for example in the Danube river). In the Rhine river during the 1970s, Theodoxus fluviatilis came close to local extinction because of water pollution. Subsequently, the water quality improved {{for more than two}} decades, leading to a recovery. Even so, the species became extinct in the Rhine for an unknown reason in the late 1990s. Since 2006, Theodoxus fluviatilis recolonized the Rhine, probably via ship transport through the Main-Danube Canal. An analysis based on cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene has shown that the recolonization probably originated in the Danube.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{are also}} found with the {{spelling}} of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in American English and British spelling. For example, meter and liter {{are used in the}} United States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in other varieties of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage <b>is</b> <b>declining.</b>|$|E
