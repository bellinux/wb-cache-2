25|$|A book of {{the show}} has become all but necessary, if only {{to allow us to}} ingest this {{information}} at normal brain speed, and because such fine and creative research genuinely deserves to be captured in print.

There are actually about 20 such books out this year, all asking these quirky questions (Do Sheep Shrink In The Rain? Do Fish Drink Water?), all piled up in Waterstones, making book-buyers feel a bit depressed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the eighth}} season of TV series Supernatural, protagonists Dean and Sam Winchester {{discover}} that Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) {{has been living}} in isolation for centuries because he became disgusted with Heaven's actions. Although he initially presents himself as an ally in the brothers' quests to seal up Heaven and Hell after they find him again, Metatron later turns against them, tricking their angelic ally Castiel into completing a ritual that leaves Castiel stripped of his angelic powers and banishes all angels apart from Metatron to Earth. Throughout the ninth season, the brothers and Castiel are forced to deal with the return of the arch-demon Abaddon along with the angels that were banished by Metatron's actions, with Metatron gathering allies that he will 'allow' back into Heaven while presenting Castiel as the villain, until Castiel manages to regain his powers and trick Metatron into revealing the monster he truly is to the other angels. Although he is released from prison in Heaven when the brothers and Castiel question him for information about the new threat in the tenth season, he is subsequently stripped of his powers by Castiel and left to wander Earth, powerless to do anything more than watch as the world goes by while aware that the other angels will kill him if he <b>does</b> <b>anything</b> to draw their attention. After God returns to help the Winchesters against new foe the Darkness- essentially God's sister, who he sacrificed to make the world- Metatron sacrifices himself to give the Winchesters time to escape after they rescue Lucifer- currently using Castiel as a vessel- from the Darkness.|$|E

500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the film}} with a 'B–' rating, {{summarizing}} it as a [...] "lulling, happy-face story of retirement-age self-renewal, {{set in a}} shimmering, weltering, jewel-colored India", and that it succeeded in selling [...] "something safe and sweet, in a vivid foreign setting, to an underserved share of the moviegoing market." [...] Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, was more igneous in his 2/5 star review, saying that the film [...] "needs a Stannah chairlift to get it up to any level of watchability, {{and it is not}} exactly concerned to do away with condescending stereotypes about old people, or Indian people of any age." [...] Noting the luminous, prolific resumes of the cast he noted [...] "nothing in this insipid story <b>does</b> <b>anything</b> like justice to the cast's combined potential." [...] He went on to opine that the film appeared [...] "oddly like an Agatha Christie thriller with all the pasteboard characters, 2D backstories and foreign locale, but no murder." [...] In further negative reviews, critics from The Guardian and the blog Marshall and the Movies criticized the film for having a colonialist and orientalist point of view towards India.|$|E

Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{that although the}} choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was [...] "defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along {{to one of her}} songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never <b>does</b> <b>anything</b> unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's why I love him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody <b>does</b> <b>anything</b> about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
