Moreover, they are often, usually implicitly, but sometimes explicitly, permeated with prosecutorial narratives, blame games and {{a search for}} culprits. <b>Fiascos</b> do not just ‘happen’. They are constructed, declared, and argued over in labelling processes that are not necessarily ‘evidence– based’. This presents a challenge for any academic endeavour to identify, analyse and explain policy <b>fiascos.</b> Against this backdrop, we assess the study of policy failure as it stands today, and offer some reflections for its further development...|$|R
