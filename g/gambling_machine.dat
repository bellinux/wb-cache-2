50|$|A {{slot machine}} (American English), informally fruit machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English slang), the slots (Canadian and American English), poker machine (or pokies in slang) (Australian English and New Zealand English) or simply slot (American English), is a casino <b>gambling</b> <b>machine</b> {{with three or}} more reels which spin when a button is pushed. Slot {{machines}} are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by one lever {{on the side of}} the machine as distinct from a button on the front panel, and because of their ability to leave the player in debt and impoverished.

This replicated the format of the first season, but now the focus of the series was more on humor than on action/adventure, as evidenced by the extreme silliness of Dr. Smith amidst a plethora of unlikely aliens who began appearing on the show, often of a whimsical fantasy-oriented nature. One of these colorful visitors even turned out to be Smith's own cousin, intent on swindling him out of a family inheritance with the assistance of a hostile <b>gambling</b> <b>machine.</b> A new theme tune was recorded by Warren Barker for the second season, but it was decided to retain the original.|$|E
5000|$|Taito of Brazil (in Portuguese Taito do Brasil) was a pinball and arcade {{manufacturer}} {{located in}} São Paulo, Brazil. The company originally {{started out as}} Clover Electronic Amusement in 1968, then became Taito Do Brasil in 1972 by Abraham [...] "Abba" [...] Kogan, {{the son of the}} founder of the parent company Taito located in Japan. This subsidiary was originally an importer of existing U.S. and Japanese machine components to be assembled within the country. However, the taxation on imports had been growing steadily, and the government's belief that pinball is a game of chance and considered a <b>gambling</b> <b>machine,</b> led to strict import rules. By 1976, within rules created by the Electronic Processing Activities Coordinating Committee (CAPRE), it became illegal to import pinball machines. This created a problem, since the popularity of arcade games in Brazil had been growing exponentially for many years.|$|E

50|$|Sittman and Pitt of Brooklyn, New York, U.S. {{developed}} a <b>gambling</b> <b>machine</b> in 1891 {{which was a}} precursor to the modern slot machine. It contained five drums holding a total of 50 card faces and was based on poker. This machine proved extremely popular and soon many bars in the city had {{one or more of}} the machines. Players would insert a nickel and pull a lever, which would spin the drums and the cards they held, the player hoping for a good poker hand. There was no direct payout mechanism, so a pair of kings might get the player a free beer, whereas a royal flush could pay out cigars or drinks, the prizes wholly dependent on what was on offer at the local establishment. To make the odds better for the house, two cards were typically removed from the deck: the ten of spades and the jack of hearts, which doubles the odds against winning a royal flush. The drums could also be rearranged to further reduce a player's chance of winning.|$|E

40|$|Video poker machines, {{a former}} symbol {{of fraud and}} {{gambling}} in Brazil, are now being converted into computer-based educational tools for Brazilian public primary schools and also for governmental and non-governmental institutions dealing with communities of poverty and social exclusion, {{in an attempt to}} reduce poverty risks (decrease money spent on gambling) and promote social inclusion (increase access and motivation to education). Thousands of illegal <b>gambling</b> <b>machines</b> are seized by federal authorities, in Brazil, every year, and usually destroyed {{at the end of the}} criminal apprehension process. This paper describes a project developed by the University of Southern Santa Catarina, Brazil, responsible for the conversion process of <b>gambling</b> <b>machines,</b> and the social inclusion opportunities derived from it. All project members worked on a volunteer basis, seeking to promote social inclusion of Brazilian young boys and girls, namely through digital inclusion. So far, the project has been able to convert over 200 <b>gambling</b> <b>machines</b> and install them in over 40 public primary schools, thus directly benefiting more than 12, 000 schoolchildren. The initial motivation behind this project was technology based, however the different options arising from the conversion process of the <b>gambling</b> <b>machines</b> have also motivated a rather innovative and unique experience in allowing schoolchildren and young people with special (educational) needs to access to computer-based pedagogical applications. The availability of these converted machines also helps to place Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the very daily educational environment of these children and youngsters, thus serving social and cultural inclusion aspects, by establishing a dialogue with the community and their technological expectations, and also directly contributing to their digital literacy...|$|R
