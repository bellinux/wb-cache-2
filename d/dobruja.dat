5|$|During {{the reign}} of Mircea the Elder, <b>Dobruja</b> also became part of Wallachia before it was annexed to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} of Nicopolis, the Ottomans {{occupied}} Bulgaria and could attack Wallachia more easily. Mircea I the Old, however, could reoccupy <b>Dobruja</b> in 1402 {{by taking advantage of}} the Ottomans' difficulties after their defeat by Timur Lenk in {{the battle of}} Ankara. He even intervened in the Ottoman civil war and supported the struggle of Musa and Mustafa against their brother, Mehmed I. After the two pretenders had been defeated, the Ottomans annexed again <b>Dobruja</b> and occupied Giurgiu, and Mircea I was forced to pay an annual tribute to the sultan. Under Mircea I iron mines were opened at Baia de Fier and copper mining began at Baia de Aramă. In addition, sulfur and amber were extracted in the region of Buzău.|$|E
5|$|Cerna's early name, {{rendered}} in Bulgarian as Панайот Станчов, was commonly transliterated into Romanian as Panait Stanciov, Stancov, Stanciof or Stancioff. The poet's preferred name alluded to Cerna, his birthplace in Tulcea County, Northern <b>Dobruja.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Romanian Army {{entered the}} Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, {{allowing}} Romania to annex Southern <b>Dobruja</b> (also {{known as the}} Cadrilater). Although some 330,000 troops were mobilised, the Romanians met little resistance in Bulgaria and as such this is not considered a major conflict in Romanian history. This was due to historical claims on land. This area no longer belongs to Romania.|$|E
5|$|Upon the war's end, Mihail Kogălniceanu and Ion Brătianu {{headed the}} Romanian {{delegation}} to the Congress of Berlin. In this capacity, they protested Russia's offer to exchange the previously Ottoman-ruled Northern <b>Dobruja</b> for Budjak, a portion of southern Bessarabia that Romania had received under the 1856 Treaty of Paris. This came after months of tension between Romania and Russia, generated over the territorial issue and the Russian claim to be representing Romania at Berlin: Kogălniceanu's envoy (Eraclie Arion) had even threatened the Russians with a Romanian denunciation of their alliance, and 60,000 Romanian soldiers were prepared for Budjak's defense. The Conference's ultimate decision (Berlin Treaty) {{was in favor of}} Russia's proposal, largely due to support from Andrássy and William Henry Waddington, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs. Additional pressures came from Bismarck. The Russians themselves did register some setbacks {{by the end of the}} Conference. Their demands for Romania to allow indefinite military transit through Northern <b>Dobruja</b> were made ineffectual by the opposition of other European states, and Kogălniceanu was able to obtain the retrocession of Snake Island.|$|E
5|$|At home Ivan Alexander {{compromised}} {{the internal}} stability of his realm by divorcing {{his first wife}} Theodora of Wallachia (in about 1349) and marrying a converted Jew, also named Theodora. The new marriage produced new sons, whom Ivan Alexander proceeded to crown co-emperors, Ivan Šišman in about 1356 and Ivan Asen V by 1359. Ivan Alexander's last surviving son from his first marriage, the co-emperor Ivan Sracimir, became effectively independent around 1356; and Ivan Alexander's control over other powerful vassals, such as the rulers of Wallachia and <b>Dobruja,</b> who pursued their own foreign policies, was hardly stronger.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine troops {{occupied}} {{large portions}} of Bulgaria, including modern <b>Dobruja,</b> under Emperor John I Tzimiskes (969976). After his death an anti-Byzantine uprising led by four brothers broke out. One of the brothers, David, was killed by Vlachs in the present-day border region between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. In 1018, the Byzantines conquered the whole territory of the Bulgarian Empire and the Archbishop of Ohrid acquired ecclesiastic jurisdiction in 1020 over the Vlachs living there.|$|E
5|$|The Turkic-speaking Bulgars {{arrived in}} the territories west of the river Dniester around 670. At the Battle of Ongal they {{defeated}} the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Emperor Constantine IV in 680 or 681 and occupied <b>Dobruja.</b> They soon imposed their authority {{over some of the}} neighboring tribes. The great variety in burial rites evidences the multi-ethnic character of the Bulgarian Empire. Even the Bulgars were divided in this respect; some of them practiced inhumation and others cremation. Initially, a sharp distinction existed between the Bulgars and their subjects, but the Slavicization of the Bulgars soon began.|$|E
5|$|The {{captured}} {{cities were}} {{turned over to}} the Byzantine Empire, while Emperor John V Palaiologos paid the sum of 180,000 florins to Ivan Alexander. The Bulgarian emperor used this sum and territorial concessions to induce his at least de jure vassals Dobrotica of <b>Dobruja</b> and Vladislav I of Wallachia to reconquer Vidin from the Hungarians. The war was successful, and Ivan Sracimir was reinstalled in Vidin in 1369, although the Hungarian king forced him to acknowledge his overlordship.|$|E
5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in <b>Dobruja).</b> He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|For the regency, the {{situation}} had become desperate. Empress Anna's requests for aid from foreign powers proved unsuccessful, as both Orhan and the beylik of Karasi rebuffed her overtures for assistance. Only Balik, the ruler of <b>Dobruja,</b> sent an elite force of 1,000 men under his brothers Theodore and Dobrotitsa, but they were routed by a Kantakouzenist army under protostrator George Phakrases. The emirate of Saruhan offered a more substantial force of 6,000 men {{in the summer of}} 1346, but instead of fighting, they plundered Thrace and then defected to join Kantakouzenos' army. Revenue remained scarce for the regency, the Genoese once again seized the imperial possessions of Chios and Phocaea, and on 19 May 1346, a part of the Hagia Sophia cathedral collapsed, a terrible omen {{in the eyes of the}} capital's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade was fading and the traders were looking for other more secure markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name genovese in the memory of the merchants from the Italian city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the <b>Dobruja</b> region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1863, Levski {{returned}} to Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in Romania. His uncle Basil reported him as a rebel to the Ottoman authorities, and Levski was imprisoned in Plovdiv for three months, but released due to {{the help of the}} doctor R. Petrov and the Russian vice-consul Nayden Gerov. On Easter 1864, Levski officially relinquished his religious office. From May 1864 until March 1866, he worked as a teacher in Voynyagovo near Karlovo; while there, he supported and gave shelter to persecuted Bulgarians and organised patriotic groups among the population. His activity caused suspicion among the Ottoman authorities, and he was forced to move. From {{the spring of}} 1866 to the spring of 1867 he taught in Enikyoy and Kongas, two Northern <b>Dobruja</b> villages near Tulcea.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros appears for {{the first}} time in Emperor Basil II's Bulgarian wars, in 999/1000, 1000/1 or 1002, {{depending}} on the source. At the time he was a protospatharios, and along with the patrikios Theodorokanos, he commanded a campaign deep into Bulgarian lands. Setting out from Mosynopolis, the two generals crossed the Balkan Mountains and captured the old Bulgarian capitals of Pliska and Great Preslav, along with Little Preslav. They then plundered the <b>Dobruja,</b> left behind garrisons and returned to their base. It is unclear whether he was already the military governor (strategos) of Philippopolis at the time, or was appointed to it after the successful conclusion of the campaign, as John Skylitzes reports, when Theodorokanos, who is known to have previously held the post, retired due to his advanced age.|$|E
5|$|Suleiman {{tried to}} {{reinforce}} his offensive, {{not knowing what}} had happened in the valley, but then Stephen, with the full support of his boyars, ordered a major attack. All his troops, together with peasants and heavy cavalry, attacked from all sides. Simultaneously, Moldavian buglers concealed behind Ottoman lines started to sound their bugles, and in great confusion some Ottoman units changed direction to face the sound. When the Moldavian army hit, Suleiman lost control of his army. He desperately tried to regain control, but was later forced to signal a retreat. The battle lasted for four days, with the last three days seeing the fleeing Ottoman army being pursued by the Moldavian light cavalry and the 2,000-strong Polish cavalry until they reached the town of Obluciţa (now Isaccea, Romania), in <b>Dobruja.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relatively}} successful {{resolution of}} the crisis in the northwest did nothing to help recover the losses in the southeast. To make matters worse, in 1369 (the date is disputed), the Ottoman Turks under Murad I conquered Adrianople (in 1363) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state. At the same time, they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and Boruj (Stara Zagora). As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks, Ivan Alexander died on February 17, 1371. He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin and Ivan Šišman in Tǎrnovo, while the rulers of <b>Dobruja</b> and Wallachia achieved further independence.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{problems}} they encountered because of the fencing, the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by Árpád's son Liüntika across the Danube, possibly near modern Galaţi, and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands. Once notified of the surprise invasion, Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars, leaving some of his troops at the southern border to prevent a possible attack by Phokas. Simeon's two encounters with the enemy in Northern <b>Dobruja</b> resulted in Magyar victories, forcing him to retreat to Drǎstǎr. After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav, the Magyars returned to their lands,* Delev, Bǎlgarskata dǎržava pri car Simeon. * Canev, Bǎlgarski hroniki, p. 199. but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895. A complete peace was delayed, as Leo VI required {{the release of the}} Byzantine captives from the Trade War.|$|E
5|$|Following the Crimean War (1853–1856), with Prince Grigore Alexandru Ghica, Kogălniceanu was {{responsible}} for drafting legislation to abolish Roma slavery. Together with Alecsandri, he edited the unionist magazine Steaua Dunării, played a prominent part during the elections for the ad hoc Divan, and successfully promoted Cuza, his lifelong friend, to the throne. Kogălniceanu advanced legislation to revoke traditional ranks and titles, and to secularize the property of monasteries. His efforts at land reform resulted in a censure vote, leading Cuza to enforce them through a coup d'état in May 1864. However, Kogălniceanu resigned in 1865, following his own conflicts with the monarch. A decade after, he helped create the National Liberal Party, before playing {{an important part in}} Romania's decision to enter the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878—a choice which consecrated her independence. He was also instrumental in the acquisition, and later colonization, of Northern <b>Dobruja</b> region. During his final years, he was a prominent member and one-time President of the Romanian Academy, and briefly served as Romanian representative to France.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern <b>Dobruja,</b> through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav enthusiastically {{agreed to}} the Byzantine proposal. In August 967 or 968, the Rus' crossed the Danube into Bulgarian territory, {{defeated}} a Bulgarian army of 30,000 men in the Battle of Silistra, and occupied most of the <b>Dobruja.</b> According to the Bulgarian historian Vasil Zlatarski, Sviatoslav seized 80towns in northeastern Bulgaria. They were looted and destroyed but not permanently occupied. Tsar Peter I suffered an epileptic stroke when he received news of the defeat. The Rus' wintered at Pereyaslavets, while the Bulgarians retreated to the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra). The next year, Sviatoslav left with part of his army to counter a Pecheneg attack on his capital at Kiev (incited either by the Byzantines or, according to the Russian Primary Chronicle, by the Bulgarians). At the same time, Tsar Peter sent a new embassy to Byzantium, a visit that was recorded by Liutprand of Cremona. In contrast to their previous reception, this time the Bulgarian envoys were treated with great honour. Nevertheless, Nikephoros, confident of his position, demanded harsh terms: Tsar Peter was to resign and be replaced by Boris, and the two young emperors, Basil and Constantine, were {{to be married to}} Bulgarian princesses, daughters of Boris.|$|E
5|$|The nomadic Avars subjugated the Gepids in 568 and {{dominated}} the Carpathian Basin up until around 800. The Bulgars also established a powerful empire in the 670s which included <b>Dobruja</b> and other territories along the Lower Danube. Bulgaria officially adopted the Eastern Orthodox variant of Christianity in 864. An armed conflict between Bulgaria and the nomadic Hungarians forced {{the latter to}} depart from the Pontic steppes and began the conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 895. Their invasion {{gave rise to the}} earliest reference, recorded some centuries later in the Gesta Hungarorum, to a polity ruled by a Romanian duke named Gelou. The same source also makes mention of the presence of the Székelys in Crişana around 895. The first contemporaneous references to Romanianswho used to be known as Vlachsin the regions now forming Romania were recorded in the 12th and 13th centuries. References to Vlachs inhabiting the lands to the south of the Lower Danube abound in the same period.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to round up and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern <b>Dobruja,</b> shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E
25|$|Following the Liberation, {{members of}} all Bulgarian {{communities}} {{moved to the}} newly established Principality of Bulgaria, but a significant Bulgarian population remained in Romania. Although set to be ceded to Bulgarian as per the Treaty of San Stefano, the region of Northern <b>Dobruja</b> was awarded to Romania by the Congress of Berlin of 1878. The region had a compact Bulgarian population in the Babadag region, with Northern <b>Dobruja</b> Bulgarians numbering 35-45,000 in the late 19th century. Romania also ruled the Bulgarian-majority Southern <b>Dobruja</b> between 1913 and 1940, when it was ceded back to Bulgaria, with a population exchange between the Bulgarians of Northern <b>Dobruja</b> and the Romanian and Aromanian colonists in Southern <b>Dobruja.</b> Today, as an officially-recognized ethnic minority, Bulgarians have one seat reserved in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies. There exist several organizations of the Bulgarians in Romania.|$|E
25|$|The oldest madrasah in <b>Dobruja</b> and Romania {{as a whole}} was set up in Babadag, {{on orders}} from Bayezid II (1484); it was moved to Medgidia in 1903. From the same period onwards, groups of Muslim Tatars and Oghuz Turks from Anatolia were settled into <b>Dobruja</b> at various intervals; in 1525, a sizable group of these, {{originating}} from the ports of Samsun and Sinop, moved to Babadag. Bayezid also asked Volga Tatars to resettle into northern <b>Dobruja.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wallachia's {{traditional}} {{border with}} Moldavia {{coincided with the}} Milcov River {{for most of its}} length. To the east, over the Danube north-south bend, Wallachia neighbours <b>Dobruja</b> (Northern <b>Dobruja).</b> Over the Carpathians, Wallachia shared a border with Transylvania; Wallachian princes have for long held possession of areas north of the line (Amlaș, Ciceu, Făgăraș, and Hațeg), which are generally not considered part of Wallachia proper.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Second Balkan War in 1913, the Kingdom of Romania came {{to include}} Southern <b>Dobruja,</b> whose {{population}} was over 50% Turkish (the region was ceded to Bulgaria in 1940). As recorded after World War I, Romania had a population of 200,000 Muslims from a total of 7 million, the majority of which were Turks who lived in the two areas of <b>Dobruja</b> (as many as 178,000). Since 1877, the community was led by four separate muftiyats. Their number was reduced during the interwar period, when the cities of Constanța and Tulcea each housed a muftiyat. In 1943, the two institutions were again unified around the mufi in Constanța. Outside <b>Dobruja,</b> the relatively small presence of Albanian Muslims also left a cultural imprint: in 1921, the first translation of the Qur'an into the Albanian language was completed by Ilo Mitke Qafëzezi in the Wallachian city of Ploiești.|$|E
25|$|During the Peace Congress of Berlin, Carp was {{especially}} {{alarmed by the}} territorial exchanges: Romania lost the Budjak region to Russia and, in addition to international recognition, received Northern <b>Dobruja</b> (formerly in the Ottoman Danube Vilayet). Domnitor Carol and the Brătianu government reluctantly approved this deal, but a parliamentary faction, comprising Carp and PNL's Dimitrie Sturdza, explicitly condemned it. Their resolution stipulated that annexing Northern <b>Dobruja</b> was against the national interest; the opposition saw Northern <b>Dobruja</b> as a marshy, toxic, territory, and worried that it was largely inhabited by Muslims or disgruntled Bulgarians. Carp personally worried that the region was indefensible in front of Bulgarian irredentism. Eventually, on September 28, 1878, after a lengthy debate in Parliament and a convincing speech by Foreign Minister Kogălniceanu, the vote swung and the territorial exchange was given official endorsement. The government insisted that the incorporation was not a pittance or spoils of war, but the recovery of ancient Wallachian territory.|$|E
25|$|Turkey {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} Romania (Article 5). Romania gained Northern <b>Dobruja</b> from Russia (to which it was transferred from the Ottoman Empire) and ceded Southern Bessarabia in a forced exchange.|$|E
25|$|Cristescu started {{questioning}} his Party's policies {{after the}} decision {{taken by the}} Balkan Communist Federation during its 1923 Vienna Conference. The Federation had adopted the official Soviet policy recommending that Bessarabia, Bukovina, Transylvania and Southern <b>Dobruja</b> (or all of <b>Dobruja)</b> be given the right to secede from Romania. Due to the ethnic composition of these regions, he could not accept that minorities be given self-determination (especially since this implied not autonomy or independence, but rather satisfaction of territorial demands that other nations had on Romania). Cristescu allegedly called for the party to revise its program in respect to these points, and thus resume legal activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{element in}} Wallachia (Ploiești, Dolj), Moldavia (Piatra Neamț, Buhuși), <b>Dobruja</b> (Constanţa), and northern Republic of Moldova is recorded to be Haplogroup I, while {{the gene pool}} of Transylvania is often untypical and diverse.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the same}} period, {{large groups of}} Circassians (as many as 200,000), {{refugees}} from the Caucasian War, were resettled in the <b>Dobruja</b> and northern Bulgaria by the Ottomans (localities with large Circassian populace included Isaccea, Slava Cercheză, Crucea, Horia, and Nicolae Bălcescu). During the 1860s, {{a significant number of}} Nogais, also fleeing Russian conquest, left their homes in the Caucasus and joined in the exodus to <b>Dobruja.</b> Members of other Muslim communities which joined in the colonization included Arabs (a group of 150 families of fellahin from Syria Province, brought over in 1831-1833), Kurds, and Persians—all of these three communities were quickly integrated into the Tatar-Turkish mainstream.|$|E
25|$|According to the Treaty of Berlin (1878), Romania gained <b>Dobruja</b> as a {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} Southern Bessarabia. Despite being a larger territory, Romanians considered it an unfair exchange and accepted it reluctantly, because there was no other alternative.|$|E
25|$|An early {{mention of}} a Moldavian naval fleet is found in {{connection}} with the rule of Aron Tiranul, who used it to help Wallachian ruler Michael the Brave establish his control over the Chilia branch of the Danube and <b>Dobruja.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the 17th century, {{according}} to the notes of traveler Evliya Çelebi, <b>Dobruja</b> was also home to a distinct community of people of mixed Turkish and Wallachian heritage. Additionally, {{a part of the}} Dobrujan Roma community has traditionally adhered to Islam; it is believed that it originated with groups of Romani people serving in the Ottoman Army during the 16th century, and has probably incorporated various ethnic Turks who had not settled down in the cities or villages. Alongside <b>Dobruja,</b> a part of present-day Romania under direct Ottoman rule in 1551-1718 was the Eyalet of Temeșvar (the Banat region of western Romania), which extended as far as Arad (1551–1699) and Oradea (1661–1699). The few thousand Muslims settled there were, however, driven out by Habsburg conquest.|$|E
25|$|In {{exchange}} for the war reparations, the Porte ceded Armenian and Georgian territories in the Caucasus to Russia, including Ardahan, Artvin, Batum, Kars, Olti, Beyazit, and Alashkert. Additionally, it ceded Northern <b>Dobruja,</b> which Russia handed to Romania in {{exchange for}} Southern Bessarabia (Article 19).|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{regional}} differences: {{in the western}} parts, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; {{the eastern part of}} the country has a more pronounced continental climate. In <b>Dobruja,</b> the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate.|$|E
