5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive.</b> Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> to help prevent gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services on the line, and the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> in the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|These {{heavy duty}} <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> use Toshiba-made 3-phase AC motors, powered through insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) control. They are single-cab locomotives, a feature they {{share with the}} Class 19E <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> of the Coalink Line, also made with Toshiba technology, the Class 9E Series 1 and 2 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> of the Orex Line, and <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> of Classes 7E1, 7E4, 11E, 18E, 20E, 21E and 22E.|$|R

5|$|Pennsylvania Railroad 4859 is a GG1-class <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{located in}} the Harrisburg Transportation Center in Harrisburg in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It was {{operated}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors, Penn Central and Conrail. 4859 pulled the first electrically powered train from Philadelphia to Harrisburg on January15, 1938. It was used in various freight and passenger service until November22, 1979, when it pulled the last GG1-powered freight train on November22, 1979. Originally located in Strasburg, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and was moved to its current location in 1986. It was designated the state <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> of Pennsylvania in 1987 by the Pennsylvania General Assembly and was re-listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> that was {{more powerful than the}} P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter axle load and to be double-ended with a cab {{in the center of the}} carbody. Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E
5|$|Many of Tom Swift's fictional inventions {{describe}} actual {{technological developments}} or predate technologies now considered commonplace. Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers (1911) {{was based on}} Charles Parsons's attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone was published in 1912. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. Tom Swift and His Wizard Camera (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923. Tom Swift and His <b>Electric</b> <b>Locomotive</b> (1922) was published {{two years before the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey began using the first diesel <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The house on wheels that Tom invents for 1929's Tom Swift and His House on Wheels pre-dated the first house trailer by a year.Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter (1952) features a flying submarine similar to one planned by the United States Department of Defense four years later in 1956,. Other inventions of Tom's have not happened, such as the device for silencing airplane engines that he invents in Tom Swift and His Magnetic Silencer (1941).|$|E
50|$|In the 1990s {{there were}} few {{passenger}} <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> in Russia. The existing Chesh <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> CHS4 and CHS4t were rather old to head passenger trains. A decision was therefore taken to commission a new <b>electric</b> passenger <b>locomotive.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{intended}} to use this type classification system for <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> as well. But because <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{could be used for}} any duty, this plan was given up.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the high}} {{vibration}} level occurring during the running of <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives,</b> mechanical defects occur in the control mechanisms of auxiliary services. This fact {{has given rise to}} the necessity of determining the values of these vibrations in <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> during their running. Measurements were conducted on the Craiova-Drobeta-Turnu Severin line, and measures to reduce the vibration level in <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> were instituted...|$|R
5|$|The {{company had}} five Di 3 diesel locomotives, {{and a single}} El 13 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive.</b> Ofotbanen had 22 B3 {{passenger}} carriages, used for charter trains. These were supplemented by three two-car Class 68 electric multiple units. The 48 freight cars the company used were owned by Nord-Norsk Spedisjon. Of these, 19 were timber cars. All stock was painted dark green. All motorized stock was used stock that NSB has chosen to take out of service.|$|E
5|$|The line beyond Harrow was not {{electrified}} so trains were hauled by an <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> from Baker Street, {{changed for}} a steam locomotive en route. From 1 January 1907, the exchange {{took place at}} Wembley Park. From 19 July 1908, locomotives were changed at Harrow. GWR rush hour services to the city continued to operate, electric traction taking over from steam at Paddington from January 1907, although freight services to Smithfield continued to be steam hauled throughout.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 the centenary of {{the branch}} saw a revival of {{interest}} in the line. Over the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July special services were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E
50|$|Between 1925 and 1945, the South African Railways placed {{altogether}} 172 Class 1E <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> in service, {{spread over}} seven orders. They {{were the first}} mainline <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> to be introduced in South Africa.|$|R

5|$|NSB El 18 is a {{class of}} 22 {{electric}} locomotives built by Adtranz and Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). The class is a modification of the Swiss Federal Railways Re 460 locomotive and built at Adtranz Strømmen in 1996 and 1997. The class remains the only mainline <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> used by NSB, and is predominantly used on some intercity services and all night trains on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line, {{as well as some}} regional trains.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Railroad 4876 is a GG1-class <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{located at}} the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It was built in 1939 and was {{involved}} in the only accident to befall a GG1. In 1953, the locomotive overran the buffer stop and crashed into Union Station in Washington, D.C. after its brakes failed. A temporary concourse floor was erected over 4876 (which had broken through the original) for the upcoming inauguration of Dwight D. Eisenhower. After the inauguration it was shipped back to Altoona, Pennsylvania, for repairs and placed back into service.|$|E
5|$|The Iore {{class was}} a cold-adapted and heavy-haul {{derivation}} from Adtranz's Octeon modular <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> platform, which {{was launched in}} 1998 {{on the basis of}} Adtranz's latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time. Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at Kassel, Germany. When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated modular locomotive platform, the type designation TRAXX H80AC was applicable to the Iore class, however, it was excluded from the TRAXX family {{by the time of the}} second batch order in 2007. The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna.|$|E

50|$|In 1963 and 1964 the South African Railways placed 130 Class 5E1, Series 2 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> with a Bo-Bo wheel {{arrangement}} in mainline service. These {{were the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{to be built in}} South Africa in quantity.|$|R
5|$|When {{the order}} was placed, {{it was the first}} Norwegian <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> with the {{mechanical}} components built in Germany. At the same time, NSB ordered five six-axle diesel-electric locomotives from Thyssen-Henschel (Mark Di 4), almost the same as the Danish Mark ME 1500. The Di 4/ME 1500 have many similarities to its electric counterpart El 17. The two were planned to have the same rectifiers and motors, but due to weight restrictions the El 17 received the same type as Class 120.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{initially}} operated by steam locomotives, however {{the cost of}} steam power was large; and on 7 June 1910 a contract with Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (today AEG) of Berlin was signed to provide overhead wires and five electric locomotives. The Rjukan Line became the second electrified railway in Norway, after the Thamshavn Line, and the first that would {{be connected to the}} main railway network. The first <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> was taken into operation on 30 November 1911. Because only some of the locomotives were delivered, steam locomotive had to help with the service. Because of insufficient safety routines there were several fatalities among employees, and not until 1922 was sufficient policy initiated.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} used for {{occasional}} excursions by railway enthusiasts {{for a short period}} after official closure, using the <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> and a brake van borrowed from British Railways. The exact date of the last run is not recorded; the last recorded use of the line was an excursion organised by the Norbury Transport and Model Railway Club on 4April 1959, but it is known that later excursions ran. In the early 1960s a railway society in Yorkshire proposed to buy the track as a preserved railway. However, as the psychiatric hospital was still open the request was not considered practical, and the track was lifted in the early 1960s. The fittings and locomotive were disposed of by H.Ripley and Sons of Hailsham.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{fleet of}} the Class 10E family of <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives</b> is {{equipped}} with electronic chopper control, which is smoother {{in comparison to the}} rheostatic resistance control which was used in the Classes 1E to 6E1 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotives.</b>|$|R

5|$|On June 15, 1938, the Broadway Limited {{received}} lightweight streamlined cars {{to replace}} its heavyweight steel cars; {{on the same}} day rival New York Central's 20th Century Limited was streamlined. Raymond Loewy styled the new cars and the PRR GG1 <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> as well as some streamlined steam locomotives for the Pennsylvania, notably the S1 and T1 Duplex drive engines. The Broadway Limited was one of four pre-World War II Pennsylvania trains to receive such equipment; the others being the General (New York–Chicago), Spirit of St. Louis (New York–St. Louis), and Liberty Limited (Washington–Chicago). Other Pennsylvania trains continued to use heavyweight cars until after the end of World War II. Most of the 1938 cars were built new by Pullman-Standard between March and May of that year, but the diners, RPO and baggage cars were rebuilt from heavyweight cars by the railroad's Altoona shops. The Broadway Limited was the only Pennsylvania train to be completely re-equipped with lightweight sleeping cars before World War II. The train's running time was further reduced to 16 hours.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Leader class, other prototype locomotives constructed at Brighton included the third 3rd rail Co-Co <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive,</b> numbered 20003 in 1948, and the third 1Co-Co1 diesel <b>electric</b> <b>locomotive</b> numbered 10203 in 1954.|$|E
