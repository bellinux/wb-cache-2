Despite the better conditions for livestock, the mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather made passage sometimes difficult and required continuing federally funded maintenance on the mountainous road—not a sure thing just before, {{during and after the}} American Civil War.

The Lander's road or cutoff opened in 1859 when it was extensively used.

Today the Lander cutoff road(s) are roughly followed by a series of county and Forest Service roads.|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.|$|E
500|$|The Phillies {{initially}} acquired Mayberry for {{his power}} hitting potential, and throughout his ascent through the minor leagues, he hit double-digit home runs, but his plate discipline was poor, as {{he struck out}} on over 20% of plate appearances. According to ESPN hot zones, Mayberry hits pitches {{in the middle of}} the plate belt-high, as well as pitches down and inside the best, while he struggles predominantly on outside pitches. Mayberry has long been considered a good athlete, and finally honed his speed to translate it to success on the basepaths – he stole many bases in the minor leagues, but only 14 in the major leagues. The Hardball Times once published a piece that compared his hitting ability to that of Mike Morse in terms of their similar power hitting ability. From 2011–2013, Mayberry performed significantly better against left-handed pitchers than right-handed pitchers. Against lefties, he totaled 21 home runs and 53 RBIs in 377 at bats with a batting average of [...]273, whereas against righties, he totaled 19 home runs and 81 RBIs in 684 at bats with a batting average of [...]231. Kenny Ayres, a writer for Phillies Nation, commented that [...] "between the long looping swing, chasing sliders three feet outside and his frustrating tendency to try to pull everything, Mayberry has earned <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> low a score for the season as a position player can have" [...] in regards to his 2013 season.|$|E

From the standpoint of terminology each name would have whatever merit inheres in a rather cheap straining after effect; and from the standpoint of decorative value, of sincerity, and of artistic merit, the Navajo rug is infinitely ahead of the picture." ...|$|E

[...] Leslie Halliwell, usually terse, almost glowed about Notorious: [...] "Superb romantic suspenser containing some of Hitchcock's best work." [...] Decades later, Roger Ebert also praised the film, adding it to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list and calling it [...] "the most elegant expression of the master's visual style." [...] On the website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall positive rating of 94%, with an average rating of 8.9/10 based on 34 reviews, with a consensus of: [...] "Sublime direction from Hitchcock, and terrific central performances from Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant make this a bona-fide classic worthy of a re-visit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the matches}} against Carlton, the Waratahs adopted Australian rules, {{and for a}} time, the colonial game {{threatened}} to supersede rugby in Sydney. Coulthard accepted an invitation from Phil Sheridan, a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground, to travel to Sydney {{with the aim of}} fostering Australian rules in the city. On 15 September 1877, soon after his arrival, Coulthard joined several local footballers on a fishing trip in Sydney Harbour. The group was anchored near Shark Island when Coulthard, sitting on the boat's gunwale {{with the back of his}} tailcoat hanging over the side, was pulled overboard by [...] "a monster shark, 13 feet long". The shark had seized his coattails trailing on the water and dragged him beneath the surface [...] "some ten or twelve feet" [...] until it tore the coat from his body. After kicking at the shark, Coulthard swam to the surface alongside the boat, [...] "into which he threw, with the aid of his friends, a kind of somersault, <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> quickly as he had been taken overboard."
