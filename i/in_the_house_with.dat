She won re-election in 1972 and 1974 to additional two-year terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> her district changing to District 31, serving through the 1975 special legislative session.

5|$|South Stoneham House was acquired, with South Hill (some {{two miles}} to the northwest), in 1920 to house male {{students}} at University College Southampton. The salmon pool at South Stoneham was retained by the Montagu family, {{becoming part of the}} Townhill Park estate. Tradition prevailed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> a collegiate atmosphere as gowns were expected to be worn to dinner and lectures and curfews were enforced.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E

5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games. Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games, he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did well in school, but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking {{in the country and}} the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{financial}} mismanagement which included his Safari hunting hobby, in July 1912, Horodecki pledged {{the building as}} a collateral against a loan taken from Kyiv Mutual Credit Association. When Horodecki defaulted on the loan, the building was auctioned off in 1913, and became {{the property of the}} engineer Daniel Balakhovsky, the son of a Kiev trader, who was also the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Blahodatinskoe sugar factory, and a French сonsular agent in Kiev. In 1916, the house belonged to the Blahodatinskoe sugar factory. In 1918, the building's ownership changed again, to Samuel Nemets. In 1921, after the Bolsheviks gained control of Kiev, several of the departments of the Kiev Military District took offices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> Chimaeras.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it as easy as they had imagined. At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house. One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall near the house. Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E

25|$|The Clean Diamond Trade Act was revised {{several times}} before {{a version of the}} bill was {{successfully}} passed by Congress, and signed into law by the President of the United States. The very first version of the CDTA, H.R 2722, was introduced in the US House of Representatives by Rep.Amo Houghton, a Republican from New York on September 2, 2001 to the 107th Congress. There were 112 cosponsors: 84 Democrats, 27 Republicans, 1 Independent. The bill was referred to the House Ways and Means, and then the Subcommittee on Trade. Eventually, the bill was debated on the House Floor. It successfully passed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> a vote of 408-6 on Nov.28th 2001. The bill was placed on the Senate Legislative calendar, but no further action was taken.|$|E
25|$|That {{conscription}} could {{split the}} Labor Party was obvious by mid-1916. Although Hughes was eager for conscription to be enacted immediately {{after returning from}} England, he bided his time in July and August to politically organise before putting the motion before Parliament. It became clear that support for a bill to introduce compulsory overseas conscription would be passed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>with</b> the Opposition making up the deficit from Labor defectors, {{but not in the}} Senate. Conscription was thus deemed impossible to enact given the political landscape in late 1916. However, a majority did exist in both houses to hold a plebiscite on the question. No such vote was strictly necessary, as the Commonwealth government possessed the powers to enact conscription without amending the constitution. The poll would thus actually be to gain symbolic, rather than legal, approval for the introduction of conscription.|$|E

The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica {{two or three weeks}} before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.|$|E
