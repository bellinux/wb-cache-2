50|$|Metabolic cost is {{naturally}} optimized by {{selection of a}} nominal gait. While external factors such as instability and perceived dangers may temporarily alter the body’s priorities, {{the primary goal of}} minimizing a task-dependent energetic expenditure ultimately dominates the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> walking gait. As a result, humans tend to select a <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> that minimizes their cost of transport. The relationship between walking and cost of transport is parabola-like with the <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed</b> at the minimum, meaning walking at a slower or faster speed can incur a similar increase in energetic cost for a 1-kilometer walk. Within each walking speed, the step length and cadence are also optimized for metabolic cost. While multiple proportional combinations of step length and cadence can be used to achieve the same walking speed, taking faster and shorter steps or slower and longer steps than the optimal combination leads to increased cost of transport.|$|R

How does the motor system choose the speed {{for any given}} movement? Many current models assume a process that finds the optimal balance between the costs of moving fast and the rewards of {{achieving}} the goal. Here, we show that such models also need {{to take into account}} a prior representation <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> movement <b>speed,</b> which can be changed by prolonged practice. In a time-constrained reaching task, human participants made 25 -cm reaching movements within 300, 500, 700, or 900 ms. They were then trained for 3 days to execute the movement at either the slowest (900 -ms) or fastest (300 -ms) speed. When retested on the 4 th day, movements executed under all four time constraints were biased toward the speed of the trained movement. In addition, trial-to-trial variation in speed of the trained movement was significantly reduced. These findings are indicative of a use-dependent mechanism that biases the selection of speed. Reduced speed variability was also associated with reduced errors in movement amplitude for the fast training group, which generalized nearly fully to a new movement direction. In contrast, changes in perpendicular error were specific to the trained direction. In sum, our results suggest the existence of a relatively stable but modifiable prior <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> movement <b>speed</b> that influences the choice of movement speed under a range of task constraints...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} (1) whether previously observed {{changes in}} gait parameters in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) {{are the result}} <b>of</b> slower <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speeds</b> or reflect adaptations independent of gait speed; and (2) the changes in spatiotemporal features of the unstable swing phase of gait in people with MS. Design: Cross-sectional study assessing changes in gait parameters during preferred, slow (0. 6 m/s), medium (1. 0 m/s), and fast (1. 4 m/s) walking speeds. Setting: Gait laboratory with instrumented walkway and motion capture system. Participants: MS group with mild to moderate impairment (n_ 19, 16 women) with a median Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3. 75 (range, 2. 5 – 6), and a sex- and age-matched control group (n_ 19). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Gait speed, stride length, stride width, cadence, dual support time, swing time, and timing of swing foot and body/head center of mass during swing phase. Results: Individuals with MS walked at slower <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds</b> with longer dual support times compared with controls. In fixed-speed conditions, dual support times were longer and swing times were shorter in MS compared with controls. Stride width was wider for all speed conditions in the MS group.

40|$|Gait {{variability}} {{has been}} correlated with fall {{risk in the}} elderly. Older adults typically display greater variability than young adults, but {{the cause of this}} increase is unclear. Slower walking leads to greater variability in young adults, but slow speeds are also typical in older adults. Increased variability in older adults may result from slower walking speeds, or possibly from other factors related to aging. We tested whether greater variability in healthy older adults could be attributed directly to slower walking speed. Eighteen healthy older adults (age 72 6) and 17 gender-, height- and weight-matched young adults (age 23 3) walked on a treadmill at speeds of 80 – 120 % <b>of</b> their <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> Variability <b>of</b> spatio-temporal gait measures, lower extremity joint angles, and trunk motions were quantified, along with bilateral isometric leg strengths and passive joint ranges <b>of</b> motion. <b>Preferred</b> walking <b>speeds</b> were not different between our healthy elderly and young subjects. In both groups, variability was speed-dependent for stride time, frontal hip and knee motions, knee internal/external rotations, and all trunk motions (p < 0. 002). Older adults exhibited greater variability (p = 0. 0003) for trunk roll, independent of changes in speed. Step length (p = 0. 005), stride time (p = 0. 018), and trunk pitch (p = 0. 022) exhibited similar trends. This greater variability was explained by decreased leg strength and passive ranges of motion. Thus, the greater variability observed in the gait of older adults may result more from loss of strength and flexibility than from their slower speeds...|$|R

40|$|A phantom limb is the {{sensation}} that an amputated limb is {{still attached to}} the body and is moving together with other body parts. Phantom limb phenomenon is often described {{on the basis of}} the patient's subjective sense, for example as represented using a visual analog scale (VAS). The aim of this study was to propose a novel quantification method for behavioral aspect of phantom limb by psychophysics. Twelve unilateral forearm amputees were asked to perform phantom wrist motion with various motion frequencies (60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240 % <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>speed).</b> The attainment <b>of</b> phantom limb motion in each session was rated by the VAS ranging from 0 (hard) to 10 (easy). The relationship between the VAS and motion frequency was mathematically fitted by quadric function, and the value of shift and the degree of steepness were obtained as evaluation variables for the phantom limb movement. In order to test whether the proposed method can reasonably quantify the characteristics of phantom limb motion, we compared the variables among three different phantom limb movement conditions: (1) unilateral (phantom only), (2) bimanual, and (3) bimanual wrist movement with mirror reflection-induced visual feedback (MVF). While VAS rating showed a larger extent of inter- and intra-subject variability, the relationship of the VAS in response to motion frequency could be fitted by quadric curve, and the obtained parameters based on quadric function well characterize task-dependent changes in phantom limb movement. The present results suggest the potential usefulness of psychophysical evaluation as a validate assessment tool of phantom limb condition...|$|R

Also, behavioral adaptations may confound these changes. We examined whether EMG dynamics during gait is less complex in older adults over a range of timescales using the multiscale entropy method, and whether slower walking attenuates this effect. Surface EMG was measured from the left vastus lateralis (VL), biceps femoris (BF), gastrocnemius (GA), and tibialis anterior (TA) in 17 young and 18 older adults as they walked on a treadmill for 5 minutes at 0. 8 x- 1. 2 x <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> Sample entropy (SE) and the complexity index (CI) of the EMG signals were calculated after successive coarse-graining to extract dynamics at timescales of 27 to 270 Hz, with m = 2 and r = 0. 15 SD. SE and CI were lower across the timescales in older adults in VL and BF, but higher in GA (all p< 0. 001); these results held for VL and GA even after accounting for longer EMG burst durations in older adults. CI was higher during slower walking speed in VL and BF (p< 0. 001). Results were mostly similar for m = 3 and r = 0. 01 - 0. 35. Smaller r was more sensitive to age-related differences. The decrease in complexity with aging in the timescales studied was limited to proximal muscles, particularly VL. The increase in GA may be driven by other factors.

40|$|Human walking {{requires}} active neuromuscular {{control to}} ensure {{stability in the}} lateral direction, which inflicts a certain metabolic load. The magnitude of this metabolic load has previously been investigated by means of passive external lateral stabilization via spring-like cords. In the present study, we applied this method to test two hypotheses: (1) the effect of external stabilization on energy cost depends on the stiffness of the stabilizing springs, and (2) the energy cost for balance control, and consequently the effect of external stabilization on energy cost, depends on walking speed. Fourteen healthy young adults walked on a motor driven treadmill without stabilization and with stabilization with four different spring stiffnesses (between 760 and 1820 N m(- 1)) at three walking speeds (70 %, 100 %, and 130 % <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>speed).</b> Energy cost was calculated from breath-by-breath oxygen consumption. Gait parameters (mean and variability of step width and stride length, and variability of trunk accelerations) were calculated from kinematic data. On average external stabilization led to a decrease in energy cost of 6 % (p < 0. 005) {{as well as a}} decrease in step width (24 %; p < 0. 001), step width variability (41 %; p < 0. 001) and variability of medio-lateral trunk acceleration (12. 5 %; p < 0. 005). Increasing stabilizer stiffness increased the effects on both energy cost and medio-lateral gait parameters up to a stiffness of 1260 N m(- 1). Contrary to expectations, the effect of stabilization was independent of walking speed (p = 0. 111). These results show that active lateral stabilization during walking involves an energetic cost, which is independent of walking speed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: Balance control during walking {{has been}} shown to involve a {{metabolic}} cost in healthy subjects, but it is unclear how this cost changes as a function of postural threat. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the influence of postural threat on the energy cost of walking, as well as on concomitant changes in spatiotemporal gait parameters, muscle activity and perturbation responses. In addition, we examined if and how these effects are dependent on walking speed. Methods. Healthy subjects walked on a treadmill under four conditions of varying postural threat. Each condition was performed at 7 walking speeds ranging from 60 - 140 % <b>of</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> Postural threat was induced by applying unexpected sideward pulls to the pelvis and varied experimentally by manipulating the width of the path subjects had to walk on. Results: Results showed that the energy cost of walking increased by 6 - 13 % in the two conditions with the largest postural threat. This increase in metabolic demand was accompanied by adaptations in spatiotemporal gait parameters and increases in muscle activity, which likely served to arm the participants against a potential loss of balance in the face of the postural threat. Perturbation responses exhibited a slower rate of recovery in high threat conditions, probably reflecting a change in strategy to cope with the imposed constraints. The observed changes occurred independent of changes in walking speed, suggesting that walking speed is not a major determinant influencing gait stability in healthy young adults. Conclusions: The current study shows that in healthy adults, increasing postural threat leads to a decrease in gait economy, independent of walking speed. This could be an important factor in the elevated energy costs of pathological gait. © 2014 IJmker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

Despite this, relatively basic data, {{such as the}} locomotor speeds that animals choose to walk at in the wild, are sparse. If animals choose to walk with dynamic similarity, they will move at equal dimensionless speeds, represented by Froude number (Fr).

40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic {{nonlinear}} generative model for visual motion {{based on a}} latent representation of binary-gated Gaussian variables. Trained on sequences of images, the model learns to represent different movement directions in different variables. We use an online approximate inference scheme that can be mapped to the dynamics of networks of neurons. Probed with drifting grating stimuli and moving bars of light, neurons in the model show patterns of responses analogous to those of direction-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex. Most model neurons also show speed tuning and respond equally well {{to a range of}} motion directions and speeds aligned to the constraint line <b>of</b> their respective <b>preferred</b> <b>speed.</b> We show how these computations are enabled by a specific pattern of recurrent connections learned by the model. ...|$|R

Artificial Human Vision (AHV or visual prosthesis) systems use this method to provide a visual substitute for the blind. This paper reports on our experiments involving normally sighted participants using a portable AHV simulation. A Virtual Reality Head Mounted Display is used to display the phosphene simulation. Custom software converts captured images from a head mounted USB camera to a DirectX based phosphene simulation. The effects of frame rate (1, 2 and 4 FPS) and phosphene spatial resolution (16 x 12 and 32 x 24) on participant Percentage <b>of</b> <b>Preferred</b> Walking <b>Speed</b> (PPWS) and mobility errors were assessed during repeated trials on an artificial indoor mobility course. Results indicate that spatial resolution is a significant factor in reducing contact with obstacles and following a path without veering, however the phosphene display frame rate is a better predictor <b>of</b> a person’s <b>preferred</b> walking <b>speed.</b> These findings support the development of an adaptive display which could provide a faster display with reduced spatial resolution when a person is walking comfortably and a slower display with higher resolution when a person has stopped moving...|$|R
40|$|Background. Although the trot is {{described}} as a diagonal gait, contacts of the diagonal pairs of hooves are not usually perfectly synchronized. Although subtle, the timing dissociation between contacts of each diagonal pair could have consequences on gait dynamics and provide insight into the functional strategies employed. This study explores the mechanical effects of different diagonal dissociation patterns when speed was matched between individuals and how these effects link to moderate, natural changes in trotting speed. We anticipate that hind-first diagonal dissociation at contact increases with speed, diagonal dissociation at contact can reduce collision-based energy losses and predominant dissociation patterns will be evident within individuals. Methods. The study was performed in two parts: in the first 17 horses performed speedmatched trotting trials and in the second, five horses each performed 10 trotting trials that represented a range <b>of</b> individually <b>preferred</b> <b>speeds.</b> Standard motion capture provided kinematic data that were synchronized with ground reaction force (GRF) data from a series of force plates. The data were analyzed further to determine temporal, speed, GRF, postural, mass distribution, moment, and collision dynamics parameters. Results. Fore-first, synchronous, and hind-first dissociations were found in horses trotting at (3. 3 m/s � 10...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Classical dynamic {{fracture}} theories {{predict the}} Rayleigh surface wave speed (cR) {{to be the}} limiting speed of propagation for mode-I cracks in constitutively homo-geneous, isotropic, linear elastic materials subjected to re-mote loading. For mode-II cracks, propagating along pre-scribed straight line paths, the same theories, while ex-cluding the possibility of crack growth in the speed re-gime between cR and the shear wave speed, cs, do not ex-clude intersonic (cs< u <cl) crack tip speeds. In the present study, we provide the first experimental evidence of inter-sonic crack growth in such constitutively homogeneous and isotropic solids, ever recorded in a laboratory setting. Intersonic shear dominated crack growth, featuring shear shock waves, was observed along weak planes in a brittle polyester resin under far-field asymmetric loading. The shear cracks initially propagate at speeds just above cs and subsequently accelerate rapidly to the longitudinal wave speed (cl) of the solid. At longer times, when steady state conditions are attained, they propagate at speeds slightly higher than Ö 2 –cs. The experimental results com-pare well with existing asymptotic theories of intersonic crack growth, and the significance <b>of</b> the <b>preferred</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> Ö 2 –cs is discussed...|$|R
