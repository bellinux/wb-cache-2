25|$|Here <b>index</b> <b>n</b> {{refers to}} the n-th energy band, wavevector k {{is related to the}} {{direction}} of motion of the electron, r is the position in the crystal, and R is the location of an atomic site.|$|E
25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{is caused}} by the dispersion of the lens material—the variation of its refractive <b>index,</b> <b>n,</b> with the wavelength of light. Since, from the formulae above, f is dependent upon n, it follows that light of different wavelengths is focused to different positions. Chromatic aberration of a lens is seen as fringes of colour around the image. It can be minimised by using an achromatic doublet (or achromat) in which two materials with differing dispersion are bonded together to form a single lens. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. The use of achromats was an important step {{in the development of the}} optical microscope. An apochromat is a lens or lens system with even better chromatic aberration correction, combined with improved spherical aberration correction. Apochromats are much more expensive than achromats.|$|E

When light is travelling around the globe in an optical fibre, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending on its refractive <b>index</b> <b>n.</b> Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an electronic switch or signal regenerator.|$|E

30|$|The light {{scattering}} experiments are performed at two wavelengths: green light at 543.5 nm (G) and red light at 632.8 nm (R) (see below Sections 6.1 and 6.6). The optical <b>indices,</b> <b>n</b> and k, {{of the various}} samples are therefore needed for these two wavelengths.|$|R

Building on earlier work, particularly that of Somer, we show that the numbers in these sets can be written {{as a product of}} a so-called basic number, which can only be 1, 6 or 12, and particular primes, which are described explicitly.

The latter theory {{was not considered}} as correct, since it was not compatible with the aberration of light, and the auxiliary hypotheses developed to explain this problem were not convincing. Also, subsequent experiments as the Sagnac effect (1913) also showed that this model is untenable. However, the most important experiment supporting Fresnel's theory was Fizeau's 1851 experimental confirmation of Fresnel's 1818 prediction that a medium with refractive <b>index</b> <b>n</b> moving with a velocity v would increase {{the speed of light}} travelling through the medium {{in the same direction as}} v from c/n to: ...|$|E

2500|$|That is, {{movement}} adds only {{a fraction}} of the medium's velocity to the light (predicted by Fresnel in order to make Snell's law work in all frames of reference, consistent with stellar aberration). [...] This was initially interpreted to mean that the medium drags the aether along, with a portion of the medium's velocity, but that understanding became very problematic after Wilhelm Veltmann demonstrated that the <b>index</b> <b>n</b> in Fresnel's formula depended upon the wavelength of light, so that the aether could not be moving at a wavelength-independent speed. This implied that there must be a separate aether for each of the infinitely many frequencies.|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, concerning visible light, {{the real}} {{part of the}} refractive <b>index</b> <b>n</b> can deviate strongly from unity (n of glass in visible light ranges from 1.5 to 1.8) while the deviation from unity for X-rays in different media is generally {{of the order of}} 10−5. Thus, the refraction angles caused at the boundary between two isotropic media calculated with Snell's formula are also very small. The consequence of this is that refraction angles of X-rays passing through a tissue sample cannot be detected directly and are usually determined indirectly by [...] "observation of the interference pattern between diffracted and undiffracted waves produced by spatial variations of the real part of the refractive index." ...|$|E

If M does not admit a finite injective resolution, then by convention the injective dimension {{is said to be}} infinite. [...] As an example, consider a module M such that id(M)=0. In this situation, the exactness of the sequence 0 → M → I0 → 0 indicates that the arrow in the center is an isomorphism, and hence M itself is injective.|$|E
