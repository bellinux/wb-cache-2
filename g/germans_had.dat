5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon {{in the side of}} a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1943, his forces {{advanced}} forward towards the Belarusian city of Vitebsk. One of the key elements to Bagramyan's success was {{that many of the}} soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the Arctic regions of Siberia, enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> spent months preparing. Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of Gorodok, which served as a communications hub that the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the Red Air Force in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground. The German garrison was overwhelmed, and by 24 December, two infantry divisions and one tank division had surrendered. In Moscow, the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124-cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front.|$|E

5|$|The Watten bunker {{was to be}} {{built to}} a design based on the B.III-2a bunker, though {{substantially}} larger. The <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> originally planned to build a separate LOX plant at Stenay but this option was abandoned in favour of installing a LOX production facility within the Watten bunker.|$|E
5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} the dead were buried in the St-Laurent-sur-Mer {{cemetery}} on 15 September 1942. The funeral was only attended by the local German and the French Gendarmarie commanders.

5|$|The brigade {{group was}} moved to an area east of Troarn on 21August. With the 12th Devons leading they {{advanced}} again, occupying Branville, Vauville and Deauville on 22August. Attempts to cross the River Touques were repulsed by a force estimated to be around 1,200 men. Outflanking the German position, the 2nd OBLI crossed the river at Touques on 24August. Keeping {{the pressure on the}} retreating Germans on 25August, Le Correspondence, Petreville and Malhortie were captured. However, the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> retained control of the bridge outside Malhortie and the high ground at Manneville-la-Raoult. The 2nd OBLI attacked and captured the bridge intact, but Mannerville-la-Raoult was only taken at dusk, at the cost of several casualties. The next day, 26August, the battalion captured Foulbec on the River Seine at 19:00, although not before the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> destroyed the bridge, and earlier that day the 1st RUR had captured Berville-sur-Mer. On 27August the division was ordered to concentrate in the area between Honfleur and Pont Audemer.|$|E
5|$|World War II in Europe {{began on}} 1 September 1939, with Nazi Germany's {{invasion}} of Poland. Two days later, the UK and France {{declared war on}} Germany. Poland's geographical location, however, prevented the Allies from intervening directly. Four weeks into the attack, the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> successfully occupied Poland.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E

5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E

5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> been unable to develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For {{the first time the}} Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that the Germans did not have nuclear weapons, and would not have them for some time.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{sent for}} Brand again {{a few days}} later. Eichmann was {{accompanied}} this time by Gerhard Clages, also known as Otto Klages, chief of Himmler's Sicherheitsdienst (security service) in Budapest. Clages' presence meant that three of Himmler's senior officers– Eichmann, Becher and Clages– had involved themselves with the Brand proposal. Clages handed Brand $50,000 and 270,000 Swiss francs that the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> intercepted, sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by rescue workers in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest.|$|E
5|$|In early July, a {{few days}} after a communist-led mass {{uprising}} commenced, Aćimović reshuffled his government, replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of the portfolios. By mid-July, the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> decided that the Aćimović regime was incompetent and unable to deal with the uprising, and began looking for a replacement. At the end of August this resulted in the resignation of the Commissioner Government and the appointment of the Government of National Salvation led by former Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić, in which Aćimović initially retained the Interior portfolio.|$|E

Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses.

The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April, the Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a demonstration off Horns Reef {{to distract the}} Germans while the Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft. The Grand Fleet did not arrive in the area until after the <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> withdrawn, however.
