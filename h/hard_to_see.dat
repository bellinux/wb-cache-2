5|$|Keeping this in mind, {{it is not}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why {{technical}} divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, {{and commercial}} divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when its wings are closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in long grass.|$|E

5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis means {{making the}} animal or {{military}} equipment <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent).

5|$|The main {{mechanisms}} {{to create the}} resemblances described by Poulton – whether in nature or in military applications – are crypsis, blending into the background so as to become <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> (this covers both special and general resemblance); disruptive patterning, using colour and pattern {{to break up the}} animal's outline, which relates mainly to general resemblance; mimesis, resembling other objects of no special interest to the observer, which relates to special resemblance; countershading, using graded colour to create the illusion of flatness, which relates mainly to general resemblance; and counterillumination, producing light to match the background, notably in some species of squid.|$|E

5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, it was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, chestnut, brown, {{or nearly}} black in colour) {{separated}} by light hair (usually white or cream in colour). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed {{to serve as}} camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at even a few metres' distance, they actively move into the open to gain the best view of an approaching predator, obviating any benefit that camouflage might bring. Instead, the adults rely on their size and ability to defend themselves. However, camouflage appears to be important for calves, which spend {{a large part of}} the day in hiding, away from their mothers; further, over half of all calves die within a year, so predation is certainly important. It appears, therefore, that the spotted coat of the giraffe functions as camouflage for the young, while adults simply inherit this coloration as a by-product. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern.|$|E

5|$|The eye-sockets of Tyrannosaurus are {{positioned}} {{so that the}} eyes would point forward, giving them binocular vision slightly better than that of modern hawks. While predatory theropods in general had binocular vision {{directly in front of}} their skull, tyrannosaurs had a significantly larger area of overlap. Jack Horner also pointed out that the tyrannosaur lineage had a history of steadily improving binocular vision. It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how natural selection would have favored this long-term trend if tyrannosaurs had been pure scavengers, which would not have needed the advanced depth perception that stereoscopic vision provides. In modern animals, binocular vision is found mainly in predators (the principal exceptions are primates, which need it for leaping from branch to branch). Unlike Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight. In Gorgosaurus specimens, the eye socket was circular rather than oval or keyhole-shaped as in other tyrannosaurid genera. In Daspletosaurus, this was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E
