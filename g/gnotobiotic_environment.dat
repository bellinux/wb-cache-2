40|$|We {{describe}} {{the occurrence of}} acute monocytic leukemia in a dog with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) that had been raised in a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>environment</b> for 20 months. This case represents the first reported instance of malignancy in canine XSCID, the first case of acute monocytic leukemia in any species with severe combined immunodeficiency, and the first documented malignancy in any species with XSCID that {{was not associated with}} immunotherapy...|$|E
40|$|A light- and electron-microscopic {{study was}} made of the lungs of {{magnesium}} (Mg) -sufficient and Mg-deficient pathogen-free weanling rats raised in a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>environment.</b> Mg-sufficient rats were studied unstressed, after mild auditory stress, or after strychnine seizures and showed essentially no pulmonary pathology. Mg-deficient rats were studied with no known seizures or immediately after audiogenic seizure-shock. Light microscopy of lung from Mg-deficient rats with audiogenic seizure-shock revealed atelectasis, generalized edema and hemorrhage, and pleural petechiae. Ultrastructural changes in lung alveoli of Mg-deficient rats with seizure-shock included gaps in capillary endothelium, swelling and separation of endothelial cells from the underlying basement membranes; Type I cell necrosis and separation from basement membranes; and intraalveolar red blood cells, fibrin, and precipitated plasma. The seizure-shock episode of acute Mg deficiency produces structural changes in the lung similar to changes produced by several forms of shock, early acute oxygen toxicity, and the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in human neonates...|$|E
40|$|Male MF 1 -nu/nu/Ola/Hsd nude mice, {{maintained}} in a <b>gnotobiotic</b> <b>environment,</b> were dosed i. p. with either 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg 2 -bromoethanamine (BEA) hydrobromide to induce a model papillary necrosis. Renal histological changes {{were examined in}} semithin glycolmethacrylate resin sections at 24, 48 and 72 h after BEA treatment. The sequence of medullary changes included pyknosis of interstitial cell nuclei, increased staining of the interstitial mucopolysaccharide matrix, platelets adhering to capillary endothelium, necrosis of collecting duct epithelial cells and denudation of the covering epithelium of the papilla. This {{was similar to that}} previously described in the Wistar rat, but the time course was extended. There was also a concomitant and extensive cortical necrosis of the P 2 and P 3 segments of the proximal tubule, which was evident prior to the onset of renal papillary necrosis at the higher doses of BEA. Nude mice show an atypical response to BEA compared to several mouse and rat strains, the hamster and pig, that suggests unique characteristics in this athymic murine mutant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The key to {{achieving}} successful, reproducible results following {{the introduction of}} beneficial microbes into soil relies on the survival rate of the inoculated bacteria in a heterogeneous soil environment and hence an improved encapsulation method was developed. Owing to the constraints associated with the inoculum formulation, in this study, encapsulation of a plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) isolate Bacillus subtilis CC-pg 104 was attempted with alginate by enriching the bead microenvironment with humic acid. High viability of the encapsulated bacteria was observed with minimum cell loss upon storage for 5 months. Steady and constant cell release from the beadwasobserved for 1 week at different pH. Encapsulated cells remained active as evidenced by their ability to solubilize calcium phosphate in vitro. Successful plant growth promotion of lettuce by the encapsulated bacteria under <b>gnotobiotic</b> and sterile <b>environment</b> was also achieved. Feasibility of this improved encapsulation technique is mainly due to the dual benefits of humic acid to microbe and plant and its chemical properties allowinganeasymixingwithalginate without interfering {{in the formation of}} the alginate gel beads by cross-linking with Ca 2 Ã¾ ions. Thus, the encapsu-lation method described in this study can be effectively used to protect the PGPB inoculum from adverse condi-tions of the soil for their successful establishment in th...|$|R

Thus, the encapsulation method described in this study can be effectively used to protect the PGPB inoculum from adverse conditions of the soil for their successful establishment in the rhizosphere.
