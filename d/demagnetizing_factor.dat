40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} bulk flow within a ferrofluid-filled container subjected to a rotating uniform magnetic field are experimentally studied. There are two prevailing theories: spin diffusion theory and flow due to non-uniformities in magnetic field within the ferrofluid due to nonuniform <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factors.</b> This research sought to confirm previous measurements that indicated <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factors</b> are {{the primary cause of}} bulk ferrofluid flow. Flattened spherical containers of various volumes, and thus different <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factors,</b> were filled with EFH 1 oil-based ferrofluid and subjected to a uniform rotating magnetic field of varying conditions (rotation direction and field strength). The shapes and magnitudes of the velocity profiles measured by an ultrasound velocimeter system differed between containers, indicating that <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factors</b> did affect flow. The complicated flows within the flattened spheres that affected both the shape and magnitude of the flow velocity prevented a direct magnitude comparison between profiles but the flows differed enough to safely conclude that spatial non-uniformities within the fluid likely caused the bulk flow of fluid in the uniform rotating magnetic field. by Michael John Snively.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of surface/interface roughness on the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factor</b> of a thin magnetic film with a single or a double boundary of self-affine, mound or anisotropic roughness. For a film with a single self-affine rough boundary, the in-plane <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factor</b> Nxx(yy) {{is proportional to the}} interface width w square and to the leading order is inversely proportional to the lateral correlation length ξ. The roughness exponent α is also shown to greatly affect Nxx(yy). For a film with a single mound boundary, Nxx(yy) is inversely proportional to the apparent correlation length, and also depends on the ratio of the two different lateral lengths: the average mound separation λ and the randomness correlation length ζ. It is also shown that an anisotropic surface morphology can induce anisotropic in-plane demagnetizing factors. The demagnetizing anisotropy can be magnified by a morphological anisotropy. Furthermore, we consider films with two rough boundaries. Besides a general formalism derived for the <b>demagnetizing</b> <b>factor,</b> we investigate how the cross correlation of the two rough boundaries affects the in-plane demagnetizing factors.

40|$|A ferrofluid is a {{collection}} of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles with a stabilizing surfactant in a liquid to form a colloid. The dynamic behavior of ferrofluids in the presence of magnetic fields has long been an area of research interest. A particular area of interest deals with the "spin-up" mechanisms of ferrofluids, which describe how a container of ferrofluid comes to a steady state of bulk flow when subjected to a uniform rotating external magnetic field. There are two prevailing theories that attempt to explain the spin-up mechanisms of ferrofluids: spin diffusion theory, and the presence of non-uniformities in the magnetic field, due to "demagnetizing factors" introduced by the shape of the container. This research attempts to confirm previous measurements indicating that non-uniformities in the magnetic field are the primary cause of ferrofluid bulk flow.
