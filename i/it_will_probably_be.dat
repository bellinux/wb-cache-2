25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E

25|$|The Østfold Line has {{the largest}} {{potential}} {{for an increase in}} freight traffic, with an estimated eleven trains per direction per day. These include freight trains to Götaland in Sweden, including a shuttle service to the Port of Gothenburg. Services could also run to Denmark and further south. Two steep hills, Brynsbakken on the Loenga–Alnabru Line and Tistedalsbakken south of Halden are currently major hindrances. Proposals have been made to build new lines to bypass these hills. One alternative to the south is to build a new railway from around Berg to Skee on the Bohus Line in Sweden. The capacity through the Western Line will be so large, especially during rush hour north of Moss, that it is possible that all freight trains may be routed via the Eastern Line. This will probably also mean that the existing railway between Sarpsborg and Halden will be kept, although <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> demolished north of Sarpsborg.|$|E

Online cited the song as sounding [...] "more like her older stuff" [...] and wrote that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> [...] "more attractive to radio stations", than [...] "Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)", the first single from Bittersweet World. Nick Levine of Digital Spy called [...] "Little Miss Obsessive" [...] a [...] "decent enough tune, not a million miles away from 'Pieces of Me', but we can't see it reviving the album's fortunes".|$|E
500|$|During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius {{continued}} {{to work on the}} symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if I had come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> my last.

500|$|Fischer {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country. Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies". According to Frank Brady, The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> a part of the canon of chess for many years to come."

500|$|The {{money from}} ABC was {{contingent}} on Disney television programs. The studio {{had been involved}} in a successful television special on Christmas Day 1950 about the making of Alice in Wonderland. Roy believed the program added millions to the box office takings. In a March 1951 letter to shareholders, he wrote that [...] "television can be a most powerful selling aid for us, as well as a source of revenue. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> on this premise that we enter television when we do". In 1954, after the Disneyland funding had been agreed, ABC broadcast Walt Disney's Disneyland, an anthology consisting of animated cartoons, live-action features and other material from the studio's library. The show was successful in terms of ratings and profits, earning an audience share of over 50%. In April 1955, Newsweek called the series an [...] "American institution". ABC was pleased with the ratings, leading to Disney's first daily television program, The Mickey Mouse Club, a variety show catering specifically to children. The program was accompanied by merchandising through various companies (Western Printing, for example, had been producing coloring books and comics for over 20 years, and produced several items connected to the show). One of the segments of Disneyland consisted of the five-part miniseries Davy Crockett which, according to Gabler, [...] "became an overnight sensation". The show's theme song, [...] "The Ballad of Davy Crockett", became internationally popular, and ten million records were sold. As a result, Disney formed his own record production and distribution entity, Disneyland Records.|$|E

2500|$|As an example, the {{radioactive}} decay of carbon-14 is exponential with a half-life of 5,730 years. A quantity of carbon-14 will decay {{to half of}} its original amount (on average) after 5,730 years, regardless of how big or small the original quantity was. After another 5,730 years, one-quarter of the original will remain. On the other hand, the time {{it will take a}} puddle to half-evaporate depends on how deep the puddle is. Perhaps a puddle of a certain size will evaporate down to half its original volume in one day. But on the second day, {{there is no reason to}} expect that one-quarter of the puddle will remain; in fact, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> much less than that.

[...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say I think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> a popular book.

2500|$|The Dongyang/Yiwu {{incidents}} {{had occurred}} {{against a backdrop}} of widespread civil unrest in the PRC. Crime had become a serious problem, something of a residue of the Cultural Revolution. The economic reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping reduced duplication of workers, resulting in a substantial number of workers being displaced. When an Anti-Crime Campaign began in August 1983, the wave of persecutions that had already begun after the Dongyang/Yiwu incidents was quickly subsumed under it. Government entities at various levels issued proclamations outlawing [...] "the Shouters sect" [...] as a criminal cult. Leaders of the local churches using publications of Witness Lee were targeted for arrest, but many unregistered house church leaders were also incarcerated. Several sources have noted that [...] "the Shouters sect" [...] was applied broadly to any Christian group which refused to join TSPM. Jonathan Chao of the CCRC speculated that Tang and Ren’s book [...] "may be TSPM’s way of isolating Li’s group from other Christians, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> effective since evangelical house church leaders in China will not support Li against the TSPM." ...|$|E
