2500|$|The hooves {{of a horse}} or pony are cleaned {{by being}} picked out with a <b>hoof</b> <b>pick</b> to remove any stones, mud and dirt and to check that the shoes (if worn) are in good condition. [...] Keeping feet clean and dry {{wherever}} possible helps prevent both lameness as well as hoof diseases such as thrush (a hoof fungus). [...] The feet should be cleaned every time the horse is ridden, and if the horse is not ridden, it is still best practice to check and clean feet frequently. [...] Daily cleaning is recommended in many management books, though if horses are on turnout and not being ridden, a weekly hoof check of healthy horses is often sufficient during good weather.|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} sign of thrush {{is usually the}} odor that occurs when picking out the feet. Additionally, the {{infected}} areas of the hoof will be black in color (even on a dark-horned hoof), and will easily break or crumble when scraped with a <b>hoof</b> <b>pick.</b> When picking the hooves around thrush areas, the differences between healthy and infected areas can be seen when white/gray tissue (healthy frog) is surrounding a dark, smelly (infected) area.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ha! Ha!' said Mowgli, on his back. 'Now thou knowest!' and {{the torrent}} of black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the ravine just as {{boulders}} {{go down in}} flood-time; the weaker buffaloes being shouldered out {{to the sides of}} the ravine where they tore through the creepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible charge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand. Shere Khan heard the thunder of their <b>hoofs,</b> <b>picked</b> himself up and lumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of escape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on, heavy with his dinner and drink, willing to do anything rather than fight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing till the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot of the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came to the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their calves), and then Rama tripped, and stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet by the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the plain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and slipped off Rama's neck, laying about right and left with his stick.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hoof</b> <b>pick</b> or {{horseshoe}} nail {{can help}} remove the plug prior to insertion of a screw-in stud. A special instrument called a T-tap {{is used to}} clean out the stud holes before the stud is screwed in, or {{it can be used to}} re-tap the stud hole if the threads are damaged. Additionally, a small metal brush can be used to help clean threads which are especially dirty. A wrench is used to tighten or loosen the studs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most basic}} form of hoofcare is cleaning, or [...] "picking out the feet". A <b>hoof</b> <b>pick</b> {{is used to}} remove mud, manure, and rocks from the sole of the hoof. Removal of mud and manure helps to prevent thrush, a common hoof ailment which in very severe cases may cause lameness, {{and the removal of}} rocks helps to prevent stone bruises. In the winter, hoof picking also {{provides}} the chance to remove packs of snow from the horse's hooves, which can cause uncomfortable [...] "snowballs". Additionally, when the hoof is cleaned, it can be visually inspected for problems such as puncture wounds due to a nail (which {{has the potential to be}} very serious if left untreated).|$|E
50|$|All crevices of the hoof are cleaned, {{particularly}} the sulci between the frog and the bars, as those areas {{are most likely}} to trap rocks or other debris, and also are the most common area to develop thrush. It is best to work the <b>hoof</b> <b>pick</b> from heel to toe, so to avoid accidentally jabbing the horse's leg, the frog of the hoof, or the person using the pick. When picking the feet, the groom stands at the horse's side, facing the tail of the horse, then slides his or her hand down the horse's leg. If the horse was not trained to pick up its foot when a person runs their hand to the fetlock and lifts lightly, most horses will pick up their feet if the tendons behind their cannon bone are squeezed. Some horses, particularly draft breeds, may be trained to pick up their feet to pressure on their fetlock.|$|E
