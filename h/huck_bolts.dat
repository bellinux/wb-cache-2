50|$|Sutphen {{produces}} {{all types}} of fire related vehicles on their own chassis including the usual engines, ladders, and rescues but also provides bodies for commercial chassis applications. The company still produces mid-mount aerials as either a tower ladder platform (with a bucket/basket) or in a ladder tower form (no bucket) plus industrial application aerials today. On April 21, 2016 at FDIC International the company debuted its first ever rear-mount aerial with the Sutphen SLR 75. The following year Sutphen previewed a 108-foot model. Previously, Sutphen had produced tillers in the 1990s including a unique tiller-tower concept where the bucket of the tiller aerial also acted as the tillerman's cab. The concept {{never made it to}} production. All Sutphen aerials are made of Aluminum alloys and fastened with aircraft-type <b>Huck</b> <b>Bolts.</b> The hydraulics are custom designed and built by the company for their applications.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNLâ€™s) progress-to-date {{on the development}} of joint designs for a composite structural member attached to a metal member for heavy vehicle chassis components. The joint design baseline was first established by characterizing the static and fatigue strength of a steel/steel <b>Huck</b> <b>bolt</b> joint assembly. The effects of various manufacturing factors and operational conditions on the static and fatigue strength of the hybrid joint were studied with a commercially available composite material. It was found that loading mode and washer size have significant influence on the static and fatigue strength of the hybrid joint. In addition, it was found that a test frequency of 15 Hz can be used for the hybrid joints without inducing significant temperature changes during fatigue testing...|$|R
