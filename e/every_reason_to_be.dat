25|$|Both teams {{went into}} the semi-final first leg with {{identical}} records in this season's Champions League, each having won eight games and drawn two, while scoring 18 goals and conceding five. United were awarded a penalty three minutes into the game, after Gabriel Milito handled Cristiano Ronaldo's header from a corner. Ronaldo himself stepped up to take the kick, but, despite sending Víctor Valdés the wrong way, smacked his shot against the post. The missed penalty seemed to give Barcelona the extra impetus they needed, {{and they began to}} take control of the game. Just before the half-hour, Ronaldo made a break into the Barça penalty area, only to be bodychecked by Rafael Márquez, who made no attempt to get to the ball. Rightfully expecting another penalty to be awarded, the look of dismay on Ronaldo's face was justified when he saw referee Massimo Busacca wave play on. Márquez fouled Ronaldo again just before half time, this time about 25yards from goal. Márquez was shown a yellow card for his trouble, which meant he was ineligible for the second leg on 29 April, but Ronaldo saw his resulting free kick go just a yard wide of the far post. A number of saves from Van der Sar and a Michael Carrick block kept Barcelona at bay, while Carrick himself came close to scoring at the other end, rippling the side-netting after making space for himself on the left side of the penalty area. The match finished as a scoreless draw, with Barcelona having had the better of the possession, but with the second leg being played at Old Trafford, United had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confident.|$|E
500|$|The Pierce administration, {{which took}} office in March 1853, had a strong pro-southern, pro-expansion mindset. [...] It sent Louisiana Senator Pierre Soulé to Spain to {{negotiate}} the acquisition of Cuba. [...] Pierce appointed expansionists John Y. Mason of Virginia and Solon Borland of Arkansas as ministers, respectively, to France and Nicaragua. Pierce's Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis, was already on record as favoring a southern route for a transcontinental railroad, so southern rail enthusiasts had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> encouraged.|$|E
2500|$|George {{enjoyed a}} boost in {{popularity}} after the attack, and received congratulatory messages {{from all over the}} kingdom. His calm forbearance and progressive attitude to the insane were praised. He wrote that after [...] "the interposition of Providence in the late attempt on my life by a poor insane woman" [...] he [...] "had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied with the impression it has awakened in this country". Nevertheless, {{as a result of the}} attack, the security surrounding the King was increased from 4 guards to 11.|$|E
60|$|Knowing {{that attack}} from the tree was now improbable, we {{determined}} to explore the cave, which we had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>was</b> but {{a continuation of the}} path we had already traversed, leading the gods alone knew where, but quite evidently away from this valley of grim ferocity.|$|R
60|$|The Minute Boys <b>were</b> ordered <b>to</b> {{remain at}} their post over the sally-port, {{much to my}} disappointment, for if the Indians did not {{take part in the}} assault, which we had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>was</b> near at hand, then would our duties be so light that we could not hope to win much credit.|$|R

2500|$|... "The postwar {{generations of}} European elites aimed {{to create more}} {{democratic}} societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services {{in a way that}} prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values—or so it appeared at the time." ...|$|E

6000|$|He came in, old, eminently respectable, but shaken. He {{was greatly}} shaken. [...] "Gentlemen," [...] he said nervously, [...] "I hasten {{to bring you}} a communication, a most {{extraordinary}} communication, which I have just received. It {{is nothing less than}} a confession--a full confession--from a person whom I had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>was</b> dead. It is from Lord Harry Norland." ...|$|R

6000|$|The Major did not {{smile in}} the least, {{though he had}} <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> amused. [...] "Monstrous {{handsome}} young man that--as fine a looking soldier as ever I saw," [...] he said to Costigan.|$|E

60|$|I, however, {{like those}} gentlemen of leisure who breakfast {{at home and}} dine at their club, almost invariably, during my {{intervals}} of health, enjoyed the afternoon repast with the bachelor chiefs of the Ti, who <b>were</b> always rejoiced <b>to</b> see me, and lavishly spread before me {{all the good things}} which their larder afforded. Mehevi generally produced, among other dainties, a baked pig, an article which, I have <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose, <b>was</b> provided for my sole gratification.|$|R
60|$|In the {{previous}} chapters {{we have seen}} that with mammals, birds, fishes, insects, &c., many characters, which there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>were</b> primarily gained through sexual selection by one sex alone, have <b>been</b> transferred <b>to</b> both sexes. As this same form of transmission has apparently prevailed to a large extent with mankind, it will save much useless repetition if we consider the characters peculiar to the male sex together with certain other characters common to both sexes.|$|R
6000|$|... "But your {{conduct is}} outrageous, Miss Ashleigh," [...] Miss Harmer said angrily. [...] "You first gratuitously {{assume that this}} will--which there <b>is</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>is</b> long since destroyed--is in existence; upon the {{strength}} of this unfounded and injurious supposition you insult us grossly, and have shocked and alarmed my poor sister beyond description. If such a thing occur again, or if any similar attempt is made, I shall call in the assistance of the law for our protection." ...|$|R

60|$|Skip was radiant with delight, {{as he had}} <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> since now he {{felt certain}} his past misdeeds were atoned for, and the {{partners}} {{repeated over and over}} again that they owed him a debt which could never be repaid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wedding was}} {{believed}} by one source <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> politically arranged, and in France, {{it was believed}} that the Count of Paris (the bride's uncle) was personally responsible for the match. However, the same source claimed that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that <b>was</b> a genuine love match".|$|R
60|$|But {{the most}} {{conclusive}} {{evidence that we}} have in regard <b>to</b> this subject <b>is</b> the fact, that {{one of the members of}} Dr Kane's expedition, while in search of Sir John Franklin, did actually, on foot, reach what we have <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>was</b> this open sea; but not being able to get their ship into it, the party had no means of exploring it, or extending their investigations. The account of this discovery is so interesting, and withal so romantic, that we extract a few paragraphs relating to it from Kane's work.|$|R
60|$|Richard, {{not knowing}} {{who might have}} betrayed him and <b>to</b> what extent, <b>was</b> very fearful--having through his {{connection}} with the Cause <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> so <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Blake, on the other hand, conscious of his innocence of any plotting, was impatient of his position, and a thought contemptuous. It was he who, upon being ushered by the constable and his men into the august presence of the Lord-Lieutenant, clamoured to know precisely {{of what he was}} accused that he might straightway clear himself.|$|R

60|$|Ferrante saw trouble {{ahead of}} him with Lodovico Sforza, {{concerning}} a matter which shall {{be considered in the}} next chapter, and not at all would it suit him at such a time that such a Pope as Alexander--who, he had <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> suppose, would <b>be</b> on the side of Lodovico--should rule in Rome.|$|R

60|$|It <b>is</b> singular, that <b>to</b> the eastward of this group, no snowy {{mountains}} are seen, {{and the lower}} Himalaya also dip suddenly. This depression is no doubt partly due to perspective; but {{as there is no}} such sudden disappearance of the chain to the westward, where peaks are seen 35 degrees to the west of north, it is far more probable that the valley of the Soobansiri river, which rises in Tibet far behind these peaks, is broad and open; as is that of the Dihong, still farther east, which we have <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>is</b> the Tibetan Yaru or Burrampooter.|$|R

40|$|Violence is an {{instrument}} of segregation, whether it manifests physically, emotionally, verbally or by any other means. Can the church be {{an instrument}} of reconciliation where people have been divided through violence? This article explores the reconciliatory role of the Sacrament of Holy Communion in the Methodist tradition, which has as a Christian denomination, experienced many threats of division in its history. Holy Communion, it is argued, is the one place where people, who may find <b>every</b> <b>reason</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> together, <b>are</b> invited <b>to</b> share in an event which unites them...|$|R
