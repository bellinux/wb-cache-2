Also in 2009, {{she appeared in}} the film Broken Embraces as Lena. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com noted in her review for the film that Cruz [...] "doesn't coast on her beauty in Broken Embraces, and she <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of role that {{can be difficult to}} flesh out". Cruz received nominations from the Satellite Awards and European Film Awards for her performance in Broken Embraces. Cruz's final 2009 film was the film version of the musical Nine, playing the character Carla Albanese, the lead character's mistress. Variety reported that Cruz had originally auditioned for the role of the film within a film's star, Claudia, which eventually went to Nicole Kidman.

500|$|Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone {{wrote of}} the song: [...] "'You,' the single which preceded Extra Texture... {{is not only the}} best thing he has done since 1971's 'My Sweet Lord,' but also promised some of the {{prestige}} and credibility he lost with last year's sourvoiced album (Dark Horse) and fizzled tour." [...] In the NME, Neil Spencer opined: [...] "'You' seems at least to proclaim a return to energy. It <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of semi-Spector production that was spread all over All Things Must Pass. It bounds along OK, Harrison's double-tracked vocals gasp convincingly, and it deserves to be the hit that it will be." [...] Reviewing for Melody Maker, Ray Coleman highlighted Harrison's vocal and the musical contributions from Horn and Russell, and said: [...] "It's a dead cert disco smash, his finest single since 'My Sweet Lord'." [...] Coleman added that the lyrics were [...] "deceptively simple" [...] since, as with Harrison's 1969 composition [...] "Something", [...] "they say a lot by saying a little." [...] Writing later in the 1970s, however, in their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler dismissed the song with the words: [...] "Doleful, lacklustre, [...] would-be singalongs which quite fail to arouse." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Beverly Bryan of The Village Voice {{stated that the}} album [...] "casts a spell with deep feeling, and melodies and lyrics that linger in the mind. Elegantly adorned with subtle strings and velvety production, it <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of warmth people are always saying they can hear on old vinyl records". Bryan also predicted that this release would be recognized {{in the future as}} the singer's [...] "most profound and enduring statement". In another positive review, Natalia Cano of the magazine Rolling Stone Mexico, referred to the album as [...] "fresh and honest pop, a reflection of her musical maturity", reiterating that the album [...] "continues to place her {{as one of the most}} important composer and performer of Latin America." [...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it is too early in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry". Corsa also noted that the singer [...] "drew from Joni Mitchell, Charles Bradley, and Amy Winehouse".|$|E
