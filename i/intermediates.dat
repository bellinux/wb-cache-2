5|$|An {{important}} goal of measuring enzyme kinetics {{is to determine}} the chemical mechanism of an enzyme reaction, i.e., the sequence of chemical steps that transform substrate into product.

5|$|If the {{reaction}} path proceeds over one or several <b>intermediates,</b> kcat {{will be a}} function of several elementary rate constants, whereas in the simplest case of a single elementary reaction (e.g. no <b>intermediates)</b> it will be identical to the elementary unimolecular rate constant k2. The apparent unimolecular rate constant kcat is also called turnover number and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second.|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the <b>intermediates</b> (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and oxaloacetate) are {{regenerated}} during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} <b>intermediates</b> to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other <b>intermediates</b> as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate, no product has been formed and no <b>intermediates</b> exist.

5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur.

5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic <b>intermediates</b> to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer <b>intermediates</b> are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E

5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised <b>intermediates</b> to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid).
