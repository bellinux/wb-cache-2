40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effect of {{buoyancy}} convection during the directional solidification of AlZn eutectic alloy. Experiments have been conducted using a Bridgman-Stockbarger arrangement with the furnace moving along the specimen. The apparatus rotated around the horizontal axis, which made it possible to carry out measurements at different angles β contained by the gravity and temperature gradient vectors in the specimen. The anisotropy of both the linear thermal expansion coefficient α and the hardness HK measured by the <b>Knoop</b> <b>method</b> has been studied. The dilatation measurements confirmed the expected anisotropy of the linear thermal expansion of directionally solidified specimens. The values of HK correspond with the lamellar spacing measured in the metallographic study...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of Zr-based thin films on vulcanized synthetic rubber {{by means of}} self-ion-assisted deposition was investigated by utilizing the Rutherford backscattering technique and RUMP code simulation. Pin Pull Test method was applied both to measure the level of adhesion between the deposited metal (Me) -based layer and rubber and mechanical properties of modified rubber surface. Hardness measurements of the thin films on substrate were fulfilled by applying a conventional <b>Knoop</b> <b>method,</b> an ultra-low load indenter and a laser-acoustic test method. The deposited films may be soft or very hard in dependence of Me species. Deposition of Me-based coatings changes the wettability of the modified rubber to water. We observe 10 % decrease and 30 % increase in a contact angle of water when Mo-based and Zr-based coatings are deposited on the rubber...|$|E
40|$|A {{technology}} {{to improve the}} tribological and mechanical surface properties of iron alloys is developed based on the electroless nickel plating. The technology combines sol-gel and electroless deposition technique. Novel nanocomposite coatings are obtained consisting of Nickel-phosphorus-nanodiamond (Ni-P-ND). The ND sol is added directly to the electroless Ni-P solution. A suitable surfactant is added to achieve well-dispersed ND particles in the electroless solution to facilitate their embodiment and equal distribution in the coating. Substrates of steel 17 CrNiMo 6 and spheroidal graphite cast irons are used for the manufacture of the iron alloys specimens. The surface morphology and microstructure observation performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical metallography confirms the influence of ND particles on the coating structure. The structural phase investigation by X Ray analysis indicates a transformation of the amorphous phase to a crystalline one such as Ni, Ni 3 P after coatings' heat treatment. The microhardness investigation by <b>Knoop</b> <b>Method</b> and wear resistance measurement {{in accordance with the}} Polish Standard PN- 83 /H- 04302 of Ni-P and Ni-P-ND composite coatings are evaluated and compared with each other. The increase in the value of hardness and wear resistance of Ni-P composite coatings in the presence of ND particles and after heat treatment is obtained...|$|E

40|$|Submicron {{thickness}} {{films of}} zirconium and hafnium carbides were electron beam deposited on the sandblasted {{surface of a}} metallic titanium substrate. The films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and the hardness of the composite film-substrate systems was measured by both Vickers and <b>Knoop</b> microindentation <b>methods</b> in the wide indentation loading range. The intrinsic hardness of the film was separated out from the composite hardness using an area law-of-mixtures approach and {{taking into account the}} indentation size effect. Measured with Vickers (Hf 0 V) and Knoop (Hf 0 K) indenters, the hardness was evaluated to be of about 26 and 24 GPa, respectively, for ZrC, and 19 and 21 GPa, respectively, for HfC films, being somewhat higher compared to published data for bulk carbides.

40|$|TiN {{films on}} mild steel were {{deposited}} by reactive d. c. magnetron sputtering; electroplated chromium was incorporated as an interlayer. Surface hardness, {{measured by the}} <b>Knoop</b> indentation <b>method</b> under a load of 25 gf. phase analysis by the X-ray diffraction method and corrosion behaviour by the potentiodynamic measurement technique of these coatings have been evaluated. Surface hardness values were found to increase from about 1000 - 1100 for TiN coatings on mild steel to about 1800 - 1900 (HK 25) for TiN coatings with chromium as interlayer. Potentiodynamic corrosion tests, performed in 1 N H 2 SO 4 solutions, have shown that with chromium interlayer the corrosion resistance increases significantly as compared to TiN only sputtered coatings on mild steel samples. No spalling of TiN coatings was observed during full sweep voltage of - 1000 mV to + 1000 mV when they were tested with a chromium interlayer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: Re-examining {{the well}} {{accepted}} concept that Zinc-Oxide-Eugenol bases (ZOE) {{have a negative}} ef-fect on composite restoration materials microhardness, {{in light of the}} advancement in composite materials and newer pub-lications. Methods: Five modern composite restoration materials were used, including hybrid (Xtra-fill and Z 250), micro-fill hybrid (G-aenial and Gradia-direct) and methacrylate-free restorative material (Silorane- oxirane). Two base materials were used IRM (ZOE-base) and Fuji-IX (GI-base). Samples were made using a designed mold, in which composite discs were cured on top and in close relation to base materials. Micro-hardness testing was performed using a DMH- 2 microhardness tester utilizing the <b>Knoop</b> <b>method.</b> Results: Statistic analysis demonstrated significantly better microhardness of three composite materials when IRM was used as base in comparison to control (G-aenial, Gradia direct and Filtek silorane), and no differences in two materials (Filtek universal Z 250 and Voco Xtra-fil). Fuji-IX bases showed a significant positive effect on the microhardness of four composite materials, and a negative effect on one material (Voco Xtra-fill). In comparison with other tested restoration materials, both Voco Xtra-fill and Fuji-IX showed higher microhardness results (P< 0. 05). Significance: Related to microhardness, both ZOE and GI bases can be used safely as bases under composite restorations. The results of this study together with the results published recently showed that the concept of not using ZOE or GI base...|$|E
40|$|Thirty percent {{carbamide}} peroxide {{is widely used}} as in extra-coronal bleaching method. Its current effect on enamel (e. g. enamel microhardness) is still uncertain. In dentistry, fluoride is recommended to be applied in 60 seconds. The {{aim of this study}} is to observe the effect of 30 % {{carbamide peroxide}} on enamel microhardness and also the effect of fluoride application on enamel microhardness that changed upon bleaching activity within shorter period than time of application recommended (30 seconds), in recommended period of application (60 seconds), and in a longer period of 90 seconds. Thirty extracted teeth were bleached with 30 % carbamide peroxide for 1 hour, and the enamel microhardness was measured by <b>Knoop</b> <b>method.</b> The microhardness of enamel was also evaluated soon after application of fluoride to the bleached tooth and after fluoride application and immersion in artificial saliva for one hour. It was revealed that the microhardness of normal enamel was 360, 46 KHN and decreased significantly to 170, 33 KHN (57 %) after application of 30 % carbamide peroxide. Soon after application of fluoride there was an increase in enamel microhardness although not significant on all duration of application. After application of fluoride and one hour immersion in saliva, the enamel microhardness increases significantly, especially in duration of fluoride and one hour immersion in saliva, the enamel microhardness increased significantly, especially in duration of fluoride application longer than recommended (90 seconds). Based on data above, it can be concluded that there was a 57 % decrease in enamel hardness after application of 30 % carbamide peroxide and this enamel microhardness increased after application of fluoride and after immersion in artificial saliva...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} plasma-sprayed coatings is studied by recourse to instrumented spherical micro-indentation. It is {{shown that the}} elastic moduli of the coatings can be determined in a more reliable and reproducible manner with instrumented spherical indentation than prior (<b>Knoop)</b> indentation <b>methods,</b> {{while at the same}} time minimizing damage to the coating during indentation. The results show that the values of the elastic moduli, E, of air plasma-sprayed (APS) materials are much lower than those of vacuum plasma-sprayed (VPS) materials. The VPS deposits are more homogeneous at a microstructural level as splat formation, microcracking and the development of oxide scales are suppressed. Such homogenization increases the value of E to the point where it becomes similar to that of fully dense materials. Larger amounts of inelastic flow occur in APS deposits as compared with VPS deposits. This flow is associated with fracture and sliding of splats. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The present work {{shows how}} data {{obtained}} in a depth-sensing indentation test using a Knoop indenter may be analyzed to provide elastic modulus and hardness of the specimen material. The method {{takes into account}} the elastic recovery along the direction of the short axis of the residual impression as the indenter is removed. If elastic recovery is not accounted for, the elastic modulus and hardness are overestimated by an amount that depends on the ratio of E/H of the specimen material. The new method of analysis expresses the elastic recovery of the short diagonal of the residual impression into an equivalent face angle for one side of the <b>Knoop</b> indenter. Conventional <b>methods</b> of analysis using this corrected angle provide results for modulus and hardness that are consistent with those obtained with other types of indenters...|$|R
40|$|Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr based AA 7010 {{aluminum}} alloy {{belongs to the}} class of heat treatable alloys and the semi-finished products are generally produced by hot rolling, forging or extrusion processes. It {{is well known that}} the thermo-mechanical processing parameters strongly influence both the evolution of texture as well as microstructure in the material. As a result, the semi-finished products exhibit anisotropy in mechanical properties causing legitimate concerns on the applicability of the alloys. In the present thesis, a systematic study on the evolution of texture and microstructure and its implications on the mechanical properties anisotropy of AA 7010 alloy has been attempted. A brief introduction on the development of texture and its influence on the anisotropy of the mechanical properties of 7 xxx series {{aluminum alloy}}s is presented first with a view to explore the scopes for further investigation. An overview of the relevant literature is described subsequently. The development of texture and microstructure in an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu-Zr based 7010 aluminum alloy during uneven, hot cross-rolling is presented. Materials processing involves three different types of uneven cross-rolling. The variations in relative intensity of the β-fibre components as a function of cross rolling modes have been investigated. It has been shown that the main attributes to the texture evolution in the present study are (a) cross-rolling and inter-pass annealing that reduce the intensity of Cu component following each successive pass, (b) recrystallization resistance of Bs oriented grains, (c) stability of Bs texture under cross-rolling, and (d) Zener pinning by Al 3 Zr dispersoids. The stability of the unique single, rotated Brass-{ 110 }(556) component developed in the present alloy, during long term thermal annealing and cold rolling deformation has been systematically investigated further. Subsequently, the influence of development of microstructure and texture on the in-plane anisotropy (AIP) of yield strength, work hardening behavior and yield locus anisotropy has been presented. The AIP and work hardening behavior are evaluated by tensile testing at 0 o, 45 o and 90 o to the rolling direction, whilst yield loci have been generated by <b>Knoop</b> hardness <b>method.</b> It has been observed that in spite of having strong rotated Brass texture, the specimens show low AIP especially in peak aged temper. The in-plane anisotropy (AIP) of yield strength, and work hardening behavior of a heat treated 7010 aluminum alloy sheet having strong, rotated Brass-{ 110 } 556  component with different texture intensity and volume fraction of recrystallization has been further evaluated. It is observed that the AIP increases with increase in texture intensity and volume fraction of recrystallization. In the subsequent chapter, the tensile flow and work hardening behavior are described using constitutive equations. Room temperature tensile properties have been evaluated as a function of tensile axis orientations in as-hot rolled as well as peak aged conditions. It has been found that both the Ludwigson and a generalized Voce-Bergström relation adequately describe the tensile flow behavior in all conditions compared to the Hollomon relation. The Voce-Bergström parameters define the slope of - plots in the stage-III regime when the specimens show a classical linear decrease in hardening. Further analysis of work hardening behavior throws light on the effect of texture on the dislocation storage and dynamic recovery. An overall summary of the experimental results and the scopes for future studies have been presented at the end...|$|R
