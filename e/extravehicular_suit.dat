40|$|Astronauts are at {{risk for}} {{developing}} decompression sickness (DCS) while exposed to the hypobaric environment of the <b>extravehicular</b> <b>suit</b> in space, in terrestrial hypobaric chambers, and during ascent from neutral buoyancy training dives. There is increasing recognition that DCS risk is different between diving and altitude exposures, with many individual parameters and environmental factors implicated as risk factors for development of DCS in divers but are not recognized as risk factors in altitude exposures. Much of the literature to date has focused on patent foramen ovale (PFO), which has long been considered a major risk factor for DCS in diving exposures, but its link to serious DCS in altitude exposures remains unclear. Knowledge of those risk factors specific to hypobaric DCS may help identify susceptible individuals and aid in astronaut selection, crew assignment, and mission planning. This paper reviews the current literature pertaining to these risk factors, including PFO, anthropometric parameters, gender, menstrual cycle, lifetime diving experience, physical fitness, biochemical levels, complement activation, cigarette smoking, fluid balance, and ambient temperature. Further research to evaluate pertinent risk factors for DCS in altitude exposures is recommended...|$|E

30|$|Space {{radiation}} is primarily composed of energetic protons and electrons. Radiation doses from the protons are harmful for astronauts and aircrews, whereas the electrons predominantly affect artificial satellites. Energetic protons originate from {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs). The spectrum and intensity of GCRs, and hence their radiation doses, are almost constant over time scales of {{much less than the}} 11 -year solar cycle. On the other hand, SEPs occur sporadically and their intensity suddenly increases by multiple orders of magnitude within days. Such sudden increases in SEP intensity present a major radiation hazard to astronauts, adversely affecting the success of space missions (Hu et al. 2009). While low-energy SEPs cannot penetrate a spacecraft or <b>extravehicular</b> activity <b>suits,</b> high-energy SEPs, the energies of which exceed several tens of MeV, penetrate these materials (Kronenberg and Cucinotta 2012; Reames 2013). Therefore, predicting high-energy SEP events is the first priority in ensuring the safety of astronauts and the success of space missions.

Medication records from 24 crewmembers on 20 missions (greater than 30 days duration) were examined for trends in usage rates, efficacy, indication, {{as well as}} adverse event qualities, frequencies and severities. No controls were possible in this observational, retrospective analysis of available data; comparisons are made to similar studies of individuals on shortduration spaceflights and submarine deployments. The most frequently used medications were for sleep problems, pain, congestion or allergy. Medication use during spaceflight missions was similar to what is seen in adult ambulatory medicine; one notable exception is that usage of sleep aids was about 10 times higher in spaceflight. There were also two apparent treatment failures in cases of skin rash, raising questions about the efficacy or suitability of the treatments used. Many spaceflight-related medication uses were linked to extravehicular-activities and operationally-driven schedule changes. The data suggest that sleep and skin rash merit additional study prior to longer space exploration missions.

40|$|Extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) {{is crucial}} to the success of both current and future space operations. As space operations have evolved in complexity so has the demand placed on the EVA crewman. In addition, some NASA requirements for human capabilities at remote or hazardous sites were identified. One of the keys to performing useful EVA tasks is the ability to manipulate objects accurately, quickly and without early or excessive fatigue. The current suit employs a glove which enables the crewman to perform grasping tasks, use tools, turn switches, and perform other tasks for short periods of time. However, the glove's bulk and resistance to motion ultimately causes fatigue. Due to this limitation it may not be possible to meet the productivity requirements that will be placed on the EVA crewman of the future with the current or developmental Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) hardware. In addition, this hardware will not meet the requirements for remote or hazardous operations.

Similarly, improved fuel cell and electrolyzer systems can reduce mass and increase the reliability of electrical power, oxygen, and water generation for crewed vehicles, depots and outposts. To achieve this, NASA {{is developing}} non-flow-through proton-exchange-membrane fuel cell stacks, and electrolyzers coupled with low permeability membranes for high pressure operation.

Typically, PEM fuel cells operate at temperatures up to 80 C.

The most widely used membranes in PEM fuel cells are Nafion 112 and Nafion 117 [...] sulfonated perfluorinated polyethers that were developed by DuPont. In addition to their relatively high cost, the properties of these membranes limit their use in a PEM fuel cell to around 80 C. The proton conductivity of Nafion membranes significantly decreases above 80 C because the membrane dehydrates. The useful operating range of Nafion-based PEM fuel cells can be extended to over 100 C if ancillary equipment, such as compressors and humidifiers, is added to maintain moisture levels within the membrane.

There are two obstacles to overcome when using titanium for a bearing race: 1) titanium is flammable when exposed to the oxygen wetted environment inside the space suit and 2) titanium's poor wear properties are often challenging to overcome in tribology applications. In order to evaluate the ignitability of a titanium space suit bearing, a series of tests were conducted at White Sands Test Facility that introduced the bearings to an extreme test profile, with multiple failures imbedded into the test bearings.

40|$|Space {{toxicology}} greatly matured as {{a result}} of research and operations associated with the Shuttle. Materials offgassing had been a manageable concern since the Apollo days, but we learned to pay careful attention to compounds that could escape containment, to combustion events, to toxic propellants, to overuse of utility compounds, and to microbial and human metabolites. We also learned that flying real-time hardware to monitor air pollutants was a pathway with unanticipated speed bumps. Each new orbiter was tested for any excess offgassing products that could pollute the air during flight. In the late 1990 s toxicologists and safety experts developed a 5 -level toxicity rating system to guide containment of toxic compounds. This system is now in use aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Several combustion events during Shuttle Mir and also during Shuttle free-flight impelled toxicologists to identify hardware capable of monitoring toxic products; however, rapid adaptation of the hardware for the unique conditions of spaceflight caused unexpected missteps. Current and planned combustion analyzers would be useful to commercial partners that wish to manage the risk of health effects from thermal events. Propellants received special attention during the Shuttle program because of the possibility of bringing them into the habitable volume on <b>extravehicular</b> activity <b>suits.</b> Monitors for the airlocks were developed to mitigate this risk. Utility materials, such as lubricants, posed limited toxicological problems because water was not recovered. One clearly documented case of microbial metabolites polluting the Shuttle atmosphere was noted, and this has implications for commercial flights and control of microbes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{performing}} unsuited testing {{as part of}} a reduced gravity <b>extravehicular</b> (EVA) <b>suited</b> human performance research program is to define baseline performance. These results are then coupled with suited test results to evaluate how the suit system affects human performance at reduced gravity. The primary drawback to this approach is that previous studies used notably different systems to interface suited and unsuited subjects to overhead-suspension, partial-gravity simulators. A spreader bar (SB) assembly previously used for unsuited tests allowed limited pitch and roll of the subject, whereas the gimbal for suited tests allowed more pitch and roll, although the mass distribution led to large moments of inertia in the yaw axis. It is hypothesized that use of the same methods for offload of both unsuited and suited subjects is needed to make meaningful comparisons. A new gimbal (GIM) was designed with the idea that it could function with both suited and unsuited subjects. GIM was designed to minimize mass and moments of inertia and to be adjustable to co-locate the 3 axes of rotation with the subject s center of gravity. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate human performance differences between SB and GIM. METHODS: Ten unsuited subjects were offloaded to 1 / 6 -g using both interfaces. Subjects completed tasks including overground and treadmill ambulation, picking up objects, shoveling, postural stability, range of motion testing, and recovery from the kneeling and prone positions. Metabolic, biomechanical, and/or subjective data were collected based on task. RESULTS: Initial analyses suggest that subjects completed all tasks with lower levels of compensation and a more terrestrial approach to movement when suspended via GIM. With SB, subjects were not able to fall or get into a prone position and had increased difficulty both retrieving objects off the floor and with overground ambulation, especially at gait initiation, because they were unable to bend their torso.

Non-porous dense monolithic membranes (DMM) that are available offer potential improvements for water {{vapor permeability}} with reduced gas leak. Accordingly, three different pressure bladder materials were investigated for water vapor permeability and oxygen leak: ElasthaneTM 80 A (thermoplastic polyether urethane) provided from stock polymer material and two custom thermoplastic polyether urethanes.

40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary <b>Extravehicular</b> Space <b>Suit</b> Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in the NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. To meet a more challenging set of requirements than previous suit systems standard design features, such as threaded inserts, have been re-analyzed and improved. NASA's Z- 2 prototype space suit contains several components fabricated from an advanced hybrid composite laminate consisting of IM 10 carbon fiber and fiber glass. One requirement NASA levied on the suit composites was the ability to have removable, replaceable helicoil inserts to which other suit components would be fastened. An approach utilizing bonded in inserts with helicoils inside of them was implemented. The design of the interface flanges of the composites allowed some of the inserts to be a "T" style insert that was installed through the entire thickness of the laminate. The flange portion of the insert provides a mechanical lock as a redundancy to the adhesive aiding in the pullout load that the insert can withstand. In some locations {{it was not possible to}} utilize at "T" style insert and a blind insert was used instead. These inserts rely completely on the bond strength of the adhesive to resist pullout. It was determined during the design of the suit that the inserts did not need to withstand loads induced from pressure cycling but instead tension induced from torqueing the screws to bolt on hardware which creates a much higher stress on them. Bolt tension is determined by dividing the torque on the screw by a k value multiplied by the thread diameter of the bolt. The k value is a factor that accounts for friction in the system. A common value used for k for a non-lubricated screw is 0. 2. The k value can go down by as much as 0. 1 if the screw is lubricated which means for the same torque, a much larger tension could be placed on the bolt and insert. This paper summarizes testing that was performed to determine a k value for helicoil inserts in the Z 2 suit and how the insert design was modified to resist a higher pull out tension...|$|R
40|$|NASA s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) {{contains}} a 6. 2 million gallon, 12 -meter deep pool where astronauts prepare for space missions involving space walks (extravehicular activity EVA). Training is {{conducted in a}} space <b>suit</b> (<b>extravehicular</b> mobility unit EMU) pressurized to 4. 0 - 4. 3 PSI for up to 6. 5 hours while breathing a 46 % NITROX mix. Since the facility opened in 1997, over 30, 000 hours of suited training has been completed with no occurrence of decompression sickness (DCS) or oxygen toxicity. This study examines the last 5 years of astronaut suited training runs. All suited runs are computer monitored and data is recorded in the Environmental Control System (ECS) database. Astronaut training runs from 2004 - 2008 were reviewed and specific data including total run time, maximum depth and average depth were analyzed. One hundred twenty seven astronauts and cosmonauts completed 2, 231 training runs totaling 12, 880 exposure hours. Data was available for 96 % of the runs. It was revealed that the suit configuration produces a maximum equivalent air depth of 7 meters, essentially eliminating the risk of DCS. Based on average run depth and time, approximately 17 % of the training runs exceeded the NOAA oxygen maximum single exposure limits, with no resulting oxygen toxicity. The NBL suited training protocols are safe and time tested. Consideration {{should be given to}} reevaluate the NOAA oxygen exposure limits for PO 2 levels at or below 1 ATA...|$|R
