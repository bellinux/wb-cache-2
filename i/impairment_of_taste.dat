30|$|Importantly, {{symptoms}} {{from the}} tumour (such as pain and difficulty swallowing) and its treatments often result in significant physical <b>impairment</b> (e.g. loss <b>of</b> <b>taste),</b> functional <b>impairment</b> (e.g. difficulty breathing, {{as well as}} voice, speech and hearing impairment), and psychosocial problems (e.g. depression, social isolation, and delays returning to work); {{all of which can}} {{have a negative impact on}} all aspects of patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [2, 6 – 8]. Thus, assessing symptoms, changes in physical, functional, and socio-psychosocial impairment, as well as in overall HRQoL, particularly within clinical trials, is necessary not only to evaluate the impact of the disease and its treatments on patients’ lives, but also to make informed decisions on clinical care and rehabilitative services for patients [7 – 9].|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: An altered taste {{perception}} {{has been}} found in some patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Direct damage <b>of</b> the <b>taste</b> buds by refluxate has been mentioned as causal mechanism. Our aim is to study the taste perception in GERD patients in the absence of ear-nose-throat diseases. AIMS & METHODS: Thirty-two clinically and instrumentally diagnosed GERD patients (24 males and 8 females, age range 25 − 69 years) and twenty gender and age matched healthy subjects (HS) were studied. All subjects underwent a standardized taste-testing to evaluate the ability of each subject to identify sweet, bitter, salty, umami and sour taste. The following substances served as specific taste agonists: acesulfame K (30 mM), quinine(10 mM), NaCl (120 mM), monopotassium glutamate+ inosine monophosphate, (30 + 0. 5 mM), and citric acid (50 mM), respectively. In addition each subject was asked to score the intensity <b>of</b> each <b>taste</b> by using a 100 mm line-visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The percentage <b>of</b> overall <b>taste</b> misperception was significantly higher in GERD than in HS (22 % vs 13, respectively, p = 0. 004). In the subset of GERD, but not in HS, a gender difference in the ability to correctly identify the taste (M 74 % vs. F 87, p = 0. 012) was also found. GERD patients compared to HS, reported a significant higher perception for acid (71 ± 22 vs 58 ± 22 mm, p = 0. 004) and lower perception for salty (53 ± 19 vs 66 ± 20, p = 0. 001) respectively. CONCLUSION: GERD patients showed a significant degree <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> misperception. The ability of GERD patients to score acidity more than healthy subjects may suggest a possible sensitization <b>of</b> sour <b>taste</b> receptors. A similar mechanism in esophagus could be supposed to participate to symptoms generation in these patients.

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION Leprosy {{often results}} in sensory and {{physical}} limitations. This study aimed to evaluate these limitations using a quantitative approach in leprosy patients in Belém (Pará, Brazil). METHODS This epidemiological, cross-sectional study measured the sensory <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> smell and <b>taste</b> {{through the use of}} a questionnaire and evaluated activity limitations of daily life imposed by leprosy through the Screening of Activity Limitation and Safety Awareness (SALSA) Scale. Data were collected from 84 patients and associations between the degree of disability and clinical and epidemiological characteristics were assessed. RESULTS The majority of patients were men (64. 3 %), married (52. 4 %), age 31 - 40 years old (26. 2 %), had primary education (50 %), and were independent laborers (36. 9 %). The multibacillary operational classification (81 %), borderline clinical form (57. 1 %), and 0 degrees of physical disability (41. 7 %) were predominant. SALSA scores ranged from 17 to 59 points, and being without limitations was predominant (53. 6 %). The risk awareness score ranged from 0 to 8, with a score of 0 (no awareness of risk) being the most common (56 %). Evaluation <b>of</b> smell and <b>taste</b> sensory sensitivities revealed that 70. 2 % did not experience these sensory changes. Patients with leprosy reactions were 7 times more likely to develop activity limitations, and those who had physical disabilities were approximately four times more likely to develop a clinical picture of activity limitations. CONCLUSIONS Most patients showed no sensory changes, but patients with leprosy reactions were significantly more likely to develop activity limitations. Finally, further studies should be performed, assessing a higher number of patients to confirm the present results...|$|R

Zinc deficiency can cause;growth limitation, delay in sexuel maturity, behavior disorders and abnormalities of immune system,susceptibility to respiratory and gasterointestinal infections and <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell perception. Material and Method: One {{of the methods}} of assessment the zinc defeciency is “ Zinc taste test” using zinc sulfate solution 0. 1 %, this test performed {{used to assess the}} zinc deficiency among preshool childeren in Yazd. The results were evaluated with measurments of weight,height and demographic data. 400 preschool children were selected by multi stage random sampling. Having good taste perception of zinc sulfate 0. 1 % was used as impaired taste test (zinc deficiency) and having bad taste perception as normal zinc level. Results: Regarding to zinc taste test 73. 9 % of study group had zinc deficiency (77. 6 %femal, 69. 7 % male) There were no significant relation between zinc deficiency and measurment of weight and height,but there was higher prevalence of zinc deficiency in children who were below the 5 th percentile in height and weight by age. Conclusion: 70 % of preschool children in yazd had zinc deficiency assessed by “ zinc taste test”, 31 % of adolecents in Tehran have had zinc deficiency based on plasma, erythrocyte and hairindex. There is no significant relation between zinc deficiency and antropometric and demographic data, in this study and the study that had been done on adolescents in Tehran. Considering the prevalnce of zinc deficiency with “ Zinc taste test”;it seems more accurate studies need to be done like zinc measurment in WBC,RBC and Platelets and zinc taste test at the same time,if correlation coefficients between zinc taste test and other tests were very strong, we can used zinc tase test in the different age for assessment of zinc body...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of high-quality foods requires the precise control of factors influencing their quality. The {{aim of this}} doctoral thesis was to monitor the influence of sterilization heating and storage time and temperature on selected parameters of model food matrix using suitable physical, chemical and sensory methods. Sterilized processed cheese {{was chosen as the}} model matrix. Processed cheeses are milk protein concentrates, produced by melting of mixture of natural cheeses, emulsifying salts, water and other dairy and/or non dairy ingredients. Desirable transformation of this mixture to homogenous, smooth, shiny mass with desired textural, structural, rheologic and sensory properties is caused by using high temperature (about 80 - 100 °C) during melting. Sterilized processed cheese is subjected to additional sterilization heating (above 100 °C) after production, significantly elongating its durability. The processed cheeses (dry matter 40 % w/w, fat in dry matter 45 % w/w) were analyzed in this work, the part of them was sterilized (117 °C 20 min). Cheeses were stored at various temperatures (cold 6 ± 2 °C, laboratory 23 ± 2 °C and elevated 40 ± 2 °C), sterilized cheeses for 2 years, non sterilized for 1 year. During storage, the samples for physical (instrumental measuring of colour and texture), chemical (assessment of fatty acids and aroma compounds) and sensory (paired preference test, ranking test and evaluation using scale) analyses were taken at regular intervals. The influence of sterilization heating and for another the influence of storage conditions on mentioned parameters were investigated. Non sterilized processed cheese kept their very good quality during all the declared durability (4 months), however, then the significant worsening of most sensory properties was observed. In consequence of sterilization heating the changes of cheese colour and texture were observed, confirmed by both sensory and instrumental assessment. The <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and aroma was also found. These changes are obvious immediately after production and differences were observed during all the durability. In the case of sterilized processed cheese, the significant impairment of single sensory properties was determined, the highest in the case of texture, taste and aroma. The results of instrumental techniques confirm conclusions from sensory evaluation. The measurements of colour and texture vindicate the formation of darker colour (increasing total difference of colour delta E*) and higher hardness (increasing Fmax) of sterilized processed cheeses, continuing during storage. The worsening of taste and aroma is in accordance with lower content of aroma active compounds and selected fatty acids...|$|E

Background: Taste has {{an extreme}} {{importance}} on individual nutrition, health and quality-of-life status. Parkinson's disease (PD), {{one of the}} most frequent neurodegenerative disorders, is becoming a systemic disease with an increasing awareness to the importance of non-motor symptoms for early PD diagnosis and early intervention. Dysgeusia may be a non-motor symptom of PD, similar to olfaction, however its role in PD diagnosis have not been well established yet. Purpose: To determine whether taste function is impaired in patients with PD. Research strategy: A systematic review research was carried out on the 30 of November 2015, using PubMed, Cochrane Library, SciELO, Web of Science, Index of Portuguese Medical Journal (IndexRMP. pt) and National Guideline Clearinghouse (guideline. gov). The metaRegister of Controlled Clinical Trials and ClinicalTrials. gov were also searched. We utilized the following equation: (“taste” (MeSH) OR “taste*”) OR “dysgeusia” (MeSH) OR “taste disorders” (MeSH) AND (“Parkinson’s disease” (MeSH) OR “Parkinson*”). Selection criteria: We have selected original studies conducted with PD patients that investigated the symptoms, incidence, prevalence and severity of taste impairment. There was no restriction on the study design, and publication date or status, but on the PubMed database, we have activated filters concerning to species (humans), and language (English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese). Data Extraction: Independent extraction of articles by 2 authors in accordance with the pre-established selection criteria. A standardized template was filled including the following information: author, year, sample, diagnosis and severity of PD, cognition and therapeutic status, purpose, type of intervention, main results and study limits. Results: We have found 334 studies by using the keywords and above search criteria. After adjusting for duplicates 173 remained. Out of this total, 125 were excluded by the title, 26 by the abstract, and 11 after we read the full text. Thus, a total of 11 studies were selected and analyzed in this review. Conclusion: We have observed a lack of standardization on the measurement methods used to assess taste function in PD patients, with great heterogeneity in the participants samples, which reduces the effectiveness and reliability of the results. Even though, an <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> in PD has been described by the majority of the studies, but the clinical usefulness of taste testing seems to be limited at present, and, therefore, further research is encouraged...|$|E
