Under Kagame's presidency, {{trade between the}} two countries has grown rapidly. The volume of trade increased five-fold between 2005 and 2009, and it doubled again in the following three years, being worth US$160million in 2012. Projects completed include the renovation of the Kigali road network, funded using a Chinese <b>government</b> <b>loan</b> and undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation; the Kigali City Tower, which was built by China Civil Engineering Construction; and a pay television service operated by Star Media.|$|E

The Canadian <b>government</b> <b>loan</b> that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1985, one of {{the worst}} {{sporting}} disasters occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was engulfed by fire. The fire started 40minutes into the club's final game of the 1984–85 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986–87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the £2.6million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a £1.46million <b>Government</b> <b>loan</b> obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered {{for the first time and}} increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1–0 to Derby County.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the political influence on government bank lending decisions using the prefecture level panel data on Japan’s <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> from 1975 to 1992. I find that prefectures that were represented by more influential {{members of the}} ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), tended to receive more <b>government</b> <b>loans.</b> I also find {{that the amount of}} <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> tended to increase in the prefectures where the LDP incumbents became electorally vulnerable. These relationships between <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> and political factors are robust even after controlling for extensive socio-economic factors, fixed prefecture effects, and fixed year effects. Moreover, differences-in-differences estimation reveals that the statistical association between loans and political factors exists only in <b>government</b> <b>loans,</b> not private loans, indicating that the results are not the artifacts of fluctuation in local loan demand. These results provide empirical support for the political view of government banks and for the popular claim that <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> have served the private interests of LDP members and their supporters in Japan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the political determinants of government banks' lending decisions using prefecture-level panel data on Japan's <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> from 1975 to 1992. It {{finds that the}} size of <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> is positively correlated with two political factors: (1) the electoral vulnerability of politicians who belong to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and (2) their seniority. These political effects are statistically robust to the inclusion of prefecture fixed effects, year fixed effects, and other socioeconomic factors and, more important, are present only in <b>government</b> <b>loans,</b> and not in private loans. These results suggest that self-interested LDP members (ab) used <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> for political purposes as implied by the "political view" of government banks.

25|$|Government {{approval}} came in December 1958, {{and construction}} of the first segment of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka started in April 1959.

Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.|$|E
25|$|On 23 February 2009, Northern Rock {{announced}} {{that they would be}} offering £14billion worth of new mortgages, over the next two years, as a part of their new business plan. This new lending was partly funded by an increase in the <b>government</b> <b>loan</b> and a reversal of previous strategy to pay the loan off as quickly as possible by actively encouraging mortgage customers to leave when their mortgage deal matured. The reason for this change was government policy to increase the availability of credit. This £14billion was to be split into £5billion in 2009 and £9billion in 2010.|$|E
25|$|American International Group {{received}} $180 {{billion in}} <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> during the financial crisis. The money {{was used to}} repay customers of its security-lending program and was paid as collateral to counterparties under credit insurance contracts purchased from AIG.

The New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced in March 2009 that he was investigating whether AIG's trading counterparties improperly received government money.

25|$|James Gardiner, {{president}} of the WACA for three terms between 1897 and 1924, proposed the adoption of 'electorate' cricket (as it was first known) whereby teams were established on a district basis for competition. He also inaugurated Country Week cricket, during which country teams compete against each other. In 1907, the WACA ground was under threat of being controlled by the Perth City Council to recover debts. Gardiner led the bid to save the ground and secured a <b>government</b> <b>loan.</b> Further financial difficulties led Gardiner to again raise funds and donations with a cricket match by the Australian XI team in 1912.|$|E
25|$|The design {{competition}} was won by GHM Addison, the Brisbane {{partner of the}} Melbourne-based firm Oakden, Addison and Kemp. In 1890 Addison amended his original design to a T-shape, incorporating a southern wing with a concert hall which could be rented out to offset repayments on the <b>government</b> <b>loan.</b> The new building was erected closer {{to the corner of}} Bowen Bridge Road and Gregory Terrace than the original building. The foundation stone was laid on 25 April 1891 and the builder, John Quinn, was required to have a section of the building completed for the August 1891 exhibition, with the whole of the building to be completed within 12 months.|$|E
25|$|The {{consolidation}} was {{a result}} of the Geddes Report, published in 1966, and the subsequent Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967 (sponsored by the Minister of Technology, then Anthony Wedgwood Benn) which recommended rationalisation and horizontal integration of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom into large regional groups, aided with grants from the state Shipbuilding Industry Board, in order to achieve economies of scale and better compete in the market for increasingly large merchant vessels like VLCCs. The creation of these groupings included Scott Lithgow on the Lower Clyde, Swan Hunter on Tyneside and Robb Caledon on the east coast of Scotland. The government had a 48.4% minority holding in the consortium and provided a £5.5m interest-free <b>government</b> <b>loan</b> over the first three years.

25|$|The new {{exhibition}} {{building was}} completed in 1892 and a public holiday was declared for 10 August 1982 to mark the official opening of the Exhibition. Despite the economic depression, 32,000 people attended on the holiday and more than 66,000 over the four-day course of the Exhibition. However, the National Association did not escape {{the effects of the}} 1890s depression, struggling to repay the <b>government</b> <b>loan</b> on the exhibition building. In 1897 the Queensland Government resumed the building and liquidated the Association's debts. The Exhibition Concert Hall continued to serve as a concert venue but the remainder of the Exhibition Building was refurbished for the Queensland Museum, which moved to the building from William Street in 1899 (now known as the Old Museum Building). At this time the museum grounds were resumed from the National Association's land as a separate reserve. The National Association struggled to maintain the viability of the remaining Exhibition Grounds until 1902–03, when the Queensland Government took control of the Association's assets, leasing the Exhibition Grounds back to the Association at an annual rental.|$|E

He joined the United Party and assisted in the 1948 election. However, as a result of the National Party victory, he was determined to become more active and was elected Chairman of the United Party branch at the university. He argued that the National Party's victory in 1948 was reversible and anyone who opposed them should concentrate on defeating them. In an interview in 1991, Schwarz said on the National Party victory that “To me, they were the people who had supported Germany during the war. As a young man, it was very objectionable to me that the very people I had been fighting against were the people that the National Party had supported.” He was also president of the university's ex-servicemen's league and chair of the Law Students Council. He stood as a candidate for treasurer of the Students Representative Council and refrained from voting for himself which he considered to be unethical. When the votes were counted, it was announced that Schwarz had lost by one vote.|$|E

40|$|International audienceI apply a {{survival}} model to a detailed dataset of Swedish patents {{to estimate how}} different financing factors affect the likelihood of patent renewal. Since the owners {{know more about the}} patents than potential external financiers, there is a problem of asymmetric information. To overcome this, Sweden has for a long time relied on government support rather than private venture capital. In the empirical analysis, two kinds of <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> are unbundled. The empirical results show that patents which have received soft <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> in the R&D-phase have a higher probability of expiring than patents without such financing. But patents that have received more market-oriented <b>government</b> <b>loans</b> during the commercialization phase are renewed for as long as other commercialized patents. This finding indicates that it is the contract terms rather than bad choices of projects that explain the low renewal of some patents with government financing...|$|R
