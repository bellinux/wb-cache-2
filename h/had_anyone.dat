5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On {{account of}} his mild and just reign, he {{has been called the}} Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty—despite his long reign, he never <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, who gave him the name 'John the Good'. He was also an {{energetic}} campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.|$|E
25|$|The late Stephen Jay Gould {{was one of}} Knight’s most {{well-known}} fans, notably refusing to refer to Brontosaurus as “Apatosaurus” because Knight had always referred to the creature with the former name. Gould writes in his 1989 book Wonderful Life, “Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day”.|$|E
500|$|Justice McHugh drew analogies {{between the}} {{legislation}} {{at issue in}} the case, and previous legislation which had authorised indefinite administrative detention, such as the arrangements under the War Precautions Act 1914. Regulations made under that and other acts allowed the internment of several thousand people, including German Australians during World War I and Japanese Australians during World War II. McHugh noted that those arrangements had been challenged, and upheld, in the High Court (for example in the 1915 case of Lloyd v Wallach), and emphasised that at no time <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> questioned that detention for protective purposes, as opposed to punitive purposes, would conflict with Chapter III. He concluded that although the situation at hand was [...] "tragic", the courts were {{not at liberty to}} question the propriety of decisions made by the Parliament of Australia on moral or human rights grounds, given the absence of a bill of rights in Australia.|$|E

500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by singer Plácido Domingo, Verstappen expressed delight about a [...] "great race", crediting his team with {{giving him a}} good car. Kimi Räikkönen said {{that while he was}} happy for Verstappen, he was disappointed not to have won. He blamed the lack of downforce while following as the reason why he had been unable to pass Verstappen. Vettel congratulated the winner as well, but lamented that his different strategy had not worked out in his favour. During the post-race press conference, Räikkönen stressed that <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> offered the team two podium positions after their poor performance in qualifying, they would have taken it [...] "happily". Fourth placed Ricciardo expressed bitterness over Red Bull's decision to switch him to a three-stop strategy, which eventually lost him a podium position, saying: [...] "I'm a bit devastated. A big part of me is happy the team are on winning form but it's hard to celebrate". His team later explained their decision, declaring that they had focused their strategy on Vettel, who they had considered the biggest threat.|$|E
500|$|The Task Force began {{night flight}} {{training}} using night vision goggles (NVG) to develop nighttime extraction capabilities; however, {{they were doing}} so with AN/PVS-5 NVGs which were originally developed for ground forces. Never before <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> in the U.S. Department of Defense flown in NVGs and the Task Force quickly adapted the NVGs for flying and by Brown's own words [...] "a warrant officer figured out we could cut them apart and mount them to our helmets and increase our efficiency and safety by a huge margin. So there we were, without authority, cutting up goggles and building our own NVGs." [...] Their nighttime training took place at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. As {{a result of the}} night vision goggle training Brown asserted in a 2011 interview that [...] "most of today's NVG tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as Black Hawk and Chinook modifications came directly from that mission." [...] Ultimately Operation Credible Sport did not come to fruition due to a peaceful resolution to the crisis where the hostages were released as a result of long negotiations.|$|E
500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it would give me, as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and {{told me that it was}} top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E

2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that.

2500|$|Tedder had {{expressed}} interest in collaborating with Adele after they met at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony in February. He arrived four hours early to their first studio session, buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work. In 2010, Tedder was featured on Far East Movement's 2010 hit single [...] "Rocketeer". Although unaware of Adele's personal predicament, he composed the opening piano sequence and first few lines to what became the lovelorn ballad [...] "Turning Tables". Adele and Tedder arranged a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later to write and record [...] "Rumour Has It". In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10 minutes: [...] "She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note.

2500|$|... is {{introduced}} as a charismatic student council president who quickly befriends Tsukune after the latter joins {{to work on}} the school festival. Prior {{to the start of the}} series, Hokuto is a human who has suffered years of physical abuse from his father. Hoping to escape, he enrolls in Yokai but only finds death; he admits he never <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> to protect him. His monster form is suppressed by a spirit lock similar to Tsukune's; when unleashed, he transforms into a giant insect-like skeletal creature with massive blades for appendages. In human form, his martial-arts ability allows him to strike with rock-shattering force. In the Anti-Schoolers storyline, he tricks the Newspaper Club into capturing him, only to steal the headmaster's rosary in order to shut down the barrier between the human and monster world. Following his defeat, when he sees that Tsukune and the girls make great efforts to restore the barrier, he helps them out. He reconciles with Tsukune, but summarily leaves the school with Anti-Schoolers colleague Kiria Yoshi. In the second serialization, a wheelchair-bound Hokuto joins Fairy Tale as the 1st Branch Staff Officer. After Moka is taken by Aqua, he and Kiria form a temporary alliance with Tsukune to rescue Moka by providing information on Fairy Tale's main headquarters, and background assistance against Fairy Tale's leader Gyokuro. In the final battle against Alucard, he overextends his strength and powers, and falls into a coma.|$|E
2500|$|Grandi followed, {{speaking}} for {{one and a}} half hours. He read out and explained his document, concluding his speech with Mussolini's citation of 1924 [...] "Let perish all the factions, so that the Nation can live". After Grandi spoke Farinacci, who explained that his criticism ran opposite to Grandi's: in fact, while Grandi contended that Mussolini had betrayed the constitution, the real victim of betrayal was Fascism. Farinacci continued saying that in order to win the war it was necessary to wipe out the democrats and liberals still nested in the Party, as well as the generals; to give back to the King the supreme command of the armed forces; to unify the war direction with the Germans; to strengthen the Party. At the end of his speech he read his proposed OdG, which summarized all these points. After some minor interventions spoke Bottai, the Fascist intellectual, who made a purely political speech, defending the OdG. Then came Ciano, who spoke boldly, summarizing the history of the alliance with the Germans, and declaring that the Italians were not the traitors, but the betrayed. At 23:30 Galbiati, the chief of the MVSN (the Fascist militia) winked at Scorza, who whispered something to Mussolini. The Duce announced that, due to the length of the meeting, some comrades had asked for a postponement to the next day. At this point, Grandi jumped from his chair crying that none could go out before they had voted on his OdG, and that it was shameful to go to sleep when Italian soldiers were dying for their fatherland. Mussolini stared at him, but unwillingly agreed. Never before in the 20-years long history of the assembly <b>had</b> <b>anyone</b> dared to ask for a vote: since fascism was strongly anti-parliamentary, in all previous meetings only discussions summarized by the Duce had taken place. At midnight the meeting was suspended for 10 minutes: while the others drank lemonade and coffee substitutes, Mussolini, who suffered from an ulcer, drank a cup of milk. In the meantime, Grandi collected the signatures to his OdG.|$|E
