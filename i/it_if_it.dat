5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank of the target value is known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after <b>it</b> (<b>if</b> <b>it</b> is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the target value is either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Americans {{were likely to}} build a Nicaragua Canal, {{the owners of the}} defunct French company, {{including}} Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who still had exclusive rights to the Panama route, lowered their price. Beginning in early 1902, President Roosevelt became a backer of the latter route, and Congress passed legislation for <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could be secured within a reasonable time. In June, Roosevelt told Hay to take personal charge of the negotiations with Colombia. Later that year, Hay began talks with Colombia's acting minister in Washington, Tomás Herrán. The Hay-Herrán Treaty, granting $10 million to Colombia for the right to build a canal, plus $250,000 annually, was signed on January 22, 1903, and ratified by the United States Senate two months later. In August, however, the treaty was rejected by the Colombian Senate.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

25|$|Absence of {{evidence}} {{is a condition}} in which no valid conclusion can be inferred from the mere absence of detection, normally due to doubt in the detection method. Evidence of absence is the successful variation: a conclusion that relies on specific knowledge in conjunction with negative detection to deduce the absence of something. An example {{of evidence}} of absence is checking your pockets for spare change and finding nothing, but being confident that the search would have found <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was there.|$|E
25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesn’t need awareness, but it does seem to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{executive}} officer of Danbury is the Mayor, who serves a two-year term. The current mayor is Mark D. Boughton (R). The Mayor is the presiding officer of the City Council, which consists of 21 members, two from each of the seven city wards, and seven at-large. The City Council enacts ordinances and resolutions by a simple majority vote. If after five days the Mayor does not approve the ordinance (similar to a veto), the City Council may re-vote on <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> then passes with a two-thirds majority, it becomes effective without the Mayor's approval.

25|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007, Whitman stated that Vice President Dick Cheney's insistence on easing air pollution controls, not the personal reasons she cited at the time, led to her resignation. At the time, Cheney pushed the EPA to institute a new rule allowing power plants to make major alterations without installing costly new pollution controls. Whitman stepped down in protest against such demand by the White House, she said. She decided that {{because she did not}} agree with the rule, she {{would not be able to}} defend <b>it</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were to be challenged in a legal action. The federal court eventually overturned the rule on the ground that it violated the Clean Air Act.|$|E
25|$|The lights can be candles or oil lamps.

Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term) or a menorah (the traditional name, simply Hebrew for 'lamp'). Many families use an oil lamp (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shamash light.|$|E

25|$|From {{the archaeological}} {{excavations}} in the 1970s, {{it is clear}} that construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure and that the Triportico and Rotunda roughly overlapped with the temple building itself; the excavations indicate that the temple extended at least {{as far back as the}} Aedicule, and the temple enclosure would have reached back slightly further. Virgilio Canio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall, of the temple itself, would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any tomb would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above <b>it)</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Nowak would not claim insanity if her case ever went to trial. Nowak's attorney withdrew a previous motion filed in 2007, which would have left open the opportunity to use an insanity defense in the case. On October 7, 2009, a judge in Orlando ruled in favor of allowing Nowak's attorneys to take a second deposition from Shipman to inquire whether Nowak actually pepper-sprayed Shipman. A medical report by paramedics raised some questions according to Nowak's attorneys as to the factual basis for <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> was found not to have occurred, Nowak's attorneys wanted the criminal charges related to the assault and battery to be dropped before trial begins. The trial was scheduled for December 7, 2009. On November 10, 2009, Nowak entered a guilty plea to lesser charges. She was sentenced to a year's probation and the two days already served in jail, with no additional jail time.|$|E
25|$|To {{defend a}} territory, the male {{exhibits}} perching behaviour {{starting in the}} mid- to late afternoon until dusk. Some individuals are able to reclaim the same territory several afternoons in a row. The longest period of time recorded in which one male defended the same territory was three days. The males choose sunny spots on hilltops, through which females are likely to travel. If no hilltops are available, the males wait in channels in the vegetation that would funnel wandering females towards them. The perching male sits and waits, scanning the sky for any moving object. Periodically, he executes a patrol flight {{to get a better}} picture of the surrounding area. When the male spots a moving flying object, he flies directly towards <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> is a male, the resident male chases him off his territory. If it is a female, the male chases the female, more slowly and less aggressively than with an intruding male, away from the perch site. The pair lands and copulates, which can last more than an hour.|$|E
50|$|That is, {{the only}} general {{way to know}} for sure if a given program will halt on a {{particular}} input in all cases is simply to run <b>it</b> and see <b>if</b> <b>it</b> halts. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> does halt, then you know <b>it</b> halts. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> doesn't halt, however, you may never know <b>if</b> <b>it</b> will eventually halt.
