50|$|Ground heat {{exchangers}} (GHEs), {{which are also}} called geothermal {{heat exchangers}}, have emerged as a promising and globally accepted way of exploiting shallow geothermal energy, for example ground-coupled heat pumps, ground heat storage. A GHE is essentially a pipe (e.g., U-, W-, or helical-shaped) in a vertical borehole or a foundation pile of a building, in which a circulating <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid</b> absorbs (or discharges) heat from (or to) the ground.GHEs can have various configurations. This article discusses two kinds of closed loop GHEs, i.e., borehole and foundation pile GHEs. The borehole type is the most common. It consists {{of one or two}} U-shaped pipes that are inserted into a vertical borehole and connected to a heat pump or a heating system to form a closed loop. A U-shaped channel usually comprises two small-diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes thermally fused to form a U-shaped bend at the bottom. The space between the wall of the borehole and the U-shaped tubes is usually grouted completely with grouting material or, in some cases, partially filled with groundwater. The depth of the hole (generally from 30 m to 200 m) depends strongly on local geological conditions and available drilling equipment.In a foundation pile GHE (or energy pile), the heat transfer tubes are inside the steel frame of a foundation pile. There are various possible shapes. Foundation piles are usually much shallower than boreholes and have a greater radius. Since energy piles generally require less land area, this technology is evoking increasing interest in the ground-source heat pumps community.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{the extraction}} of heat energy from hot off-gases (2) from productive or service processes and for {{the transfer of the}} energy to an external user device (3) is positioned in contact with the off-gases (2), at least partly inside a containing chamber (22) or one or more pipes of a plant performing the productive or service processes. The apparatus comprises at least two sections (4), each of which is defined by at least a heat exchange module (5) having a container/exchanger (6), located at least partly in contact with the off-gases (2), in order to exchange heat energy with them. A first phase change material (7) having high heat diffusivity is located inside the container/exchanger (6). An extraction exchanger (8), disposed in contact with the first phase change material (7), has delivery and return pipes (9) in which a <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid</b> (10) circulates, to extract and transfer the heat energy accumulated by the first phase change material (7). Furthermore, movement means (14, 15) move the <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid</b> (10) and convey and manage the flow rate of the latter to selectively determine, for each section (4), a variation in the values of the heat flow extracted from the off-gases (2) and exchanged with said first phase change material (7) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental results obtained for a three-Tiered finned tube bank {{with the aid}} of which a <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid</b> heats a wet air stream entraining a water spray. A study was made of the thermal behavior of the two-phase humid-air/water-spray stream flowing over the finned tube bank when the inlet temperature of the process fluid (water) is low and the difference between the inlet temperature of the two streams (air/water mist and process fluid flow) is very small. The results are given in terms of enthalpic efficiency for both mist flow and single air flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} oxygen affinity, {{aluminium}} alloys are difficult-to-sinter materials. Either mechanical destruction or {{the action of}} a liquid phase {{can be used to}} break oxide layers and thus achieve the desired diffusion bonds between the individual particles. In the present work, a liquid phase sintering approach is used in conjunction with high-purity particulates and controlled processing conditions in order to obtain high-purity, high-porosity (up to 90 %) parts with an exclusively open porosity. Appropriate sinter conditions were determined with the help of thermodynamic calculations using the PANDAT software package. Bonding of the sintered fibre structures to tubes, sheets and other massive structures may be achieved by co-sintering or brazing. The resulting metallic contacts allow for excellent heat transfer between the fibre structure and <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluids.</b> These advantageous properties may be exploited in applications such as adsorption cooling devices or very fast phase-change material (PCM) heat-storage devices. The present study reports on the manufacturing of such PCM-aluminium fibre compounds and their performance measured on a PCM storage demonstrator run in a laboratory environment...|$|R
40|$|General studies {{undertaken}} by the C. N. R. S. {{in the field of}} solar power plants have generated the problem of building energy production units in the medium range of electrical power, in the order of 100 kW. Among the possible solutions, the principle of the use of distributed heliothermal converters has been selected as being, with the current status of things, the most advantageous solution. This principle consists of obtaining the conversion of concentrated radiation into heat by using a series of heliothermal conversion modules scattered over the ground; the produced heat is collected by a <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid</b> circulating inside a thermal loop leading to a device for both regulation and storage...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{different}} high temperature TES components are numerically analyzed. The difference {{is defined by}} the different type of porous medium employed in the storage. Two different porous media are considered: spheres or foams. In all cases a ceramic material is considered. In the formulation of the model it is assumed that the system geometry is cylindrical, the fluid and the solid thermophysical properties are temperature independents, the radiation heat transfer mechanism is taken into account. The commercial CFD Fluent code is used to solve the governing equations in transient regime and in local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE). Numerical simulations are carried out at different mass flow rates of the <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid.</b> The results show the effects of the porosity and of the working fluid mass flow rate on the stored thermal energy and on the storage time...|$|E

30|$|Due {{to the low}} thermal {{diffusivity}} of aquifers relative to air, subsurface temperatures experience less fluctuation than surface air temperatures. Therefore, geothermal energy systems use aquifers as heat sources {{during the winter months}} and as heat sinks during the summer months. In principle, {{there are two types of}} geothermal energy systems: the ground source heat pump (GSHP) and the groundwater heat pump (GWHP). The GSHP is a closed system with a <b>heat-carrying</b> <b>fluid</b> circulating through a tube system installed underground. Heat is exchanged between the aquifer and the GSHP system, but the groundwater level remains unchanged. The GWHP is an open system, within which groundwater is extracted and sent through the heat pump installed at the ground surface. Heat is released or extracted depending on the season, and groundwater is re-injected within a short time period back into the aquifer (Haehnlein et al. 2010). Even though the cones of depression from groundwater withdrawal wells are likely to affect local-scale groundwater flow, the water budget does not change on a regional scale. However, the issue of changing the subsurface temperature around an injection well is crucial in some respects. Increasing the number of geothermal energy systems within a small area can affect the efficiency of the individual systems (Ferguson and Woodbury 2006). Moreover, effects of temperature changes on the groundwater ecosystems such as estuaries, wetlands and ponds can be critical (Brielmann et al. 2009; Bonte et al. 2011).|$|E
