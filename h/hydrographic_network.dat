40|$|Summary: This {{article focuses}} {{on the process of}} {{matching}} old <b>hydrographic</b> <b>networks</b> ex-tracted from Cassini maps. The inherent specificities of such data make conventional methods for matching networks inefficient. We propose a novel hierarchical approach to match <b>hydrographic</b> <b>networks,</b> by extracting natural structures called strokes. Each stroke is then classified according to its weight in terms of hydrographic structure within the graph. The hierarchical selection of candidates and the use of a multi-criteria decision making process (AHP) constitute a good strategy to match imperfect hydrographic net-works...|$|R

The Alps are a high mountain range {{running across the}} central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the Swiss Plateau. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of [...] From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The <b>hydrographic</b> <b>network</b> includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included Lake Geneva (also called le Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes, and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. The Rhône is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva. Lake Constance is the second largest Swiss lake and, like the Lake Geneva, an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border to Austria and Germany.

40|$|Abstract Background The genetic {{structure}} of the marble trout Salmo trutta marmoratus, an endemic salmonid of northern Italy and the Balkan peninsula, was explored at the macro- and micro-scale level {{using a combination of}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite data. Results Sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region showed the presence of nonindigenous haplotypes indicative of introgression from brown trout into marble trout. This was confirmed using microsatellite markers, which showed a higher introgression at nuclear level. Microsatellite loci revealed a strong genetic differentiation across the geographical range of marble trout, which suggests restricted gene flow both at the micro-geographic (within rivers) and macro-geographic (among river systems) scale. A pattern of Isolation-by-Distance was found, in which genetic samples were correlated with hydrographic distances. A general West-to-East partition of the microsatellite polymorphism was observed, which was supported by the geographic distribution of mitochondrial haplotypes. Conclusion While introgression at both mitochondrial and nuclear level is unlikely to result from natural migration and might be the consequence of current restocking practices, the pattern of genetic substructuring found at microsatellites has been likely shaped by historical colonization patterns determined by the geological evolution of the <b>hydrographic</b> <b>networks.</b> </p...|$|R

There has been a good amount of work already done as far as boundary detection and skeletonization is concerned, but this research work is different from the previous ones in the way that it uses the Delaunay graph and the Voronoi tessellation to extract boundary and skeletons that are guaranteed to be topologically equivalent to the segmented objects.

40|$|In this study, 169 stream lily (Helmholtzia glaberrima) {{seedlings}} {{from six}} micro-drainages were genotyped with AFLP markers {{to quantify the}} impact that topographic landscape features and altitude may have in shaping patterns of genetic diversity within individual populations. A global analysis of genetic diversity detected significant genetic differentiation among micro-drainages (FST = 0. 22, P < 0. 01). The observed genetic structure of sampled sites conformed to a hierarchical model of gene flow. Assignment tests also supported a hierarchical model of gene flow as only one dispersal event among the sampled micro-drainages was detected. This suggests that opportunities for seed dispersal in H. glaberrima are highly constrained by patterns of <b>hydrographic</b> <b>networks</b> even at a local scale. In contrast, altitude had little impact on partitioning of genetic diversity as no increase in genetic diversity was evident among individuals in the upper (0. 18 ± 0. 02), and lower (0. 17 ± 0. 02) areas of micro-drainages.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of both spatial and genetic connectivity is paramount {{to the long-term}} persistence of small, isolated populations living in environments with extreme climates. We aim to identify the distribution of genetic diversity and assess population sub-structuring and dispersal across dwarfed desert populations of Crocodylus suchus, which occur in isolated groups, usually less than five individuals, along the mountains of Mauritania (West Africa). We used both invasive and non-invasive sampling methods and a combination of mitochondrial DNA (12 S and ND 4) and microsatellite markers (32 loci and a subset of 12 loci). Our results showed high genetic differentiation and geographic structure in Mauritanian populations of C. suchus. We identified a metapopulation system acting within four river sub-basins (high gene flow and absence of genetic structure) and considerable genetic differentiation between sub-basins (FST range: 0. 12 – 0. 24) with rare dispersal events. Effective population sizes tend to be low within sub-basins while genetic diversity is maintained.

30|$|The post-caldera central cones are {{characterized}} by high velocities from the surface {{to a depth of}} 1  km. In the center of the post-caldera central cones, approximately at Kusasenrigahama, low velocities prevail at the surface and extend to major anomalies at depths of 1 – 2.5  km. These low-velocity anomalies can be assumed to be shallow hydrothermal reservoirs that might be related to surface geothermal activity; it is possible that these reservoirs are replenished by precipitation and <b>hydrographic</b> <b>networks</b> within the caldera or through pathways connecting it to deeper earth. The prevalence of high velocities below 3  km can be considered to correspond to consolidated igneous rock. However, the low velocities identified at depths of 5 – 6  km beneath the post-caldera central cones might indicate the tops of magma chambers. The low-velocity belts situated at 2.5 – 5  km depths are likely pathways for the transfer of hydrothermal fluids, volcanic gases, or melting magma to the surface. The northern part of the caldera exhibits substantial lateral velocity variations, that is, low velocity predominates in the east and high velocity predominates in the west. Additionally, low Vs anomalies are identified adjacent to the western and northwestern surface of Aso caldera.|$|R
40|$|Loss and {{degradation}} of wetlands {{is now one}} of the most important environmental issues on a global scale. Previous research based on analyses of cartographic materials allow for quantification of changes in wetland area in recent centuries. The results of lithological research of peat cores, reported in this publication, have established that the processes of anthropogenic loss of wetlands can be much older and in the Kłodnica valley were initiated in the first millennium BC. As a result of increased mineral sedimentation accompanying soil erosion some peatlands have been fossilized whilst the area of others has been reduced. In total, the surface area of peat-forming wetlands in the bottom of the Kłodnica valley decreased by over 60 % between the time of the Lusatian Culture settlement and the Middle Ages. Post-peatland habitats are recently used for agricultural or colonized by non-peat forming vegetation. These processes have played a more important role in the degradation of peatland ecosystems than the direct human impact in historic times. Changes in <b>hydrographic</b> <b>networks,</b> land drainage and regulation of water levels in rivers and canals in the last century have contributed to further reducing the wetland areas by almost 50 % compared to the 1880 s.
