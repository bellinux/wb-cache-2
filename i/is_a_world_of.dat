500|$|Although Hazlitt {{had seen}} As You Like It on stage, he remembered it most fondly from having read it so {{frequently}} that he practically had it memorised. In Characters of Shakespear's Plays, {{he makes no}} mention at all of any stage performances, treating the play as one primarily meant to be read. What strikes him as most notable about it is its character of a [...] "pastoral drama", one that presents an [...] "ideal" [...] world—that <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> thought and imagination, not action. And {{though it is a}} comedy, its interest derives not so much from in our being made to laugh at any particular human follies, but rather, [...] "more out of the sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations. It is not what is done, but what is said, that claims our attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but {{not included in the}} theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E

2500|$|Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 {{soon after}} the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The {{highlights}} are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, [...] "What then is central to {{what you want to}} say about race?" [...] Butler's response was, [...] "Do I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" [...] This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.|$|E

2500|$|Adam Serwer of The Atlantic {{regarded}} A Song of Ice and Fire as [...] "more a {{story of}} politics than one of heroism, a story about humanity wrestling with its baser obsessions than fulfilling its glorious potential" [...] where the emergent power struggle stems from the feudal system's repression and not from the fight {{between good and evil}} (see section Moral ambiguity). Damien G. Walter saw Martin's strength in [...] "his compendious understanding of the human stories driving the grand political narrative. There {{does not seem to be}} a single living soul in the land of Westeros that Martin does not have insight into, from the highest king to the lowest petty thief. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> high stakes, where the winners prosper and the losers are mercilessly ground under heel. Against this tapestry every one of Martin's characters is forced to choose between their love for those close to them and the greater interests of honour, duty and the realm. More often than not, those who make the noble choice pay with their lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{world where}} there are no nouns — or where nouns are {{composites}} of other parts of speech, created and discarded according to a whim — and no things, most of Western philosophy becomes impossible. Without nouns about which to state propositions, there can be no a priori deductive reasoning from first principles. Without history, there can be no teleology (showing a divine purpose playing itself out in the world). If there can be no such thing as observing the same object at different times, there is no possibility of a posteriori inductive reasoning (generalizing from experience). Ontology — the philosophy {{of what it means to}} be — is an alien concept. Tlön <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> Berkeleyan idealism with one critical omission: it lacks the omnipresent, perceiving deity on whom Berkeley relied as a point of view demanding an internally consistent world. This infinitely mutable world is tempting to a playful intellect, and its [...] "transparent tigers and ... towers of blood" [...] appeal to baser minds, but a Tlönic world view requires denying most of what would normally be considered common sense reality.|$|E
2500|$|After media {{outrage at}} the 1976 Look Out for Lefty strip about {{football}} hooliganism in the IPC comic Action, Gifford controversially drew parallels with the Wertham censorship of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that [...] "Perhaps its time we had another outcry against products like Action. Action is {{a new kind of}} comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, stuff like this provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce Action are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply." [...] Despite 2000 AD (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed stortelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: [...] "Whether children would actually enjoy living in ... is another matter, for as depicted... the future <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> unrelieved violence." [...] Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that [...] "I look {{back to the days of}} my youth... when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts." ...|$|E
