50|$|To {{differentiate}} Soft Foot from Misalignment and Looseness, even if {{it causes}} Misalignment when present, {{one way is to}} loosen each <b>foot</b> <b>bolt</b> at a time, while the other three are tight. If loosening one of them reduces vibration amplitude (which would be opposite to what one would expect if the machine was OK and we caused looseness by unscrewing of the bolt), then Soft Foot was present.Another way to differentiate Soft Foot from Looseness are Phase Measurements between the machine foot and the base/ground. 180 degrees difference indicates ness.|$|E
40|$|Prosthetic {{assemblies}} {{for lower}} limb amputees are highly engineered and consist of several components {{each with its}} own failure mechanism. This paper describes the dynamic testing of HDPE rotational moulded sockets in a specially designed machine which mimics normal gait. Thus the components are subjected to all main loadings occurring during a stride such as axial loading and A-P bending about the knee and ankle. Machine details {{as well as the other}} components of the system are described. SACH feet appear to be vulnerable by rapid wear and structural component failures at less than 100, 000 cycles were observed. The sockets are much less vulnerable and stand up to simulated loading of 1350 N for approximately 400, 000 cycles. Metal components such as the <b>foot</b> <b>bolt</b> may also fail in fatigue if not properly tightened. References to proposed ISO standards are also included...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Harrison {{himself was}} sitting on his vineshaded veranda, in his shirt sleeves, enjoying his evening pipe. When he {{realized}} who was coming up the path he sprang suddenly to his <b>feet,</b> <b>bolted</b> into the house, and shut the door. This was merely the uncomfortable result of his surprise, mingled with {{a good deal of}} shame over his outburst of temper the day before. But it nearly swept the remnant of her courage from Anne's heart.|$|R
40|$|Monolimb {{refers to}} a kind of trans-tibial {{prostheses}} with the socket and shank moulded into one piece of thermoplastic material. If properly designed, the shank of a monolimb can deflect which may compensate for the lost ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion to some extent. However, provision of shank flexibility is usually accompanied by reduced structural strength of the entire prosthesis. In our recent work using finite element analysis and the Taguchi method, the dimensions of the shank for the monolimb were derived which aimed at giving high shank flexibility and reasonable strength to resist static load. Yet, fatigue testing has not been performed. Fatigue failure may happen when a relatively low level of load is applied repeatedly. This study aimed to document the fatigue life of two flexible-shank monolimbs, by applying cyclic force of 800 N at the forefoot region for 500, 000 cycles. Results showed that the design of the <b>foot</b> <b>bolt</b> adaptor {{played an important role in}} the structural integrity of the monolimb. One monolimb completed the fatigue test of 500, 000 cycles without visual material yield, but with 3. 8 degrees change in dorsiflexion angle when the load was removed...|$|E

6000|$|Step, leap ... whack, step, leap.... Each leap {{seemed to}} last ages. With each, the cave opened {{out and the}} number of Selenites visible increased. At first they seemed all running about like ants in a {{disturbed}} ant-hill, one or two waving hatchets and coming to meet me, more running away, some bolting sideways into the avenue of carcasses, then presently others came in sight carrying spears, and then others. I saw a most extraordinary thing, all hands and <b>feet,</b> <b>bolting</b> for cover. The cavern grew darker farther up.|$|R
60|$|As Flannagan {{shot into}} their midst {{the men at}} the table leaped to their <b>feet</b> and <b>bolted</b> for the doorway; but the detective was up and after them so quickly that only two succeeded in getting out of the room. One of these generously slammed the door in the faces of his fellows, and there they pulled and hauled at each other until Flannagan was among them.|$|R
60|$|It {{was bitter}} to draw back; {{but it was}} madness to remain. Nigel looked round and saw that half his men were down. At the same moment Raoul sank with a gasp at his <b>feet,</b> a <b>bolt</b> driven to its socket through the links of the camail which guarded his neck. Some of the archers, seeing that certain death awaited them, were already running back {{to escape from the}} fatal passage.|$|R
60|$|Promptly on time Diana {{appeared}} with horse and buggy, her rosy face glowing above her raincoat. The good-byes {{had to be}} said then somehow. Mrs. Lynde came in from her quarters to give Anne a hearty embrace and warn her {{to be careful of}} her health, whatever she did. Marilla, brusque and tearless, pecked Anne's cheek and said she supposed they'd hear from her when she got settled. A casual observer might have concluded that Anne's going mattered very little to her--unless said observer had happened to get a good look in her eyes. Dora kissed Anne primly and squeezed out two decorous little tears; but Davy, who had been crying on the back porch step ever since they rose from the table, refused to say good-bye at all. When he saw Anne coming towards him he sprang to his <b>feet,</b> <b>bolted</b> up the back stairs, and hid in a clothes closet, out of which he would not come. His muffled howls were the last sounds Anne heard as she left Green Gables.|$|R

25|$|Supported by 12 cannons, Jacques Félix Jan de La Hamelinaye's brigade stormed Villeneuve and Grand-Maison at 3:30 pm. Gérard held Georges Joseph Dufour's brigade in reserve. As the Bavarian <b>foot</b> {{soldiers}} <b>bolted</b> {{from both}} positions, {{they were set}} upon by Bordesoulle's cavalrymen. When some Allied cavalry tried to rescue the Bavarians, the French horsemen rode into them and chased them away. Next, the Iller Mobile Legion tried to intervene, only to be routed by the French recruits. Altogether, Bordesoulle's half-trained horsemen inflicted about 300 casualties on their foes. They apparently took no prisoners except a wounded Austrian officer who Bordesoulle had to personally save.|$|R
40|$|A failed SACH foot adapter and an unused {{socket adapter}} were {{forwarded}} to the laboratory for analysis. Examination {{revealed that the}} SACH <b>foot</b> adapter <b>bolt</b> had failed in the threaded region by fatigue. The failure on the flange region was by overload. No metallurgical abnormalities were observed at the fatigue crack origins. The fatigue appears to be stress related. It appears most probable that the assembly stresses caused due to improper tightening and/or fixing of the adapter led to fatigue crack initiation. Semi-quantitative chemical analysis of the socket adapter by EDX revealed that the material of the adapter corresponds to stainless steel of specification CA- 6 NM...|$|R

60|$|One precaution, and one only, did Zack observe while {{enjoying the}} {{dangerous}} diversions into which paternal prohibitions, assisted by filial perversity, now thrust him headlong, He {{took care to}} keep sober enough {{to be sure of}} getting home before the servants had risen, and to be certain of preserving his steadiness of hand and stealthiness of <b>foot,</b> while <b>bolting</b> the door and stealing up stairs {{for an hour or two}} of bed. Knowledge of his own perilous weakness of brain, as a drinker, rendered him thus uncharacteristically temperate and self-restrained, so far as indulgence in strong liquor was concerned. His first glass of grog comforted him; his second agreeably excited him; his third (as he knew by former experience) reached his weak point on a sudden, and robbed him treacherously of his sobriety.|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} waned into twilight, and Hare {{sought the}} quiet shadows under the wall {{near the river}} trail. He meant to stay there until August Naab had pronounced his son and Mescal man and wife. The dull roar of the rapids borne on a faint puff of westerly breeze was lulled into a soothing murmur. A radiant white star peeped over the black rim of the wall. The solitude and silence were speaking to Hare's heart, easing his pain, when a soft patter of moccasined <b>feet</b> brought him <b>bolt</b> upright.|$|R
60|$|And {{there he}} saw {{the last of the}} Gairfowl, {{standing}} up on the Allalonestones all alone. And a very grand old lady she was, full three <b>feet</b> high, and <b>bolt</b> upright, like some old Highland chieftainess. She had on a black velvet gown, and a white pinner and apron, and a very high bridge to her nose (which is a sure mark of high breeding), and a large pair of white spectacles on it, which made her look rather odd: but it was the ancient fashion of her house.|$|R

60|$|The sun was setting; {{and they}} floated through waves as rosy as the rosy sky. A fresh wind filled the sail, and ruffled Gulliver's white breast {{as he sat}} on the mast-head crooning a cheery song to himself. Dan held the tiller, and Davy lay at his <b>feet,</b> with Nep <b>bolt</b> upright beside him; but the happiest face of all was Moppet's. Kneeling at the bow, she leaned forward, with her lips apart, her fuzzy hair blown back, and her eyes fixed on the island which was to be her home. Like a little black figure-head of Hope, she leaned and looked, as the boat flew on, bearing her away from the old life into the new.|$|R
60|$|The girls {{gave one}} last agonized glance. Yes, it was {{creeping}} {{down over the}} dyke, as no calf ever did or could creep. Reason fled before sudden, over-mastering panic. For the moment {{every one of the}} trio was firmly convinced that what they saw was Henry Warren's ghost. Carl sprang to his <b>feet</b> and <b>bolted</b> blindly. With a simultaneous shriek the girls followed him. Like mad creatures they tore up the hill, across the road and into the manse. They had left Aunt Martha sewing in the kitchen. She was not there. They rushed to the study. It was dark and tenantless. As with one impulse, they swung around and made for Ingleside--but not across Rainbow Valley. Down the hill and through the Glen street they flew on the wings of their wild terror, Carl in the lead, Una bringing up the rear. Nobody tried to stop them, though everybody who saw them wondered what fresh devilment those manse youngsters were up to now. But at the gate of Ingleside they ran into Rosemary West, who had just been in for a moment to return some borrowed books.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt very}} dreary here; poor, dear Delly--thou {{must have heard}} {{something}} of her story--a most sorrowful house, Pierre. Hark! that is her seldom-pausing pacing thou hearest from the floor above. So she keeps ever pacing, pacing, pacing; in her track, all thread-bare, Pierre, is her chamber-rug. Her father will not look upon her; her mother, she hath cursed her to her face. Out of yon chamber, Pierre, Delly hath not slept, for now four weeks and more; nor ever hath she once laid upon her bed; it was last made up five weeks ago; but paces, paces, paces, all through the night, till after twelve; and then sits vacant in her chair. Often I would go to her to comfort her; but she says, 'Nay, nay, nay,' to me through the door; says 'Nay, nay, nay,' and only nay to me, through the bolted door; bolted three weeks ago--when I by cunning arts stole her dead baby from her, and with these fingers, alone, by night, scooped out a hollow, and, seconding heaven's own charitable stroke, buried that sweet, wee symbol of her not unpardonable shame far from the ruthless <b>foot</b> of man--yes, <b>bolted</b> three weeks ago, not once unbolted since; her food I must thrust through the little window in her closet. Pierre, hardly these two handfuls has she eaten in a week." ...|$|R
