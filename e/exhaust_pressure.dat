5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure,</b> intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
2500|$|Exhaust steam is {{directed}} upwards {{out of the}} locomotive through the chimney, {{by way of a}} nozzle called a blastpipe, creating the familiar [...] "chuffing" [...] sound of the steam locomotive. The blastpipe is placed at a strategic point inside the smokebox that {{is at the same time}} traversed by the combustion gases drawn through the boiler and grate by the action of the steam blast. The combining of the two streams, steam and exhaust gases, is crucial to the efficiency of any steam locomotive, and the internal profiles of the chimney (or, strictly speaking, the ejector) require careful design and adjustment. This has been the object of intensive studies by a number of engineers (and often ignored by others, sometimes with catastrophic consequences). The fact that the draught depends on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> means that power delivery and power generation are automatically self-adjusting. Among other things, a balance has to be struck between obtaining sufficient draught for combustion whilst giving the exhaust gases and particles sufficient time to be consumed. In the past, a strong draught could lift the fire off the grate, or cause the ejection of unburnt particles of fuel, dirt and pollution for which steam locomotives had an unenviable reputation. Moreover, the pumping action of the exhaust has the counter-effect of exerting back pressure on the side of the piston receiving steam, thus slightly reducing cylinder power. Designing the exhaust ejector became a specific science, with engineers such as Chapelon, Giesl and Porta making large improvements in thermal efficiency and a significant reduction in maintenance time and pollution. A similar system was used by some early gasoline/kerosene tractor manufacturers (Advance-Rumely/Hart-Parr) – the exhaust gas volume was vented through a cooling tower, allowing the steam exhaust to draw more air past the radiator.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} wastegate is {{a built-in}} bypass valve and passage within the turbocharger housing which allows excess <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> {{to bypass the}} turbine into the downstream exhaust. Control of the internal wastegate valve by a pressure signal from the intake manifold is identical to that of an external wastegate. Advantages include simpler and more compact installation, with no external wastegate piping. Additionally, all waste exhaust gases are automatically routed back into the catalytic converter and exhaust system. Many OEM turbochargers are of this type. Disadvantages in comparison to an external wastegate include a limited ability to bleed off <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the relatively small diameter of the internal bypass valve, and less efficient performance under boost conditions.|$|E

50|$|Turbocharging {{allows for}} more {{efficient}} engine operation {{because it is}} driven by <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> {{that would otherwise be}} (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as turbo lag. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{control method}} has been {{developed}} that uses <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> measurements to regulate the turbine nozzle vane position on a turbocharged diesel engine with variable-geometry turbocharger during transient operation. Signicant reductions in <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressures</b> are achieved without degrading the turbocharger response and, overall, engine behaviour is improved through more rapid torque delivery, lower transient smoke and improved aircharge stability immediately after the transient...|$|R
25|$|Throttle lag {{occurs because}} turbochargers {{rely on the}} buildup of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>pressure</b> to drive the turbine. In {{variable}} output systems such as automobile engines, <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>pressure</b> at idle, low engine speeds, or low throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine. Only when the engine reaches sufficient speed does the turbine section start to spool up, or spin fast enough to produce intake pressure above atmospheric pressure.|$|R
50|$|Afterburners do produce {{markedly}} enhanced thrust {{as well as}} {{a visible}} flame {{at the back of the}} engine. This exhaust flame may show shock diamonds, which are caused by shock waves formed due to slight differences between ambient pressure and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure.</b> These imbalances cause oscillations in the exhaust jet diameter over distance and cause the visible banding where the pressure and temperature is highest.|$|E
50|$|For optimal {{performance}} {{the pressure}} of the gas {{at the end of the}} nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust's pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust's pressure is higher, then <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.|$|E
50|$|A surface {{condenser}} is a commonly used {{term for a}} water-cooled shell and tube heat exchanger installed on the exhaust steam from a steam turbine in thermal power stations. These condensers are heat exchangers which convert steam from its gaseous to its liquid state at a pressure below atmospheric pressure. Where cooling water is in short supply, an air-cooled condenser is often used. An air-cooled condenser is however, significantly more expensive and cannot achieve as low a steam turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> (and temperature) as a water-cooled {{surface condenser}}.|$|E
50|$|The power {{developed}} by an aircraft engine under any given external conditions can be computed approximately if the normal {{power at the}} given speed is multiplied by appropriate temperature and pressure correction factors. The temperature correction factor is given by an equation taken from NACA Report No. 45. When the intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressures</b> are equal, {{it is best to}} use an equation {{based on the work of}} NACA Report No. 46 for the pressure correction factor. For unequal intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressures,</b> the correction factor for a small range of values may be taken from a graph in Report No. 45. The temperature rise in the compressor, which has an important part in determining the power output of the engine, can be computed when the pressure ratio, the shaft efficiency, and the heat radiated per pound of air by the compressor and discharge pipe are known. For typical conditions, with the compressor exposed to the full force of the propeller slipstream, the computed value of the ratio of the actual temperature rise to the theoretical rise without heat radiation is 0.864.|$|R

40|$|Copyright c ○ 2004 SAE International Mean value {{cylinder}} {{air charge}} (CAC) estimation models for control and diagnosis are investigated on turbocharged SI-engines. Two topics are studied; Firstly CAC changes due to fuel enrichment and secondly CAC sensitivity to <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> changes. The {{objective is to}} find a CAC model suitable for control and diagnosis. Measurements show that CAC models based on volumetric efficiency gives up to 10 % error during fuel enrichment. The error is caused by the cooling effect that the fuel has as it evaporates and thus increases the charge density. To better describe the CAC during fuel enrichment a simple one parameter model is proposed which reduces the CAC estimation error on experimental data from 10 % to 3 %. With active wastegate control, the pressure changes in the exhaust manifold influences the CAC. The magnitude of this influence is investigated using sensitivity analysis on an <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> dependent CACmodel. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded, that the CAC is most sensitive to <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> changes for low intake manifold pressures (part load). Without taking the <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> into account the CAC error is approximately 5 % when the wastegate is opened at part load. The <b>exhaust</b> manifold <b>pressure</b> dependent CAC model is then augmented with the charge cooling model and the total model gives precise agreement on experimental data. The resulting model is thus highly suitable for CAC estimation for control and diagnosis of turbocharged SI-engines...|$|R
50|$|Exhaust brakes are simpler in {{operation}} than an engine brake. Essentially, the exhaust pipe {{of the vehicle}} is restricted by a valve. This raises the pressure in the exhaust system, forcing the engine to work harder on the exhaust stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from the exhaust pipe, retarding the vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict the flow of exhaust gas can also help in increasing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> {{to achieve the same}} objective.|$|E

50|$|An {{exhaust brake}} is {{a device that}} {{essentially}} creates a major restriction in the exhaust system, and creates substantial exhaust back pressure to retard engine speed and offer some supplemental braking. In most cases, an exhaust brake is so effective that it can slow a heavily loaded vehicle on a downgrade without ever applying the vehicle's service brakes. Exhaust brakes are manufactured by many companies. The brakes vary in design, but essentially operate as described above. More advanced exhaust brakes have <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> modulation (EPM) that controls the back pressure which in turn improves the braking performance {{across a range of}} engine speeds.|$|E

There {{is a certain amount}} of {{high-pressure}} gas available, and energy is extracted from it by making the gas move a piston [...] - [...] in this case, the projectile is the piston. The swept volume of the piston determines how much energy can be extracted from the given gas.

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} a {{supercharger}} driven by the engine itself, a turbocharger is driven using the otherwise wasted exhaust gas from the engine. The amount {{of power in the}} gas is proportional to the difference between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> and air pressure, and this difference increases with altitude, helping a turbocharged engine to compensate for changing altitude. This increases the height at which maximum power output of the engine is attained compared to supercharger boosting, and allows better fuel consumption at high altitude compared to an equivalently powered supercharged engine. This facilitates increased true airspeed at high altitude and gives a greater operational range than an equivalently boosted engine using a supercharger.|$|E
5000|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{the mean}} free path of air is about 70 nm. A turbomolecular pump can work only if those molecules hit by the moving blades reach the stationary blades before colliding with other molecules on their way. To achieve that, the gap between moving blades and stationary blades must be close to or less than the {{mean free path}}. From a practical construction standpoint, a feasible gap between the blade sets is {{on the order of}} 1 mm, so a turbopump will stall (no net pumping) if exhausted directly to the atmosphere. Since the mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, a turbopump will pump when the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> is less than about [...] where the mean free path is about 0.7 mm.|$|E

5000|$|Most piston valves {{are of the}} [...] "inside admission" [...] type, where fresh steam is {{introduced}} from the boiler via {{the space between the}} two piston heads of the valve, and exhaust steam leaves via the space between a piston head {{and the end of the}} steam chest. The advantage of this arrangement is that leakage, via the gland which seals the steam chest from the operating rod of the valve gear, is much less of a problem when the gland is subjected to low <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> rather than full boiler pressure. However, some locomotives, like Bulleid's SR Merchant Navy class, used [...] "outside admission" [...] where the reverse was true, in Bulleid's case because of the unusual chain-driven valve gear arrangement.|$|E
50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or {{molecular}} drag pump) {{as their}} last stage {{to increase the}} maximum backing pressure (<b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure)</b> to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a regenerative pump {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|E
50|$|At {{low engine}} speeds the wave {{pressure}} within the pipe network is low. A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, {{and to increase}} low-speed torque, large amplitude <b>exhaust</b> <b>pressure</b> waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal valve within the exhaust—the EXUP valve—at {{the point where the}} four primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an artificial atmosphere, hence the alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, thus inducing the formation of larger amplitude negative reflected expansion waves. This enhances low speed torque up to a speed at which the loss due to increased back pressure outweighs the EXUP tuning effect. At higher speeds the EXUP valve is fully opened and the exhaust is allowed to flow freely.|$|E
