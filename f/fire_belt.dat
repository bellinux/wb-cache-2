50|$|A typical SANDF {{mechanized}} company {{consists of}} 16 Ratels, with three four-vehicle rifle platoons and a two-vehicle command section. A battalion's support company consists of 3 Ratel 90s, 3 MILAN teams in APCs or Ratel-ZT3s, 6 Ratel 81 mm mortar vehicles and 3 Ystervark self-propelled 20 mm AA vehicles. Since SADF units frequently operated in ad hoc task forces during the South African Border War, unit structures and equipment varied widely. At {{the time of}} Operation Moduler in 1988, for example, the 61 Mechanised Infantry Battalion Group's task force consisted of two infantry companies with Ratel 20s, an armoured car squadron with fourteen Ratel 90s, a mortar platoon with twelve 81mm Ratels, an anti-tank company {{with a mix of}} ATGW and Ratel 90 vehicles, as well as other attachments. <b>Fire</b> <b>belt</b> actions were a formidable tactic, typically with the 20 mm cannon firing almost continuously during a specific advance onto target. They were also used as command vehicles given their large storage capacity. These vehicles were kitted out with an array of radio and other equipment as needed. During the latter stages of the civil unrest in South Africa, Ratels were often used for counter insurgency purposes in townships.|$|E

Most data was tallied every 10 -day to analyze seasonal and spatial fire occurrence. Seasonal and spatial analysis results for severe fire years, namely 2006 and 2009, under El Nino conditions were as follows: the severest fire incidents for whole Kalimantan occurred in October in 2006 under the dri est conditions in both Palangkaraya and Pontianak. The severest fires for the Mega Rice Project (MRP) area and its vi cinity occurred in late September in 2009 under the driest conditions for Palangkaraya. Fire activities in the last 10 -year in south Central Kalimantan were severe than other areas in Kalimantan. This may be explained by different dry condi tions of peat. Namely, the peat {{in the southern part of}} Central Kalimantan could become dryer under the relatively longer dry season (about 3 -month) compared with other areas (dry season in West Kalimantan is only 2 / 3 -month).

Water sprinkler systems are usually used to extinguish underground conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>fires,</b> {{but because of}} the complex interaction between conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>fires</b> and mine ventilation airflow, more effective engineering designs are needed for the installation of water sprinkler systems. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate the interaction between the ventilation airflow, the belt flame spread, and the water spray system in a mine entry.

30|$|Large forest {{areas are}} also lost every year due to {{uncontrolled}} fires. In {{most of the}} areas, natural forests have no <b>fire</b> <b>belts</b> to prevent <b>fires</b> and hence {{it is very difficult}} to fight this particular threat (Khan et al. 2014). Out of all types of forests available, sub-tropical broadleaved evergreen shrub forests and sub-tropical Pine forests are the most fire-prone ecosystems in Pakistan (Bukhari 1997; NIDM 2011). The “Himalayan Environmental Degradation” (Ali and Benjaminsen 2004; Hasan 2008) is caused by an increasing human population which has resulted in increased demands for natural resources, leading to severe resource depletion, especially deforestation. Hussain et al. (2012) found that the contribution of state forests in providing timber and fuelwood is just 14 % and 10 % respectively. Another problem affecting the forests of Pakistan is that forest officials are implementing old and obsolete management practices. No proper forest database is developed or maintained and much time is wasted in “useless management activities” (Wani 2002).|$|R

The Panel was charged with providing independent scientific and engineering review and recommendations with respect to the utilization of belt air and the composition and fire retardant properties of belt materials in underground coal mining. The TSP was impaneled by the Honorable Elaine L. Chao and commenced its work on January 9, 2007. At this first meeting, Mr. Richard E. Stickler, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, asked the Panel to report on many issues including how recent technological advances could be applied to atmospheric monitoring systems, point-type heat sensors, current state of fire-resistant vs. fireproof belt materials, and <b>belt</b> <b>fire</b> suppression systems to improve miner safety. In addition, Mr. Stickler asked the Panel to review belt air velocity limitations. The Panel members attended 12 days of public meetings over a nine-month period. Three of the public meetings were scheduled for the Panel to hear from technical experts and those persons or organizations interested in providing input. The meetings were held in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania with emphasis on <b>belt</b> <b>fires,</b> <b>belt</b> maintenance, belt flammability and toxicity, ventilation, and escape issues; in Salt Lake City with emphasis on ground control and convergence issues; and in Birmingham with emphasis on fire detection, sensors and atmospheric monitoring systems. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) personnel, representatives of the major belt conveyor manufacturers and a representative of the National Mining Association provided discussions at the Coraopolis meeting. In Salt Lake City, Utah, MSHA district managers and ventilation specialists, a member of the Aracoma Mine No. 1 investigation team, a representative of the Bureau of Land Management, and industry and consulting representatives of the Utah Mining Association and the Colorado Mining Association made presentations. In Birmingham, Alabama, atmospheric monitoring system representatives, NIOSH researchers, representatives of coal mining companies, and UMWA workers from two Alabama mining companies made presentations. In addition, a staff member of The Center for Regulatory Effectiveness also presented comments to the Panel.

40|$|During {{the last}} years the forest {{management}} community has acknowledged the need of monitoring the vegetated and forest areas as well as mapping burned areas. The hazard of a forest fire is encountered in the Mediterranean territory quite often, mainly due to its climate. Notwithstanding the catastrophic effects to the entire ecosystem, for decades these countries have not taken proper precautionary measures. Remote sensing faces this challenge and emerges a necessity, for the accurate detection {{and control of the}} areas with a high fire risk. In order to map a fire risk zone and prevent future possible fires, an attempt is made to set up a risk model. The model deals with remote sensing data in a GIS environment. The model parameters that trigger the fire spreading are estimated by satellite imagery and topographical data. The vegetation type, the relief and the location of man-made features, such as tanks for reserving water, roads and <b>fire</b> <b>belts</b> are some of the model input data. In this study the image analysis of low and high resolution satellite imagery results to an effective study of the area. Image processing methods such as band ratios and vegetation indices offer the potential of exploring vegetated and non-vegetated areas, by creating new bands where the burned and un burned territory is highlighted. These bands in combination with the initial multispectral bands are inserted in an object based classification scheme designed to estimate the fire extent. The study area covers the suburban forest of Seih Sou situated around the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Taking into account that only the 0. 9 % of the city is vegetated, this forest is considered the main source of oxygen for the city which greatly affects the microclimate of the territory. A significant part of the forest was destroyed by a fire in July 1997 causing severe ecosystem damage...|$|R
