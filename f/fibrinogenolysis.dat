40|$|Despite its {{affinity}} for fibrin, {{tissue plasminogen activator}} (t-PA) administration causes systemic <b>fibrinogenolysis.</b> To investigate the mechanism, t-PA was incubated with plasma in {{the presence or absence}} of a fibrin clot, and the extent of <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> was determined by measuring B beta 1 - 42. In the presence of fibrin, there is a 21 -fold increase in B beta 1 - 42 levels. The potentiation of <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> in the presence of fibrin is mediated by soluble fibrin degradation products because (a) the extent of t-PA induced <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> and clot lysis are directly related, (b) once clot lysis has been initiated, <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> continues even after the clot is removed, and (c) lysates of cross-linked fibrin clots potentiate t-PA-mediated <b>fibrinogenolysis.</b> Fibrin degradation products stimulate <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> by binding t-PA and plasminogen because approximately 70 % of the labeled material in the clot lysates binds to both t-PA- and plasminogen-Sepharose, and only the bound fractions have potentiating activity. The binding site for t-PA and plasminogen is on the E domain because characterization of the potentiating fragments using gel filtration followed by PAGE and immunoblotting indicates that the major species is (DD) E complex, whereas minor components include high-molecular weight derivatives containing the (DD) E complex and fragment E. In contrast, D-dimer is the predominant species found in the fractions that do not bind to the adsorbants, and it has no potentiating activity. Thus, soluble products of t-PA-induced lysis of cross-linked fibrin potentiate t-PA-mediated <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> by providing a surface for t-PA and plasminogen binding thereby promoting plasmin generation.

40|$|Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (t-PA) causes fibrinogen proteo-lysis when a 2 -antiplasmin levels fall, {{and this}} may contribute to t-PA-induced hemorrhage.

When added to human or rabbit plasma, a 2 -antiplasmin inhibits t-PA-induced <b>fibrinogenolysis,</b> but has little effect on the lysis of 1251 -fibrin clots. To examine its effect in vivo, rab-bits with preformed 125 I-labeled-jugular vein thrombi were ran-domized to receive t-PA, t-PA and a 2 -antiplasmin, or saline. a 2 -Antiplasmin infusion produced a modest decrease in t-PA-induced thrombolysis (from 40. 2 % to 30. 1 %, P = 0. 12), but reduced fibrinogen consumption from 87 % to 27 % (P = 0. 0001), and decreased blood loss from standardized ear in-cisions from 5, 594 to 656,ul (P < 0. 0001). We hypothesize that a 2 -antiplasmin limits t-PA-induced hemorrhage by inhibit-ing <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> and subsequent fragment X formation be-cause (a) SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis indicate less fragment X formation in a 2 -antiplasmin treated animals, and (b) when added to a solution of fibrinogen and plasminogen clotted with thrombin in the presence of t-PA, fragment X shortens the lysis time in a concentration-dependent fashion.

40|$|The fibrinolytic {{function}} of earthworm protease-III- 1 (Ef P-III- 1) {{has been studied}} in recent years. Here, we found that Ef P-III- 1 acted not only in <b>fibrinogenolysis,</b> but also in fibrogenesis. We have used Ef P-III- 1 to hydrolyze fibrinogen, and to activate plasminogen and prothrombin. Based on the N-terminal sequences of the hydrolytic fragments, Ef P-III- 1 was showed to specifically recognize the carboxylic sites of arginine and lysine. Analyses by <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> mapping and amino acid sequencing revealed that the isozyme could cleave the alpha, beta, and gamma chains of fibrinogen, showing a high α-fibrinogenase, moderate β-fibrinogenase, and low γ-fibrinogenase activities. Interestingly, Ef P-III- 1 activated plasminogen and released active plasmin, suggesting a tPA-like function. Furthermore, Ef P-III- 1 showed a factor Xa-like function on prothrombin, producing alpha-thrombin. The function in both activating prothrombin and catalyzing <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> suggests that Ef P-III- 1 {{may play a role}} in the balance between procoagulation and anticoagulation.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{disaggregation}} of human platelets by {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (t-PA). When added to a suspension of human platelets induced to aggregate in plasma with adenosine 5 '-diphosphate, t-PA promoted disaggregation of platelets over several minutes. Addition of fresh plasma or purified human fibrinogen to disaggregated platelets facilitated (reversible) aggregation and subsequent disaggregation. Aspirin treatment of platelets markedly potentiated the ability of t-PA to induce disaggregation. Disaggregation was inhibited by alpha- 2 -antiplasmin. Comparative analysis of the rate of proteolysis of platelet-bound fibrinogen with that of ambient plasma fibrinogen suggested that <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> of cohesive fibrinogen occurred more rapidly than <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> of ambient fibrinogen. These data demonstrate that t-PA facilitates platelet disaggregation in plasma through kinetically selective proteolysis of cohesive fibrinogen by plasmin, and suggest that thrombolytic mechanisms may serve both to remove platelets from platelet-fibrin thrombi and to disperse circulating platelet aggregates...|$|E

40|$|A biologically {{relevant}} relationship {{exists between}} neutrophils and coagulation processes. Several {{studies have focused}} on the ability of neutrophil proteases (both intracellular and membrane-associated) to degrade fibrinogen. The present study investigates the events following the interaction of activated neutrophils with soluble fibrinogen. During incubation of PMA-stimulated neutrophils with fibrinogen at 37 degrees C, <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> occurred, and degraded fibrinogen became associated with the neutrophil. Immunoelectron microscopy identified these fibrinogen products to be located within electron lucent vesicles, and not {{on the surface of the}} cell, suggesting that they are internalized. Although a specific interaction between fibrinogen and the neutrophil membrane might assist uptake, in the presence of physiological concentrations of fibrinogen, internalization occurred largely via a non-specific pinocytic process. Studies at low temperature revealed that both intact and degraded forms of fibrinogen can associate with neutrophils. The fibrinogen products detected intracellularly in experiments performed at 37 degrees C might represent uptake of degraded as well as intact forms of fibrinogen, the latter being rapidly degraded intracellularly. This route of <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> contributes minimally to the overall extent of the degradation process, the majority occurring extracellularly. Neutrophils thus possess a proteolytic mechanism for preventing accumulation of surface ligand, perhaps allowing them to evade the immunomodulatory effects of such ligands during inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Background. Plasmin {{has been}} {{reported}} both to activate platelets and to inhibit platelet functions. The latter effect {{was thought to be}} caused by proteolysis of the main membrane glycoproteins. Methods and Results. We found that incubation of citrated human platelet-rich plasma with streptoki-nase (SK) (300 IU/ml) does not produce any detectable activation but leads to a time-dependent inhibition ofADP-induced aggregation accompanied by substantial <b>fibrinogenolysis.</b> These effects were abrogated by previous addition of a plasmin inhibitor, aprotinin. Crossover experiments (SK-treated or control platelets mixed with SK-treated or control plasma) demonstrated that the platelets remained functional and that the aggregation defect was caused by <b>fibrinogenolysis.</b> Further experiments (addition of purified fibrinogen to fibrinogen-depleted plasma with either SK or thrombin) suggested that in addition to the low residual level of fibrinogen, fibrinogen degradation products had an inhibitory effect. Under the same conditions, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (3, 000 ng/ml) had no effect on platelet aggregation, and plasma fibrinogen was not significantly lowered. The effects on glycoproteins Ub-Illa of incubation with SK, t-PA, or plasmin were assessed with immunoblots with murine monoclonal antibodies directed against either part of the complex, which is the receptor for fibrinogen.

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmacological {{thrombolysis}} with streptokinase, urokinase or tissue activator of plasminogen (t-PA), {{and mechanical}} interventions are frequently {{used in the}} treatment of both arterial and venous thrombotic diseases. It has been previously reported that application of ultrasound as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy offers unique potential to improve effectiveness. However, little is known about effects of the ultrasound on proteins of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Here, we investigated the effects of the ultrasound on fibrinogen on processes of coagulation and <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> in an in vitro system. Results Our study demonstrated that low frequency high intensity pulse ultrasound (25. 1 kHz, 48. 4 W/cm 2, duty 50 %) induced denaturation of plasminogen and t-PA and fibrinogen aggregates formation in vitro. The aggregates were characterized by the loss of clotting ability and a greater rate of plasminolysis than native fibrinogen. We investigated the effect of the ultrasound on individual proteins. In case of plasminogen and t-PA, ultrasound led to a decrease of the <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> rate, while it increased the <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> rate in case of fibrinogen. It has been shown that upon ultrasound treatment of mixture fibrinogen or fibrin with plasminogen, t-PA, or both, the rate of proteolytic digestion of fibrin(ogen) increases too. It has been shown that summary effect on the fibrin(ogen) proteolytic degradation under the conditions for combined ultrasound treatment is determined exclusively by effect on fibrin(ogen). Conclusions The data presented here suggest that among proteins of fibrinolytic systems, the fibrinogen {{is one of the most}} sensitive proteins to the action of ultrasound. It has been shown in vitro that ultrasound induced fibrinogen aggregates formation, characterized by the loss of clotting ability and a greater rate of plasminolysis than native fibrinogen in different model systems and under different mode of ultrasound treatment. Under ultrasound treatment of plasminogen and/or t-PA in the presence of fibrin(ogen) the stabilizing effect fibrin(ogen) on given proteins was shown. On the other hand, an increase in the rate of fibrin(ogen) lysis was observed due to both the change in the substrate structure and promoting of the protein-protein complexes formation. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to inflammatory mediators, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are activated and release potent serine proteases, i. e. elastase, cathepsin G and proteinase 3. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop an assay to determine PMNmediated <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> in plasma, as a biochemical marker for activated PMN in vivo. On the basis of a special monoclonal antibody, generated against a neo-antigenic site in elastase degraded fibrinogen (EOF), we developed a highly specific plasma test for PMN-generated fibrin(ogen) derivatives. Intact fibrin(ogen) did not cross react in the assay, nor did plasmin-generated fibrin(ogen) derivatives. With this assay we showed, amongst others, that smoking did not affect the values of EDF-like degradation products in plasma of normal healthy volunteers (overall 8. 2 ± 1. 6 ng/ml; n= 18) and that EDF-values are increased in patients with an ccl-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (18. 6 ± 5. 3 ng/ml; n= 12) and with sepsis (365. 7 ± 198. 4 ng/ml; n= 16). The assay was also applied to assess PMN-mediated <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> in synovial tissue extracts of patients with rheumatoid arthritis; these contained very high levels of EDF (98. 2 ± 59. 3 ng/ml; n= 15), in contrast to synovial tissue extracts of patients with osteoarthritis (6. 3 ± 2. 7 ng/ml; n= 12).

40|$|Trauma-induced {{tissue factor}} (TF) release into the {{systemic}} circulation {{is considered to}} play an important role in the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) immediately after severe trauma. However, the relationship between TF and hyperfibrinolysis, especially <b>fibrinogenolysis,</b> has been unclear. A total of 18 rats were divided into three groups: (a) the control group was infused with normal saline; (b) the low-dose group was infused with 4 U/kg TF; and (c) the high-dose group was infused with 16 U/kg TF. Arterial blood was drawn immediately and 2 and 4 h after the start of TF infusion. At each sampling point, arterial blood gases, platelet counts, and coagulation variables were measured. The fibrinogen degradation products were evaluated by a Western blot analysis. Hypotension, hypoxemia, and lactic acidosis were not observed in any of the three groups. In proportion to the doses of TF, the platelet counts, coagulation, and fibrinolysis variables deteriorated in line with DIC. The alpha 2 -plasmin inhibitor levels significantly decreased in the high-dose group compared with the other groups. The amounts of fibrinogen degradation products increased in proportion to the doses of TF. The plasmin-alpha 2 -plasmin inhibitor complex level in the high-dose group increased more than that of the other groups. In conclusion, TF can induce DIC associated with fibrinolysis and <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> without tissue hypoperfusion. The decrease in the alpha 2 -plasmin inhibitor level and the significant increase in the plasmin level may be the two main factors underlying the pathogenesis of hyperfibrin(ogen) olysis after TF administration...|$|E
40|$|The 600 kDa {{neutrophil}} membrane neutral protease, {{which had}} been shown to generate bioactive peptides from the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein, has now {{been shown to have}} fibrinogenolytic activity that is distinct from <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> by plasmin and neutrophil lysosomal enzymes. This protease gradually reduces the apparent molecular mass of fibrinogen (340 kDa) to non-clottable products and generates terminal products with apparent molecular mass values of 270 kDa, 200 kDa, 100 kDa and less than 40 kDa through cleavage of all three of the constituent chains. Characteristics of <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> by this neutrophil protease are cleavage of the bond between amino acids valine and glutamic acid at positions 21 and 22 respectively from the N-terminus of the A alpha chain to release an A alpha 1 - 21 peptide, digestion of the B beta chain at positions within the C-terminus, and proteolysis of the bond between amino acids isoleucine and glycine at positions 394 and 395 respectively from the N-terminus of the gamma chain. This generates products that lack anticoagulant activity. The thrombin clotting time of the product with an apparent molecular mass of 330 kDa was prolonged, although clot formation was still observed. Loss of coagulability and inability to clot was found with further degradation of fibrinogen to an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa. Activity of this neutrophil membrane protease in vivo could be important for the regulation of fibrin deposition at sites of inflammation, and may contribute to the reported plasma levels of the A alpha 1 - 21 peptide...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{demonstrated}} that {{tissue plasminogen activator}} directly releases fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB) from fibrinogen. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether urokinase has similar activity. Incubation of urokinase with fibrinogen or heparinized plasma results in concentration-dependent FPB release unaccompanied by FPA cleavage. For equivalent amidolytic activity, high molecular weight urokinase releases twofold more FPB than the low molecular weight species. In contrast, prourokinase does not release FPB until activated to urokinase. Contaminating thrombin or plasma is not responsible for urokinase-mediated FPB release because this activity is unaccompanied by FPA or B beta 1 - 42 cleavage, and is unaffected by heparin, hirudin, a monospecific antibody against thrombin, aprotinin, or alpha 2 -antiplasmin. FPB release reflects a direct action of urokinase on fibrinogen because release is completely inhibited by a monospecific antibody against the enzyme. Further, urokinase releases FPB from the FPB-containing substrate B beta 1 - 42, thus confirming its specificity for the B beta 14 (Arg) -B beta 15 (Gly) bond. In addition to FPB release, SDS-PAGE analysis of the time course of urokinase-mediated <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> indicates progressive proteolysis of both the A alpha- and B beta-chains of fibrinogen that occurs after FPB release is completed. As a consequence of urokinase-mediated <b>fibrinogenolysis,</b> there is progressive prolongation of the thrombin clotting time. These studies indicate that urokinase has direct catalytic activity against fibrinogen. By releasing FPB, a potent chemoattractant, and by rendering fibrinogen less clottable by thrombin, urokinase may participate in processes extending beyond fibrinolysis...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{thrombolysis}} by monotherapy {{with either}} tPA or proUK have not {{lived up to}} expectations. Since these natural activators are inherently complementary, this property can be utilized to a synergistic advantage; and yet, this has undergone little evaluation. ProUK is no longer available because at pharmacological concentrations it converts to UK in plasma. Therefore, a single site proUK mutant, M 5, was developed {{to address this problem}} and was used in this study. Fibrinolysis was measured using preformed fluoresceinated 24 h old clots in a plasma milieu rather than by the standard automated method, because proUK/M 5 is sensitive to inactivation by thrombin and activation by plasmin. The shortest 50 % clot lysis time that could be achieved by tPA or M 5 alone was determined: mean times were 55 and 48 minutes respectively. These bench marks were matched by 6 % of the tPA monotherapy dose combined with 40 % that of M 5 : mean lysis time 47 minutes with less associated <b>fibrinogenolysis.</b> Results showed that the tPA effect was limited to initiating fibrinolysis which was completed by M 5 and then tcM 5. Plasma C 1 -inhibitor inhibited <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> by M 5, providing protection from side effects not available for proUK. In conclusion, by utilizing the complementary properties and sequential modes of action of each activator, more efficient fibrinolysis with less non-specific effects can be achieved than with traditional monotherapy. In vivo validation is needed, but in a previous clinical trial using a similar combination of tPA and proUK (5 % and 50 % monotherapy doses) very promising results have already been obtained...|$|E
30|$|Fibrin(ogen) {{degradation}} products (FDPs) are heterogeneous small molecules {{generated by the}} action of plasmin on both fibrin network (secondary fibrinolysis) and fibrinogen (primary <b>fibrinogenolysis).</b> D-dimers (D-domain of two fibrin molecules stabilised by FXIIIa) are specific of fibrinolysis and must be preferred when available [125 – 127]. D-dimers sign thrombin generation, fibrin formation and polymerisation then fibrinolysis, while the absence of D-dimers could represent defective fibrinolysis despite the presence of fibrin. Other markers could be useful but are not available in routine laboratories: PAP (plasmin–antiplasmin complexes), tPA and PAI- 1 [128, 129].

PMN were stimulated to migrate across 125 I-fibrinogen-coated nitrocellulose filters in response to 10 (- 7) M FMLP, and the extent of <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> was determined by measuring release of A alpha 1 - 21 and 125 I-labeled fibrinogen degradation products. The fibrinogenolytic activity of migrating PMN was then compared with that of free HNE present in PMN lysates or secreted by PMN stimulated with FMLP. Whereas the fibrinogenolytic activity of soluble HNE was completely inhibited by low concentrations (1 %) of plasma or serum and macromolecular antiproteinase (alpha 1 proteinase-inhibitor and soybean trypsin- inhibitor), even in the presence of undiluted plasma or serum the activity of the migrating PMN was incompletely blocked (81 - 85 %). Further, concentrations of alpha 1 proteinase-inhibitor and soybean trypsin-inhibitor that totally inhibited free HNE activity also incompletely blocked (88 - 89 %) the fibrinogenolytic activity of migrating PMN, indicating that FMLP-stimulated PMN demonstrate significant fibrinogenolytic activity in the presence of antiproteinases as small as 20, 000 mol wt. A specific low molecular weight HNE inhibitor (MeO-Suc-Ala 2 -Pro-ValCH 2 Cl), however, totally blocked PMN-mediated <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> without affecting intracellular HNE activity, HNE secretion from PMN, or PMN migration in response to FMLP. These findings support the hypothesis that PMN migrating on a fibrinogen-coated surface form zones of close contact with fibrinogen, thus preventing access of plasma antiproteinases to HNE released at the cell-substrate interface. The occurrence of this phenomenon in vivo would explain the presence of circulating A alpha 1 - 21 in individuals with normal antiproteinase concentrations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{association}} of increasing serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products after recombinant {{tissue-type plasminogen activator}} (rt-PA) therapy with bleeding and early coronary patency was assessed in 242 patients with acute myocardial infarction. After administration of 5, 000 IU heparin, a median of 40 mg (range 35 to 60) of double chain rt-PA was given intravenously in 90 min. Bleeding occurred in 62 patients; in 73 % of patients it was observed within the 1 st 24 h and 84 % of events consisted of hematoma or prolonged bleeding, or both, at puncture sites. Bleeding events occurred 2. 12 times as often in patients with serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products > 85 mg/liter as in patients with serum levels < 22 mg/liter (95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 4. 43). The infarct-related coronary vessel was patent in 65 % of patients at 90 min {{after the start of}} rt-PA infusion. In patients with high serum levels of fibrin(ogen) degradation products, coronary patency at 90 min after the start of rt-PA infusion was not better (13 % less, 95 % confidence interval − 33 %, 13 %) than in patients with low serum levels. This uncoupling of thrombolytic effect in terms of coronary patency and systemic <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> confirms the experimentally demonstrated fibrin specificity of double chain rt-PA in human subjects. Because fibrin specificity of single chain rt-PA is at least similar to that of double chain rt-PA, the observations in this analysis most likely hold also for single chain rt-PA. These findings suggest that a dose of rt-PA just below the threshold that causes systemic <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> might be optimal in terms of bleeding and coronary patency. Measurements of fibrinogen degradation products during rt-PA infusion might help to titrate rt-PA dosing in individual patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of 23 plasma proteins were measured by radial immunodiffusion in the plasma and ascites of 17 patients with cirrhosis and four patients with intraperitoneal malignancies, to learn {{whether there is}} a selectivity in the movement of proteins from plasma into ascites, analogous to that of proteinuria. Additionally, since some of the proteins are involved in coagulation, we hoped to clarify the coagulopathy frequently seen following peritoneovenous shunting of ascites. Analysis was by groups: group 1 consisted of nine patients with cirrhosis with an ascites-total protein content less than 2. 5 g/dl; group 2 consisted of eight patients with cirrhosis with ascites-total protein content {{greater than or equal to}} 2. 5 g/dl; and group 3 consisted of four patients with malignant ascites. The ratio of the plasma concentration/ascites concentration ([P]/[A]) for each protein was calculated for each patient. In each group the median [P]/[A] for each protein was plotted against the natural logarithm of its molecular weight (In MW). For 21 of the 23 proteins, [P]/[A] showed a close linear relationship to In MW. Fibrogen and plasminogen showed significant (p < 0. 0002) elevation above the regression line relating [P]/[A] to In MW. This indicates depletion of fibrinogen and plasminogen in ascites. The ascites in group 1 showed moderate selectivity, defined as the slope of the regression line (1. 59), while groups 2 and 3 were essentialy nonselective (0. 35 and 0. 50). Fibrin-split products were elevated in all ascites but not in plasma, indicating either fibrinolysis or <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> within the ascites. A normal ratio for prothrombin suggests <b>fibrinogenolysis</b> may be the dominant mechanism. Thus the coagulopathy induced by LeVeen valve insertion may be in part secondary to the infusion of plasmin or a plasminogen activator into the circulation...|$|E
