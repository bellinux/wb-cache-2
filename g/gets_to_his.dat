500|$|Carl proposes Homer {{be the new}} union {{president}} and he is promptly elected by a nearly unanimous vote. Mr. Burns watches Homer on his hidden camera, and is intimidated by his energy. Mr. Burns invites Homer to his office {{with the intent of}} bribing him, but Homer misconstrues Mr. Burns' sly innuendos as sexual advances. Homer quickly <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, saying he does not go for those [...] "back door shenanigans" [...] and promptly leaves, a series of events which establishes the idea in Mr. Burns' mind that Homer is honest and incorruptible.|$|E

6000|$|NICHOLLS (complacently--feeling {{his duty}} in the matter well done). That's the right spirit. I knew you'd see it that way. And you and I'll do all we can to help her. (He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet.) Well, I guess I'll have to go. Tell Eileen---- ...|$|E

60|$|BURKE--[Regaining his courage.] To the divil {{with all}} other reasons then. They don't matter with me at all. [He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet confidently, {{assuming}} a masterful tone.] I'm thinking you're the like of them women can't make up their mind till they're drove to it. Well, then, I'll {{make up your mind}} for you bloody quick. [He takes her by the arms, grinning to soften his serious bullying.] We've had enough of talk! Let you be going into your room now and be dressing in your best and we'll be going ashore.|$|E
6000|$|... “It is simple,” {{said one}} of the peons. “Comes this señor the American, into the wine‐shop of Cananos where we are sitting. There he takes a glass of Vermouth and goes away. Then comes a man {{slipping}} by where it is darkest, and we go to warn the señor taking the caña bottle. It appears there is another man waiting in this doorway, there is a struggle, and Vincente strikes down one of the prowlers with the bottle. He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet again, and they go in haste when they hear you coming. Then we find the señor faint and short of breath.” ...|$|E
60|$|Moore did {{not explain}} what he meant. For a {{crippled}} man, he made quick time in <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> horse and mounting.|$|R

60|$|GAYNOR. No, {{your kind}} never realises things till the crash comes--usually when it's too late. She kept on doing her work, I suppose--taking {{care of her}} {{brothers}} and sisters, washing, cooking, sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when {{she should have been}} in bed--and---- (He <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet with a harsh laugh.) But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And if luck is with us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.|$|E
6000|$|Loudon, I conjecture, {{would have}} {{struggled}} farther, had not he known {{that there would}} be a better chance again not very many miles ahead. London has studied this Convoy; knows of Ziethen coming to it with so many; of Ziskowitz coming to him, Loudon, with so many; that Ziethen cannot send for more (roads being all beset by our industry yesterday), that Ziskowitz can, should it be needful;--and that at Domstadtl there is a defile, or confused woody hollow, of unequalled quality! Mosel jumbles on all day with his Train, none molesting; at night <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> appointed quarters, Village of Neudorff; [The L, or EL, is a diminutive in these Names: (NEUDORFL) [...] "New-ThorpLET," [...] (DOMSTADTL) [...] "Cathedral-TownLET," [...] and the like.] and there finds Ziethen: a glad meeting, we may fancy, but an anxious one, with Domstadtl ahead on the morrow. Loudon concerts with Ziskowitz this day; calls in all reinforcements possible, and takes his measures. Thursday morning, Ziethen finds the Train in such a state, hardly half of it come up, he has to spend the whole day, Mosel and he, in rearranging it: Friday morning, June 30th, they get under way again;--Friday, the catastrophe is waiting them.|$|E
5000|$|Hardenbrook {{goes on to}} {{summarize}} the narrative background of the Oz mythos [...] - [...] the fairy queen Lurline and the whole scope and structure of magic, wizards and sorceresses crucial to Baum's fantasy [...] - [...] before he <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> story in earnest.|$|E

5000|$|... "Canadian Rules" [...] means that, {{instead of}} a {{traditional}} three-count, the referee must administer a five-count. Following the five-count, the competitor has to stay down for ten seconds. If both men are down for a ten-count for any reason, the first man who <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet wins the match. In addition, there are no submissions and no count-outs.|$|E
5000|$|George's ex-wife, Susan Temper (Sharon Smith), {{young son}} C.J. (C.J. Cooke), and Kathy, the family {{babysitter}} (Danny Ronan), begin to receive [...] "hang-up" [...] calls, which {{none of them}} realize is George making sure his family is home. The closer George <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> destination, the more gruesome his murders become and the memories of his first childhood-murder intensify.|$|E
5000|$|Socially Awkward Car {{salesman}}: A {{car salesman}} (played by Mark Cox) who {{stands in a}} group with three other car salesmen that have a laugh with each other by making comments or noises {{in relation to a}} subject. When it <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> turn, he becomes overbearing by making loud noises or gestures, resulting in the other car salesmen walking away in embarrassment.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, so {{you know}} him, do you?" [...] put in Link Merwell, questioningly. He had <b>gotten</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and was now {{straightening}} out his apparel.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{also plays}} on another common theme in James' fiction: the {{simultaneous}} allure and danger of experience. The closer Clement <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{goal of a}} home in the English countryside, the sicker he becomes. James' fiction would often show imaginative characters getting near the dense, [...] "passionate" [...] experience they desire, only to find that such experience can be destructive as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} the song is the heroics of Danish sailors during the wars against Sweden in the 17th and 18th centuries. It {{specifically}} names the Danish naval heroes King Christian IV, Niels Juel and Peter Wessel Tordenskiold.The first verse refers to the Battle of Colberger Heide where King Christian IV is hurt by shrapnel and thought to be dead, but quickly <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and incites his crew to continue the battle.|$|E
50|$|By {{the events}} of Rise of the Silver Surfer, Richards is, along with his teammates, an internationally {{recognized}} superhero and celebrity.

Reed and Sue are now engaged, although Reed has trouble keeping himself from being distracted from his imminent wedding (which is established as the fifth attempt they have made).|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] cried my uncle, <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{feet with}} some alacrity, as upon a sudden change of thought, [...] "I will get him myself." ...|$|R
5000|$|As Petrushka {{gradually}} {{pulls himself}} together, {{we hear a}} strange arpeggio in the clarinets: this is the famous [...] "Petrushka chord" [...] (consisting of juxtaposed triads of C major and F♯ major). Petrushka <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet (although shakily) {{to the accompaniment of}} waves of arpeggios from the piano (revealing the music's origins in Stravinsky's Konzertstück). The [...] "Petrushka Chord" [...] returns, now violently scored for trumpets, marked in the score [...] "Petrushka's Curses", directed at the portrait of the Magician.|$|E

A little further, Caroline and Matt make up but when Matt hurts his finger and bleeds, Caroline loses control and attacks him.|$|E
50|$|Nicae (Nice): En {{route to}} Nicae, Asterix and Obelix {{get stuck in}} holiday traffic bound for the Gaulish Riviera and stop at an inn for lunch (where Obelix <b>gets,</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> disgust, veal). Once they arrive in Nicae, the Gauls buy salad and {{have to make a}} {{premature}} departure when a Roman patrol spies them. To lose the patrol, Asterix and Obelix escape by sea and commandeer a boat, which they take to Massilia, much to the protest of a vacationing Lutetian who already had too much trouble finding room and board in Nicae.|$|E
