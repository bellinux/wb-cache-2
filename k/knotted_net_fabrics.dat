50|$|Filet lace is {{the general}} word used for all the {{different}} techniques of Embroidery on <b>Knotted</b> <b>Net</b> (or in French Broderie sur Filet Noué). It is a hand made needlework created by weaving or Embroidery using a long blunt needle and a thread on a ground of <b>knotted</b> <b>net</b> lace or Filet Work made of square or diagonal meshes of the same sizes or of different sizes. Lacis uses the same technique but is made on a ground of Leno (a woven fabric) or small canvas (not a knotted lace).|$|R

50|$|For a cricket net, the netting is {{the most}} {{important}} component. The net is usually manufactured in a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, this is a hard wearing and relatively economic material. Prior to the mid-1990s nets were often made from nylon, however after the significant spikes in crude oil prices it was no longer viable to use nylon. The net will be black in colour or occasionally green. The mesh size of the net will be 50mm and will commonly have a twine diameter ranging from 1.8mm - 3.0mm. Cricket nets are supplied from a knotless or <b>knotted</b> <b>netting</b> - {{as a rule of thumb}} <b>knotted</b> <b>nets</b> are considered to be superior. It is important to understand that twine thickness of <b>knotted</b> and knotless <b>nets</b> are not directly comparable as breaking strengths of <b>knotted</b> <b>nets</b> are higher than knotless. A good standard cricket net will be UV stabilised and rot proof. For people who construct their own cricket cage, the netting is the only component which they need to purchase from a specialist supplier. Cricket netting is seamed at the edges to stop netting fraying. These seams are usually a 6mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce net wear. Also partial canvas skirts of 0.5m (at the lower portion of the netting) are added to prevent animal damage at night from creatures walking into netting and chewing out of it.|$|R

40|$|Medical, {{healthcare}} and hygiene {{sector of the}} technical textiles industry is an important and growing part of the textile industry. For many years, pressure garments {{have been used to}} exert pressure on human limbs for scar management, venous and lymphatic problems, bone, muscle injury and post cosmetic surgery. Pressure garments are produced from knitted elastic fabrics, which extends from a relaxed state and remain extended when worn, thereby exerting pressure on the body of the wearer. Since pressure garments are worn next to the skin and are in intimate contact with the body, their attributes are relevant to the comfort of the wearer hence are of immense importance. As the skin of the wearer is extremely sensitive in the affected areas, thermal comfort characteristics and moisture management attributes of pressure garment fabrics {{play a critical role in}} patient compliance and healing. Pressure garments can be manufactured and structured from multi-layered fabric assemblies. In the present study, two power <b>net</b> <b>fabrics</b> PN 1 and PN 2 and three lining materials L 1, L 2 and L 3 were assessed for their moisture management properties in form of single layers and in form of assemblies constructed of power <b>net</b> <b>fabrics</b> and lining materials.

Further, L 2 /PN 1 is the best performing in terms of moisture management for fabric assemblies followed by PN 2 /L 1...|$|R
40|$|During {{selectivity}} {{experiments with}} square and diamond mesh codends, {{an evaluation of}} the covered codend method and a modified trouser trawl method went in favour of the last one. Both twisted knotless- and braided knotted material was used for the experiments. Square mesh codends gave higher 50 % retention lengths and selection factor than the diamond mesh codend, both for cod and haddock. Fished commercially, the square mesh codend of <b>knotted</b> <b>netting</b> caught fewer undersized fish than the diamond mesh codend. Big bycatches of redfish caused heavy meshing in the square mesh codend and reduced the selectivity. Due to the fixed circumference of the square mesh codend some problems arose when emptying big hauls on a sterntrawler...|$|R
50|$|The crewel {{technique}} {{is not a}} counted-thread embroidery (like canvas work), but a style of free embroidery. Crewelwork had its heyday in Britain in the 17th century, but has come {{in and out of}} fashion several times since then. Traditionally, crewel embroidery is done on tightly woven linen twill, though more recently, other fabrics like Matka silk, cotton velvet, rayon velvet, silk organza, <b>net</b> <b>fabric</b> and also jute have been used. A firm fabric is required to support the weight of the stitching. It is best to use a crewel needle to execute the stitches as a needle with a wide body, large eye and a sharp point is required.|$|R
5000|$|On the base, rough webbing made of durable, stainable fabric like burlap is attached. A nearly {{invisible}} material like fishing {{line can be}} used to sew each <b>knot</b> of <b>net</b> to the <b>fabric</b> (often with a drop of glue for strength). The jute is applied to the netting by tying groups of 5 to 10 strands of a color to the <b>netting</b> with simple <b>knots,</b> skipping sections to be filled in with other colors. The webbing is then seasoned by dragging it behind a vehicle, leaving it to soak in mud, or even applying manure to make it smell [...] "earthy." [...] Once on location, the ghillie suit is customized with twigs, leaves, and other elements of the local foliage as much as possible, although these local additions must be changed every few hours, due to wilting of green grasses or branches.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} 3D woven fabrics can be tapered {{in all three}} {{directions}} during the weaving process, producing near <b>net</b> shape <b>fabrics</b> such as I-beams and stiffeners. This means that these preforms could be placed directly in the mold without any additional labor work.|$|R
50|$|More or less {{integrally}} {{attached to}} the hull are the gondola, engines and sometimes the empennage (tail). The framework has the task of distributing the suspension loads of these attachments and the lifting gas loads evenly throughout the whole hull's surface and may also partially relieve stresses on the hull during manoeuvres. In early airships which relied on <b>nets,</b> <b>fabric</b> bands, or complicated systems of rope rigging to unite the lifting envelope with {{the other parts of}} the ship, semi-rigid construction was able to achieve improvements in weight, aerodynamic, and structural performance. The boundary between semi-rigid and non-rigid airships is vague. Especially with small types, it is unclear whether the structure is merely an extended gondola or a proper structural keel.|$|R

40|$|Background The {{durability}} of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) in field conditions {{is of great}} impor-tance for malaria prevention and control efforts; however, the physical integrity of the <b>net</b> <b>fabric</b> is not well understood making it challenging to determine overall effectiveness of nets as they age. The 2011 World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) guidelines provide a simple, standardized method using a proportional hole index (PHI) for assessing net damage {{with the intent to}} provide national malaria control pro-grams with guidelines to assess the useful life of LLINS and estimate the rate of replacement. Methods We evaluated the utility of the PHI measure using 409 LLINs collected over three years in Nampula Province, Mozambique following a mass distribution campaign in 2008. For each LLIN the diameter and distance {{from the bottom of the}} net were recorded for every hole. Holes were classified into four size categories and a PHI was calculated followingWHOPE...|$|R

50|$|Overall {{there is}} no need to protect or set aside {{conservation}} easements for the bigmouth buffalo, it seems to be a very well adapted species to its range and maintains its population well naturally. However it would be good to have a proper estimate on the abundance of species across its native range and monitored in order to catch any beginning of decline quickly to take action. Since the bigmouth is a foodfish it is easy to look at the commercial catching as a way to sample the population. It is shown that <b>knotted</b> <b>nets</b> can harm the fish causing hemorrhages and scale loss which would not be conducive to having little impact on the species while sampling. It would be ideal to seine for the bigmouth through oxbows and other regions of their range. This should be done in multiple locations in the Lake Erie, Ohio River, Mississippi River, Tennessee River, Milk River, Los Angeles aqueducts and Missouri River reservoirs where the fish are known to be caught. The species should be netted, sized, counted, and released. If the funding was available it would be good to tag the small ones for future population estimates.|$|R
