5|$|Somerton's climate <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{climate of}} {{south-west}} England {{which is usually}} cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more rain experienced in winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} {{regarded}} as a landmark in hard science fiction. As <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genre, Dragon's Egg attempts to communicate unfamiliar ideas and imaginative scenes while giving adequate attention to the known scientific principles involved.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sahara-Sahel region, and {{is mainly}} desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many {{previously}} wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|Built on former {{reservation}} {{lands of}} Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Indians, Lawton {{was founded on}} August 6, 1901, and was named after Major General Henry Ware Lawton, a Civil War Medal of Honor recipient killed in action in the Philippine–American War. Lawton's landscape <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Plains, with flat topography and gently rolling hills, while the area {{north of the city}} is marked by the Wichita Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north-west of Europe, {{although several}} of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds {{for a variety of}} seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|E
5|$|The flora of {{the island}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Outer Hebrides with heather, {{sphagnum}} moss, sedges, grass and bracken predominating. There is but a single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay {{since at least the}} late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of Crucibulum, which {{contains}} both haploid and diploid stages, <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species of Basidiomycota that can reproduce both asexually (via vegetative spores), or sexually (with meiosis). Like other wood-decay fungi, this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases: the vegetative stage for the spread of mycelia, and the reproductive stage {{for the establishment of}} spore-producing structures, the fruiting bodies.|$|E
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southwest of Scotland. There {{is a mixture of}} boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from the sandy bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue {{was built}} in 1890. Its {{architecture}} <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, with a square shape and discreet neo-romanesque ornaments. Its cupola was destroyed in 1940 by the Nazis and never rebuilt. The Jewish cemetery, located outside the old town, was opened in 1622. It has several 18th century gravestones showing a Christian artistic influence.|$|E

5|$|The upper storeys have {{ornamental}} panels featuring {{several different}} decorative motifs, including roundels and diagonal ogee braces. The eaves have corbel brackets with carvings including human faces and animals. These include a lion, ape and devil, {{as well as}} a salamander, supposed to give protection against fire. Gilded carvings of Richard and Margerye Churche are located above the main entrance, on either side. The timbers bear carpenters' marks with both Roman and Arabic numerals, some being unusually long. The highly decorated style <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timber-framed buildings of the Elizabethan period.|$|E
5|$|With these exceptions, {{most of the}} {{decoration}} and the fittings of the choir date from the 19thcentury and are {{in keeping with the}} Gothic Revival promoted by the Oxford Movement and Augustus Welby Pugin. The restored vault of the choir <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, having been designed by Scott and decorated and gilded by Clayton and Bell.|$|E
5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's {{name comes from}} pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E

5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman whose name is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, whose name is unlike other Wuffingas names but which <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a soft, silvery, {{paramagnetic}} metal. Its chemistry <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late actinides, with {{a preponderance}} of the +3 oxidation state; the +2 oxidation state is also accessible, especially in solids. The high radioactivity of einsteinium-253 produces a visible glow and rapidly damages its crystalline metal lattice, with released heat of about 1000 watts per gram. Difficulty in studying its properties is due to einsteinium-253's decay to berkelium-249 and then californium-249 {{at a rate of}} about 3% per day. The isotope of einsteinium with the longest half-life, einsteinium-252 (half-life 471.7 days) would be more suitable for investigation of physical properties, but it has proven far more difficult to produce and is available only in minute quantities, and not in bulk. Einsteinium is the element with the highest atomic number which has been observed in macroscopic quantities in its pure form, and this was the common short-lived isotope einsteinium-253.|$|E
5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of}} the skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E

5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E
5|$|The tiger {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tigrinum) <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, {{such as the}} Bufo spp. toads, actively search for prey, while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.|$|E
5|$|Sicily's second city, Catania, was {{the most}} damaged of all the larger cities in 1693, with only the medieval Castello Ursino and three tribunes of the cathedral remaining. Thus it was replanned and rebuilt. The new design {{separated}} the city into quarters, divided by two roads meeting at an intersection known as the Piazza del Duomo (Cathedral Square). Rebuilding was supervised by the Bishop of Catania, and the city's only surviving architect, Alonzo di Benedetto. Di Benedetto headed a team of junior architects called in from Messina, which quickly began to rebuild, concentrating first on the Piazza del Duomo. Three palazzi are situated here, the Bishop's Palace, the Seminario and one other. The architects worked in complete harmony and {{it is impossible to}} distinguish di Benedetto's work from that of his junior colleagues. The work is competent but not remarkable, with decorated rustication in the 17th-century Sicilian style, but often the decoration on the upper floors is superficial. This <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baroque of this period immediately after the earthquake.|$|E
