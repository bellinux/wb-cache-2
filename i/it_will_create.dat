This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E
25|$|Undercutting is {{when the}} weld reduces the {{cross-sectional}} thickness of the base metal. This type of defect reduces {{the strength of the}} weld and workpieces. One reason for this defect is excessive current, causing the edges of the joint to melt and drain into the weld; this leaves a drain-like impression {{along the length of the}} weld. Another reason is if a poor technique is used that does not deposit enough filler metal along the edges of the weld. A third reason is using an incorrect filler metal, because <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>create</b> greater temperature gradients between the center of the weld and the edges. Other causes include too small of an electrode angle, a dampened electrode, excessive arc length, and slow speed.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} sense and respond {{effectively}} to fluctuations {{in an environment}} is the fundamental problem addressed by cybernetics. When applied to {{the context of the}} organizational IT function, agility denotes the capacity of the IT function to perceive "signals" from its internal and external environments, to interpret these, and respond appropriately. The processing of such signals requires the selection and filtering of information to drive decision-making for response in a timely way. The challenge for the IT function is processing an overwhelming collection of signals, in un-standardized formats, and from overlapping sources, that tends to overload decision-makers. Informed by a cybernetic model, we studied how the IT function enables agility. We found evidence (1) that the more mature the policy processes of the IT function, the more the <b>IT</b> function <b>will</b> <b>create</b> agility in information systems; (2) The more mature the intelligence processes of the IT function to look outside the organization, the more the <b>IT</b> function <b>will</b> <b>create</b> agility in information systems and; (3) The more mature the control processes of the IT function that focus on the current use of information systems, the more the <b>IT</b> function <b>will</b> <b>create</b> agility in information systems. <br /...|$|R

Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a {{need to create a}} militarized [...] "production atmosphere" [...] by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state the workers should have nothing to fear from the state, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress he argued for [...] "such a regime under which each worker feels himself to be a soldier of labor who cannot freely dispose of himself; if he is ordered transferred, he must execute that order; if he does not do so, he will be a deserter who should be punished. Who will execute this? [...] The trade union. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>create</b> a new regime. That is the militarization of the working class." [...] Lenin sharply criticised Trotsky and accused him of [...] "bureaucratically nagging the trade unions" [...] and of staging [...] "factional attacks". His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, [...] "Introduction of genuine labor discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions take a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. This cannot be achieved by bureaucratic methods and orders from above." [...] This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.|$|E
