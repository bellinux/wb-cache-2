25|$|The Fifth {{generation}} {{was equipped with}} an interchangeable <b>extruder</b> with some self-diagnostics capabilities. It was new {{in the market and}} supposed to help printer maintenance but reliability problem occurred with very short lifespan on the <b>extruder,</b> requiring frequent replacement at high cost. This led to a class action lawsuit which was dismissed Ultimately, Makerbot replaced the failing <b>extruder</b> with a new version.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, MakerBot {{introduced}} the Replicator 2. This newest model again increased the build volume, {{this time to}} 28.5cm x 15.3cm x 15.5cm (11.2″ x 6.0″ x 6.1″L/W/H) and can print at 100µm per layer. The dual <b>extruder</b> was changed back to a single <b>extruder</b> head, while the upgraded electronics, LCD, and gamepad remained similar to the original Replicator. Unlike previous models, the Replicator 2 can print only using PLA plastic, which comes sold in sealed bags with desiccate {{to protect it from}} moisture.

25|$|In 2014, {{the company}} faced {{significant}} criticism when it filed patent applications for designs that some claimed had been invented {{by members of}} its community and published to Thingiverse, such as the quick release <b>extruder.</b> Community members accused MakerBot of asserting ownership over their designs when those designs had been contributed {{with the understanding that}} they would remain open source. Then-CEO Bre Pettis released a statement dismissing these critics, citing patents that had been filed for unique inventions prior to any community-created designs, namely that the patent for the quick release <b>extruder</b> was originally filed in 2012 while the open source design was first published to Thingiverse in 2013.|$|E
40|$|Mixing {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{functions}} of screw <b>extruders.</b> Mixing is usually divided in distributive and dispersive mixing. It is well known that single screw <b>extruders</b> generally have poor mixing capability even when dispersive mixing elements are incorporated into the screw design. This paper will discuss the requirements for dispersive mixing. Current dispersive mixing elements used in single screw <b>extruders</b> will be analyzed and the lack of efficient dispersive mixing will be explained. A new generation of dispersive mixing elements will be introduced for use both in single and twin screw <b>extruders.</b> Two and three dimensional flow simulation will be used to analyze the mixing performance of these new mixers. Experimental work on the new mixing elements will be also be presented; the results demonstrate that it is possible to achieve dispersive mixing capability on single screw <b>extruders</b> as good as what can be achieved on twin screw <b>extruders.</b> The implications of these results on the compounding industry will be briefly discussed...|$|R

25|$|Extrusion is {{the process}} of {{kneading}} and shaping {{at the same time and}} in the matter of a few minutes. This process takes place in an <b>extruder</b> which is a grooved extrusion cylinder equipped with an extrusion worm which is a shaft with deep thread around its core. The extrusion worm kneads and moves the dough forward and presses it through the dies in the head of the <b>extruder.</b> The longitudinal grooves in the cylinder reduce the friction and improves the movement of the dough. Both the worm and the cylinder are made of stainless steel, but the worm has a Teflon coating to decrease friction.|$|E
25|$|THF {{is used as}} {{a solvent}} in 3D {{printing}} when using PLA plastics. It can be used to clean clogged 3D printer parts, as well as when finishing prints to remove <b>extruder</b> lines and add a shine to the finished product.|$|E
25|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an <b>extruder,</b> where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the <b>extruder</b> where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both protein denaturation and starch gelatinization, depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a {{regression}} model was constructed {{to optimize the}} relationships between the void fraction of foamed HDPE/wood-flour composites, the processing conditions (<b>extruder’s</b> die temperature and screw speed rate), and the formulation compositions [chemical foaming agent (CFA) concentration and the moisture content of wood flour] by applying a four-factor central composite design (CCD) statistical approach. Design Expert software was employed to carry out the experimental design, statistical analysis, and numerical optimization. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the model showed that the void fraction of HDPE/wood-flour composites was a strong function of the <b>extruder’s</b> die temperature, the screw speed rate, and the moisture content of wood flour, while independent of the CFA content within the studied range (0 1 %). In addition, the moisture content of wood flour and the <b>extruder’s</b> screw speed rate exhibited significant interaction effect on the void fraction of the foamed composites. The response surface optimization generated using the regression model suggests that HDPE/wood-flour composite foams with the highest void fraction can be achieved {{at the highest levels of}} <b>extruder’s</b> screw speed rate (120 rpm) and moisture content of wood flour (12 %), together with the lowest levels of <b>extruder’s</b> die temperature (170 C) and no chemical foaming agent.

It was the last open-source MakerBot printer.|$|E
25|$|The {{forming process}} {{involves}} the dough entering an <b>extruder</b> {{in which the}} rotation of a single or double screw system pushes the dough toward a die set to a specific shape. As the starch granules swell slightly {{in the presence of}} water and a low amount of thermal energy, they become embedded within the protein matrix and align along the direction of the shear caused by the extrusion process.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} types and shapes of dies to form various shapes of pasta. Generally, pastas are categorized into two large groups: long pasta (like spaghetti, fettuccine, linguine and etc.) and short pasta (like elbow-shaped macaroni, penne, shells and etc.). Circular dies with rotating blades underneath them {{are used for}} short products, where long rectangular dies form the long products. The dies are made of Teflon-coated bronze. The <b>extruder</b> pushes the dough through the dies and blades or trimmers cut the dough in the desired length.|$|E

25|$|Durum wheat {{is ground}} into {{semolina}} flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour {{to move to}} a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades while pasta such as penne and rotini are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the <b>extruder</b> through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.|$|E
25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an <b>extruder</b> and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a crosslinked network is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, <b>extruder</b> speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.|$|E
50|$|Co{{extrusion}} is the extrusion {{of multiple}} layers of material simultaneously. This type of extrusion utilizes two or more <b>extruders</b> to melt and deliver a steady volumetric throughput of different viscous plastics to a single extrusion head (die) which will extrude the materials in the desired form. This technology is used {{on any of the}} processes described above (blown film, overjacketing, tubing, sheet). The layer thicknesses are controlled by the relative speeds and sizes of the individual <b>extruders</b> delivering the materials.|$|R

25|$|First, {{gum base}} is {{previously}} prepared through a melting and straining or filtering process. The formulation for gum base is proprietary information known to few individuals within each gum-producing company. Next, other ingredients such as nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners and flavors {{are added to}} the gum base until the warm mixture thickens like dough. The gum base mixture is heated during this mixing process in order to increase the entropy of the polymers to achieve a more uniform dispersion of ingredients. Then, extrusion technology is implemented to smooth, form, and shape the gum. Next, the gum goes through a shaping process that is determined by gum type and consumer demand. For example, cut and wrap (chunk or cube) pieces are severed straight out of the <b>extruder</b> using a vertical cutter. Sheeting is a technique often used for stick, slab and tab gums. Next, gum is either conditioned by being sprinkled with a powdered polyol or coated via the application of subsequent layers of coating using temperature controlled coating basins before it is sent to packaging.|$|E

50|$|There are two sub-types of {{twin screw}} extruders: co-rotating and counter-rotating. This {{nomenclature}} {{refers to the}} relative direction each screw spins compared to the other. In co-rotation mode, both screws spin either clockwise or counter clockwise; in counter-rotation, one screw spins clockwise while the other spins counter clockwise. It has been shown that, for a given cross sectional area and degree of overlap (intermeshing), axial velocity and degree of mixing is higher in co-rotating twin <b>extruders.</b> However, pressure buildup is higher in counter-rotating <b>extruders.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Durum wheat {{semolina}} or flour, common farina or flour, or {{combination of}} both is mixed with water and eggs (for egg noodles) and other optional ingredients (like spinach, tomato, herbs and etc.). [...] Usually 25-30 kg of water is added per 100 kg of semolina. The amounts are measured by computerized dispensers. The mixture is then kneaded by auger <b>extruder</b> equipped with mixing paddles and kneading blades to obtain a homogeneous mass, and after that is extruded through various shaped dies. Drying process begins immediately after the products are shaped to prevent deformation and sticking. The pastas are dried completely in drying chambers and stabilized, then ready for packaging. In modern factories, dry pasta is processed using automatic continuous lines.|$|E
2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer <b>extruder),</b> which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

50|$|Compounding {{extrusion}} is {{a process}} that mixes one or more polymers with additives to give plastic compounds. The feeds may be pellets, powder and/or liquids, but the product is usually in pellet form, to be used in other plastic-forming processes such as extrusion and injection molding. As with traditional extrusion, there is a wide range in machine sizes depending on application and desired throughput. While either single- or double-screw <b>extruders</b> may be used in traditional extrusion, the necessity of adequate mixing in compounding extrusion makes twin-screw <b>extruders</b> all but mandatory.|$|R
