50|$|Human {{health and}} {{environmental}} risk is the likelihood of an adverse outcome (See adverse outcome pathway). As such, risk {{is a function of}} hazard and <b>exposure.</b> <b>Hazard</b> is the intrinsic danger or harm that is posed, e.g. the toxicity of a chemical compound. Exposure is the likely contact with that hazard. Therefore, the risk of even a very hazardous substance approaches zero as the exposure nears zero, given a person's (or other organism's) biological makeup, activities and location (See exposome). Another example of health risks are when certain behaviors, such as risky sexual behaviors, increase the likelihood of contracting HIV.|$|E

Fast fission may produce higher yields. Tin is an inert metal with little mobility in the environment, helping limit health risks from its radiation.|$|E

30|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, several spectrophotometric and radioisotopic methods were developed to measure the amount of blood loss from sanitary products directly. The measurement of blood depended on either the measurement of hemoglobin content (e.g., acid hematin and alkaline hematin) or iron content (e.g., iron-labeled isotopes and chemical extraction of iron) [1, 2, 16 – 19]. Methods that depend on iron chemical extraction were limited by the low extraction rates and systematic underestimation of blood loss.

The oil and smoke that spewed for months from hundreds of burning oil wells presented another <b>exposure</b> <b>hazard</b> not previously encountered in a war zone.

5000|$|Aspergillus penicillioides is {{a common}} indoor fungus in damp {{buildings}} {{where it has been}} associated with allergic rhinitis. Under high level of exposure to indoor fungus, an association was found between fungal concentration and development of allergic rhinitis. Despite that this species was originally described from a skin infection, the principle human <b>exposure</b> <b>hazard</b> is likely to be through the inhalation route. Products of mold growth, such as volatile organic metabolites and spores, may contribute to discomfort such as allergy and asthma. Sustained growth of house dust mites by A. penicillioides can also be a health hazard. House dust mites can activate mast cells and T cells, which release mediators like prostaglandin and histamine that have multiple effects on epithelium. Dust mite-induced signals are then propagated through epithelium, which enhance allergic airway inflammation. However, there is controversy on contribution of A. penicillioides to allergenicity of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. It was shown that allergen profiles of larval mites without this fungus are similar to adult mites with the fungus. [...] Fungus-free adult mites in experimental condition also had same allergen profiles when compared to the mites re-fed the fungus A. penicillioides.|$|E

40|$|Population {{exposure}} to multiple chemicals in air presents significant challenges for environmental public health. Air quality regulations distinguish criteria air pollutants (CAPs) (e. g., ozone, PM 2. 5) from {{hazardous air pollutants}} (HAPs) — 187 chemicals which include carcinogens and others {{that are associated with}} respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and numerous other non-cancer health effects. Evidence of the public’s cumulative exposure and the health effects of HAPs are quite limited. A multilevel model is used to assess differential {{exposure to}} HAP respiratory, neurological, and cancer hazards (2005) related to the Townsend Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (TSI), after adjustment for regional population size and economic activity, and local population density. We found significant positive associations between tract TSI and respiratory and cancer HAP exposure hazards, and smaller effects for neurological HAPs. Tracts in the top quintile of TSI have between 38 %– 60 % higher HAP exposure than the bottom quintile; increasing population size from the bottom quintile to the top quintile modifies HAP <b>exposure</b> <b>hazard</b> related to TSI, increasing cancer HAP <b>exposure</b> <b>hazard</b> by 6 % to 20 % and increasing respiratory HAP <b>exposure</b> <b>hazard</b> by 12 % to 27 %.

30|$|We {{define the}} margin of {{exposure}} as the hazard quotient (HQ), quantified by dividing the exposure potential of NMs concentration in air by the threshold value OEL. The resultant value represents the initial deterministic risk forecast generated by the BN risk assessment model. If the forecasted exposure level {{is greater than the}} threshold dose, i.e. HQ[*]>[*] 100 %, there exists potential risks of adverse human health implications for the particular NM. The HQ can be refined through a robust learning process in BN and offers a coherent and quantifiable human health risk assessment.
