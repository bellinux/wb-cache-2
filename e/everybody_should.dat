500|$|Organizations {{including}} People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) criticized Gore for not advocating vegetarianism {{as a way}} {{for individuals}} to reduce their carbon footprint. Gore agreed that meat production contributes to increased carbon emissions, but did not want to [...] "go quite as far as ... saying <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> become a vegetarian". He said that although he was not a vegetarian, he had [...] "cut back sharply" [...] on his consumption of meat.|$|E
500|$|Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter {{describe}} [...] "Ding Dong" [...] as the [...] "quickest song" [...] that Harrison ever wrote, {{in terms}} of time spent on the composition. The words for the song's middle eight – [...] "Yesterday, today was tomorrow / And tomorrow, today will be yesterday" [...] – came from another pair of inscriptions from Crisp's time at Friar Park. Harrison found these lines in what he called [...] "the garden building", carved in stone around two matching windows. The only other lyrics in [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong" [...] are the song title, repeated four times to serve as its chorus. Sung in imitation of a clock chiming, the chorus lyrics, combined with the message of those of the verse, lend the composition an obvious New Year's theme. Harrison later described the song as [...] "very optimistic", and suggested: [...] "Instead of getting stuck in a rut, <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> try ringing out the old and ringing in the new… [...] sing about it, but they never apply it to their lives." ...|$|E

5000|$|Broomfield {{told the}} BBC that he professes irreligion. He said, [...] "I believe that there's a {{goodness}} out there, and I think there's goodness in <b>everybody.</b> We <b>should</b> probably all try {{and have a}} good dig around and find out where it is." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, McCamley was knighted for his {{outstanding}} {{contributions to}} the beef industry. Despite receiving the knighthood and being henceforth known as Sir Graham McCamley, McCamley {{said he did not}} expect to be called by the title. McCamley said that if his three-year-old grandson could simply call him [...] "Graham", <b>everybody</b> else <b>should</b> as well.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2009, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Cemil Çiçek {{declared}} that, should Turkey {{be forced}} to choose between supporting either EU membership or Turkish Cypriots, [...] " [...] Turkey’s choice will forever be to stand next to the Turkish Cypriots. <b>Everybody</b> <b>should</b> understand this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee Min Choon, {{legal adviser}} to the CFM and the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship issued a {{statement}} which said [...] "It means that churches can celebrate Christmas {{as they have been}} doing all along. Otherwise, the very meaning of the occasion will be lost." [...] "Now, <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> take the government at its word and celebrate Christmas the way they normally celebrate and express their religious faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|Christopher Hitchens. In 2010 he {{dismissed}} the [...] "cruel revolutionary rubbish" [...] he promoted {{as a member}} as [...] "poison", but later commented that [...] "it was a reasonable mistake to have made. I'm glad I made it, because unlike people who've been vaccinated against a disease, I've actually had the disease and therefore I'm totally immune from {{it in a way}} that a mere vaccination couldn't possibly provide. ... It taught me how to think, in a lot of ways. So I don't regret the experience at all; I think <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> have it." ...|$|E
60|$|Because he gave {{no warning}} {{that we should}} remain silent, were my suspicions {{regarding}} his loyalty increased, for if peradventure our presence there must be kept a profound secret from <b>everybody,</b> then <b>should</b> he have checked Hiram, since in event of a Tory or a lobster back entering the building, our comrade's voice would be heard.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Provost I {{have had}} the honour of meeting," [...] said Auberon, easily. [...] "We old journalists, you know, meet <b>everybody.</b> I <b>should</b> be most delighted {{to have the same}} honour again. General Turnbull, also, it would be a {{gratification}} to know. The younger men are so interesting. We of the old Fleet Street gang lose touch with them." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a 1950 {{interview}} with journalist Edward R. Murrow, Arnold reported seeing similar objects on three other occasions, and said other pilots {{flying in the}} northwestern U.S. had sighted such objects {{as many as eight}} times. The pilots initially felt a duty reporting the objects despite the ridicule, he said, because they thought the U.S. government didn't know what they were. Arnold did not assert that the objects were alien spacecraft, although he did say: [...] "being a natural-born American, if it's not made by our science or our Army Air Forces, I am inclined to believe it's of an extraterrestrial origin." [...] Then he added that he thought <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> be concerned, but [...] "I don't think it's anything for people to get hysterical about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{successfully}} pressured William Bulger {{to resign}} as President of the University of Massachusetts (UMass) on September 1, 2003. Bulger {{said that his}} resignation {{was the result of}} [...] "a calculated political assault" [...] on him, largely by the governor. William Bulger came under pressure from Romney and others to resign after he invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify when he was subpoenaed by a Congressional committee to testify about his brother, James J. [...] "Whitey" [...] Bulger, one of the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Romney, who had called for Bulger's resignation and the elimination of the UMass presidency as a cost-cutting move, denied that he had been personally targeting the former state senate president. [...] "The decision was not a political calculation or a personal one," [...] Romney said in February 2003, after unveiling his plan to eliminate the president's job. The Governor's aides stressed that he had not been personally targeting Bulger, saying such interpretations of Romney's actions were cynical. [...] "I think <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> be taken at their word," [...] spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) into law on March 23, 2010 in the East Room before a select {{audience}} of nearly 300. He {{stated that the}} health reform effort, designed after a long and acrimonious debate facing fierce opposition in the U.S. Congress to expand health insurance coverage, was based on [...] "the core principle that <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> have some basic security {{when it comes to}} their health care". [...] The primary purpose of the PPACA was to increase coverage to the American people either through public or private insurance and control healthcare costs. [...] The Congressional Budget Office(CBO) estimated that the PPACA would reduce the number of uninsured by 32 million increasing coverage for the non-elderly citizens from 83 to 94 per cent. [...] Insurers were not allowed to deny insurance to applicants with pre-existing conditions. [...] The Sunlight Foundation has stated that at least forty-seven private company contractors have been involved with the PPACA in some capacity as of fall 2013, with the measure causing a wide variety of policy changes. Journalists writing for The New York Times have called the PPACA [...] "the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades".|$|E

50|$|Like {{her fellow}} {{political}} activist Helene Stöcker, Lily Braun was stronglyly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche; {{she and her}} husband wanted the SPD to focus on the development of personality and individuality instead of levelling <b>everybody.</b> Women <b>should</b> have their own personality and should not have to be only regarded as (future) mothers and wives. She wanted economic freedom for women and advocated new types of personal relations up to the abolition of legal marriage.|$|R

50|$|There {{were some}} critics who didn’t {{even bother to}} get {{themselves}} familiar {{with the way the}} election system works here. They started saying straightaway that the election was undemocratic. But I think that the citizens of Russia stopped the mouths of those critics with their high turnout. The main attribute of a democratic country is that all decisions are made by the people. Politicians and <b>everybody</b> else <b>should</b> respect the choice of people.|$|R
60|$|He has {{coffee and}} pipes for <b>everybody.</b> I <b>should</b> {{like you to}} have seen the face of old Bowly, his college-tutor, called upon to sit cross-legged on a divan, a little cup of bitter black Mocha put into his hand, and a large amber-muzzled pipe stuck into his mouth by Spitfire, before he could so much as {{say it was a}} fine day. Bowly almost thought he had {{compromised}} his principles by consenting so far to this Turkish manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{suppose that}} covers all her {{shortcomings}} in manners,' I retorted. But I was ashamed--for {{it is true}} that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too; and she is a perfect tower of strength in the Red Cross. It's a little hard to remember all the heroines. Just the same, it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when <b>everybody</b> is--or <b>should</b> be--trying to 'save and serve.' ...|$|R
60|$|The most curious {{part of this}} curious {{letter is}} the conclusion, where Rousseau, loosely {{wandering}} from his theme, separates Voltaire from the philosopher, and beseeches him {{to draw up a}} moral code or profession of civil faith that should contain positively the social maxims that <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> be bound to admit, and negatively the intolerant maxims that <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> be forced to reject as seditious. Every religion in accord with the code should be allowed, and every religion out of accord with it proscribed, or a man might be free to have no other religion but the code itself.|$|E

5000|$|Cook {{expressed}} his vision this way: [...] "Carnival {{is to promote}} business for <b>everybody</b> and <b>should</b> not be used by any one group. It is {{for all of the}} stores and all of the people, for all kinds of professions and businesses, for the city as a whole regardless {{of the size of the}} business, the social standing, wealth, prestige, family background or anything else that would tend to make anyone feel that he or she would not be invited to participate in Carnival." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look, Bessie," [...] he said. [...] "This is your uncle's death-warrant. At {{present it}} is valueless and informal, for I {{have not yet}} signed, though, as you will see, I have been careful that <b>everybody</b> else <b>should.</b> If once I place my {{signature}} there it cannot be revoked, and the sentence must be carried into effect. If you persist in your refusal I will sign it before your eyes;" [...] and he placed the paper on the book and took the pencil in his right hand.|$|R
60|$|They {{all began}} {{to talk to me}} then and tell me wot I was to do, and wot they would do if I didn't. I couldn't get a word in edgeways. When I {{reminded}} the mate that when he was up in London 'e always passed himself off as a single man, 'e wouldn't listen; and when I asked the skipper whether 'is pore missus was blind, he on'y went on shouting at the top of 'is voice.

6000|$|... "Quite right; quite right. <b>Everybody</b> <b>should</b> {{use their}} own {{judgment}} in everything they do or say, more or less. But now, Mrs. Jones, I want to know this: you remember her ladyship's first marriage, I dare say." ...|$|E
60|$|Among the {{officials}} whose positions {{enabled them to}} know all these astonishing occurrences it was unanimously agreed that, so far as possible, <b>everybody</b> <b>should</b> be kept in ignorance of the crime which had been attempted, and of the deliverance which had taken place.|$|E

60|$|At once, I am {{ashamed to}} say, Heaven lost its exalted {{position}} in my eyes.

5000|$|Winship {{tried to}} repress the Nationalists. Jaime Benítez Rexach, {{a student at}} the University of Chicago at the time and later long-time {{chancellor}} of the University of Puerto Rico, wrote to President Roosevelt stating, [...] "Governor Winship himself through his military approach to things has helped keep Puerto Rico in a unnecessary state of turmoil. He seems to think that the political problem of Puerto Rico limits itself to a fight between himself and the Nationalists, that no holds are barred in that fight and that <b>everybody</b> else <b>should</b> keep out." [...] Winship was replaced in 1939.|$|R
