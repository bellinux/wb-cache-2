5000|$|A {{shell mill}} is any of various milling cutters (typically a <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> or endmill) whose {{construction}} takes a modular form, with the shank (arbor) made {{separately from the}} body of the cutter, which is called a [...] "shell" [...] and attaches to the shank/arbor via any of several standardized joining methods.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> is a cutter {{designed}} for facing {{as opposed to}} e.g., creating a pocket (end mills). The cutting edges of face mills are always located along its sides. As such it must always cut in a horizontal direction at a given depth coming from outside the stock. Multiple teeth distribute the chip load, and since the teeth are normally disposable carbide inserts, this combination allows for very large and efficient face milling.|$|E

The key problem of this method is to obtain joint surface parameters between the machine tool spindle and <b>face</b> <b>milling</b> cutter through experimental modal analysis and MATLAB software.

For coated inserts, prior to the coating process, edge preparation method choice will impact their performance. So, a classification based on its impact on wear resistance is needed. Indeed, the flank wear of three coated cemented carbide inserts presenting differently prepared edges (untreated, dragging and magneto-abrasive machining) is explored experimentally. Those inserts are used to <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> the hardened AISI 4140 low alloy steel. Further, by means of the principal component analysis (PCA), correlations between the online measured cutting forces and flank wear behaviour are investigated. In view of this analysis, for each studied case, the statistical law predicting flank wear relying on cutting forces components is established with fair approximation.

Titanium is deposited by FCVA while MoS 2 is magnetron sputtered. The deposition set up allows several compositions of Ti-MoS 2 to be deposited simultaneously, with Ti content ranging between 5 and 96 at. %, and their machining performances to be evaluated. Milling took place using a CNC Vertical Machining Center at a 877 mm/min feed rate. The effect of different coating compositional ratios {{on the degree of}} aluminium sticking when a milling insert is used to <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> an Al alloy (SAE 6061) was investigated using a combination of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XPS studies suggest that the greater degree of Al sticking on the rake face of the inserts is due to the formation of greater amounts of non-protective Ti-O phases. EDX mapping of the milling inserts after machining reveal that a Ti:MoS 2 ratio of around 0. 39 prevents Al from sticking to the tool edges. Since we prevent Al from sticking to the tool surface, the resultant machined surface finish is improved thus validating the machining performance of TiB 2 -coated tools using optimum compositions of Ti:MoS 2 thin film coatings...|$|E

40|$|Material {{developments}} for {{the cutting}} tool {{is one of the}} most critical elements in metal cutting, have always been characterized by an increase in wear resistance to machine harder, tougher, or chemically reactive materials. In machining processes, a major quality related output is integrity of the machined part surface. In machining of difficult to cut material, a drastic decrease in tool-life makes the machining process even more difficult. Inconel 718 is a high strength thermal resistant material alloy which was used for this project. It contains hard particles making it a very difficult to machine. The difficulty of machining Inconel 718 leading to short tool life and poor surface roughness. This project describes a study on the effects of cryogenic treatment on tool wear and surface roughness of Inconel 718. The main aim of this study is to analyze the differences in tool performance between cryogenically treated and untreated PVD during <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> Inconel 718. The flank wear and crater wear on cutting tool are studied for specific operating parameters.

At high cutting speed, cryogenic PVD produce low surface roughness and less tool wear.

The methods employed as well as the final balancing procedures are outlined in the study for various areas of interest. The conclusions for the study were based on the in situ, balancing performed at Cobra Machine Tool for the prototype machine.

40|$|Conventional {{machinability}} testing requires {{large numbers}} of workpiece specimens. The difficulty is evaluating the machinability rating of an unknown and newly produced work material. A new method, proposed in this paper, is to <b>face</b> <b>mill</b> an end face of a cylindrical workpiece. The (VT) ^n=C curve is then determined from the data. Using this curve a machinability rating for the work material can be found. This method uses 85 % of the workpiece for chip making as compared to 45 % with conventional methods. From face milling a JIS S 45 C steel bar, the exponent n {{is found to be}} 0. 35. This value is satisfactory when compared with the value obtained by using the conventional method. Using these techniques a subsequent investigation was conducted using JIS S 12 C. Materials' properties were varied by changing the chemical composition and heat treatment. After the test runs, the following conclusions were reached : 1) A small workpiece diameter (up to 2. 5 cm) can be used without altering resutlts. It should be noted that homogeneous properties of the workpiece remain essential. 2) There is little change in chip thickness, when a 5. 5 cm diameter workpiece is cut with 25 cm milling cutter, since the centers of the two elements coincide. 3) Wear pattern on the tool face is rectangular in form, and the repeatability of the wear progress is very high. We conclude that error in measuring the wearland is small, even when observed by different operators. 4) A graph of cutting time vs. wearland is a straight line; on running several tests under identical conditions, the VT curve is similar, even though a wearland of 0. 2 mm or 0. 3 mm is chosen as the tool life criterion. The employment of a small workpiece does provide a VT curve and analysis is possible. 5) Besides machinability evaluation of a material, this method is also appropriate to study tool chipping and tool wear...|$|E
