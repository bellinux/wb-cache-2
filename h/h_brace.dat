5000|$|Emeco’s {{engineering}} team {{worked for}} 4 years to create a material made of recycled PET plastic that is made into pellets. Those pellets are mixed with glass fiber and color pigment. [...] Each chair starts out as six kilograms of plastic pellets that are melted down and then injection-molded {{into the shape of}} the 1006 Navy Chair. Craftsmen add the <b>H</b> <b>brace</b> to make the chair sturdier and they smooth out any imperfections that result from injection moulding.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Boxer" [...] is {{supposedly}} {{derived from the}} breed's tendency to play by standing {{on its hind legs}} and [...] "boxing" [...] with its front paws. According to Andrew <b>H.</b> <b>Brace's</b> Pet owner's guide to the Boxer, this theory is the least plausible explanation. He claims [...] "it's unlikely that a nation so permeated with nationalism would give to one of its most famous breeds a name so obviously anglicised".|$|R
3000|$|Given {{a desired}} {{fundamental}} frequency, construct a brace-plate system {{as described by}} a mass matrix M and a stiffness matrix K. All dimensional (geometric) properties of the brace-plate system {{are assumed to be}} specified and fixed except for the thickness of the <b>brace</b> <b>h</b> [...]...|$|R
40|$|New {{constructions of}} braces on finite {{nilpotent}} groups are given and hence {{this leads to}} new solutions of the Yang–Baxter equation. In particular, it follows that if a group G of odd order is nilpotent of class three, then it is a homomorphic image of the multiplicative group of a finite left brace (i. e. an involutive Yang–Baxter group) which also is a nilpotent group of class three. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary group H to be the multiplicative group of a left brace such that [H, H] ⊆ Soc(H) and H/[H, H] is a standard abelian brace, where Soc(H) denotes the socle of the <b>brace</b> <b>H...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{mean value}} of (∆ 0.8) was {{evaluated}} as 80.90 and 73.89  mm, respectively (Tables  5, 6), under monotonic loading of samples H with lateral and bilateral braces and 78.90 and 76.27  mm, respectively (Tables  7, 8), under cyclic loading. The presence of bilateral brace {{on the wall}} causes about 6  % reduction on its maximum displacement compared to lateral brace samples. The mean value of ductility was evaluated as 3.16 and 3.22, respectively (Tables  5, 6), under monotonic loading of samples H with lateral and bilateral braces and 3.35 and 3.49, respectively, (Tables  7, 8) under cyclic loading. To calculate (R d) from Eq. (3) for wall with lateral brace, a mean value of ductility equal to 3.26 was used {{and the value of}} R d was evaluated as 2.35. Since the value of (S y/S yp) is less than 1, there is no additional resistance; thus the value of (R 0) is considered equal to 1. Finally, the value of the response modification factor was obtained as 2.35 (Table  9). To calculate the value of (R d) for wall with bilateral brace, a mean value of ductility equal to 3.36 was used and the value of R d was equal to 2.39. Since the value of (S y/S yp) is less than 1, there is no additional resistance; thus the value of (R 0) is considered equal to 1. Finally, the value of the response modification factor was obtained as 2.39 for sample <b>H</b> with bilateral <b>brace</b> (Table  9). If the bilateral brace is used for sample H, the value of the response modification factor will be about 1.70  % more than that of the lateral brace. This small difference can result from the lack of additional resistance in samples.|$|R
