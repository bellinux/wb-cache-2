5|$|The book's initial {{critical}} reception was modest, but it {{was popular}} with the public {{and has never been}} out of print. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> publication the book's reputation has grown; it is generally considered one of Waugh's best works, and has more than once figured on unofficial lists of the 20th century's best novels.|$|E

5|$|About 300to 250million years ago, the Allegheny Plateau, Allegheny Front, and Appalachian Mountains all {{formed in}} the Alleghanian orogeny. This {{happened}} long after the sedimentary rocks in the park were deposited, when the part of Gondwana that became Africa collided with what became North America, forming Pangaea. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> up to 5,000feet (1,500m) of rock has been eroded away by streams and weather. At least three major glaciations in the past million years have been the final factor in shaping the land that makes up the park today.|$|E
5|$|After April's failed {{wedding to}} Matthew, Callie and Arizona {{bought a house}} together, a fresh start, away from the {{memories}} of their apartment. They later decided to try again for a second child. However, {{a trip to the}} OB/GYN led to the discovery that Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Sofia's birth, meaning she could not carry any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple.|$|E
5|$|Baker's {{work has}} {{achieved}} cult status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published.

Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.|$|E

5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to {{the erosion of the}} highway's shoulders. In mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional importance as a through route for commuters traveling to and from the village of Malone.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's {{recordings}} {{were released}} on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 {{recording of the}} Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings {{were out of the}} catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E

5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot in the lineup was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Greene's retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> {{the film}} has {{generated}} significant academic attention with regard to its thematic symbolism, and is now widely {{regarded as one of}} Lynch's major works and one of the greatest films of the 1980s. Publications including Sight & Sound, Time, Entertainment Weekly and BBC Magazine have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time. In 2008, Blue Velvet was chosen by the American Film Institute {{as one of the greatest}} American mystery films ever made.|$|E
5|$|NY370 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York as a Red Creek–Liverpool highway, replacing NY40 west of Cato and New York State Route37 from Cato to Baldwinsville. From Liverpool to Syracuse, modern NY370 was initially part of NY57, a route that continued north from Liverpool to Oswego. That route was eliminated in 1982, at which time NY370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY57's former routing. Other minor changes, namely a series of realignments west of Victory, have also occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> NY370 {{was assigned}}.|$|E
5|$|The San Francisco Citizens' Committee {{wished to}} issue a {{commemorative}} coin as a fundraiser for {{a celebration of the}} statehood diamond jubilee. A California congressman attached authorization for it to another coinage bill, which was approved by Congress in early 1925. Designs by sculptor Jo Mora met a hostile reception at the Commission of Fine Arts, but the Citizens' Committee would not change them, and they were approved. The coin has been widely praised for its beauty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Grameen {{bank has}} {{developed}} and expanded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> its beginning, {{it continues to}} operate on those same two principles. Today, Grameen bank still assumes that when individuals are provided credit, {{they will be able}} to initiate upward social mobility for themselves through entrepreneurial endeavours. As a result, Grameen differs from many other social justice efforts in that it does not include intensive rehabilitation training programs for the disadvantaged persons it serves. Instead, Grameen gives its borrowers freedom to pursue a better future using the skills they already possess in the best way they can with membership in a five-person support group being the only requirement.|$|E
5|$|Bitterman et al. in 1986 and 1995 {{showed that}} {{darkness}} and caffeine would delay {{the onset of}} changes to brain electrical activity in rats. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since,</b> research on central nervous system toxicity has centred on methods of prevention and safe extension of tolerance. Sensitivity to central nervous system oxygen toxicity {{has been shown to}} be affected by factors such as circadian rhythm, drugs, age, and gender. In 1988, Hamilton et al. wrote procedures for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to establish oxygen exposure limits for habitat operations. Even today, models for the prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity do not explain all the results of exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli {{agreed to}} Wood's {{proposed}} changes, {{but before he}} could set to work there were more legal complications. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> Thunderball, Kevin McClory had set up two film companies and was trying to make a new Bond film in collaboration with Sean Connery and novelist Len Deighton. McClory got wind of Broccoli's plans to use SPECTRE, an organisation that had first been created by Fleming while working with McClory and Jack Whittingham on the very first attempt to film Thunderball, back even before it was a novel, in the late 1950s. McClory threatened to sue Broccoli for alleged copyright infringement, claiming that he had the sole right to include SPECTRE and its agents in all films. Not wishing to extend the already ongoing legal dispute that could have delayed the production of The Spy Who Loved Me, Broccoli requested Wood remove all references to Blofeld and SPECTRE from the script.|$|E
