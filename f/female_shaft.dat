5000|$|The Talmud {{describes}} arrow {{heads and}} mating shafts as potentially being either male or female, {{depending on their}} construction, i.e. a prong on a male arrow head fits into a hollowed out shaft and vice versa. This is owing to a prohibition on a <b>female</b> <b>shaft,</b> from its susceptibility as a receptacle for impurity, for use as s'chach ...|$|E
40|$|A {{torque meter}} {{comprising}} hollow-keyed, {{input and output}} <b>female</b> <b>shafts</b> adapted to receive the male shafts of the power source and machine respectively. Each shaft has a circular flange whose face is perpendicular to the center line of the shafts. Each flange has a plurality of equally spaced cylindrical recesses machined into the inside face thereto adapted to receive conical inserts therein. Balls are contained by the conical inserts and transmit the rotational movement from the input to the output shaft. A stationary housing extends around the input and output shaft and has a transducer shell secured thereto. When {{force is applied to}} the input shaft to cause movement, the balls encounter torsional resistance which causes the balls to roll up the ramps of the conical seat inserts to separate the two torque flanges. The force transmitted through the balls causes rotation to the output shaft and produces tension to the stationary transducer shell. The stationary transducer shell is instrumented with semi-conductor strain gauges...|$|R
25|$|In {{the greater}} short-nosed fruit bat, {{copulation}} by males is dorsoventral and the <b>females</b> lick the <b>shaft</b> or {{the base of}} the male's penis, but not the glans, which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed.|$|R
5000|$|Oral sex: Several species {{engage in}} both autofellatio and oral sex. This has been {{documented}} in brown bears, Tibetan macaques, wolves, goats, primates, hyenas, bats, cape ground squirrels and sheep. In the greater short-nosed fruit bat, copulation by males is dorsoventral and the <b>females</b> lick the <b>shaft</b> or {{the base of the}} male's penis, but not the glans which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{differentiation}} {{starts on}} the internal sex organs at about 5 weeks of gestation, resulting {{in the formation of}} either testes in males, or ovaries in females. If testes are formed, they begin to secrete androgens that affect the external genital development at about week 8 or 9 of gestation. The urogenital folds form the labia minora in <b>females,</b> or penile <b>shaft</b> in males. The labioscrotal swellings become the labia majora and mons pubis in females, or fuse to become the scrotum in males. Because the male and female parts develop from the same tissues, this makes them homologous (different versions of the same structure). Sexual differentiation is complete at around 12 weeks of gestation.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} gregarious, and {{typically}} roosts in same sex groups of 8-9 individuals. The sexes remain separate until the mating season, when group size increases. They are polygynous {{and it is}} usual for 6-10 males and 10-15 females to share palm frond tents during the breeding season. C. sphinx is the only non-primate species known to show fellatio, which enhances copulation time in the species. Copulation by males is dorsoventral and the <b>females</b> lick the <b>shaft</b> or {{the base of the}} male's penis, but not the glans which has already penetrated the vagina. While the females do this, the penis is not withdrawn and research has shown a positive relationship between length of the time that the penis is licked and the duration of copulation. Post copulation genital grooming has also been observed. Males stay with females for some time after mating, but later return to same sex groups.|$|R
40|$|A {{morphological}} and morphometric comparison using {{light microscopy}} and {{scanning electron microscopy}} was made of six populations of Meloidogyne javanica belonging to three host races (infective on pepper, peanut, or noninfective on both). The variability of certain morphological characters was studied within these populations, and the reliability of these taxonomic traits was evaluated for usefulness in species identification. The most useful diagnostic characters of M. javanica were head and stylet morphology of males and stylet morphology and perineal patterns of females. Males have an offset head region, usually lacking annulations, and a distinct, narrow head cap with slightly raised labial disc. The stylet has a cone markedly wider than the shaft at the junction and large, transversely ovoid knobs that are offset from the <b>shaft.</b> <b>Females</b> have a robust stylet with a dorsally curved cone and large, transversely ovoid knobs. Perineal patterns are oval to squarish in shape, usually with coarse, broken striae and with conspicuous lateral lines. The host races could not be differentiated on a morphological basis...|$|R
5000|$|Adults have a {{relatively}} short tail with the two central (deck) feathers being square-tipped and somewhat longer than their lighter, outer tail feathers giving the bird its distinctive name. The plumage is mottled dark and light browns against a white background, they are lighter on the underparts with a white belly uniformly covered in faint [...] "V"-shaped markings. These markings distinguish sharp-tailed grouse from lesser and greater prairie chickens which are heavily barred on their underparts(Connelly et al. 1998). Adult males have a yellow comb over their eyes and a violet display patch on their neck. This display patch is another distinguishing characteristic from prairie chickens as male prairie chickens have yellow or orange colored air sacs(Connelly et al. 1998). The female is smaller than the male and can be distinguished by the regular horizontal markings across the deck feathers {{as opposed to the}} irregular markings on the males deck feathers which run parallel to the feather <b>shaft.</b> <b>Females</b> also tend to have less obvious combs. Males weigh an average of 33.5 oz (951 g) and females average 29 oz (815 g).|$|R
5000|$|The heavy, lower {{piece of}} the cue is the cue butt, and the smaller, {{narrower}} end is the shaft. The two cue pieces are attached at the joint; normally a screw rising from butt end's joint (male) is threaded into a receptacle on the <b>shaft</b> (<b>female),</b> or vice versa. The joints are made of various materials, most frequently a plastic, brass, stainless steel, or wood outer layer, but some custom cues are made of bone, antlers, or other more expensive materials that are less common, but serve the same effect. Most snooker cues have brass-to-brass joints. The internal male and female connection points are almost always brass or steel because they respond less to temperature changes and thus expand and contract less than other materials, preserving {{the life of the}} cue. Joints have different sizes as well as different male and female ends on the shaft and butts of the cues. Traditional designs employ a fully threaded connection, while newer versions (marketed under such names as Uni-loc, Accu-loc, Speed-loc, and Tru-loc) employ half-threaded [...] "quick pin release" [...] connections that allow players to assemble and disassemble their cues faster.|$|R
40|$|Impaired {{fracture}} {{healing in}} aged females {{is still a}} challenge in clinics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in fracture healing. This study aims to identify the miRNAs that potentially contribute to the impaired fracture healing in aged <b>females.</b> Transverse femoral <b>shaft</b> fractures were created in adult and aged female mice. At post-fracture 0 -, 2 - and 4 -week, the fracture sites were scanned by micro computed tomography {{to confirm that the}} fracture healing was impaired in aged female mice and the fracture calluses were collected for miRNA microarray analysis. A total of 53 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs and 5438 miRNA-target gene interactions involved in bone fracture healing were identified. A novel scoring system was designed to analyze the miRNA contribution to impaired fracture healing (RCIFH). Using this method, 11 novel miRNAs were identified to impair fracture healing at 2 - or 4 -week post-fracture. Thereafter, function analysis of target genes was performed for miRNAs with high RCIFH values. The results showed that high RCIFH miRNAs in aged female mice might impair fracture healing not only by down-regulating angiogenesis-, chondrogenesis-, and osteogenesis-related pathways, but also by up-regulating osteoclastogenesis-related pathway, which implied the essential roles of these high RCIFH miRNAs in impaired fracture healing in aged females, and might promote the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies...|$|R
5000|$|Austrolestes colensonis were {{observed}} at two different sites of variant elevations in New Zealand; {{they were found}} to have a two-year life cycle. [...] Some eggs hatched directly the summer that they were laid while others overwinter and hatch the following spring. Deacon stated that organisms that form the height of the spring hatch are well developed embryos that can push through the winter in a state of quiescence.Temperature was the major influence that regulated the rate of development; any temperature near or below the threshold inhibited early embryonic development and eventually caused death to the embryo. Eggs can be hatched in about 20-21 days at 20 degrees Celsius, in others the developed embryo forms the overwintering stage. Before emergence, the nymphal darkens until it is near black. Rowe (1987) found that the nymphs may take several short trips from the water a few days before emergence, which takes place on rush stalks 10-40 cm above the water line. It is common for there to be a high rate of mortality due to the moulting adult losing its grip on the substrate and ending up in a body of water where it can drown. [...] Emergence occurs during the day from the months of October to February, with the majority bursting around January but adults can be found at late as May in Dunedin and in early June in Northland. After emergence and maiden flight, young adults mature sexually for several days; during this time there can be quite a high number of dispersals. Once males reach maturity they venture out to find habitats suitable for breeding and to set their territories where they stay motionless on their established porch for extended periods of time until they are bothered by an intruder. Early afternoons, the height of reproductive activity, you will see males go chasing after females that fly through their territory. Rowe (1987) explains that oviposition generally occurs in tandem; the pair land on a floating piece of vegetation and the <b>female</b> drives a <b>shaft</b> through the stem and into the pith. She then lays 6-9 eggs, taking up to a minute. This is repeated and eggs are laid out either in close batches or spaced between one another. Once the nymphs are hatched they begin to search for water so they can moult and release the second larval instar (about 2.3 mm long). These nymphs are quite active swimmers; once they reach a later stage they roam about on the surface of detritus and vegetation on the bottom of ponds.|$|R
