50|$|In {{amorphous}} silica (fused quartz), the SiO4 tetrahedra form {{a network that}} does not exhibit any long-range order.

50|$|The glass {{transition}} of a liquid to a solid-like state may occur with either cooling or compression. The transition comprises a smooth {{increase in the}} viscosity of a material {{by as much as}} 17 orders of magnitude within a temperature range of 500 K without any pronounced change in material structure. The consequence of this dramatic increase is a glass exhibiting solid-like mechanical properties on the timescale of practical observation. This transition is in contrast to the freezing or crystallization transition, which is a first-order phase transition in the Ehrenfest classification and involves discontinuities in thermodynamic and dynamic properties such as volume, energy, and viscosity. In many materials that normally undergo a freezing transition, rapid cooling will avoid this phase transition and instead result in a {{glass transition}} at some lower temperature. Other materials, such as many polymers, lack a well defined crystalline state and easily form glasses, even upon very slow cooling or compression. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass <b>forming</b> <b>ability.</b> This ability depends on the composition of the material and can be predicted by the rigidity theory.|$|E

30|$|Various {{bacteria}} (gram {{positive and}} negative) possess ice nucleating activity (Failor et al. 2017). Certain strains of Pseudomonas syringae (plant pathogens) appear particularly effective, allowing freezing at even comparatively high temperatures (above – 10  °C) (Maki et al. 1974; Cochet and Widehem 2000). Pseudomonas bacteria were proposed {{as a natural}} source of atmospheric ice nucleation that might be harnessed to seed rain (Maki et al. 1974), before they were detected in natural clouds (Joly et al. 2013). Much remains unknown about how such bacteria influence the water-cycle, {{but we know that}} their abundances and their ice <b>forming</b> <b>abilities</b> vary among vegetation types, for example being less abundant on conifer trees than most angiosperm species (Lindow et al. 1978).

Such mechanisms are restricted to regions where frosts occur and are likely less important in warmer regions. These leaf dwelling prokaryotes may be important determinants of precipitation at mid-latitudes. The ‘bioprecipitation hypothesis’ proposes a cycle in which Pseudomonas and other micro-organisms are lifted off leaves and other surfaces by air currents and promote freezing in clouds, resulting in increased precipitation within the region. This precipitation disperses the microbes and provides the moist conditions both they and their host plants need to grow—thus increasing their prevalence (Morris et al. 2014).|$|R

Viability assays showed AI-10-49 has an IC50 of 0.6µM. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that AI-10-49 has half-life of 380 minutes in mouse plasma. AI-10-49 prolonged the survival of mice transplanted with CBFβ-SMHHC leukemic cells without any signs of toxicity.

5000|$|The glass <b>forming</b> <b>ability</b> of gallium(III) sulfide and {{lanthanum}} sulfide {{was discovered}} in 1976 by Loireau-Lozac’h, Guittard, and Flahut. [...] This family of chalcogenide glasses, referred to as gallium lanthanum sulfide (Ga-La-S) glasses, have a wide region of glass formation centred about the 70Ga2S3:30La2S3 composition and can readily accept other modifiers into their structure. This means that Ga-La-S can be compositionally adjusted to give {{a wide variety of}} optical and physical properties. Optically, Ga-La-S has a high refractive index, a transmission window covering most of the visible wavelengths and extending to about 10 µm and a low maximum phonon energy, approx. 450 cm−1. Thermally, the refractive index of Ga-La-S glasses has a strong temperature dependence and low thermal conductivity, which results in strong thermal lensing. However, the high glass transition temperature of Ga-La-S makes it resistant to thermal damage, it has good chemical durability and unlike many chalcogenides which are based on arsenic, its glass components are non-toxic. A clear advantage over other chalcogenides is its high lanthanum content which allows excellent rare-earth solubility and dispersion of the ions in the glass matrix for active devices. Ga-La-S can exist in both glassy and crystalline phases, in a glassy phase, it is a semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.6 eV corresponding to a wavelength of 475 nm; consequently Ga-La-S glass takes a deep orange colour. As with all chalcogenides the phase of the bulk is determined by two key factors; the material composition and {{the rate at which the}} molten material is cooled. These variables can be controlled to manipulate the final phase of the material.|$|E
