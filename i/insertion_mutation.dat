40|$|An {{expression}} vector utilizing the enhancer and promoter {{region of the}} simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA regulating a murine p 53 cDNA clone was constructed. The vector produced murine p 53 protein in monkey cells identified by five different monoclonal antibodies, three of which were specific for the murine form of p 53. The murine p 53 produced in monkey cells formed an oligomeric protein complex with the SV 40 large tumor antigen. A large number of deletion <b>mutations,</b> in-frame linker <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations,</b> and linker <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> resulting in a frameshift mutation were constructed in the cDNA coding portion of the p 53 protein {{expression vector}}. The wild-type and mutant p 53 cDNA vectors were expressed in monkey cells producing the SV 40 large T antigen. The conformation and levels of p 53 protein {{and its ability to}} form protein complexes with the SV 40 T antigen were determined by using five different monoclonal antibodies with quite distinct epitope recognition sites. <b>Insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> between amino acid residues 123 and 215 (of a total of 390 amino acids) eliminated the ability of murine p 53 to bind to the SV 40 large T antigen. Deletion (at amino acids 11 through 33) and <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> (amino acids 222 through 344) located on either side of this T-antigen-binding protein domain produced a murine p 53 protein that bound to the SV 40 large T antigen. The same five <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> that failed to bind with the SV 40 large T antigen also failed to react with a specific monoclonal antibody, PAb 246. In contrast, six additional deletion and <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> that produced p 53 protein that did bind with T antigen were each recognized by PAb 246. The proposed epitope for PAb 246 has been mapped adjacent (amino acids 88 through 109) to the T-antigen-binding domain (amino acids 123 through 215) localized by the mutations mapped in this study. Finally, some <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> that produced a protein that failed to bind to the SV 40 T antigen appeared to have an enhanced ability to complex with a 68 -kilodalton cellular protein in monkey cells...|$|R
50|$|AD is an {{autosomal}} recessive spondylometaepiphyseal dysplasia typically {{characterized by an}} early (prenatal) onset of extremely short stature and adults that do not typically exceed 85 cm in height. A less than normal amount of teeth and slight mental retardation are also typical of AD. The associated mutation(s) are a homozygous <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> and two compound heterozygous mutations.

50|$|The planar {{structure}} of chemicals such as ethidium bromide and proflavine {{allows them to}} insert between bases in DNA. This insert causes the DNA's backbone to stretch and makes slippage in DNA during replication {{more likely to occur}} since the bonding between the strands is made less stable by the stretching. Forward slippage will result in deletion mutation, while reverse slippage will result in an <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation.</b> Also, the intercalation into DNA of anthracyclines such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin interferes with the functioning of the enzyme topoisomerase II, blocking replication as well as causing mitotic homologous recombination.|$|E

Currently, no deletion or duplication mutations have been detected in such disorders. Interestingly, though ectodermal dysplasia disorders result from heterozygous mutations in TP63, compromised epidermal differentiation with epidermal decay is representative of Hay-Wells patients but is hardly observed in other syndromes. In contrast, severe abnormalities characteristic of other ectodermal dysplasia disorders (i.e. limb abnormalities in EEC) are not seen in Hay-Wells patients.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-four of over 24, 000 {{patients}} genotyped {{over the}} past 3 years {{were found to have}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) isolates that possess an insert in the protease gene. In this report, we evaluated the spectrum of protease gene <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> in patient isolates and analyzed the effect of these various <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> on viral phenotypes. The inserts were composed of 1, 2, 5, or 6 amino acids that mapped at or between codons 35 and 38, 17 and 18, 21 and 25, or 95 and 96. Reduced susceptibility to protease inhibitors was found in isolates which possess previously reported drug resistance mutations. Fitness assays, including replication and competition experiments, showed that most of the isolates with inserts grew somewhat better than their counterparts with a deletion of the insert. These experiments demonstrate that, rarely, <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> can develop in the HIV type 1 protease gene, are no more resistant than any other sequences which have similar associated resistance mutations, and can provide a borderline advantage in replication...|$|R
5000|$|In genetics, an {{insertion}} (also {{called an}} <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation)</b> is {{the addition of}} one or more nucleotide base pairs into a DNA sequence. This can often happen in Microsatellite regions due to the [...] DNA polymerase slippage. Insertions can be anywhere in size from one base pair incorrectly inserted into a DNA sequence to a section of one chromosome inserted into another. The merchandise of the smallest singlehandedly base insertion mutations is believed to be through case-pair separation between the template and primer strands hollowed by non-neighbor base stacking, which can occur locally within the DNA polymerase active site. On a chromosome level, an insertion refers to the insertion of a larger sequence into a chromosome. This can happen due to unequal crossover during meiosis.|$|E
50|$|A three-generation {{family is}} known in which two half-brothers were {{diagnosed}} with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). The two boys, diagnosed at 2 months and 17 months of age, had a germline <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> in exon 4 of the INI1 gene that was inherited from their healthy mother. A maternal uncle died in childhood from a brain tumor and a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney. The identification of two unaffected carriers in a family segregating a germline mutation and rhabdoid tumor supports the hypothesis {{that there may be}} variable risks of development of rhabdoid tumor {{in the context of a}} germline mutation. There may be a developmental window in which most rhabdoid tumors occur. This family highlights the importance of mutation analysis in all patients with a suspected rhabdoid tumor.|$|E
5000|$|Transposon {{sequencing}} {{requires the}} creation of a transposon insertion library, which will contain a group of mutants that collectively have transposon insertions in all non-essential genes. The library is grown under the condition that is of interest. Mutants with transposons inserted in genes required for growth under the test condition will diminish in frequency from the population. To identify genes being lost, sequences encompassing the transposon ends are amplified by PCR and sequenced by MPS to determine the location and abundance of each <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation.</b> The importance of each gene for growth under the test condition is determined by comparing the abundance of each mutant before and after growth under the condition being examined.

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method for}} introducing two codons into a cloned gene {{has been applied}} to studying functional regions of the pBR 322 -encoded tetracycline-resistance gene and beta-lactamase (ampicillin-resistance) gene. Single-stranded hexameric linkers are inserted into a preexisting cohesive end restriction site to create a new (six-base recognition) restriction site. <b>Insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> are enriched by using biochemical selection or are selected by using a kanamycin-resistance cassette (biological selection). Phenotypes of <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> isolated in the tetracycline-resistance gene support the hypothesis that it is comprised of two domains connected by a central hinge.

40|$|A {{total of}} 399 {{independent}} mutants of Escherichia coli were obtained which have point and <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the glnA region. Mutants isolated included Gln- and Reg- strains (unable to utilize arginine as a nitrogen source). Mutations were mapped with 73 deletion-containing derivatives of a lambda gln phage. Complementation {{analysis was performed}} with lambda gln derivatives containing point mutations which conferred a Gln- or Reg- phenotype. Deletion mapping and complementation analysis assigned 104 mutations in 24 deletion intervals to glnA. Mutations in Reg- strains were assigned to two genes, glnL and glnG. glnL contained 131 mutations in 12 deletion intervals, and glnG contained 164 mutations in 10 deletion intervals. The gene order is glnA-glnL-glnG, transcribed from left to right. Polarity of <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> indicates that glnL and glnG form from left to right. Polarity of <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> indicates that glnL and glnG form an operon. Complementation analysis of glnA <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> with glnL and glnG mutations showed polarity of glnA onto most glnL and glnG alleles, suggesting that transcription of glnA may proceed into the glnL-glnG operon. All mutations analyzed in glnA conferred a Gln- phenotype. However, {{we also found that}} over half of the Gln- strains isolated ater chemical mutagenesis contained point mutations in glnG. Mutants which synthesized a high level of glutamine synthetase in the presence of ammonia (GlnC phenotype) were selected as revertants of a strain with a Tn 10 insertion in glnD and were mapped with chromosomal deletions. Results indicate that mutations in 12 and 15 examined strains clearly map outside of glnA, probably in glnL...|$|R

5000|$|The {{problem of}} {{character}} coding {{is very different}} in molecular analyses, as the characters in biological sequence data are immediate and discretely defined - distinct nucleotides in DNA or RNA sequences and distinct amino acids in protein sequences. However, defining homology can be challenging due to the inherent difficulties of multiple sequence alignment. For a given gapped MSA, several rooted phylogenetic trees can be constructed that vary in their interpretations of which changes are [...] "mutations" [...] versus ancestral characters, and which events are insertion mutations or deletion mutations. For example, given only a pairwise alignment with a gap region, {{it is impossible to}} determine whether one sequence bears an <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> or the other carries a deletion. The problem is magnified in MSAs with unaligned and nonoverlapping gaps. In practice, sizable regions of a calculated alignment may be discounted in phylogenetic tree construction to avoid integrating noisy data into the tree calculation.|$|E

The mechanism of how PRRT2 causes PKD still requires further investigation.

40|$|Mutations {{previously}} designated prlD {{were described}} that suppressed malE signal sequence mutations and {{were located in}} the vicinity of the secA gene on the Escherichia coli chromosome. In this study, we demonstrated that four such independently isolated prlD mutations represented three unique single-base substitutions in secA, resulting in alterations at residues 111, 373, and 488 of the 901 -residue SecA protein. Heretofore, the only mutations that had been described for secA were located early in the gene and resulted in a general protein export defect. <b>Insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the cloned gene X-secA operon that reduced or eliminated suppression by a prlD mutation also have been obtained.

The recO 1504 ::Tn 5 mutation decreased the frequency of recombination during Hfr-mediated crosses and increased the susceptibility to killing by UV irradiation and mitomycin C when present in a recB recC sbcB background, but only increased the sensitivity to killing by UV irradiation when present in an otherwise Rec+ background. The effects of these and other RecF pathway mutations on plasmid recombination were tested. Mutations in the recJ, recO, and ssb genes, when present in otherwise Rec+ E. coli strains, decreased the frequency of plasmid recombination, whereas the lexA 3, recAo 281, recN, and ruv mutations had no effect on plasmid recombination. Tn 5 <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the lexA gene increased the frequency of plasmid recombination. These data indicate that plasmid recombination events in wild-type Escherichia coli strains are catalyzed by a recombination pathway that is related to the RecF recombination pathway and that some component of this pathway besides the recA gene product is regulated by the lexA gene product...|$|R

40|$|P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is encoded by the ABCB 1 {{gene and}} {{acts as an}} efflux pump for xenobiotics. In the Border Collie, a {{nonsense}} mutation caused by a 4 -base pair deletion in the ABCB 1 gene {{is associated with a}} premature stop to P-gp synthesis. In this study, we examined the fulllength coding sequence of the ABCB 1 gene in an ivermectinsensitive Border Collie that lacked the aforementioned deletion mutation. The sequence was compared to the corresponding sequences of a wild-type Beagle and seven ivermectin-tolerant family members of the Border Collie. When compared to the wild-type Beagle sequence, that of the ivermectin-sensitive Border Collie was found to have one <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding sequence of the ABCB 1 gene. While the eight SNPs were also found in the family members ’ sequences, the <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> was found only in the ivermectin-sensitive dog. These results suggest the possibility that the SNPs are species-specific features of the ABCB 1 gene in Border Collies, and that the <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> may be related to ivermectin intolerance...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{purified}} Escherichia coli RNA polymerase {{contains a}} small subunit termed omega. This subunit consists of 91 amino acids with a molecular weight of 10, 105. We previously reported the cloning and sequencing {{of the gene}} encoding omega, which we call rpoZ (D. R. Gentry and R. R. Burgess, Gene 48 : 33 - 40, 1986). We constructed an rpoZ <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> by placing a kanamycin resistance cassette into the coding region of the rpoZ gene. Purified RNA polymerase from strains carrying this mutation lacked detectable omega. We found that the <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> conferred a slow-growth phenotype when introduced into most strains. We mapped the position of rpoZ on the E. coli chromosome by genetic techniques and by examining the restriction map of the whole chromosome and found that rpoZ maps around 82 min, very close to spoT. We determined that the slow-growth phenotype of the insertion mutant is suppressed in relA mutants and that the rpoZ insertion results in a classical SpoT- phenotype. This finding strongly suggests that rpoZ is upstream of spoT in the same operon and that the slow-growth phenotype elicited by the <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> is due to polarity on spoT...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied a}} 15 -year-old girl, patient X, who has {{maintained}} consistently low plasma loads of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) RNA, as well as normal and stable CD 4 + T-cell concentrations. She has presented no clinical manifestations of AIDS, despite having only received zidovudine monotherapy for {{a part of her}} life. Patient X's HIV-positive mother (patient Y) has also not progressed to AIDS and has never been treated with antiretroviral agents. HIV- 1 isolated from patient X replicated poorly in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In order to map the determinant of the poor growth of patient X's isolate, viral sequences from patient X were determined and examined for insertion or deletion mutations. These sequences contained a two-amino-acid <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> in the Vif gene, which was also observed in uncultured PBMC acquired at different times. Furthermore, Vif sequences harbored by patient Y contained the identical mutation. These observations suggest that polymorphic HIV- 1 was transmitted to patient X perinatally 15 years previously and has been maintained since that time. Recombinant HIV- 1, engineered with Vif sequences from patient X, replicated in PBMC to levels approximately 20 -fold lower than that of wild type. Removal of the <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> from this recombinant restored replication efficiency to wild-type levels, while introduction of the <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> into wild-type Vif sequences resulted in greatly decreased replication. Furthermore, Vif protein from patient X's HIV- 1 was aberrantly cleaved, suggesting a mechanism for loss of Vif function. Since HIV- 1 containing these sequences replicates poorly, the implication is that the two-amino-acid <b>insertion</b> <b>mutation</b> in Vif contributes significantly to the nonprogressor status of this mother and child. Further studies of these sequences might provide information regarding contributions of Vif structure and/or function to HIV- 1 virulence...|$|E

Representatives of several LacI mutant classes were recovered, including mutants which exhibit fully active, inducer-insensitive, or weak dominant-negative phenotypes. The various properties of the recovered mutants agree with previous biophysical, biochemical, and genetic data for the protein. In particular, the results support the prior designation of mutationally tolerant spacer regions of LacI as well as proposed differences in dimerization interactions among regions of the protein core domain. These {{findings suggest that the}} analysis of 31 -codon <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> may provide a simple approach for characterizing structure-function relationships in proteins for which high-resolution structures are not available...|$|R
40|$|Changes in histone {{gene dosage}} {{as well as}} {{mutations}} within some histone genes suppress δ <b>insertion</b> <b>mutations</b> in the HIS 4 and LYS 2 loci of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by altering the site of transcription initiation.
