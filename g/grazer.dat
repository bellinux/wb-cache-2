40|$|We analyse {{a simple}} {{plankton}} system {{to provide a}} heuristic for more complex models such as Dynamic Green Ocean Models (DGOMs). Zooplankton foraging is either by generalist <b>grazers</b> that consume whatever they bump into or specialist <b>grazers</b> that actively seek particular prey. The zooplankton may further be classified as either facultative <b>grazers</b> that can survive on any of their prey or obligate <b>grazers</b> that depend {{on the presence of}} specific prey. A key result is that different prey dependencies can result in dramatically different impacts of grazing strategies on system outcomes. The grazing strategy can determine whether a system with obligate <b>grazers</b> will be stable, have regular, predictable cycles or be chaotic. Conversely, whether facultative zooplankton functioned as specialist or generalist <b>grazers</b> makes no qualitative difference to the dynamics of the system. These results demonstrate that the effect of different grazing strategies can be critically dependent on the <b>grazer’s</b> dependency on specific prey. Great care must be taken when choosing functional forms for population interactions in DGOMs, particularly in scenarios such as climate change where parameters such as mortality and growth coefficients may change. A robust theoretical framework supporting model development and analysis is key to understanding how such choices can affect model properties and hence predictions...|$|R

40|$|Forage {{intake and}} feeding {{behaviour}} of cattle grazing during day and/or night was studied in Sadore between February and May (late dry season) 1995 and, in Toukounous, Niger, between July 1995 and May 1996, covering wet (WS), early dry (EDS) and late dry (LDS) seasons. In Sadore, 24 steers grazed from 09. 00 to 19. 00 h (day <b>grazers),</b> from 21. 00 to 07. 00 h (night <b>grazers)</b> or from 09. 00 to 19. 00 h and from 24. 00 to 04. 00 h (day and night <b>grazers).</b> In the trials in Toukounous, 64 steers were allotted to 8 treatments (T). Grazing {{time during the}} day was for 6 h for T 1, 2 and 3; 9 h for T 4, 5 and 6; 12 h for T 7 and 8. Night grazing time was 0 h for T 1, 4 and 7; 3 h for T 2, 5 and 8; and 6 h for T 3 and 6. Feeding activities were observed every 5 min in Sadore. In both studies, forage intake was determined from individual data on faecal output and mean of extrusa in vitro organic matter digestibility. In Sadore, the actual grazing time was 352, 376 and 476 min/day (SEM = 16) for day, night, and day and night <b>grazers,</b> respectively. Night <b>grazers</b> spent less (P 0. 05) time ruminating and walking than day <b>grazers.</b> Day and night <b>grazers</b> had a higher forage intake than either day or night <b>grazers.</b> In Toukounous, day and night <b>grazers</b> (T 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8) also consumed more forage than day <b>grazers</b> (T 1, 4 and 7) in all seasons. Forage intake increased {{with an increase in}} total duration of grazing, while it declined as the season progressed from wet to dry.

40|$|<b>Grazers</b> affect prey {{abundance}} negatively through grazing {{and positively}} through releasing nutrients and sub-strates. In the present study, {{the relative importance}} of these positive and negative effects of <b>grazers</b> on bacterial abundance was examined seasonally at 2. 5 m and 30 m depths in Lake Biwa. We used a method by Elser and Goldman to estimate in situ growth rate, grazing rate, and the fraction of growth rate that was stimulated by <b>grazers</b> smaller than 100 mm. At 2. 5 m, the bacterial grazing rate showed clear seasonal changes with higher values in summer. At 30 m, bacterial grazing was significant but consistently low throughout the year. The fraction of the growth rate stimulated by <b>grazers</b> was changed with season and depth. At 2. 5 m, bacteria compensated 30 – 40 % of grazing loss by using deficient nutrients released by the <b>grazers</b> from May to October. During that period, bacterial growth rate was severely limited by phosphorus, and it is most likely that phosphorus release by <b>grazers</b> was stimulating bacteria. At 30 m, however, the bacterial growth rate was not stimulated by the <b>grazers</b> in the majority of the cases. Bacterial growth rate was limited by low temperature at this depth, so nutrient return from <b>grazers</b> does not have a beneficial effect on bacterial growth. These results indicate that {{the relative importance of}} positive and negative effects of <b>grazers</b> on bacterial abundance differs seasonally and vertically, and that positive effect becomes important when bacterial growth is limited by nutrients. In a given habitat, bacterial abundance changes less than one order of magnitude in spite of high growth rates. The present study suggests that <b>grazers</b> contribute to numerical stability of bacterial assemblages not only through grazing but also by regenerating deficient nutrients.

5|$|Like {{all other}} lemurs, Hadropithecus was endemic to Madagascar. Because it died out only {{recently}} {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. It once ranged across the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. Within its original range, there were few other lemurs to overlap its ecological niche, and it has been shown to be the only subfossil lemur to consume both C3 and C4 (or CAM) plants, an indication that it lived in more open habitats and had a varied diet. Its physiology and dentition suggest that it may have been much like the Gelada Baboon in locomotion and diet, acting as a manual <b>grazer</b> (picking grass with the hands) since its teeth were well-adapted for grinding either grass or seeds. Microwear patterns on its teeth, as well as its overly large molars, indicate it processed hard objects like nuts or seeds, making it a seed predator. More recent microwear analysis suggests differences between Gelada Baboons and Hadropithecus, indicating that this extinct lemur may not have been a <b>grazer,</b> but strictly a hard object processor.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory.

40|$|Interactions between toxic {{phytoplankton}} {{and their}} zooplankton <b>grazers</b> are complex. Some zooplanktcrs ingest some toxic phytoplankters {{with no apparent}} harm, whereas others are deleteriously affected.

40|$|The {{influence}} of night grazing on feeding behavior, nutrition {{and performance of}} cattle was studied. Twenty-four steers weighing 367 kg (SD = 76) grazed either from 0900 to 1900 (day <b>grazers),</b> 2100 to 0700 (night <b>grazers)</b> or 0900 to 1900 and 2400 to 0400 (day-and-night <b>grazers)</b> during 13 weeks. Four esophageally fistulated steers were used in a cross-over design to sample the diet selected {{during the day and}} at night. No differences (P > 0. 05) were observed in the diet selected in the day or at night. As the season progressed the fiber components of the diet increased (P < 0. 01) significantly while nitrogen and in sacco dry matter disappearance declined (P < 0. 01). Actual grazing time (min day- 1, SE = 16) were 352, 376, and 476 for day, night, and day-and-night <b>grazers,</b> respectively. Day-and-night <b>grazers</b> had a higher intake of organic matter than either day or night <b>grazers.</b> Night <b>grazers</b> had the lowest forage intake and also the slowest rate of consumption. Steers that grazed in the night had the lowest water intake: 22. 7 liter day- 1 (SE = 1. 5) in week 4; 19. 9 liter day- 1 (SE = 1. 1) in week 8. Average weight changes (g day- 1, SE = 62) were - 435, - 548 and - 239 for day, night, and day-and-night <b>grazers,</b> respectively.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} cause of the {{extinction}} of 'megafauna' species during the late Pleistocene of Australia. One view is that environmental change, either natural or human-induced, was the main factor in the extinctions. Some support for this comes from the observation that, among herbivores, most of the species that went extinct were apparently browsers rather than <b>grazers.</b> Browsers would presumably have been more dependent on shrubland and woodland habitats than <b>grazers,</b> and {{it has been argued that}} such habitats might have contracted in response to aridity or changed fire regimes in the late Pleistocene. Here, we test this idea by comparing extinction rates of browsers and <b>grazers</b> in the late Pleistocene, controlling for body mass in both groups. We show that in both browsers and <b>grazers</b> the probability of extinction was very strongly related to body mass, and the body mass at which extinction became likely was similar in the two groups. It is true that more browsers than <b>grazers</b> went extinct, but this is largely because most very large herbivores in the late Pleistocene were browsers, not because large browsers were more likely to go extinct than similarly sized <b>grazers.</b> This result provides evidence against some forms of environmental change as a cause of the extinctions...|$|R

40|$|<b>Grazers</b> {{can have}} a large impact on {{ecosystem}} processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of <b>grazers</b> affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large <b>grazers</b> in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small <b>grazers</b> predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large <b>grazers</b> predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large <b>grazers</b> thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process {{should be taken into}} account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which <b>grazers</b> can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition...|$|R
