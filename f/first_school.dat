5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of Northumberland, Blyth has a two tier school system {{consisting}} of <b>first</b> and high <b>schools.</b> [...] The town currently has ten <b>first</b> <b>schools,</b> five middle schools and one high school.

Under the plans, all five middle <b>schools</b> and three <b>first</b> <b>schools</b> will close; the remaining <b>first</b> <b>schools</b> will become primary schools in 2009, and the high school— Blyth Community College (now The Blyth Academy) is now a secondary school and ranges from years 7 to 11 and 3 years of 6th form.|$|R

5|$|Hamersley's <b>first</b> <b>school,</b> Glendale Primary School in Glendale Avenue, {{opened in}} 1971 {{in the western}} portion of the suburb.

As schools were built in those suburbs in 1974–1976, congestion eased considerably. The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place by residents and groups until the recreation centre opened in April 1975. In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.|$|E

5|$|Skagen's <b>first</b> <b>school</b> was the Latinskole, a grammar school, {{which was}} in {{operation}} from 1549 until 1739. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, three schools had been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and a third in Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (Borgerskolen) designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils. A secondary school (Realskolen) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended. An additional two-storey wing was completed in 1969.|$|E
