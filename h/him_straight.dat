5|$|Gertrude summons Hamlet to {{her room}} to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has {{possession}} of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. Hamlet, {{on his way to}} visit his mother, sneaks up behind him, but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, makes a noise.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets <b>him</b> <b>straight,</b> telling him to recall the day that he got married.|$|E

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1993 Johnston {{undertook}} a series of UK theatre tours, entertaining live audiences as a raconteur. On the morning of 2 December 1993, whilst in a taxi going to Paddington station en route to Bristol where he was due to fill a speaking engagement, he suffered a massive heart attack. The taxi driver drove <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> to the nearest Maida Vale hospital where he was revived after suffering a cardiac arrest. When he was revived, Johnston was moved to St Mary's Hospital, Paddington where he remained until 14 December.

However, he was re-admitted to hospital on 4 January.|$|E
25|$|Hunte, aged 12, won a {{scholarship}} to attend Alleyne Secondary School. His talent was soon noted by the school gamesmaster, who placed <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> into the school First XI, where he played against boys aged up to 18. As an incentive the gamesmaster offered Hunte a shilling every time he made 25 runs. Hunte captained the school team in his last three years. In his final year at school Hunte was asked {{to play for a}} new club, the Belleplaine Sports and Social Club. Belleplaine played in the Northern section of the Barbados Cricket League (BCL), which provided organised cricket for poor and rural Barbadians. In 1950 Hunte made the BCL representative team for its annual match against the elite (and socially exclusive) Barbados Cricket Association team. Dropped early in his innings by Test player Denis Atkinson, Hunte went on to make 137—the first BCL player to make a century in this annual fixture.|$|E
500|$|As many expected, {{the highly}} {{anticipated}} domestic clash was a savage brawl from round one. Gomez won the opening rounds {{and threatened to}} overpower Johanneson from the opening seconds. The Leeds fighter then gained the upper hand as the fight went on, flooring Gomez in the sixth round only for the [...] "Irish Mexican" [...] {{to rise from the}} canvas. Soon after, with Gomez appearing unsteady on his feet, referee Mickey Vann stopped the fight. Gomez said that Vann had stopped the fight early, adding, [...] "When the stoppage came, I wasn't wobbling or staggering, and I only dropped my hands in the fight to show Johanneson that he couldn't hurt me. But the referee simply got the wrong message. It was bad refereeing. I told <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> away I was fine, but he insisted on showing me to my corner." [...] The former champion was clear that he wanted another opportunity to fight for the British title.|$|E

500|$|The film {{includes}} four role-playing scenes. In the first, a man tells a girl {{that he will}} buy her a toy if she goes home with him. In the second, eight-year-old Natasha goes to her friend's house and finds that only her friend's father is home; after he intentionally spills water on her clothes, he tells her to take them off. The film cuts to Harris, who says, [...] "She should look <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> {{in the eye and}} tell him to stop, go away". In the third scene, a group of older boys try to lure young children into their [...] "special club"; they lead one young boy to a secluded, wooded area and try to convince him to remove his clothes. In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E

Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that sent us both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the matter}} {{involved}} the prince, Stacey consulted other {{officers in the}} regiment about what should be done, and found that opinion was divided between allowing Gordon-Cumming {{to remain in the}} regiment while he defended himself, or removing <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> away. The Colonel of the Scots Guards, the prince's younger brother, the Duke of Connaught, was also asked: according to Havers, Grayson and Shankland, the duke [...] "insisted that Gordon-Cumming must be crushed". Stacey disagreed, and thought that the whole story needed to be brought out before such a decision was taken. He reported the situation to the Adjutant-General to the Forces, General Sir Redvers Buller, and requested permission to let Gordon-Cumming retire on half-pay. Buller agreed to the request, but stated that if Gordon-Cumming's legal action failed, the permission would be reviewed. Stacey relayed the message to Gordon-Cumming and told him that signing the note was an error: [...] "Because you signed that document you will never put on a sword in the regiment. If you bring a successful action you will be allowed to retire: if you fail, you will be dismissed [...] the service". The Duke of Connaught strongly disapproved of Buller's decision, and he withdrew to Portsmouth, refusing to again be drawn on the affair, even after his brother requested further advice.|$|E

500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs are so great, and you like <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E

2500|$|In his March 1845 inaugural address, President Polk {{quoted from}} the party platform, saying that the U.S. title to Oregon was [...] "clear and unquestionable". Tensions grew, with both sides moving to {{strengthen}} border fortifications in anticipation of war. Despite Polk's bold language, he was actually prepared to compromise, and had no real desire {{to go to war}} over Oregon. He believed that a firm stance would compel the British to accept a resolution agreeable to the United States. While meeting with Representative James A. Black on 4 January 1846, Polk stated that [...] "the only way to treat John Bull was to look <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> in the eye... if Congress faultered ... John Bull would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands..." [...] But Polk's position on Oregon was not mere posturing: he genuinely believed that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire region. He rejected British offers to settle the dispute through arbitration, fearing that no impartial third party could be found.|$|E

In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. It was past one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.

2500|$|According to American {{journalist}} R. G. Waldeck, who {{was present}} in Romania in 1940–1941, Codreanu's violent killing only served to cement his popularity and aroused interest in his cause. She wrote: [...] "To the Rumanian people the Capitano [...] remained a saint and a martyr and the apostle of a better Rumania. Even skeptical ones who {{did not agree with}} him in political matters still grew dreamy-eyed remembering Codreanu." [...] Historiographer Lucian Boia notes that Codreanu, his rival Carol II, and military leader Ion Antonescu were each in turn perceived as [...] "savior" [...] figures by the Romanian public, and that, unlike other such examples of popular men, they all preached totalitarianism. Cioroianu also writes that Codreanu's death [...] "whether or not paradoxically, would increase the personage's charisma and would turn <b>him</b> <b>straight</b> into a legend." [...] Attitudes similar to those described by Waldeck were relatively widespread among Romanian youths, many of whom came to join the Iron Guard out of admiration for the deceased Codreanu while still in middle or high school.|$|E
