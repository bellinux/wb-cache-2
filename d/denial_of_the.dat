5|$|During the war, Japan brought {{as many as}} 670,000 Korean conscripts to Japan to work as forced labor. About 5,000–8,000 Koreans {{were killed}} in Hiroshima and another 1,500–2,000 died in Nagasaki. For many years, Korean {{survivors}} {{had a difficult time}} fighting for the same recognition as Hibakusha as afforded to all Japanese survivors, a situation which resulted in the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free health benefits to them. Most issues were eventually addressed in 2008 through lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed {{the ban on}} court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, {{hundreds of thousands of}} acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, 80 Taiwanese {{practitioners}} {{were blocked}} from entering Hong Kong, {{and again in}} 2007, hundreds more Taiwanese were blocked from entering Hong Kong or detained at the airport, These events set off a six-year human rights case that tested {{the integrity of the}} one country, two systems arrangement. In 2009, Falun Gong's case against the Hong Kong immigration department was dismissed. Months later, Hong Kong immigration officials denied visas to several members of the Falun Gong-affiliated Shen Yun dance company, which was scheduled to perform in the territory in January 2010. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho said the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visas was a worrying new erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, and damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as a liberal and open society. A court ruling in March 2010 overturned the Immigration Department's decision.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Protestant ideas first {{appeared}} {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. During Gáspár Heltai's service as preacher, Lutheranism grew in importance, as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism. By 1571, the Turda (Torda) Diet had adopted a more radical religion, Ferenc Dávid's Unitarianism, characterised by the free interpretation of the Bible and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dogma of the Trinity. Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti-Reform movement; however, it did not have much success. For a year, in 1600–1601, Cluj became part of the personal union of Michael the Brave. Under the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The prince was {{plunged into}} debt by his exorbitant lifestyle. His father refused to assist him, {{forcing him to}} quit Carlton House and live at Fitzherbert's residence. In 1787, the prince's {{political}} allies proposed to relieve his debts with a parliamentary grant. The prince's relationship with Fitzherbert was suspected, and revelation of the illegal marriage would have scandalised the nation and doomed any parliamentary proposal to aid him. Acting on the prince's authority, the Whig leader Charles James Fox declared that the story was a calumny. Fitzherbert was not pleased with the public <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage in such vehement terms and contemplated severing her ties to the prince. He appeased her by asking another Whig, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, to restate Fox's forceful declaration in more careful words. Parliament, meanwhile, granted the prince £161,000 (equivalent to £ today) to pay his debts and £60,000 (equivalent to £ today) for improvements to Carlton House.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} European {{countries}} reported in Hirst v. United Kingdom (No. 2) (2005), a {{judgment of the}} European Court of Human Rights, found that 18 states allowed prisoners to vote without restriction (Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine), while in 13 states all prisoners {{were not allowed to}} vote (Armenia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom). In another 13 states, the right to vote could be restricted in some way (Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Spain, Latvia and Liechtenstein). In Hirst, the UK Government's <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote to prisoners was ruled contrary to Protocol 1, Article 3, of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to regular, free and fair elections. The European Court said that the UK had to justify any deviation from universal suffrage, but the UK Government has so far desisted from applying the judgment after the House of Commons voted on 10 February 2012 to maintain the country's blanket ban on voting by prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E
5|$|The <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, {{as did the}} {{financial}} settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing {{the extent of his}} financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily at the disposal of an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession. In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{paternity}} as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> parenthood, specifically with <b>the</b> determination and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> paternity. Main topics are analytically examined and described from {{the historical and}} comparative perspective. It systematically discusses the legal sources, <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept, the general arrangements for parenthood, <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> maternity, <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> paternity and its three legal assumptions, <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> paternity. In its final chapter, the thesis provides a comparative study on law in selected European countries and on <b>the</b> case-law <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Human Rights related to this issue. The thesis structure reflects that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Family Act as amended, i. e. the chapter that deals with <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> motherhood {{is followed by the}} chapeter on <b>the</b> determination and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> paternity. <b>The</b> chapters that deal with <b>the</b> determination and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> paternity respect <b>the</b> legal division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue regulated by <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> legal assumptions related to <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> paternity. Given <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> determination and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> paternity, <b>the</b> thesis deals with procedural issues, in particular with different types <b>of</b> evidence and <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> their use as a result of scientific developments in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> biology, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 	Goodman’s grue {{paradox is}} {{unassailable}} if we hold that instances confirm generalizations, for the evidence at hand {{is both an}} instance of ‘All emeralds are green’ and ‘All emeralds are grue’.

This paper argues that <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> ‘All emeralds are grue’ is more positively relevant to the evidence to date than <b>the</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> ‘All emeralds are green’ is to the evidence and that therefore ‘All emeralds are green’ is better supported by the evidence than ‘All emeralds are grue’. <b>The</b> measure <b>of</b> support we employ—S(h|e) = p(e|h) – p(e| h) —is motivated by the familiar relevance condition of confirmation, namely e confirms h only if p(h|e) > p(h). ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Exxon became {{a leader in}} climate change denial.
