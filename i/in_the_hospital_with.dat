5|$|At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, {{while trying}} to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries {{to pull the plug}} on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies {{unconscious}} in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that {{he was the one who}} put him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>with</b> his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>with</b> a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting his pants, but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of}} the department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E

25|$|Tarkovsky {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Yuryevets. He was described by childhood friends as active and popular, having many friends and being typically {{in the center of}} action. His father left the family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939 Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School № 554. During the war, the three evacuated to Yuryevets, living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943 the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet Andrey Voznesensky was one of his classmates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school. The family lived on Shchipok Street in the Zamoskvorechye District in Moscow. From November 1947 to spring 1948 he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>with</b> tuberculosis. Many themes of his childhood—the evacuation, his mother and her two children, the withdrawn father, the time in the hospital—feature prominently in his film Mirror.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} Suzuki spent {{a short time}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>with</b> tuberculosis, but soon recovered. In 1927 an {{important}} chapter in Suzuki's life was turned. He went to visit a teacher in England he had at Komazawa named Miss Nona Ransom, {{a woman who had}} taught English to such people as the last emperor of China, Pu-yi, and more so his wife, the last empress of China, Jigoro Kano (the Founder of Judo), the children of Chinese president Li Yuanhong, and some members of the Japanese royal family. She hired him that day to be a translator and to help with errands. Through this period he realized she was very ignorant of Japanese culture and the religion of Buddhism. She respected it very little and saw it as idol worship. But one day, when there were no chores to be done, the two had a conversation on Buddhism that changed her mind. She even let Suzuki teach her zazen meditation. This experience is significant in that Suzuki realized that Western ignorance of Buddhism could be transformed.|$|E
25|$|Tebow started against Kentucky despite {{suffering}} from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game.
