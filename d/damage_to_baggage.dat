40|$|On 31 November 2003 the 1999 Montreal Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air {{entered into}} force. Its {{purpose was to}} {{consolidate}} and modernize the Warsaw system and to reunify the provisions of several international instruments of private international air law under one legal instrument. The Montreal Convention consolidates the positive elements of the Warsaw Convention, the Hague Protocol, the Guadalajara Convention, the Guatemala City Protocol and Additional Protocol Numbers 3 and 4. It also simplifies and modernizes the requirements of documentation relating to the carriage by air of passengers, baggage and cargo. Most importantly, the Montreal Convention modernizes of the liability regime for death and injury to passengers by adopting the passenger liability regime in the IATA Inter-carrier Agreement. It also modernizes the liability regime for <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>baggage</b> and cargo and the delay. In spite of the foregoing, the Montreal Convention fails to advance the unification of private international air law any further than the Warsaw Convention. This thesis analyzes the provisions of liability regimes under the Warsaw System and the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter one studies the liability regime established under the original Warsaw Convention and the subsequent attempts by states, air carriers and other interested entities to update it. Chapter two analyzes the new regime of unlimited liability established by the 1999 Montreal Convention. Chapter three examines the liability of the air carrier for damage caused by terrorist activities. In an effort to demonstrate the innovative elements of the new Convention and to encourage states to ratify it, chapter four surveys the main benefits that have accrued to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its national air carrier upon ratification of the 1999 Montreal Convention...|$|E

40|$|Risk {{management}} {{is considered to}} be an application of general concepts in scientific management of a particular problem of exposure to risk of loss. It is concerned with identifying objectives, analysing the data regarding the nature of the problem, evaluating the pure risks deriving from the nature of the business and choosing or finding the most suitable method or methods of handling these risks; aiming to control them and their effects as well as minimizing the cost. The field of aviation has grown very quickly and developed faster {{in the last few years}} to reach the present level of operation and technology by introducing more advanced and higher capacity airliners. Therefore, aviation risks and their financial impact exhibit a number of distinguishing characteristics that raise problems for traditional risk management and insurance technique in dealing with such risks. The study reviews, analyses and classifies aviation risks and their characteristics as well as the major hazards involved in aircraft and their operation. The research undertakes to review the international conventions and agreements affecting air transportation and the limits of liabilities affecting those who operate airlines internationally in respect of death, injury or <b>damage</b> caused <b>to</b> passengers, <b>baggage,</b> cargo and third parties as well as safety and security of aircraft in the air and on the ground. It also studies and analyses the international jet airliner fleet, their accidents and their causes to provide a basis of choosing suitable risk levels in managing these risks...|$|R
