40|$|Abstract — The {{emphasis}} {{and awareness}} of the Government urge to implementing ICT in the education sector cannot be over-emphasizes, however, the process seems to be hindered {{by a number of}} barriers hence this study investigated the availability and impact of <b>ICT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in Federal College of Education (Technology) Omoku in Rivers State of Nigeria, to determine the level of ICT implementation in teaching and learning. Four research questions guided the study. The population of the study was made up of 200 students selected from one of the four schools of the institution. Data obtained was analyzed using mean and standard deviation. Some of the findings revealed that <b>ICT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are not adequate in the college for effective teaching and learning. Management’s effort towards the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has tremendously improved but still tilt towards administrative purposes. In addition, some few students have computers and laptops and can access the internet but, they do not use them for learning effectively. Based on the findings of the study, recommendations were made to encourage the use of <b>ICT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to promote teaching and learning in the college. The college should as matter of urgency continue to organise in house training for lecturers on the use of ICT for teaching and learning. Government should release the necessary funds to enable colleges of education put in place necessary <b>ICT</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that will facilitate teaching / learning.
