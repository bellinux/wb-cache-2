40|$|With {{the focus}} of {{psychiatric}} care now firmly in the community {{there has been a}} steady reduction of costly in-patient beds along with the emergence of the community recovery model. 1, 2 The benchmark of successful patient management now includes reduced hospital usage. The management of psychiatric patients in the community enables greater patient autonomy. This, however, also results in some patients disengaging and relapsing, leading to repeated admissions with poorer clinical outcomes as well as greater financial stress on the healthcare system. In addition, the media’s portrayal of psychiatric patients as dangerous led to a call for greater scrutiny of community care under legal jurisdiction by the political establish-ment. 3, 4 In 1998 the government started the process of reforming the mental health law <b>in</b> <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} links between {{biosecurity}} policy and rural differentiation. It attempts to show how biosecurity policy has been fundamentally affected by uncertainty over {{the rules of the}} game of policy-making – what Hajer has called the ‘institutional void’. In particular, the article attempts to show how this void has created a new political space in which the traditional practices of dealing with animal disease have been challenged and reshaped. Crucial to this is a discourse of partnership that permits new actors and forms of expertise to construct different approaches to biosecurity at new spatial scales. These actions legitimate a new spatiality of disease control, thereby contributing to the differentiation of the countryside.

40|$|Pregnancy {{in women}} aged 45 or older is unusual. Of the 4. 1 million births in the USA in 2004, only 6122 were to women aged 45 or more. 1 In the UK, births {{to women in}} this age group are not {{reported}} separately, but rather are lumped in with births to women over 40. Published data tell us little about women who fall pregnant at this late stage in their reproductive lives. The group will include women who conceive spontaneously {{as well as those who}} have undergone assisted reproduction. It will include women for whom pregnancy is a mistake, as well as those who choose to get pregnant. In a review of 1865 pregnancies among Danish women aged 45 or older who conceived between 1978 and 1992, it was reported that the majority (1184; 63 %) ended in induced abortion. 2 <b>In</b> <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the {{findings}} from research into the outcomes of adult protection in Scotland, with particular focus on how service users, family members and service delivery professionals perceive the effectiveness of the protection orders in the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007. Design/methodology/approach – The study comprised analysis of Adult Protection Committee biennial reports on implementation of the 2007 Act to the Scottish Government, key informant interviews and workshops with professionals involved in adult protection leadership and practice, and case study interviews with service users, family members and practitioners. Findings – Concerns about the potential for paternalistic practice and excessive use of the protection orders within the 2007 Act have not materialised. The principle of proportionality appears to be firmly embedded in adult protection practice. Service delivery professionals, service users and family members remain acutely aware of the tensions between autonomy and protection but point to beneficial outcomes for adults at risk from the careful use of protection orders, especially banning orders. Research limitations/implications – Only ten case studies were able to be included in the study. However, the use of mixed methods enabled triangulation of the findings. Common themes emerge from across the data sources. The findings also resonate with conclusions drawn by other researchers. Practical implications – The paper identifies outcomes and challenges in respect of protecting adults at risk in Scotland. Strengths and limitations of the 2007 Act are identified. Originality/value – The paper offers a formal evaluation of the outcome of protection orders for adults at risk in Scotland. The findings are of wider policy relevance given the debates on how to legislate for adult safeguarding <b>in</b> <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R

There is evidence of displacement for earlier immigrants, with a substantial impact for those with no or low qualifications.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the average levels of air {{pollution}} present in different areas of Belfast during the five-year period commencing 1 st January, 1961, and to examine these levels in relation to the mortality rates from bronchitis which occurred in the central and in the peripheral wards or part-wards of the city during the same five-year period. An assessment is made of the smoking habits of persons resident in Belfast and the effects of these smoking habits upon mortality from bronchitis is discussed. In the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Bronchitis (LCD. No. 500 - 502) comprises three disease groups, namely Acute bronchitis, Unqualified bronchitis and Chronic bronchitis (LCD. No. 500, 501 and 502 respectively). Eighty-seven per cent of all deaths due to bronchitis in the United Kingdom during the year 1964 were due to chronic bronchitis.

40|$|ArticleQuestionnaire {{research}} {{was carried out}} to identify factors that may encourage problem debtors {{to take the first}} steps towards getting out of debt. Consumers with debt problems were identified with the aid of creditor organisations and the Courts service for <b>England</b> <b>and</b> Wales. Responses were also sought from non-debtors from the same consumer groups as the debtors. Response rates from debtors were very low, but results confirmed the existence of a group of chronically poor consumers with widespread and long-lasting debt and also confirmed the demographic differences between this group of debtors and non-debtors found in previous research. These debtors showed marked attitudinal differences from non-debtors, with reduced optimism and financial self-esteem, and a less internal economic locus of control. They also showed a distinct social identity, identifying with fellow debtors and feeling stigmatised both generally and personally. Within the debtor group, engagement with creditors was higher in people reporting lower debt levels, but seeking advice was more frequent in those reporting higher debts. Engagement was associated with a stronger attitude of financial self-efficacy and with a perception of the debtor identity as more permeable. Neither demographic nor psychological factors significantly predicted which debtors would seek advice. Her Majesty’s Court Service for <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R

The study provides glimpses into the criminal behaviour of the offending youth which could provide useful opportunity for future research and extension of CSO implementation.
