This is surprising and has implications for the double dividend discussion i. e. drawing into doubt the existence of even the weak double dividend and the universal soundness of warnings against earmarking. Until recently taxes were only a marginal instrument of environmental regulation however over the last decade they have become more important in a number of European countries (EUROSTAT, 1996).

Our first goal is to describe the effects of the transfer system on horizontal balance among municipalities. By our estimates, the fiscal capacities of Colombian municipalities differ substantially, which is a major challenge to designing an effective system of decentralization. Our second goal is to draw some inferences from the data about how the current system of transfers has affected the level of local taxation and spending, and the pattern of spending across functional categories. Our data cover a period that straddles the major reform in the allocation of municipal transfers that resulted from Law 60 in 1993. This permits a more accurate assessment of the effects of transfers than has been possible in previous research. Columbia, decentralization, subnational taxes, local taxation...|$|R

Six P-35As were delivered to Ecuador to form the first combat unit, the Escuadrilla de Caza. The remainder were sent to the Far East Air Force in the Philippines beginning in February 1941. Eventually all pilots of the three pursuit squadrons on Luzon transitioned to the P-35A from the P-26. About 10 of these were lost in accidents. The P-35s were used primarily as gunnery trainers by all three squadrons because of a critical shortage of [...]50-caliber ammunition in the Far East Air Force, placing a strain on the engines of all the aircraft since no replacement engines were available.
