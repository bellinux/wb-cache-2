The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands.

5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E

25|$|The miners sank their shafts in {{turns of}} up to , each turn being a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> {{from the bottom of}} the {{preceding}} one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or stemples, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These climbing shafts were usually within the miners' “coe”, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an adit or tunnel driven into the slope.|$|E

25|$|A <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> {{from the}} Ordnance Survey's {{triangulation}} {{point on the}} Graig stands Lisvane's only Cold War nuclear bunker. During World War II the Royal Observer Corps (ROC) observation post stood on the Graig with its clear views over the village {{and the city of}} Cardiff. The volunteer ROC observers spotted many German Luftwaffe raids approaching across the channel and activated the air raid warnings in the Cardiff area. In early 1966 a protected nuclear fallout shelter (or bunker) was completed on the site for the ROC (OS Grid Ref: ST 1898 8508), who by the 1960s had switched from above ground aircraft spotting to underground operations with instruments to detect nuclear explosions and warn the public of approaching radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear war.|$|E
25|$|At 02.30 on 9 June (D+4), {{an enemy}} {{aircraft}} dropped {{a number of}} anti-personnel bombs on a Bofors site of G Trp at the junction of Nan White and Green beaches. The first bomb severely wounded the gun's No 2 while the No 4, Gunner Douglas Taylor, {{was hit in the}} leg, though the crew continued to engage the aircraft until it had passed. A second bomb had ignited an ammunition dump a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> and while the No 2's wound was being attended to, Taylor led two other men to tackle the blaze, ignoring his own wound and the danger from the exploding ammunition. He was later relieved by the gun's No 1 and taken to a beach dressing station, from which he was evacuated to England the same day. Taylor was awarded the MM.|$|E
25|$|From January to June 1978, Jacques and Maddly lived quietly {{at their}} home on Atuona Bay on Hiva-Oa island. In July, after his health began to fail, Brel was flown back to France and rushed to a {{hospital}} in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where doctors discovered a cancerous tumour.

25|$|Brett Lee had {{dominated}} {{the clash between}} himself and Sehwag for some brief moments when he hit Sehwag on the helmet twice, with just-short of a length deliveries each time. Sehwag also enjoyed a slice of luck, when a comedy of errors by the Australian fielders resulted in a run-out chance being put down. Sehwag had just struck a ball off Lee on the off-side, and had run a single, and had made his mind {{to go for the}} second, but a moment's hesitation, left {{him in the middle of}} the pitch and when the fielder threw the ball to Lee, the bowler, Sehwag was a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> from the crease. Unmindful of this, Lee threw the ball to the batting end, where Chopra was struggling to get to. The wicketkeeper, however, dropped the ball, only for Chopra to make it back to the crease in time.|$|E

2500|$|Starter whey (containing {{a mixture}} of certain {{thermophilic}} lactic acid bacteria) is added, and the temperature is raised to 33–35°C (91–95°F). Calf rennet is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10–12 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55°C (131°F) with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45–60 minutes. The compacted curd is collected {{in a piece of}} muslin before being divided in two and placed in molds. There is 1100 L (291 US gallons or 250 imperial gallons) of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each wheel at this point weighs around 45kg (100lb). The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which [...] "Prosciutto di Parma" [...] (cured Parma ham) was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a <b>few</b> <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> from the cheese production rooms.|$|E
