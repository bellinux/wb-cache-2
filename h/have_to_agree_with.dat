500|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, DeLee {{observed}} that obstetric complications and deaths were so common that he [...] "often wondered whether nature did not intend women should be used up {{in the process of}} reproduction, in a manner analogous to that of the salmon, which dies after spawning. Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E

William Gibbs McAdoo, a former Democratic senator, stated [...] "You don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> every {{position}} taken {{to concede that}} he was an intellectual giant and one of the truly great men of our times". Ernest K. Lindley deemed Borah the [...] "most effectively liberal voice in the Republican Party". Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' paper, Der Angriff, asserted, [...] "American life loses a personality valued by friend or foe on account of his courage, honesty, and decent method of fighting." [...] Borah's old classmate, Kansas editor William Allen White, called him [...] "a righteous man who was wise and unafraid, who followed his star, never lowered his flag, and never lost his self-respect... an honest man who dedicated his talents to his country's good".
