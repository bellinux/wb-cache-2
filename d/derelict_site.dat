5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The <b>derelict</b> <b>site</b> was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|The Hippodrome in Constantinople {{remained}} in use for races, games, and public ceremonies {{up to the}} sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During the sack of 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres; it is now displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a <b>derelict</b> <b>site,</b> a few walls still standing, and the spina, the central reservation, robbed of its splendor. Today, only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered. In the West, the games had ended much sooner; {{by the end of}} the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns. The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD.|$|E
25|$|On April 13, 1969, local {{merchants and}} {{residents}} held {{a meeting to}} discuss possible uses for the <b>derelict</b> <b>site.</b> At the time, student activist Wendy Schlesinger and Michael Delacour (a former defense contractor employee who had become an anti-war activist) had become attached to the area, {{as they had been}} using it as a rendez-vous for a secret romantic affair. The two presented a plan for developing the under-utilized, university-owned land into a public park. This plan was approved by the attendees, but not by the university. Stew Albert, a co-founder of the Yippie Party, agreed to write an article for the local counter-culture newspaper, the Berkeley Barb, {{on the subject of the}} park, particularly to call for help from local residents.|$|E

Guidance of the spatial development degradation is reflected in a rational use {{of the region and}} protects the purpose of use of other lands (for example: agricultural). Unfortunately, we do not know the exact numbers, size and diversity of <b>derelict</b> <b>sited,</b> areas are not recorded, solutions for this problem are not systematic. In the Statistical Region, we can see many of the areas, that are undergoing a degradation for a longer period, or they are undergoing a ceasing activity, which leads to <b>derelict</b> <b>sites.</b> In my diploma, I focused on the town Medvode and its surrounding. The purpose of my work is not to record all the <b>derelict</b> <b>sites</b> for this addressed area, but to identify learning examples for each type of <b>derelict</b> <b>sites</b> and their detailed presentation. Based on the record, that was carried out {{with the help of the}} census documents; an analysis of <b>derelict</b> <b>sites</b> was made.

25|$|In the 1940s, {{a service}} trench had been {{excavated}} {{in the adjacent}} Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A.

In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the <b>derelict</b> <b>site</b> at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation took place at the site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a mechanical digger to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M.

40|$|Minerals are {{the gift}} of nature which occurs either in thick forest areas or {{adjacent}} to it. During the course of mining, vegetation/forest gets destroyed and gets replaced by huge quantities of overburden dumps. Restoration of these dumps becomes necessary so that the land may come back to its original topography. Soil has the significant role in restoration process. Present paper focuses on how the physical characteristics of soil affect the restoration intervention in a derelict mined land. The study was carried out with an objective of evaluating the role of soil physical properties in ecological succession of an age series of 23, 22, 21 and 20 years old restored mine sites in Dehradun district, Uttarakhand, India. Adjoining natural forest was also studied for comparison of some selected soil physical properties (texture, porosity, electrical conductivity, bulk density). Data of the present investigation reveals that as the physical properties of soil improve with age of biorestoration, the successional processes also advance culminating into successful restoration of mine <b>derelict</b> <b>sites.</b> The {{results of the present}} study will be helpful in further understanding the successional processes and how soil properties play significant role in successional processes.

The most visually spectacular of these developments is the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC)- a financial district almost a kilometre long situated along the North quays. While the former tramways had been torn up in the 1950s in favour of buses, the new Luas tram service started in 2004.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} opportunities for reclaiming industrial brownfield {{sites for the}} communities that surround them, recreating <b>derelict</b> <b>sites</b> as community-oriented spaces that increase understanding of and restore pride in industrial and cultural heritage. The study consisted of two primary components. The first phase consists primarily of {{an exploration of the}} linkages between landscape/urban design and industrial heritage. This phase also examines and evaluates various design projects that have attempted to celebrate industrial heritage through the adaptive re-use of former industrial sites. The second phase of the study consists of the development of a master plan for the transformation of a <b>derelict</b> industrial <b>site</b> to a community space that interprets and celebrates industrial heritage. This phase includes researching the industrial heritage of Muncie, selecting an appropriate project site within the city, and developing a master plan for the reclamation of an industrial site by the community. A layered design strategy was developed for the selected site, with the end result being a master plan for a new public park. The three elements of the design strategy included industrial heritage, adaptive reuse, and improvements in the surrounding community. Department of Landscape ArchitectureThesis (M. L. A. ...|$|R
