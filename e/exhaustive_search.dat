Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>search</b> of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.|$|E

For example, the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number n for which the Mertens function M(n) equals or exceeds the square root of n) is known: all numbers less than 1014 have the Mertens property, and the smallest number {{that does not have}} this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 1.59×1040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3×1039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a googol), there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by <b>exhaustive</b> <b>search.</b>|$|E

25|$|After an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>search</b> that {{included}} interviews with several established head coaches, Frei's offensive line coach, Dick Enright, was elevated to head {{coach for the}} 1972 season. Enright was the least experienced candidate for the position, having been a high school coach until 1970, and he struggled to maintain team discipline and consistent play. Enright famously tried to make an option quarterback out of Dan Fouts, {{who was not a}} runner. Although his 1972 team did beat Oregon State {{for the first time in}} nine seasons, Enright's teams only won six games in two seasons. After complaining to the media about what he considered sub-standard conditions of football facilities, he was fired after the 1973 season, replaced by Don Read, his quarterback coach.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} method of structural learning uses optimization based search. It requires a scoring function and a search strategy. A common scoring function is posterior probability {{of the structure}} given the training data, like the BIC or the BDeu. The time requirement of an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>search</b> returning a structure that maximizes the score is superexponential {{in the number of}} variables. A local search strategy makes incremental changes aimed at improving the score of the structure. A global search algorithm like Markov chain Monte Carlo can avoid getting trapped in local minima. Friedman et al. discuss using mutual information between variables and finding a structure that maximizes this. They do this by restricting the parent candidate set to k nodes and exhaustively searching therein.|$|E

The aircraft is painted as a B-10 used in the 1934 Alaskan Flight. It was an export version sold to Argentina in 1938. The aircraft survived as a ground crew trainer, and was still being used by the Argentine Air Force for training its ground crews until the 1960s. The Air Force Museum conducted an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>search</b> for any surviving B-10 remains, and eventually learned of the aircraft. In 1970, the incomplete airframe was donated by the Government of Argentina to the U.S. Government in a formal ceremony attended by the U.S. ambassador.

40|$|To deploy a {{multi-cell}} 802. 11 wireless {{local area}} network (WLAN), access point (AP) placement and channel assignment are two primary design issues. For a given pattern of traffic demands, we aim at maximizing not only the overall system throughput, but also the fairness in resource sharing among mobile terminals. A novel method for estimating the system throughput of multi-cell WLAN is proposed. An important feature of this method is that co-channel overlapping is allowed. Unlike conventional approaches that decouple AP placement and channel assignment into two phases, we propose to jointly solve the two problems for better performance. The optimal solution can be found using <b>exhaustive</b> <b>searching.</b> Due to the high computational complexity involved in <b>exhaustive</b> <b>searching,</b> an efficient local searching algorithm, called patching algorithm, is designed.

25|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} {{is usually}} a chosen plaintext attack, meaning that the attacker {{must be able to}} obtain ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of their choosing. There are, however, extensions that would allow a known plaintext or even a ciphertext-only attack. The basic method uses pairs of plaintext related by a constant difference; difference can be defined in several ways, but the eXclusive OR (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a differential. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials (ΔX, ΔY), where ΔY = S(X ⊕ ΔX) ⊕ S(X) (and ⊕ denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box S. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent; in this way, the cipher can be distinguished from random. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than <b>exhaustive</b> <b>search.</b>|$|E
