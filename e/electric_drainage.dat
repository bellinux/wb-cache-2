25|$|Denton is {{the county}} seat of Denton County. From 1914 to 1959, the City of Denton used a mayor–city {{commission}} system, but a charter adopted in 1959 created a council–manager form of city government. Residents elect a mayor, four single-member district council members, and two at-large members. The city manager is appointed by the Denton City Council. Council terms are for two years, with a maximum of three consecutive terms, and elections are held each year in May. Utilities are administered by Denton Municipal Utilities; the city provides water, wastewater, <b>electric,</b> <b>drainage</b> and solid waste service. The electric utility, Denton Municipal Electric (DME), has been in operation since 1905. In 2009, DME began providing 40 percent of its energy to customers through renewable resources. The City of Denton Water Utilities Department serves the city's water demand. Atmos Energy provides the city's natural gas. Denton {{is a part of}} the Sister Cities International program and maintains cultural and economic exchange programs with its sister cities, Madaba in Jordan and San Nicolás de los Garza in Mexico.|$|E

[...] It charged a fixed rate per ton for taking loaded coal wagons from Tilmanstone Colliery to Shepherdswell (no further) for {{switching}} onto {{the main line}} and for returning empties. [...] Since the colliery possessed no locomotives, it also performed necessary shunting duties at the mine, including taking coal from the screens to the power station that ran the <b>electric</b> <b>drainage</b> pumps. [...] Tonnage was over 200,000 after 1926. [...] Rates agreed in 1932 were £0.0315 per ton to Shepherdswell, internal shunting at the colliery at £0.0126 per ton, 1,000 tons of free coal per year for railway use and £0.90 per ton over that. [...] In return, the railway had to obtain all its coal from the colliery, and bad quality {{was to be a}} problem. [...] The Southern Railway credited the EKLR £0.042 per ton of coal forwarded to them.|$|E

While most of these older markets have had upgrades in gas, <b>electric</b> and <b>drainage,</b> as well as fire extinguishers installed, sixty percent are in danger of fire due to faulty electrical wiring. Many have insect and rodent infestations. Many of these markets are in unsafe areas, with drug addicts, alcoholics, and delinquents.|$|R
50|$|IET Lucknow, {{started in}} November 1984, {{began with the}} Faculty of Engineering and Technology of Lucknow University. Initially, it offered a B.Tech degree in three {{branches}} - Computer Science, Electrical and Electronics. Within a year, two more branches - Civil and Mechanical - were introduced.The campus was constructed by Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd (UPRNN) on an 100 acre plot purchased from the Lucknow Development Authority. UPRNN constructed a substation, academic block, eight boys’ hostels, three girls’ hostel and nearly 70 residences. LDA provided its support for construction of external roads, <b>electric</b> supply, <b>drainage</b> and sewage.|$|R

In Mexico City, about 65% of permits that merchants have to operate in these public markets have some sort of irregularity. None of these markets have adequate sanitary measures for meat. Meat and dairy products sold in tianguis and fixed markets are not regulated or inspected according to the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías (CUCEI). Contaminants such as Salmonella and E. coli have been detected in products tested by this organization. Since 1997, Mexico City authorities have not carried out inspection in businesses selling groceries of any type in the city. Federal authorities only have jurisdiction in the states.|$|R
5000|$|The Bassett Olympian Stadium {{went through}} an {{extensive}} modernization {{which included a}} rubberized running track, artificial football field and cooling system, <b>electric</b> score board, <b>drainage,</b> replaced wood steps and seats of existing bleachers with aluminum panels; the BHS Football team, Track and Cross-country team and {{both boys and girls}} Soccer teams use the stadium. BHS Commencement ceremonies and Torch Middle School Promotion ceremonies are performed in the stadium. The BHS Gymnasium also went through an extensive renovation after the passing of Bond measure [...] "E" [...] in the district. The BHS boys and girls basketball team, the BHS volleyball team, and the BHS badminton team play in the Gym. Student Body sports rallies and renaissances rallies are usually done in the Gym. The school library is also currently going through renovations. The campus is two stories and has three quads and an amphitheater. The school has its own Theater equipped with a Band room. The campus also has a full swimming pool, and four fields use for its Baseball and Softball teams.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the picturesque}} little {{settlement}} of Wood Hills (said the Oldest Member) that the incidents occurred which I am about to relate. Even if you {{have never been in}} Wood Hills, that suburban paradise is probably familiar to you by name. Situated at a convenient distance from the city, it combines in a notable manner the advantages of town life with the pleasant surroundings and healthful air of the country. Its inhabitants live in commodious houses, standing in their own grounds, and enjoy so many luxuries--such as gravel soil, main <b>drainage,</b> <b>electric</b> light, telephone, baths (h. and c.), and company's own water, that you might be pardoned for imagining life to be so ideal for them that no possible improvement could be added to their lot. Mrs. Willoughby Smethurst was under no such delusion. What Wood Hills needed to make it perfect, she realized, was Culture. Material comforts are all very well, but, if the summum bonum is to be achieved, the Soul also demands a look in, and it was Mrs. Smethurst's unfaltering resolve that never while she had her strength should the Soul be handed the loser's end. It was her intention to make Wood Hills a centre of all that was most cultivated and refined, and, golly! how she had succeeded. Under her presidency the Wood Hills Literary and Debating Society had tripled its membership.|$|R
40|$|China is {{a country}} with vast territory, but {{economic}} development and population growth have reduced the usable land resources in recent years. Therefore, reclamation by pumping and filling is carried out in eastern coastal regions of China {{in order to meet}} the needs of urbanization. However, large areas of reclaimed land need rapid drainage consolidation treatment. Based on past researches on how to improve the treatment efficiency of soft clay using vacuum preloading combined with electro-osmosis, a two-dimensional drainage plane model was proposed according to the Terzaghi and Esrig consolidation theory. However, the analytical solution using two-dimensional plane model was never involved. Current analytical solutions can't have a thorough theoretical analysis of practical engineering and give relevant guidance. Considering the smearing effect and the rectangle arrangement pattern, an analytical solution is derived to describe the behavior of pore-water and the consolidation process by using EKG (electro-kinetic geo synthetics) materials. The functions of EKG materials include <b>drainage,</b> <b>electric</b> conduction and corrosion resistance. Comparison with test results is carried out to verify the analytical solution. It is found that the measured value is larger than the applied vacuum degree because of the stacking effect of the vacuum preloading and electro-osmosis. The trends of the mean measured value and the mean analytical value processes are comparable. Therefore, the consolidation model can accurately assess the change in pore-water pressure and the consolidation process during vacuum preloading combined with electro-osmosis...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to spatially evaluate land suitability for surface and sprinkler irrigation in the Guang watershed, Ethiopia based on FAO guidelines. Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques were used to develop land suitability map. The 30 m spatial resolution Digital Elevation Model was used to generate slope by using “Spatial Analyst Tool Surface Slope ” in ArcGIS environment. Land characteristics (LCs) used as criteria for irrigation requirements were soil depth, soil texture, <b>electric</b> conductivity, pH, <b>drainage</b> and slope factors. The irrigation suitability map was made by matching between reclassified LCs with irrigation land use requirements (LURs) using GIS model builder. Surface soil samples from different soil types were collected and analyzed in the soil laboratory of Amhara Design and Supervision Works Enterprise (ADSWE). The crop suitability evaluation was made by matching between reclassified LCs of the watershed with crop LURs using GIS model builder. The results showed that 990. 25 ha (39. 61 %) of the Guang watershed were highly suitable (S 1) for surface irrigation method. However, 2370 ha (94. 8 %) of the region was unsuitable (N) for sprinkler irrigation method due to soil salinity, drainage and pH. This showed that the surface irrigation method was more efficient than the sprinkler irrigation method to intensively and extensively use the land. The resultant map can assist decision makers in ensuring that lands are used according to their suitability...|$|R
