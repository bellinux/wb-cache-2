An analog circuit {{provides}} an additional <b>fine</b> <b>delay</b> of 0 to 100 ns. A 5 MHz reference clock drives a phase-locked loop {{to produce a}} stable 500 MHz clock. It is this fast clock that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The fast clock is divided down to 10 MHz and fed to main counter. The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500 MHz clock (2 ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2 ns of jitter.

40|$|One {{important}} determinate {{of childhood}} {{physical activity and}} sedentary behaviour may be that of motor development in infancy. The present analyses aimed to investigate whether gross and <b>fine</b> motor <b>delays</b> in infants were associated with objective and self-reported activity in childhood. Data were from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study, involving UK children born on or around the millennium (September 2000 and January 2002). When children were 9 months old, parents reported children’s fine and gross motor-coordination, and at 7 years, sports club attendance and daily TV viewing time. Children’s physical activity was measured using accelerometers at 7 years. Adjusted regression models were used to examine associations between delayed motor development and objectively measured activity, sport club attendance and TV viewing time. In this sample (n= 13021), gross motor delay in infancy was associated with less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (B - 5. 0 95 % CI - 6. 8, - 3. 2) and more time sedentary (B 13. 5 95 % CI 9. 3, 17. 8) in childhood. Gross and <b>fine</b> motor <b>delays</b> during infancy were associated with a reduced risk of having high attendance at sports clubs in childhood (both RR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 6, 0. 9). <b>Fine</b> motor <b>delays,</b> but not gross delays, were also {{associated with an increased}} risk of having high TV viewing time (RR 1. 3 95 % CI 1. 0, 1. 6).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding affects {{the likelihood of}} gross and <b>fine</b> motor <b>delay</b> in infants and examined the effect of factors that might explain any observed differences. METHODS: The study sample included all term singleton infants who weighed > 2500 g at birth and were not placed in a special care infant unit and whose mothers participated in the first survey of the Millennium Cohort Study. Missing data reduced the sample to 14660 (94 %) with complete data. RESULTS: Almost half (47 %) of the infants initially were exclusively breastfed, but only 3. 5 % of these infants were still being fed exclusively on breast milk after 4 months of age, and 34 % of infants were not breastfed at all; 9 % of the infants were identified with delays in gross motor coordination and 6 % with <b>fine</b> motor coordination <b>delays</b> at age 9 months. The proportion of infants who mastered the developmental milestones increased with duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. Infants {{who had never been}} breastfed were 50 % more likely to have gross motor coordination delays than infants who had been breastfed exclusively for at least 4 months (10. 7 % vs 7. 3 %). Any breast milk also was positively related to development: infants who had never been breastfed were 30 % more likely to have gross motor delays than infants who were given some breast milk for up to 2 months (10. 7 % vs 8. 4 %). The odds ratios for gross motor delay were not attenuated after adjustment for biological, socioeconomic, or psychosocial factors. Infants who were never breastfed had at least a 40 % greater likelihood of <b>fine</b> motor <b>delay</b> than infants who were given breast milk for a prolonged period. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the protective effect of breastfeeding on the attainment of gross motor milestones is attributable to some component(s) of breast milk or feature of breastfeeding and is not simply a product of advantaged social position, education, or parenting style, because control for these factors did not explain any of the observed association.

30|$|The delay step in DLLs can {{be defined}} as the finest change in the delay time of the output signal after a DLL’s output has been locked. The delay step is {{controlled}} by the CP voltage.
