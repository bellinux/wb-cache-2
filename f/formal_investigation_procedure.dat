5000|$|In Case E-8/13, Abelia, the Court {{dismissed}} {{an action}} brought by Abelia, a trade and employers association {{that is part}} of Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon (“NHO”), the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise. The applicant sought the annulment of ESA Decision No 160/13/COL of 24 April 2013 where ESA concluded, without initiating the <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure,</b> that the contested provisions of the Norwegian VAT Act and VAT Compensation Act did not have the effect of granting State aid, within the meaning of Article 61(1) EEA, to public schools or the lessors of premises to public schools. Besides the applicant’s legal interest in bringing the action for annulment, which led to the dismissal, the Court {{had to deal with the}} situation of the applicant’s counsel in light of Article 17(2) of the Statute of the Court, according to which parties other than any EFTA State, ESA, the European Union and the Commission must be represented by a lawyer. The Court examined the relationship between the applicant and the two lawyers that signed the application. The independence of one lawyer was not found to be affected by her position as head of the Business Legislation Department of NHO as the Court had not been provided with information demonstrating that the interests of NHO were largely the same as those of the applicant. The other lawyer was also deemed sufficiently independent from the applicant as an employee of an independent law firm, from where she continued to receive her salary, regardless of a contract between NHO and the law firm for the temporary provision of her services. The applicant was thus found to be properly represented before the Court, showing that the right of audience of in-house counsel must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} analyses {{the judgments}} of the Court of Justice [ECJ] in the Kronoply and Kronotex and Deutsche Post and DHL cases. Although they concern different sectors, both cases {{share a common}} procedural itinerary. They both {{have their origin in}} a decision not to raise objections to a State aid plan adopted by the Commission without opening the <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Moreover, both decisions were challenged before the General Court [GC] by private applicants with limited locus standi – i. e., by applicants who satisfied the Cook/Matra test of standing but failed to meet the stricter conditions laid down by Cofaz. Finally, the appeal brought before the ECJ in both cases turned on the conditions that need to be satisfied for the Cook/Matra rule of standing to be applicable and on the constraints that the limited locus standi of the applicants imposes on the jurisdiction of the GC...|$|E
40|$|This third {{overview}} of EU competition and sector-specific regulatory jurisprudential and case law developments with a nexus to Poland covers the years 2010 and 2011. This {{period of time}} is worth noting for several reasons. First, EU courts delivered {{a significant number of}} judgments in ‘Polish’ cases including an increased number of preliminary rulings. Second, 2010 - 2011 developments were dominated by judgments and decisions concerning telecoms. Finally, the Commission adopted only a handful of Polish State aid decisions following a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedure</b> under Article 108 (2) TFEU. The main developments in telecoms relate to the Court of Justice’s preliminary reference judgment in Tele 2 Polska focusing on the interpretation of Regulation 1 / 2003 and the PTC v UKE ruling that dealt with number portability charges. Relevant is also the antitrust prohibition decision issued by the Commission against Telekomunikacja Polska S. A. for its refusal to grant access to its wholesale broadband services. In other fields, the Court of Justice delivered three State aid judgments (including two appeals against pre- 2010 judgments of the General Court) and two judgments in infringement proceedings (regarding pre EU Accession marketing authorisations for medicines and the reutilisation of data from the public sector). The General Court ruled on appeal in the butadiene rubber cartel case (e. g. in Trade-Stomil v Commission). Finally, the Commission dealt with a merger case with a truly Polish specificity (Kraft Foods/ Cadbury), approved subject to divestiture of the E. Wedel brand. ...|$|E
40|$|On 7 March 2012 the European Court {{decided to}} annul the 2002 {{decision}} by the European Commission {{that it would not}} raise any objections to the current imposition of the Aggregates Levy by the UK government and in particular to exemptions. On 31 July 2013 the Commission decided to open <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedures</b> to give further consideration to certain aspects of the exemptions. This shift in policy will require that the fundamental problems in the definitions that are applied to identify supposed exempt materials are addressed and resolved. Here we discuss these issues and point out areas of ambiguity, indicating the reasons why these cause problems, and suggest solutions...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle {{main engine}} (SSME) {{alternate}} high-pressure liquid oxygen pump experienced synchronous vibration and ball bearing life {{problems that were}} program threatening. The success of the program hinged {{on the ability to}} solve these development problems. The design and solutions to these problems are engirded in the lessons learned and experiences from prior programs, technology programs, and the ability to properly conduct failure or anomaly investigations. The failure investigation determines the problem cause and is the basis for recommending design solutions. For a complex problem, a comprehensive solution requires that <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>procedures</b> be used, including fault trees, resolution logic, and action items worked through a concurrent engineering-multidiscipline team. The normal tendency to use an intuitive, cut-and-try approach will usually prove to be costly, both in money and time and will reach a less than optimum, poorly understood answer. The SSME alternate high-pressure oxidizer turbopump development has had two complex problems critical to program success: (1) high synchronous vibrations and (2) excessive ball bearing wear. This paper will use these two problems as examples of this <b>formal</b> failure <b>investigation</b> approach. The results of the team's investigation provides insight into the complexity of the turbomachinery technical discipline interacting/sensitivities and the fine balance of competing investigations required to solve problems and guarantee program success. It is very important to the solution process that maximum use be made of the resources that both the contractor and Government can bring to the problem in a supporting and noncompeting way. There is no place for the not-invented-here attitude. The resources include, but are not limited to: (1) specially skilled professionals; (2) supporting technologies; (3) computational codes and capabilities; and (4) test and manufacturing facilities...|$|R

According to Article 53 of the Rome Statute, the OTP shall open a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> where there is a reasonable basis to believe that (a) the ICC possesses temporal, territorial and subject-matter jurisdiction in relation to the situation, (b) it is admissible before the ICC and (c) that a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> would not be contrary to the interests of justice. The application of this framework to the events that occurred on 31 May 2010 is difficult and complex, especially in regard as to whether the situation can be considered of sufficient gravity to warrant the ICC’s attention and whether any of the crimes enumerated in Article 5 of the Rome Statute have been committed. This notwithstanding, I argue that there is a reasonable basis to believe that these criteria are satisfied and therefore conclude by encouraging the OTP to open a <b>formal</b> <b>investigation</b> into the situation...|$|R
