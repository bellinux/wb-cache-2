Nuclear spin is useful to perform single-qubit operations, but to make a quantum computer, two-qubit operations are also required. This {{is the role of}} electron spin in this design. Under A-gate control, the spin is transferred from the nucleus to the donor electron. Then, a potential is applied to the J gate, drawing adjacent donor electrons into a common region, greatly <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> between the neighbouring spins.

50|$|Two {{structural}} {{components are}} necessary for integrase binding: a hydrophobic benzyl moiety that buries into a highly hydrophobic pocket near the active site; and chelating triad that binds with two Mg2+ ions in a rather hydrophilic region, anchoring the inhibitor onto the protein surface (see figure 3). In fact, all potent integrase inhibitors possess a substituted benzyl component that is critical for maintaining 3‘end joining potency. Removal of the benzyl group prevents inhibitory function. Lipophylic substituents are therefore beneficial for the strand transfer inhibition, in particular the thiophenyl, furanyl and (thiophen-2-yl)phenyl substitutions. Heteroaromatic amine and amide also cause increase in 3‘ processing inhibitory action.When catechol-based inhibitors of IN were researched {{it was observed that}} maintaining a planar relationship with the bis-hydroxylated aryl ring increases potency. The inhibitory activity could be further optimized by including a meta-chloro substituent, <b>enhancing</b> <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> of the benzyl group with the adjacent hydrophobic pocket (see figure 4: Structures A-G).|$|E

Once viral proteins are synthesized, the viral RNA is replicated, beginning with negative-strand RNA synthesis using the genomic RNA as a template. The fine-tuned regulation of the switch from translation to replication has still not been fully elucidated. In this study, we identified RBM 24 as a host factor involved in both translation and RNA replication in HCV life cycle. First, RBM 24 inhibits the HCV IRES activity by binding to the 5 ′-UTRs of HCV RNA and impairing 80 S ribosome assembly on the HCV IRES.

A series of Ni/Al 2 O 3 -SiC catalysts were successfully prepared by the co-deposition-precipitation method.
