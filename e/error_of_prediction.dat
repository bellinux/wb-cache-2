It will increase the average <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>prediction</b> if the original model is continually used without modification for Ball Grid Array (BGA) packages, which they nowadays are in the majority with respect to quite different types by the industry. In this paper, the variation of these exponents in the original N-L model was demonstrated using the data of different solder materials and package types from some research sources, and different solder pastes from ours. The modified N-L models from Salmela and Dauksher were introduced respectively.

The present work analysed the relationship of gender, age and body mass index (BMI) to <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>predictions</b> by the Cockcroft–Gault equation (CGeq), the simplified equation of the Modification of Renal Diseases Study (MDRDeq) and the Mayo Clinic equation (Mayoeq). Methods. Inulin clearance (glomerular filtration rate; GFR) and other variables were measured in 380 subjects of both sexes, aged 18 – 88 years, with and without kidney disease. GFR was defined as low when < 60 ml/min 1. 73 m 2. BMI was used for defini-tion <b>of</b> underweight/overweight. Relative <b>error</b> <b>of</b> <b>predictions</b> {{was used as an}} index of bias. It was calculated as prediction minus GFR (positive values overestimates, negative values underestimates) and expressed {{as a percentage of the}} GFR. Absolute error was used as an index of imprecision and was calculated as the absolute value <b>of</b> relative <b>error.</b> Results. CGeq relative error was inversely associated with age and directly associated with BMI (P< 0. 001), but not with gender or GFR. MDRDeq relative error was inversely associated with female gender and GFR (P< 0. 001), but not with age or BMI. Mayoeq relative error was directly associated with male gender, BMI and GFR (P< 0. 01), but not with age. Absolute error was higher for CGeq than for MDRDeq but only at low GFR (P< 0. 001). Mayoeq had a higher absolute error than CGeq and MDRDeq (P< 0. 01). Conclusions. <b>Errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>predictions</b> varied not only with GFR but also with gender, age and BMI.

The estimates were carried out using the absorbance values in the near infrared region. 135 samples of rice semolina were collected between 2004 and 2012 from several pet food plants in Costa Rica. The convergence of the results was validated through Bootstrapping techniques. The observations were split in two groups: one data set to estimate the best regression model (n= 120) and a data set of validation (n= 15). The models estimated in the data set showed difficulties with outliers, consequently an observation was removed to obtain the best PLS model.

This study aims (1) at assessing the impact of the variability of observations on vital rates, and then on model’s predictions, and (2) at comparing three methods for computing confidence intervals for values predicted from the models.

A sample of 420 girls aged 10 - 15 years from the Madeira Growth Study were measured at yearly intervals and then 8 years later. Anthropometric dimensions (lengths, breadths, circumferences, and skinfolds) were measured; skeletal age was assessed using the Tanner-Whitehouse 3 method and menarcheal status (present or absent) was recorded. Adult height was measured and predicted using stepwise, forward, and maximum R (2) regression techniques. Multiple correlations, mean differences, standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>prediction,</b> and <b>error</b> boundaries were calculated. A sample of the Leuven Longitudinal Twin Study was used to cross-validate the regressions. Age-specific coefficients of determination (R (2)) between predicted and measured adult height varied between 0. 57 and 0. 96, while standard <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>prediction</b> varied between 1. 1 and 3. 9 cm.

The animals were randomly divided into four plots and placed on B. decumbens Stapf pastures. Three plots received concentrate supplement with different protein profiles and the fourth plot received only mineral supplement. Animals were weighed every 28 days to design growth curve of full body weight.
