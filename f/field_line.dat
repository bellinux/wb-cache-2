5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left <b>field</b> <b>line,</b> to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The new park had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate beneficiary of the change, lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award. It {{would be the only}} time in his career he earned this distinction.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left <b>field</b> <b>line.</b> Jeter ran from his {{position}} at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees {{went on to win}} the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).|$|E

In order to also depict the magnitude, a selection of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> is drawn such that the density of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> (number of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> per unit perpendicular area) at any location is proportional to the magnitude of the vector field at that point.|$|R
5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left <b>field</b> <b>line,</b> scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right <b>field</b> <b>line.</b> It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of the wall, and the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E
25|$|A charged {{particle}} {{moving in the}} direction perpendicular to the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>line</b> is subject to the Lorentz force which is normal to the plane individuated by the velocity and the magnetic field. This force bends the path of the particle. In general, since particles also have a velocity component along the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>line,</b> the Lorentz force constrains them to bend and move along spirals around the field lines at the cyclotron frequency.|$|E
50|$|If {{the vector}} field {{describes}} a velocity field, then the <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> follow stream {{lines in the}} flow. Perhaps the most familiar example of a vector field described by <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> is the magnetic field, which is often depicted using <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> emanating from a magnet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> of the planet’s {{magnetic field}} are not stationary. They are continuously joining or merging with magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> of the interplanetary magnetic field. The joined <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> are swept {{back over the}} poles into the planetary magnetic tail. In the tail, the <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> from the planet’s magnetic field are re-joined and start moving toward night-side of the planet. The physics of this process was first explain by Dungey (1961) [...]|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} method {{to map the}} magnetic field is to 'connect' the arrows to form magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> The direction of the magnetic field at any point {{is parallel to the}} direction of nearby <b>field</b> <b>lines,</b> and the local density of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> can be made proportional to its strength.|$|R

50|$|To make {{a simple}} {{classical}} comparison, consider {{the figure of}} the oscillating dipole. It produces electric <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> travelling outwards, intertwined with magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines,</b> according to Maxwell's equation. This system of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> then corresponds to that of E1 radiation. Similar considerations hold for oscillating electric or magnetic multipoles of higher order.|$|R
40|$|We present several {{examples}} of dayside inverted Vs in which ion convection and energy dispersion appear to span {{the region of}} both open and closed <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> All of these examples occur in the region generally called the low-latitude boundary layer or the cusp boundary layer and suggest a connection between closed <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> of the dayside auroral region and open <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> of the dayside cusp. One explanation is that plasma in the cusp boundary layer on closed <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> convects across <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> in a smooth fashion into the cusp. Such cross-field-line convection may be possible in regions of finite conductivity and strong currents, where the field can diffuse through the plasma. Another explanation for the observations is that they represent the mid-altitude manifestation of merging at the dayside magnetopause {{and the opening of}} previously closed <b>field</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

25|$|The grubber {{is used in}} {{this manner}} to prevent the {{opposing}} team from trying to regather the ball or to force a mistake if they do try. A grubber also ensures that the ball will fall {{in the field of}} play before going in to touch, which would result in a penalty otherwise. A punt in this situation is placed as close to the out of <b>field</b> <b>line</b> as possible, which gives the opposition little chances to regather.|$|E
25|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park, Fisk hit a pitch off of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Pat Darcy {{that went down}} the left <b>field</b> <b>line</b> and {{appeared}} to be heading into foul territory. The image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair {{as he made his way}} to first base is considered by many to be one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole, giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic.|$|E
25|$|For the 1987 World Series {{between the}} Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals, ABC {{utilized}} 12 cameras and nine tape machines. This includes cameras positioned down the left <b>field</b> <b>line,</b> {{on the roof}} of the Metrodome, and high above third base. There have been a few occasions when two Monday Night Football games were played simultaneously. In 1987, a scheduling conflict arose when Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins went to Game 7 of the World Series (which also aired on ABC), making the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome unavailable for the Minnesota Vikings' scheduled game (against the Denver Broncos) that Sunday.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study {{constraints}} imposed on kinematics of the Crab pulsar's jet we consider {{motion of particles}} along co-rotating <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> in the magnetosphere of the Crab pulsar. It is shown that particles following the co-rotating magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> may attain velocities close to observable values. In particular, we demonstrate that if the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> are within the light cylinder, the maximum value of the velocity component parallel to the rotation axis is limited by 0. 5 c. This result {{in the context of}} the X-ray observations performed by Chandra X-ray Observatory seems to be quite indicative and useful to estimate the density of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> inside the jet. Considering the three-dimensional (3 D) <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> crossing the light cylinder, we found that for explaining the force-free regime of outflows the magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> must asymptotically tend to the Archimedes' spiral configuration. It is also shown that the 3 D case may explain the observed jet velocity for appropriately chosen parameters of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

30|$|The {{changes of}} the polar cap sizes and {{positions}} were not {{taken into account in}} the GSM TIP model since their inclusion requires development of an absolutely new model. This is related to the tilted dipole approximation of the Earth’s magnetic field in the GSM TIP model. Geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> in the polar caps are assumed open, while other geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> are closed. The integration of modeling equations for the thermal plasma of the F-region ionosphere and plasmasphere in the GSM TIP model is performed along geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> For the development of the GSM TIP model the grid of the geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> has been kept fixed. Displacement of the equatorial boundary of the polar cap to the equator should automatically lead to the expansion of the open geomagnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> The modeling equations solution on open <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> must be consistent with the boundary conditions, describing the regime of the continual escape of thermal plasma (polar wind). The model does not provide the replacement of closed <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> by the open <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> due to the chosen fixed grid. Errors {{associated with the use of}} fixed polar cap sizes exist and are not easy to quantify. However, we expect these errors to be not substantial.|$|R
25|$|Babe Ruth, who got {{his first}} hit as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920, hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single {{bleacher}} stand, went across the street, and hit a tree over 500feet away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second row of houses, again over 500feet distant and {{said to be the}} longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park. The longest strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams's prodigious foul ball blast that cleared the high roof at the right <b>field</b> <b>line,</b> passed over 20th, over Opal, over Garnet, and came down on 19th Street.|$|E
25|$|On July 6, 2010, the Seattle Mariners trailed {{the visiting}} Kansas City Royals 3–2 in the 8th inning of a game. With runner Ichiro Suzuki on first {{base for the}} Mariners, Mariners {{designated}} hitter Russell Branyan hit a double down the right <b>field</b> <b>line.</b> As Royals outfielder David DeJesus attempted to make a play on the ball, a young fan reached onto the field {{and picked up the}} ball. The play was ruled an automatic double, and the umpires ruled that Branyan would take second base and that Ichiro would take third base, denying him a potential opportunity to score on the play. Both Ichiro and Branyan would be stranded on the bases, and the Royals held on for the 3–2 victory.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the <b>field</b> <b>line</b> and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices that try to use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E

50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>lines</b> {{can be used}} as a {{qualitative}} tool to visualize magnetic forces. In ferromagnetic substances like iron and in plasmas, magnetic forces can be understood by imagining that the <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> exert a tension, (like a rubber band) along their length, and a pressure perpendicular to their length on neighboring <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> 'Unlike' poles of magnets attract because they are linked by many field lines; 'like' poles repel because their <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> do not meet, but run parallel, pushing on each other.

25|$|In 1962, {{after another}} memorable pennant chase with the Dodgers which {{resulted}} in a second three-game playoff series with the Dodgers (after 1951) which the Giants again won by coming from behind with three runs in the ninth inning of Game 3, the Giants brought a World Series to San Francisco only to lose it four games to three to the New York Yankees. The seventh game went {{to the bottom of the}} ninth inning, with the Yankees ahead 1–0. With Matty Alou on first base and two outs, Willie Mays sliced a double down the right <b>field</b> <b>line.</b> Right fielder Roger Maris quickly got to the ball and rifled a throw to the infield, preventing Alou from scoring the tying run and keeping him at third base.|$|E
25|$|Trevor Hoffman came on {{to try to}} {{earn the}} save in the ninth. After {{inducing}} two groundouts back to himself, it seemed like Hoffman, who, at the time, was second all-time in career saves, would finally send the American League to a loss in an All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in a decade. However, Paul Konerko hit a single to left past third baseman Miguel Cabrera, and was pinch-run for by José Lopez. Troy Glaus hit a ground rule double down the left <b>field</b> <b>line,</b> forcing Lopez to hold at third. While it looked like the National League received a break (as Lopez could have possibly scored the tying run if the ball stayed in play), Hoffman allowed a two-strike triple to Michael Young, who went on to win the MVP, scoring Lopez and Glaus and putting the AL up 3–2.|$|E
25|$|In Game 4, the Yankees {{carried a}} 4-3 lead into the 8th inning. But with two out {{and no one}} on, Pedro Feliz lined a solo home run to left off Joba Chamberlain on a 3-2 pitch to tie the game. However, {{in the top of}} the 9th, Johnny Damon grinded out a 9 pitch at bat with two outs off Phillies closer Brad Lidge, lining a single to left center field. Damon then stole second base, and with the infield overshift on with Teixeira batting, Damon alertly stole an unoccupied third base. After Teixeira was hit by a pitch, Alex Rodriguez lined a double down the left <b>field</b> <b>line</b> to give the Yankees a 5-4 lead. Jorge Posada added two {{insurance}} runs thereafter, and Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect 9th to put the Yankees one win away from winning the series.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> {{are like}} {{streamlines}} in fluid flow, {{in that they}} represent something continuous, and a different resolution would show more or fewer lines. An advantage of using magnetic <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> as a representation is that many laws of magnetism (and electromagnetism) can be stated completely and concisely using simple concepts such as the 'number' of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> through a surface. These concepts can be quickly 'translated' to their mathematical form. For example, the number of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> through a given surface is the surface integral of the magnetic field.|$|R
50|$|Divergence may {{be easily}} seen through <b>field</b> <b>lines,</b> {{assuming}} {{the lines are}} drawn such that the density of <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> {{is proportional to the}} magnitude of the field (see above). In this case, the divergence may be seen as the beginning and ending of <b>field</b> <b>lines.</b> If the vector field is the resultant of radial inverse-square law fields with respect to one or more sources then this corresponds {{to the fact that the}} divergence of such a field is zero outside the sources. In a solenoidal vector field (i.e., a vector field where the divergence is zero everywhere), the <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> neither begin nor end; they either form closed loops, or go off to infinity in both directions. If a vector field has positive divergence in some area, there will be <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> starting from points in that area. If a vector field has negative divergence in some area, there will be <b>field</b> <b>lines</b> ending at points in that area.|$|R
