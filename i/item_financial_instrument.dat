40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} pattern of <b>Financial</b> <b>Instrument</b> Disclosures (FIDs) within the annual reports of Australian listed {{extractive}} resource companies (mining and petroleum) over a four year longitudinal period encompassing the 2003 to 2006 financial years. This is an important period to investigate FID patterns as it encompasses those {{years leading up to}} and immediately following formal adoption of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Using an index (FIDI) comprising 120 <b>items</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information to measure the extent of FIDs, there is a statistically significant increase in disclosures over the four year period with the greatest percentage increase occurring on transition to IFRS. Under IFRS, direct comparability with firms internationally can be made. Although the <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements are the same pre- and post- IFRS adoption, the introduction of a new form of regulation makes a difference to managements’ financial reporting disclosure incentives. Total <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures, as measured by FIDI, increased from 34 % in Yr 1 (year ending 31 December 2002 or year ending 30 June 2003) to 52 % in Yr 4 (year ending 31 December 2005 or 30 June 2006), the latter representing the first full year annual reporting period under IFRS. Similar trends are observed for mandatory <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures (comprising 57 <b>items)</b> and discretionary <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures (comprising 63 items). The results of the main model regression analysis demonstrate that the independent variables of corporate governance, capital management, overseas listing and income tax characteristics of firms are factors which are variably significantly associated with FID patterns for panel data. Statistically significant associations are achieved for pooled regression results. Control variables comprising firm size, leverage, top 20 shareholder concentration, sub-industry and return on assets are statistically significant predictor variables of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. In contrast, overseas stock exchange listing of firms and additional income tax characteristics that are related to financial reporting transparency are found to be significantly negatively associated with FID patterns. Discrete items that comprise FIDI are individually statistically significantly associated with the independent and control variables. Similarly, discrete items that comprise the independent variable scores are individually statistically significant predictor variables of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. This thesis contributes {{to an understanding of the}} extent, trends and rationale behind resource firms’ <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure practices in Australia. Further, this thesis examines the association of <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures with corporate governance, capital management, overseas listing and income tax characteristics of firms leading up to and immediately following IFRS adoption in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Business and Management Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Statistically speaking, {{only between}} 4 % and 6 % {{individuals}} {{can afford to}} retire comfortably. When this fact is combined with changes such as a longer life expectancy, disintegration of family life and increasing pressure on public resources to deal with issues such as aids, the increasing need for personal financial planning for retirement becomes clear. Firstly, a framework was set of requirements which need to be met with regard to financial planning for retirement. This includes the need to diversify the portfolio (as a method to manage the acceptable risk level), as well as principles and techniques relating to diversification. The possibility of using {{the services of a}} financial planner to aid with the retirement planning, as well as aspects to be considered in this regard were discussed. It was also demonstrated that a variety of aspects should be considered when deciding on an investment, including market expectations, general economic conditions and the investor's own research, all within a long-term framework. The final aspect considered as part of the framework, was tax. Having set the framework for successful financial retirement planning in Chapter two, a number of pitfalls to be avoided were addressed in Chapter three. These included the investor's planned annual cost of living, since this {{is the single most important}} factor which will determine standard of living during retirement. The planned age at which the individual wishes to retire specifically also needs to be taken into account, seeing that this determines the amount of time he has to build up his investment. The planned rate of return on the investment has to be realistic, but also has to at least keep up with inflation. The effect of inflation could also for example mean that adequate present planning may fall short in 20 years' time. A final aspect to be considered is the importance of taking unforeseen events, such as a potential medical disability, into account. Having set the framework of factors to be taken into account, specific investment options were addressed in the main categories of equity, bonds, property and cash, as well as a pension find, provident fund and/or retirement annuity. Less traditional options such as collector's <b>items,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> or the option to start one's own business were also addressed in more detail. Finally, a questionnaire was addressed to professional people, as represented by auditors in the Northwest Province, with the view to determine the current level of retirement planning and whether or not their expectations matched the theoretic framework as discussed in the previous chapters. Suggestions were made as per the results of the questionnaire by linking the results of the questionnaire and the theoretical framework. Gaps were also highlighted, for instance that very few people as per the sample plan to fully retire, and this changing understanding of "retirement" is not fully captured by current literature. It also seems that professional persons, as per the questionnaire, have an over optimistic view regarding their retirement and funds needed during retirement. Master...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{debate around}} the {{usefulness}} of fair value {{as a basis for}} measuring <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> has become increasingly topical and, in recent times, has attracted the attention of various market participants {{as a result of the}} global credit crisis which developed during 2007. The qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability are central to any analysis regarding {{the usefulness of}} fair value as a <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> measurement basis. This study therefore investigates the relevance and reliability of the fair value measurements disclosed by the four largest South African banks in their 2008 annual financial statements in order to determine whether fair value is the most useful basis for measuring the majority of the <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> of South African banks. The <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> categories and fair value hierarchy defined in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used to perform a content analysis on the 2008 annual financial statements of the banks included in the study, in order to conclude on the relevance and reliability, respectively, of the <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> fair values provided. Collectively, an analysis of the <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> categories applied and an investigation of the differences between the fair values and carrying values of <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> not measured at fair value suggest that fair value is not the most relevant basis for measuring the majority of the financial assets of all of the banks included in the study, and is also not the most relevant basis for measuring the majority of the financial liabilities of three of the four banks included in the study. Based on their fair value hierarchy classification, the fair values of the majority of both the financial assets and financial liabilities of the banks included in the study were not found to be reliable.
