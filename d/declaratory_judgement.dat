50|$|Several family {{planning}} clinics challenged the Rust v.

Many clinics would find it economically unrealistic to separate their family-planning facilities from those for abortion services, and, therefore, would have to eliminate one part of their program. Title X projects now must be deemed “physically and financially separate” from facilities that do provide abortion counseling or services. Title X Projects can not provide counseling that deals with abortion as a method of {{family planning}}, provide referrals for abortion as a method of family planning, advocate abortion in any manner (including lobbying for its legalization or taking legal action to make abortion more accessible), or provide public speakers who promote abortion as a method of family planning.|$|R
