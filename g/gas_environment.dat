40|$|Diamond-based low-work {{function}} thermionic electron emitters are in {{high demand}} for applications ranging from electron guns and space thrusters to electrical energy converters. A key requirement of such diamond-based electron sources is hydrogen termination of the surfaces which can significantly reduce the emission barrier. However, at high temperatures (≤ 600 °C), terminated hydrogen begins to desorb causing degradation in thermionic emission performance. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine low-pressure hydrogen operating environments as a means to overcome this high-temperature performance limitation by enabling increased thermionic emission currents with improved stability at temperatures ≤ 600 °C. A series of isothermal and isobaric experiments were performed in both nitrogen and hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>environments</b> to determine the performance enhancement. Diamond electron emitters in both the as-grown and hydrogenated states were characterized at temperatures of 600, 625, and 650 °C. An increase in thermionic emission current over vacuum operation was observed following the introduction of hydrogen. Upon evacuation of hydrogen to vacuum, the emission current decreased back to baseline levels. Further experiments in <b>gas</b> <b>environments</b> at a constant pressure (~ 5. 5 [*]×[*] 10 − 6 [*]Torr) were conducted at temperatures ranging from 700 to 900 °C. It was observed that the hydrogen environment promoted increased emission current while also enabling the diamond electron emitters to stably emit at increased temperatures compared with vacuum operation. Analogous experiments using nitrogen environments did not show any measurable performance enhancements, thus verifying that hydrogen is responsible for the observed effect. These results suggest diamond-based electron emitters can have improved thermionic emission performance at temperatures ≤ 600 °C when operating in hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

The annealing was conducted at 600 °C/ 1 h and three kinds of environments of vacuum, Ar gas, and 5 %H 2 +Ar mixture gas were controlled. Cold sprayed Ti coating layer (as sprayed) represented 6. 7 % of porosity and 228 HV of hardness.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} concept of {{displacement}} of sorbed methane and enhancement of methane recovery by injection of CO 2 into coal, while sequestering CO 2. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the diffusion behavior of San Juan Basin coal under single and competitive <b>gas</b> <b>environments.</b> The movement of gas in a coalbed reservoir starts in the coal matrix with diffusion towards the naturally occurring cleat network surrounding the matrix blocks. The gas production potential from coalbed reservoirs under different <b>gas</b> <b>environments</b> was, therefore, estimated by studying the diffusion behavior of the coal type. The results clearly showed that the rate of diffusion increases with decreasing reservoir pressure, the increase being exponential at low/very low pressure. As a final step, a simulation study was carried out using the experimental results to predict long-term gas production from coalbed reservoirs with and without CO 2 injection. This was followed by a preliminary economic analysis in order to estimate the feasibility of enhanced recovery method by CO 2 injection by calculating the net present value of a project with and without carbon credits. The results showed that it is possible to obtain significant improvement in methane recovery by CO 2 injection. However, it becomes economically feasible only with carbon credits...|$|R
