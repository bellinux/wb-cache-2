500|$|Upon being dismissed, Borglum wrecked his {{models for}} the monument; the Association sought to have him jailed for {{destruction}} of property. [...] Borglum was addressing the ladies of the Atlanta chapter of the UDC when his assistant, Jesse Tucker, burst in and hurried <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{with a minimum of}} explanation, only moments before a sheriff's deputy arrived to serve the warrant. He left the state, but was arrested in Greensboro, North Carolina, though quickly allowed bail, and the Association abandoned extradition proceedings. Freed, the sculptor soon took up a project in South Dakota, Mount Rushmore. The publicity surrounding these events hurt the Association's fundraising, as did allegations that the Association had misused {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} put aside for the project.|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich Gimpel, {{a hidden}} Jew {{serving as an}} officer at the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht in Berlin. Heinrich is careful and meticulous about {{maintaining}} his masquerade: originally even from the reader, who goes through nearly a whole chapter before finding that Gimpel is a hidden Jew and a leader of a secret Jewish community. Heinrich's specific job is to monitor the American payment of tribute to Germany and detect the frequent attempts to avoid payment. Gimpel is arrested because a friend's wife denounces him as a Jew, without knowing he really is one, because he resisted her sexual advances. Gimpel is eventually released from custody, an SS major who escorts <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> casually remarking to him: [...] "You find us in the oddest places." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dynamite and Beefcake {{escaped from}} the cage first. Smith then escaped the cage to win the match after Valentine had accidentally knocked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|She led <b>him</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and into}} <b>the</b> little garden, where they stopped.|$|R
60|$|He {{rested his}} cue against the table, {{and put on}} his coat. Jimmy {{followed}} <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> which he shut behind him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He shall come back!" [...] said Mrs. Poppins, {{following}} <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "He shall come back, though I have {{to carry}} him myself." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Jealousy" [...] (Bobcat Goldthwait) only appears once, when Herman and {{his sister}} find {{themselves}} in competition for a job. He causes so much confusion and chaos that the original four selves throw <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> followed by a hand grenade.|$|E
50|$|Bunker then {{noticed that}} the second outlaw was {{guarding}} Wilcox and the third outlaw was busy collecting money. He made a dash out the back door. The third outlaw gave chase, following <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and fired, wounding Bunker in the shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|Jason visits Hoyt at his mother's {{house and}} offers him {{a place to}} stay, but Hoyt rebuffs his efforts at reconciliation, telling him not to come around anymore and that they're [...] "over". Hoyt's mother whispers thanks to Jason for {{splitting}} up Hoyt and [...] "that red haired slut" [...] and then mock pushes <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> so Hoyt doesn't know.|$|E
60|$|His {{pleasure}} was abruptly quenched. Billy Windsor, {{placing a}} firm {{hand on his}} collar, led him to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and pushed <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> behind <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should do}} very badly without a Church, Mr. Newton. At least {{that is my}} opinion." [...] Then Ralph left the shop, and <b>the</b> breeches-maker bowed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|And Father John {{got up from}} table, {{and went}} <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> room. As soon, however, as Denis {{saw that he was}} really going, he rose and {{followed}} <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5000|$|T.J. {{brings in}} TUF 24 winner Tim Elliott {{to help with}} James Krause who is his coach, {{teammate}} and friend. But Elliot overstays his welcome at the TUF house when his inappropriate comments about a [...] "winner's circle" [...] rub the losing fighters the wrong way, especially Julian Lane and Justin Edwards who get {{in his face and}} push <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tyb and Sir Johan {{finish the}} entire pie, then mock Johan when he complains, pretending {{that they gave}} him some. Johan has had enough by this point, so he fights with both of his tormentors, {{throwing}} them out. Johan does not have long to enjoy his victory, however, as his anxiety over what the two will do {{now that they are}} alone together quickly sends <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> after them.|$|E
50|$|When {{he returns}} to his club, Robbo finds {{every one of his}} {{charities}} is now a front for counterfeiting. The soup kitchen smuggles fake bills in soup cans over state lines. Robbo also finds Little John living it up in Marian's mansion. Marian is willing to keep Robbo as a front, as long as she is in charge. Robbo shows his contempt for her and leaves, with Little John following <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|I imagined, for a moment, {{that this}} piece of eloquence was {{addressed}} to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her answer.|$|R
60|$|Instead of replying, Matt {{tried to}} push <b>the</b> man <b>out</b> from behind <b>the</b> counter. The young {{auctioneer}} thought {{that if he could}} get <b>him</b> <b>out</b> near <b>the</b> <b>door</b> he would then be able to summon assistance and have the tipsy individual taken away.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are wrong}} in this, sir, if ever {{you were wrong}} in your life," [...] said Peregrine, leaving the room. His {{grandfather}} did not answer him again, but followed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and walked briskly across the hall into the drawing-room.|$|R
50|$|When firefighters {{determined}} {{that no more}} passengers would leave the aircraft unassisted, they entered the passenger cabin with fire hoses and attempted to extinguish the blaze inside the aircraft. By this time, efforts to fight the fire inside the aircraft were futile and unsafe. One firefighter was slightly injured when an explosion threw <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and down to the}} tarmac. The cause of the explosion was not determined, but heat-induced overpressure and rupture of an aerosol spray can or therapeutic oxygen cylinder are suspected.|$|E
50|$|The owner calls {{several of}} his friends to the shop and hatch a plan to {{counteract}} the weapon. McAllister now holds an enormous temporal charge. If he leaves the shop he will return to his time, while the weapon will be shot into the future by the same amount. As he dresses in a protective suit that retains the charge, he realizes {{there is a problem}} - unless he removes the suit he will retain the charge and the motion will not stop. The group seizes him and throws <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
50|$|Archie is {{preparing}} for his upcoming nuptials with his groomsmen, Reggie Mantle, Moose Mason, Dilton Doiley, and best man Jughead Jones. Meanwhile, Veronica is treating her bridesmaids Midge Klump, Ethel Muggs, and Nancy Woods to {{a day at the}} spa. Veronica is sad that Betty Cooper is not there. However, Betty shows up at that moment and her position as Veronica's maid of honor is cemented. Betty brings along a “friend” of hers named Henry who works with her. Ethel states that he reminds her of Archie as Betty rushes <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> On the eve of the wedding, Archie and Veronica discuss their future.|$|E
60|$|It {{lifted him}} off his feet and bore <b>him</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> When he made up on himself {{he knew he was}} searching {{everywhere}} for Tommy. A terror seized him, lest he should not be the first to convey the news.|$|R
50|$|Romina won her {{fight with}} Shkëlqim on the Saturday show as Shkëlqim was evicted with 54% of the vote. Shkëlqim chose Astrit to greet <b>him</b> <b>out</b> to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> telling <b>him</b> {{that despite the}} {{disagreements}} he really valued him, leaving Astrit in an emotional state.|$|R
60|$|The bewildered Perkins {{was about}} to stammer out a speech, when his uncle, cutting it short, pushed <b>him</b> gently <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} night, Marti and {{her father}} are nearly [...] "taken over" [...] too by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as the invasion {{is not an isolated}} incident. Steve is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other [...] "pod people" [...] to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans.|$|E
50|$|A {{consortium}} of William Harrison-Allan, Chris Brammall and Jeff Hooper took the club on and bailed {{them out of}} administration. What followed was a complete restructure with manager Tommy Widdrington going to Southend United as assistant manager {{in the summer of}} 2010. Long-serving Nick Holmes followed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> which left Darrell Clarke and Mikey Harris in temporary charge of a depleted squad in the lead up to the season. They managed to assemble a squad of youngsters over pre-season to go with the players that remained at the club. Striker Matt Tubbs also left that summer to join Crawley Town for a club record fee, thought to be around £70,000.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to initial}} media {{reports of the}} incident, a fight broke out between Alpizar and his wife, after which Alpizar {{suddenly}} ran up the aisle {{from the back of}} the plane. Lonny Glover, national safety coordinator for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said, [...] "As the man came forward it was obvious that he was upset ... That's when one of our attendants at the front of plane told him, 'Sir, you can't leave the plane.' His response, she said, was implying that he had a bomb in his backpack. It was at that point that the air marshals gave up their cover and pursued <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and up the jet bridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, mother!" [...] Gale {{could say}} no more. He did not {{comprehend}} a mood seemingly so utterly {{at variance with}} Mrs. Belding's habitual temperament. But {{he put his arm}} around her. In another moment she had gained command over herself, and, kissing him, she pushed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|George Rockwell (Seitz) {{is young}} and adventurous. He meets June (Caprice), a {{beautiful}} young girl {{on the road and}} decides she will be his wife. But Professor Elliott (Redman), June's father, has <b>him</b> thrown <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> George does not give up and saves the Professor from his cousin Murdock (Cuny), who was trying to kill him.|$|R
60|$|Before Alan could summon his {{scattered}} wits, Lynde glided {{in with a}} white, appealing face. Wordlessly she grasped Alan's arm, drew <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> {{and shut}} <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|Upon being dismissed, Borglum wrecked his {{models for}} the monument; the Association sought to have him jailed for {{destruction}} of property. Borglum was addressing the ladies of the Atlanta chapter of the UDC when his assistant, Jesse Tucker, burst in and hurried <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{with a minimum of}} explanation, only moments before a sheriff's deputy arrived to serve the warrant. He left the state, but was arrested in Greensboro, North Carolina, though quickly allowed bail, and the Association abandoned extradition proceedings. Freed, the sculptor soon took up a project in South Dakota, Mount Rushmore. The publicity surrounding these events hurt the Association's fundraising, as did allegations that the Association had misused {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} put aside for the project.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003-04 season he was used almost {{exclusively}} as a substitute. In mid-December he joined Third Division Darlington on a one-month loan. He played six games, scoring one goal. Upon returning to Bristol he went straight into the first team - though this was at Rovers rather than City. Wilson claimed this was to give Matthews a chance at regular football. Appreciated at The Memorial Stadium, Matthews considered making the move permanent. Caretaker-manager Phil Bater was keen to oblige, however the loan deal ended in March, Matthews having failed to score in nine games. He moved straight on to Yeovil Town, in a loan deal later extended {{to the end of the}} season. In June 2004 he was released by City, though manager Wilson soon followed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|The verger {{on guard}} at <b>the</b> west <b>door</b> had quietly dropped to sleep. He did not wake {{apparently}} when Jongejuffrouw Beresteyn slipped past <b>him</b> and <b>out</b> through <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|Robert {{is finally}} {{caught in a}} barn with the horses. The {{soldiers}} surrounding Robert set the barn on fire {{in an attempt to}} smoke <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> barn are locked. Before Robert can open them, the roof collapses on him and the horses. Robert is saved but badly burned, and all the horses and possibly the dog are killed.|$|R
60|$|If we {{had been}} mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He made no {{ceremony}} of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and availed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without saying a word. The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the library; he entered and motioning <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> shut <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
