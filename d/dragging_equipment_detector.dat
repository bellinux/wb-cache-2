50|$|These {{systems are}} {{different}} to <b>dragging</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>detectors,</b> which {{are looking for}} anything dragging from the train connecting with the sleepers.Low Hose detectors are looking specifically between two wagons, to measure the droop of the brake hoses. The brake hoses need a bit of droop, but too much and they can hit or dislodge.Typically, these systems employ a vertical bar installed {{on one side of}} the track, with infrared sensors pointed across the track at a mate bar with receivers installed pointed back at the infrared beams. When a train goes past, the infrared sensors are looking in the coupling area specifically, and will alert if anything is detected in the area that is lower than acceptable.|$|R
50|$|A {{column of}} cones sits {{across the whole}} width of the {{railroad}} (just like a cross tie) attached to a switch. Anything dragging from the train will hit this cone, thus pushing it back, thus breaking a contact. It then returns to its normal position to prepare for anything else that might be dragging under the train. The detector will register this action and flag it as a defect. Brittle bars are still used elsewhere, but {{still have to be}} repaired. Over time, <b>dragging</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>detectors</b> metal flaps need to be replaced because of extensive damage to them. Single use systems typically involve a frangible engagement bar or a stainless steel wire/braid strung between the rails and typically outside the rails as well, fastened to the sleepers. If the bar or braid is hit by something it breaks, and the circuit break alerts that there is a dragging item. Auto-resetting systems typically involve a pivot pin system to allow the target to reset itself after a hit.|$|R

5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{automated}} detectors, it was the responsibility of on-board train crew and track-side workers to visually inspect trains for defects, and then to bring the train to a halt, if a defect were observed. To detect [...] "hotboxes," [...] i.e., overheating bearings, they would look for oil smoke during the day or a red glow at night. As early as the 1940s, automatic defect detectors were installed to improve upon the manual process. Hotboxes could be detected using new infrared light sensors; high and wide loads by wires outlining the clearance envelope, and <b>dragging</b> <b>equipment</b> through [...] "brittle bars" [...] - frangible bars mounted between the rails. The detectors would transmit their data via wired links to remote read-outs in stations, offices or interlocking towers. A stylus-and-cylinder gauge would record a reading for every axle; if a journal were too hot, or if some other defect were detected, the offending axle would register a sharp spike on the graph. An alarm would sound as well, and the employee on duty at that locality would either use manual signals or the signaling system to bring the train to a halt and, if possible, to inform {{the crew of the}} approximate location of the problem.|$|R

40|$|Neutron {{detectors}} and control panels transferred from Rocky Flats Plant (RFP) were recalibrated and retested for redeployment to the CEF. Testing and calibration were successful with no failure to any <b>equipment.</b> <b>Detector</b> sensitivity was tested at the TRIGA reactor, {{and the response}} to thermal neutron flux was satisfactory. MCNP calculated minimum fission yield (~ 2 Ã— 1015 fissions) was applied to determine the thermal flux at selected detector positions at the CEF. Thermal flux levels were greater than 6. 39 Ã— 106 (n/cm 2 -sec), which was about four orders of magnitude greater than the minimum alarm flux. Calculations of detector survivable distances indicate that, {{to be out of}} lethal area, detector needs to be placed greater than 15 ft away from the source. MCNP calculated flux/dose results were independently verified by COG. CAAS calibration and the testing confirmed that the RFP CAAS system is performing its functions as expected.

5000|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad {{used her}} voice talent {{contained}} inside Harmon Electronics (of Grain Valley, MO) track-side defect detector devices, used in various locations {{west of the}} Mississippi River. When a defect is identified on the passing train, the system responds with her recorded voice announcing the defect location information to the train crew over the radio. In railroad forums and railroad radio monitoring groups, she was and is still {{referred to as the}} [...] "SP Lady". However, with the implementation of newer hotbox detector technology, finding her voice today on working detectors is very rare. The hotbox detectors that had her voice installed in them were not upgradeable to the newer digital signaling requirements, and finding parts for them was problematic. Today, her voice is found on smaller regional railroads, usually only at <b>dragging</b> <b>equipment</b> locations, such as in California at milepost 24.6 on the Metrolink Lancaster line (under the I-5 and I-210 interchange in Sylmar), and in Oregon on the Portland & Western at milepost 746.5, near Lake Oswego. These voiced detectors remain because the lines were once owned by Southern Pacific, and because only two unchanging recorded messages are used, compared to the dynamic changing library used in hotbox detectors. The only major railroad that still uses her voice today is Union Pacific.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a digital imaging method based on silhouette image analysis {{to visualize the}} three-dimensional (3 D) surface profile of textiles, or other flexible materials, and investigates its 3 D reconstruction principle. A prototype of an imaging system consisting of five components has been developed: visible lighting source (white backlighting), sample stage, progressive sample feeding <b>equipment,</b> <b>detector</b> (CCD camera), and analysis software. A sequence of silhouette images of textile surface patches was digitized progressively where a sample was passed through the sharp edge of a crossbeam in bending status, so that the whole 3 D surface profile could be generated {{by a combination of}} the silhouette height profile of each surface patch in the sequence. This non-destructive testing method is effective for the surface characterization or defects detection of flexible materials. It can reconstruct a pure 3 D surface profile of the surface while discarding unwanted information such as surface color. This avoids the fusion of shadows and dark colors, which is a problem when using traditional two-dimensional (2 D) image analysis methods. The Kawabata Evaluation System (KES) is used to validate the effectiveness of this silhouette imaging system (SIS), and our experiment shows that good correlation can be achieved in terms of thickness and surface roughness measurements. However, there are some differences due to the contact or non-contact methods used in terms of the measurement of fuzzy layers in textile materials.

40|$|Kerns, Z., Bennett, D.,Moir, G. East Stroudsburg University, East Stroudsburg, PA The use of {{firefighter}} specific Ability Tests (AT) {{could allow}} firefighters {{to monitor their}} own fitness, and expose areas that need improvement. Those improvements could help decrease chances of fatality or injury and improve performance in firefighting operations leading to more lives saved. Purpose: The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the relationship between fitness parameters and performance on a firefighting specific ability test. Subjects: Nine certified firefighters (27. 11 Â± 10. 56 yr, 89. 74 Â± 21. 92 kg, meanÂ±SD) from the East Stroudsburg Volunteer Fire Department performed the AT. Methods: The AT consisted of 6 events performed consecutively: stair climb, hose <b>drag,</b> <b>equipment</b> carry, ladder raise 2 Ì† 6 extension, search, and rescue. Prior to the AT all subjects performed the following fitness parameter tests: aerobic capacity (VO 2 max), push-ups in a minute, sit-ups in a minute, handgrip strength (Dynamometer), and lower body power (Vertical Jump). Pearsonâ€™s product moment correlations and linear regression statistics used to determine the strength of relationship between variables and to predict AT performance from the fitness variables. Results: VO 2 max (r=-. 812) and sit-ups in a minute (r=-. 787) were found to be significantly inversely correlated with overall AT time. VO 2 max could predict AT performance from the following regression equation (R 2 = 0. 61) : AT time = 0. 148 *(VO 2 max) + 11. 915. The equation for the fitted model with R 2 = 0. 61 is: AT Time = - 0. 148 * (VO 2 max) + 11. 915. Conclusion: The results suggest VO 2 max to be an important physiological variable for firefighterâ€™s performance, explaining 61...|$|R
