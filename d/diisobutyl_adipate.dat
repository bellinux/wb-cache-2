40|$|International audienceThis paper reports new {{measurements}} of the density of dimethyl adipate (DMA) and <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DiBA) over 12 isotherms from (293. 15 to 403. 15) K and 15 isobars from (0. 1 to 140) MPa. The density of diethyl adipate (DEA) in the same conditions has already been published in a previous work. Viscosity data for the three fluids are also presented from (283. 15 to 373. 15) K at 0. 1 MPa. The influence {{of the size of}} the adipate chains on the thermophysical properties has been analyzed. The correlation of the densities against pressure and temperature with the Tammann-Tait equation were used to obtain the isothermal compressibility and the isobaric thermal expansivity. The linear dependence between the tangent bulk modulus at atmospheric pressure and the secant bulk modulus at 100 MPa recently proposed by Kiselev et al. is also used in this work to calculate the isothermal compressibility at atmospheric pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{quality of}} indoor {{environment}} has received considerable attention {{owing to the}} declining outdoor human activities and the associated public health issues. The prolonged exposure of children in childcare facilities or the occupational exposure of adults to indoor environmental triggers can be a culprit of the pathophysiology of several commonly observed idiopathic syndromes. In this study, concentrations of potentially toxic plasticizers (phthalates as well as non-phthalates) were investigated in 28 dust samples collected from three different indoor environments across the USA. The mean concentrations of non-phthalate plasticizers [acetyl tri-n-butyl citrate (ATBC), di-(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA), and <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DIBA) ] were found at 0. 51 e 880 mg/g {{for the first time}} in indoor dust samples from childcare facilities, homes, and salons across the USA. The observed concentrations of these replacement non-phthalate plasticizer were as high as di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, the most frequently detected phthalate plasticizer at highest concentration worldwide, in most of the indoor dust samples. The estimated daily intakes of total phthalates (n = 7) by children and toddlers through indoor dust in childcare facilities were 1. 6 times higher than the non-phthalate plasticizers (n = 3), whereas estimated daily intake of total non-phthalates for all age groups at homes were 1. 9 times higher than the phthalate plasticizers. This study reveals, for the first time, a more elevated (~ 3 folds) occupational intake of phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizers through the indoor dust at salons (214 and 285 ng/kg-bw/day, respectively) than at homes in the USA...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing health {{debate about}} polymer {{plasticizers}} {{based on the}} esters of phthalic acid, especially di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), has caused a trend towards using phthalates of lower volatility such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and towards other acid esters, such as adipates, terephthalates, citrates, etc. Probably {{the most important of}} these so-called "alternative" plasticizers is diisononyl cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DINCH). In the indoor environment, the continuously growing market share of this compound since its launch in 2002 is inter alia apparent from the increasing concentration of DINCH in settled house dust. From the epidemiological point of view there is considerable interest in identifying how semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) distribute in the indoor environment, especially in air, airborne particles and sedimented house dust. This, however, requires reliable experimental concentration data for the different media and good measurements or estimates of their physical and chemical properties. This paper reports on air concentrations for DINP, DINCH, diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DIBA), diisobutyl succinate (DIBS) and diisobutyl glutarate (DIBG) from emission studies in the Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC). For DINP and DINCH it took about 50 days to reach the steady-state value: for four months no decay in the concentration could be observed. Moreover, vapor pressures p 0 and octanol–air partitioning coefficients KOA were obtained for 37 phthalate and non-phthalate plasticizers from two different algorithms: EPI Suite and SPARC. It is shown that calculated gas/particle partition coefficients Kp and fractions can widely differ due to the uncertainty in the predicted p 0 and KOA values. For most of the investigated compounds reliable experimental vapor pressures are not available. Rough estimates can be obtained from the measured emission rate of the pure compound in a microchamber as is shown for di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate(DEHA), tri(octyl) trimellitate (TOTM) and DEHP...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntroduction Modern {{lubricants}} {{are complex}} formulations, which are continually developed to meet increasing requirements for performance and durability [1]. In {{the scope of}} the investigation of more benign lubricants, as potential replacements of oils currently used, we have focused our attention on the diesters (adipates), which have excellent properties for industrial applications. Diesters are obtained by reacting a linear or branched diacid, with a monofunctional alcohol. In the case of adipates, 1, 6 -hexanoic diacid, also named adipic acid, is used. In the present work dimethyl adipate (DMA), diethyl adipate (DEA) and <b>diisobutyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DiBA) have been studied over wide pressure and temperature intervals. The analysis of the effect of the molecular size is performed in terms of volumetric properties (density, isothermal compressibility and thermal isobaric expansivity), together with viscosity and viscosity index. Experimental The density  as a function of pressure and temperature was measured with a high pressure vibrating tube densimeter Anton Paar DMA HPM which is adequate to perform measurements up to 140 MPa. The calibration of this equipment has been performed with vacuum, water and decane [2]. Viscosity at atmospheric pressure was measured with a rotational automated viscometer Anton Paar Stabinger SVM 3000. We have verified the viscosity uncertainty of this viscometer with two Canon reference fluids S 60 and N 100, finding that the deviations are lower than 1 %. Results and Discussion Density measurements have been performed from 293. 15 to 403. 15 K and up to 140 MPa. The experimental density values have been correlated successfully using a Tait-type equation. In Figure 1 it can be seen the molecular structure of dialkyl adipates and the density behavior. At fixed temperature and pressure, density follows the trend DMA > DEA > DiBA. So, it decreases with the molecular size (molar weight or number of carbon atoms). The behavior of the isothermal compressibility for two temperatures can be also seen in Figure 1. This property decreases with pressure and increases with temperature for the three adipates. Furthermore, an increase on T occurs when the molecular size of the molecule increases. Similar behavior has been previously found for other fluids such as pentaerythritol ester lubricants [3]. The effect of changing the temperature or the pressure has more impact on the values of the isothermal compressibility than on the isobaric thermal expansivity...|$|E
