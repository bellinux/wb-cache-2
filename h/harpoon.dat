5|$|Those B-52Gs not {{converted}} as {{cruise missile}} carriers underwent {{a series of}} modifications to improve conventional bombing. They were fitted with a new Integrated Conventional Stores Management System (ICSMS) and new underwing pylons that could hold larger bombs or other stores than could the external pylons. Thirty B-52Gs were further modified to carry up to 12 AGM-84 <b>Harpoon</b> anti-ship missiles each, while 12 B-52Gs were fitted to carry the AGM-142 Have Nap stand-off air-to-ground missile. When the B-52G was retired in 1994, an urgent scheme was launched to restore an interim <b>Harpoon</b> and Have Nap capability, the four aircraft being modified to carry <b>Harpoon</b> and four to carry Have Nap under the Rapid Eight program.|$|E
5|$|When an Iowa class {{battleship}} fired a <b>Harpoon</b> Missile, {{a booster}} propelled the missile {{away from the}} ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 <b>Harpoon</b> Fire Control System.|$|E
5|$|After several failed attempts, they harpooned the {{humpback}} on 31 December 1883. It was {{a strong}} male, and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as Montrose {{and then to the}} Firth of Forth. After a struggle that lasted all night, the <b>harpoon</b> lines broke and the whale escaped.|$|E

50|$|The M28 was {{advertised as}} being {{suitable}} for use for hunting and rescue work, {{as well as for}} general shooting of lines. The advertisement reproduced here specifically mentions its suitability for firefighters, people erecting telephone lines and general construction work. The M28 was seen as suitable for hunting Atlantic bluefin tuna, seals, swordfish and other large marine animals. Among the equipment that could be delivered for the M28 were hunting <b>harpoons,</b> rescue <b>harpoons,</b> rocket-assisted <b>harpoons,</b> 'dum-dum bullets' and rope of various lengths in special crates. The special rounds for launching <b>harpoons</b> were manufactured until the mid-1970s.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool gained four battle honours and {{was seriously}} damaged in two attacks by Italian torpedo bombers. The cruiser {{operated}} variously with the naval {{stations in the}} East Indies and China and with the Mediterranean and Home fleets. While assigned to the China Station in January 1940, the cruiser instigated a diplomatic incident with Japan when she intercepted the liner Asama Maru {{off the coast of}} Japan. Liverpool fought in the battles of the Espero Convoy and Calabria, the Arctic Convoys, and Operation <b>Harpoon</b> during the Malta Convoys. An aerial attack on 14 June 1942, during Operation <b>Harpoon,</b> proved to be the ship's final combat of the war. For the remainder of the conflict, Liverpool underwent repairs and refitting at Rosyth, Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a <b>harpoon,</b> but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the <b>harpoon,</b> killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} to illustrate a theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a <b>harpoon.</b>|$|E

5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to <b>harpoon</b> it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another <b>harpoon</b> into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are opportunistic predators, catching prey which drifts {{within reach}} of their tentacles. The prey is secured {{with the help of}} sticky mucus, spirocysts (non-venomous <b>harpoon</b> cells) and nematocysts (venomous <b>harpoon</b> cells). The tentacles then bend to push larger prey into the mouth, while smaller, plankton-size prey, is moved by cilia to the tip of the tentacles which are then inserted into the mouth. The mouth can stretch to accommodate large items, and in some species, the lips may extend to help receive the prey. The pharynx then grasps the prey, which is mixed with mucus and slowly swallowed by peristalsis and ciliary action. When the food reaches the coelenteron, extracellular digestion is initiated by the discharge of the septa-based nematocysts and the release of enzymes. The partially digested food fragments are circulated in the coelenteron by cilia, and from here they are taken up by phagocytosis by the gastrodermal cells that line the cavity.|$|E

Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her helmet and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a <b>harpoon</b> gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E

5000|$|A {{multitude}} of Birnirk instruments have been found. They were skilled seal hunters, {{known for their}} use of innovative equipment, such as ice scratchers to lure seals over frozen waters. They are characterized by {{the style of the}} <b>harpoons</b> they used for hunting seals and other marine animals; the heads of the <b>harpoons</b> were self-pointed and had a [...] "single lateral barb and an opposing chipped-stone side blade inset". [...] In addition to their <b>harpoons,</b> the Birnirk people were known for their use of ground slate weapons. These weapons include knives, blades, arrows, and spears, usually utilized in hunting terrestrial animals.|$|R

5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the <b>harpoon</b> had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The <b>harpoon</b> gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Catches in 2007 {{amounted}} to 384 Striped Dolphins, 300 Bottlenose Dolphins, 312 Risso's Dolphins and 243 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales, {{for a total}} of 1,239 animals. These numbers do not include dolphins or other small whale species killed using various other methods, such as offshore <b>harpoon</b> hunts, in which mainly porpoises are killed. Another 77 Bottlenose Dolphins, 8 Risso Dolphins, 5 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The quota set by the government for the species that were targeted in drive hunts that year allowed for the capture of 685 Striped Dolphins, 1,018 Bottlenose Dolphins, 541 Risso's Dolphins, and 369 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales. The quota applies to all hunting methods.|$|E

5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Dubrovnik {{was captured by}} the Italians. After a refit, which included the replacement of some of her weapons and the shortening of her mainmast and funnels, she was commissioned into the Royal Italian Navy as Premuda. In Italian service she was mainly used as an escort and troop transport. In June 1942, {{she was part of}} the Italian force that attacked the Allied Operation <b>Harpoon</b> convoy attempting to relieve the island of Malta. In July 1943, she broke down and put into Genoa for repair and a refit. Premuda was the most important and effective Italian war prize ship of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Humpback whales were hunted {{as early}} as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean {{and to a lesser extent}} in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century {{introduction}} of the explosive <b>harpoon</b> allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the Antarctic Ocean beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Great Britain was {{waging war}} against Italian forces in North Africa and their allies, Rommel's Afrika Korps. Malta was {{critical}} to this campaign During {{this stage of the}} war, Malta was critically short on munitions, food and aviation fuel. Attempts to run the blockade and resupply Malta proved to be a failure; previous convoys such as <b>Harpoon</b> (from Gibraltar) and Vigorous (from Alexandria, Egypt) had lost most of their merchantmen and their escorts had been damaged. A new convoy was hence planned for mid-August, and named Pedestal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Harpooned</b> is a {{computer}} game developed by Conor O'Kane for Windows and Macintosh computers. It is a serious game which questions the Japanese government's claim that their whaling program is scientific in nature.

After the successful hunt, two drunken white men kidnap Aba (and prevent Mala from rescuing her) and force her to get drunk. The ship captain rapes Aba, who escapes at dawn. The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a <b>harpoon</b> (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E
5|$|New Jerseys {{modernization}} {{was unique}} in that {{she was to be}} the only reactivated Iowa-class battleship to lose a gun turret. At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove New Jerseys No. 3 16in gun turret (located aft of the superstructure). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a vertical launching missile magazine which would have enabled New Jersey to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or <b>Harpoon</b> missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on VTOL or V/STOL type aircraft; however these ideas were ultimately dropped, and New Jersey retained her No. 3 Gun Turret during her 1980s career.|$|E
5|$|The Conventional Enhancement Modification (CEM) program {{gave the}} B-52H a more {{comprehensive}} conventional weapons capability, adding the modified underwing weapon pylons used by conventional-armed B-52Gs, <b>Harpoon</b> and Have Nap, and the capability to carry new-generation weapons including the Joint Direct Attack Munition and Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser guided bombs, the AGM-154 glide bomb and the AGM-158 JASSM missile. The CEM program also introduced new radios, integrated Global Positioning System into the aircraft's navigation system and replaced the under-nose FLIR with a more modern unit. Forty-seven B-52Hs were modified under the CEM program by 1996, with 19 more {{by the end of}} 1999.|$|E

50|$|On 26 July 1971, {{the first}} Sea King landed on INS Vikrant. From {{then on the}} indomitable team of <b>Harpoons</b> and ‘Mother’ (the carrier) saw a series of firsts. The first {{operational}} ASW mission was flown on 18 October 1971. On 31 November 1971, while on an ‘Advance Screen’, a Sea King picked up a suspected submarine contact and carried out a Vectored attack for the first time. The <b>Harpoons</b> received their baptism with fire when hostilities broke out in 1971. Extensive ASW operations were undertaken and the <b>Harpoons</b> clocked over 156 hours of war effort. Over the decade the <b>Harpoons</b> continued to operate from INS Vikrant as the only front line carrier borne rotary wing squadron and earned the honour and reputation of being the most versatile and baleful of the whirly birds. The squadron got greater punch with the procurement of Sea King 42B which have an improved sensor fit and capability for Anti-Shipping strikes.|$|R
