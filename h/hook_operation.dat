40|$|We {{report a}} case of pedicle screw {{loosening}} treated by modified transpedicular screw augmentation technique using polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which used the anchoring effect of hardened PMMA. A 56 -year-old man who had an L 3 / 4 / 5 fusion operation 3 years ago complained of continuous low back pain after this operation. The computerized tomography showed a radiolucent halo around the pedicle screw at L 5. We augmented the L 5 pedicle screw with modified pedicle screw augmentation technique using PMMA and performed an L 3 / 4 / 5 pedicle screw fixation without <b>hook</b> or <b>operation</b> field extension. This modified technique {{is a kind of}} transpedicular stiffness augmentation using PMMA for the dead space around the loosed screw. After filling the dead space with 1 - 2 cc of PMMA, we inserted a small screw. Once the PMMA hardened, we removed the small screw and inserted a thicker screw along the existing screw threading to improve the pedicle screws' pullout strength. At 10 months' follow-up, x-ray showed strong fusion of L 3 / 4 / 5. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of his back pain was improved from 9 to 5. This modified transpedicular screw augmentation with PMMA using anchoring effect is a simple and effective surgical technique for pedicle screw loosening. However, clinical analyses of long-term follow-up and biomechanical studies are needed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{decision}} support for regional LTL carriers. The basic operating characteristics of regional LTL carriers {{are similar to}} those of national LTL carriers, i. e., they operate linehaul networks with satellites, breakbulks, and relays to consolidate freight so as to be able to cost-effectively serve their customers. However, there are also key differences. Most importantly, because the area covered by a regional carrier is smaller, a regional carrier handles less freight (sometimes significantly less) and therefore typically has fewer consolidation opportunities, which results in higher handling and transportation costs per unit of freight. Consequently, competing with national carriers on price is difficult. Therefore, to gain or maintain market share, regional carriers have to provide better service. To be able to provide better service, regional carriers have to be more dynamic, e. g., they have to be able to deviate from their load plan when appropriate, which creates challenges for decision makers. Regional carriers deliver about 60 % of their shipments within a day and almost all of their shipments within two days. Furthermore, most drivers get back to their domicile at the end of each day. Therefore, the focus of the thesis is the development of effective and efficient decision models supporting daily operations of regional LTL carriers which provide excellent service at low cost. This thesis presents an effective solution approach based on two optimization models: a dynamic load planning model and a driver assignment model. The dynamic load planning model consists of two parts: an integer program to generate the best paths for daily origin-destination freight volumes and an integer program to pack freight into trailers and trailers into loads, and to determine dispatch times for these loads. Techniques to efficiently solve these integer program solution are discussed in detail. The driver assignment model is solved in multiple stages, each stage requiring the solution of a set packing models in which columns represent driver duties. Each stages determines admissible driver duties. The quality and efficiency of the solution approach are demonstrated through a computational study with real-life data from one of the largest regional LTL carriers in the country. An important "technique" for reducing driver requirements is the use of meet-and-turn operations. A basic meet-and-turn operation involves two drivers meeting at a location in between terminals and exchange trucks. A parking lot or a rest area suffices as a meet-and-turn location. This ensures that drivers return to the terminal where they started. More sophisticated meet-and-turn operations also exist, often called drop and <b>hook</b> <b>operations.</b> In this case, drivers do not exchange trucks, but one of their trailers. The motivation in this case is not to get drivers back to their domicile, but to reduce load- miles. The thesis presents analytical results quantifying the maximum benefits of using meet and turn operations and optimization techniques for identifying profitable meet-and-turn opportunities. Ph. D.

50|$|The brassy {{trevally}}, Caranx papuensis (also {{known as}} the brassy kingfish, Papuan trevally, tea-leaf trevally and green back trevally) is a species of large marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The brassy trevally is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian and West Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} the Marquesas Islands in the east, including Australia to the south and Japan in the north. The brassy trevally is best distinguished by its colouration, having small black spots scattered above and below its lateral line, with a narrow white outside edge to its lower caudal fin. The species grows to a known maximum length of 88 cm and a weight of at least 15 kg. It predominantly inhabits both coastal and offshore reefs, as well as inshore lagoons, bays and even estuarine waters as a juvenile. It is a predatory species, moving either individually or small schools, where it takes small fish and occasionally squid and crustaceans. Nothing is known of its reproductive cycle. The brassy trevally is not of great importance to commercial fisheries, but is taken in many netting and <b>hook</b> and line <b>operations</b> throughout its range. It is valued as a gamefish by anglers and spearfishermen, and is considered an excellent table fish.|$|R
40|$|Endoscopic {{carpal tunnel}} release (ECTR) was {{introduced}} into Thailand when this technique became widely accepted. However, the technique {{was limited to}} only a few institutions because of the training required and the very high cost of the instruments. Because of the economic crisis in Thailand, most hospitals in the public health ministry had no budget to invest in new instruments. However, new technology cannot be ignored so the authors modified some unused instruments in conjunction with an arthroscope in order to perform ECTR. A 5 cm by 4 mm slot was made at the mid-portion of an old unused 5 mm arthroscopic sheath. One end of this sheath was reshaped to fit the meniscectomy hook blade. A 4. 5 mm Steinmann pin was reshaped to be the obturator of the arthroscopic sheath. ECTR was performed with this instrument in conjunction with an arthroscope (modified from Chow's 2 -portals technique). The transverse carpal ligament was clearly viewed and identified, and the transverse carpal ligament was completely divided by the menisectomy <b>hook</b> blade. The <b>operation</b> time was 10 to 20 minutes. 30 patients received ECTR with this set of instruments, and they were completely relieved from the symptoms and returned to work early without any complications.

50|$|The {{aircraft}}: Although {{there are}} various types of aircraft suitable for banner-towing {{they have to have}} stable flying characteristics, sufficient power to overcome the substantial drag created by a banner streaming behind the aircraft and they must be equipped with a quick-release hook at the tail. Needless to say, they must be approved for towing operations by the civil aviation authorities. In the 1950s Tiger Moths were cheap and dominated the scene in the Netherlands, but the occasional surviving Fieseler Storch was also very suitable. These aircraft now are priceless classics. Current types are Piper PA18 Super Cub, Vilga, Cessna 172 and other like Morane-Saulnier Rallye, Aeronca Champion, etc. Often these aircraft, when not in use for banner-towing, are used for towing gliders. Some crop dusters are equipped with a <b>hook</b> for towing <b>operations.</b> Nowadays we find that many are turboprop, or diesel powered. Even a twin-engine Dornier D28 has been seen towing a banner.For towing, a grapple hook is attached. Mostly it is in the pilot's lap for take-off. It will be thrown out and door or canopy closed. The Super Cub door has a top and bottom half and the pilot could close it after take-off. The C172 door hinges forward. The pilot has to throw the grapnel out of the window, but the 172 often has a second quick-release under the belly. The hook is attached and released after getting airborne. If the pilot makes a mistake, (s)he will only have a line trailing from the aircraft with the grapple hanging under the belly. The only solution is to land, rectify it and take off again, hoping not too many spectators will have noticed.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{motorization}} of traditional craft on two fisheries resources, viz. tunas and whitebait anchovies, was studied. A conspicuous {{increase in the}} annual tuna catch was seen from 1984 due to the increased effort expended by the motorized craft by using more units of drift nets, hooks and lines than non-motorized craft. The tuna landing increased from 361 tonnes during the pre-motorization period to 1976 tonnes during the motorization period. On the contrary, the anchovy landing came down from 580 tonnes during the pre-motorization period to 386 tonnes on motorization. A decline was noticed in the effort expended for whitebait anchovies but the catch rate did not show a steep decline which indicated that the reduction of effort was not due to the decrease in the catch rate. The shifting over of motorized units to drift net and <b>hooks</b> and lines <b>operation</b> {{seems to be the}} major reason for the decline in the effort of boat siene and nelholi vala which are the main gears for whitebait anchovies. Indian Journal of Fisheries 41 (2) : 92 - 9, June 1994 The motorization of traditional craft was initiated in central Kerala by 1980. It spread to northern and southern areas by 1983 (Balan et al. 1989). At Vizhinjam, the most important fish landing centre in Trivandrum, the motorization was initiated during the middle of 1982. A substantial increase in the effort from the motorized craft was recorded from A 984 which resulted in an immediate increase in the total fish catch at Vizhinjam. An account of the traditional fishery in the area has been given by Luther et al. (1982) and Nair et al. (1988) and the initiation of motorization of traditional craft in the area has been reported by Gopakumar et al. (1986). The increase in Present address: 'Scientist (SG), technical Officer, Technical Assistant the catch and catch rate of tunas and mackerel as a result of motorization has also been pointed out by Gopakumar and Sarma (1989) and Gopakumar et al. (1991). The chief gears operated by the motorized craft at Vizhinjam are hooks and lines and drift net. Motorization has extended the fishing areas of traditional craft to relatively more distant grounds and has increased the yield of certain resources like tunas which are caught chiefly by drift net and hooks and lines. This has resulted in a reduction in the operation of non-motorized units and a simultaneous decrease in the yield of certain other resources like whitebait anchovies which are caught by boat seine, shore seine and netholi vala. To analyse this aspect, the trends offish landing with particular reference to two resources, viz. 9...|$|R
