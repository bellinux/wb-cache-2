5000|$|The Kurians created these vampiric monsters that stalk the night, {{selecting}} victims {{for their}} insatiable masters. Each Reaper {{is an extension}} of its master, and when it pierces the heart of a victim with its long, <b>flexible</b> <b>tongue</b> <b>to</b> drain the unfortunate's blood, its connection to the Kurian controller transfers the vital aura. The Reapers are nigh-unstoppable; not only garbed in bullet-resistant cloaks but also possessing superhuman speed, agility, strength and resilience. Their blood is a powerful coagulant when exposed to air, sealing wounds almost instantly, and the bones of a Reaper are hard enough to deflect most bullets. The most terrifying aspect of the Reaper, however, is its ability to stalk prey by sensing out [...] "lifesign", the energy given off by a living being. The greater the emotional distress of the target, the easier it is for the Reapers to find them.|$|R

50|$|The <b>flexible</b> <b>tongue</b> and tendon guard allow {{players to}} fully flex {{to get a}} full, natural range of motion. While <b>flexible,</b> the <b>tongue</b> is still stiff enough to prevent lace bite which is a common problem among skaters. The tongue is also removable, so if it ever wears out, a player can replace it. Another feature is that the tendon guard can also be {{detached}} with an Allen wrench, so if they break, a player can replace them {{rather than having to}} send the whole boot to get repaired or having to buy an entirely new skate.|$|R
