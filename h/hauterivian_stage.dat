50|$|Abyssosaurus {{is known}} {{only from the}} holotype specimen, Museum of Chuvash Natural Historical Society (MChEIO) no. PM/1, a partial postcranial skeleton. The holotype was {{collected}} in Poretskii District of Chuvashia, near Mishukovo, dating to the late <b>Hauterivian</b> faunal <b>stage</b> of the Early Cretaceous, about 133-130 million years ago. The specimen is thought to occupy an intermediate position between the Late Jurassic Tatenectes and Kimmerosaurus and the Late Cretaceous Aristonectes and Kaiwhekea. Berezin (2011) considered Abyssosaurus to represent the first reliable record of Aristonectidae in Russia. A large phylogenetic analysis performed by Roger Benson and Patrick Druckenmiller {{found it to be}} a derived cryptoclidid closely related to Colymbosaurus.|$|R
50|$|The sediments {{in which}} it was found were {{originally}} thought to represent the <b>Hauterivian</b> to Barremian <b>stages</b> of the early Cretaceous Period, dating Jobaria to approximately 132 million years ago. However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are more likely from the Bathonian to Oxfordian stages of the middle Jurassic in age, between 167 and 161 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|Acamptonectes is an extinct genus of ophthalmosaurid {{ichthyosaur}} {{known from}} England and Germany.

Acanthodiscus fossils can be found in Argentina's Neuquén Basin. Also in the Macanal Formation of the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, fossils of Acanthodiscus have been found.|$|E
5000|$|Kinnareemimus is a genus of ornithomimosaurian {{theropod}} dinosaur from Thailand. It {{is known}} only from incomplete remains including vertebrae, partial pubic bones, metatarsals, and an incomplete fibula. The third metatarsal exhibits a distinctive lateral [...] "pinching", {{known as the}} [...] "arctometarsalian" [...] condition, variations of which are found in ornithomimosaurs, tyrannosauroids, troodontids, and caenagnathids. Its remains were collected from the Early Cretaceous Sao Khua Formation, dating to the Valanginian to <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>stage,</b> at Phu Wiang, Khon Kaen Province. Its early occurrence makes it among the earliest (if not the earliest) ornithomimosaur known, depending on {{the age of the}} formation. Buffetaut et al. suggest the fossils of Kinnareemimus may indicate an Asian origin for advanced ornithomimosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Barremites is an ammonoid {{cephalopod}} {{belonging to}} the family Desmoceratidae, that lived during the <b>Hauterivian</b> and Barremian <b>stages</b> of the Early Cretaceous. Its shell is moderately to very involute, with the outer whorl strongly embracing the inner whorls, and variably compressed. Sides are generally smooth and marked with sinuous or falcate collars marking intervals of growth and bearing feeble striae to moderately distinguished ribs.|$|R
5000|$|Histriasaurus (HIS-tree-ah-SAWR-us) (meaning [...] "Istria lizard") was a genus of dinosaur {{from the}} Early Cretaceous (<b>Hauterivian</b> to Barremian <b>stages,</b> around 130 million years ago). Its fossils, holotype WN V-6, were found {{near the town}} of Bale on the Istrian {{peninsula}} in Croatia, and described in 1998 by Dalla Vecchia. It was a diplodocoid sauropod, related to, but more primitive than, Rebbachisaurus. Phylogenetic analyses published in 2007 and 2011 placed Histriasaurus as the most basal member of Rebbachisauridae.|$|R
25|$|The {{remains of}} Afrovenator were {{discovered}} in 1993 in the Tiourarén Formation {{of the department of}} Agadez in Niger. The Tiourarén was originally thought to represent the <b>Hauterivian</b> to Barremian <b>stages</b> of the early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 132 to 125 million years ago (Sereno et al. 1994). However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are probably mid-Jurassic in age, dating Afrovenator to the Bathonian to Oxfordian stages, between 167 and 161 mya. The sauropod Jobaria, whose remains were first mentioned in the same paper which named Afrovenator, is also known from this formation.|$|R
5000|$|All {{species in}} the genus are noted for {{the small size of}} the pterostigma when {{compared}} to other raphidiopteran species. P. hopkinsi and P. gomezi were described by James E. Jepson and Edmund A. Jarzembowski in a 2008 paper published in the journal Alavesia. [...] P. hopkinsi is known from a fossil found in deposits of the Lower Weald Clay at the Clockhouse Brickworks in Surrey, England. The deposits date to the Late <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Lower Cretaceous. The P. hopkinsi holotype is described from a single forewing that is 11.5 mm long preserved in a section of siltstone concretion also containing Blattodea, Hemiptera, Mecoptera, and Diptera specimens. The wing is narrower than P. turkestanica, with three crossveins between the R and Sc veins, and the second branch of the CuA forked. The type specimen is housed in the Booth Museum of Natural History at Brighton, England, as specimen number [...] "BMB 014915, - 8". [...] P. hopkinsi was named in honor of Dick Hopkins, a long-time volunteer of the Booth Museum.|$|E
30|$|The strata are {{relatively}} explicit, and {{the thickness of}} each stratum is relatively stable. The Angut oilfield is an asymmetrical anticline structure reservoir with edge water, and the major oil layer is in group XIV of the <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>stage</b> {{at a depth of}} 1100 – 1200  m. The lithology is loose sandstone, and the oil layer is characterized by a thin interbed. The average thickness of group XIV is 176  m, the effective thickness is 20  m, and the average porosity and permeability are 17.6 % and 144.2  mD, respectively.|$|E
30|$|In the <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>stage,</b> {{the main}} {{lithology}} is sandstone, consisting of 85 – 90 % fragments and 10 – 15 % cement material. The fragments are mainly quartz (65 – 75 %) and silica rock (10 – 15 %), including feldspar (8 – 10 %) and mica (5 – 7 %). The cement materials are mainly dolomite or calcspar, including small quantities of anhydrite and kaolinite. In the siltstone, the fragment content ranges from 60 to 90 %, mainly quartz (55 – 70 %) and dolomitic cement. The clay {{is composed of}} fine squamous clay-mica bearing material (Ministry of Mines and Petroleum of Afghanistan 2013).|$|E
50|$|Ichthyosauridae is an extinct {{family of}} thunnosaur ichthyosaurs {{from the latest}} Triassic and Early Jurassic (Rhaetian to Pliensbachian stages) of Europe, and {{possibly}} also from the middle Early Cretaceous (<b>Hauterivian</b> or Barremian <b>stage)</b> of Iraq. Named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte, in 1841, it is usually thought to contain a single genus, Ichthyosaurus, which is known from several species from the Early Jurassic. In 2013, Fischer et al. named and described Malawania anachronus from the middle Early Cretaceous of Iraq. It was found to share several synapomorphies with the type species of this family, Ichthyosaurus communis, and a large phylogenetic analysis recovered these species as sister taxa. Despite its geologically younger age, M. anachronus was also assigned to Ichthyosauridae.|$|R
5000|$|Hadongsuchus is an extinct genus of protosuchian crocodylomorph. Fossils {{have been}} found from the Hasandong Formation {{outcropping}} on Hadong, South Korea. The formation {{dates back to the}} <b>Hauterivian</b> and Barremian <b>stages</b> of the Early Cretaceous. A complete fossil skull was discovered in 2002, and the genus was named in 2005 {{on the basis of this}} holotype. Certain features of the third premaxillary tooth help distinguish it from other related crocodylomorphs. The estimated size of Hadongsuchus was around 50 cm in length. Like other protosuchians, it is believed to have been a fully terrestrial cursorial animal with a semi-erect posture. The binomial name of the type species H. acerdentis means [...] "sharp-toothed crocodile from Hadong" [...] in Greek.|$|R
40|$|A new CA-ID TIMS U–Pb age of 130. 39 ± 0. 16 Ma is {{presented}} {{here from the}} Pilmatué Member of the Agrio Formation, lower Hauterivian of the Neuquén Basin in west-central Argentina. This high precision radioisotopic new age, together with the two former ones from the upper Hauterivian Agua de la Mula Member of the Agrio Formation and modern cyclostratigraphic studies in the classical sections of the Mediterranean Province of the Tethys indicate that the <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>Stage</b> spans some 6 Ma, starting ca. 132 Ma and ending ca. 126 Ma. These radioisotopic ages are tied to ammonite biostratigraphy and calcareous nannofossil bioevents and biozones recognized in the Neuquén Basin which in turn are correlated with the Mediterranean standard zones. A new geological time scale for the Valanginian–Hauterivian stages in the Mediterranean region integrating astrochronological and radiochronological data differs with the current official geological time scale which still maintains poorly constraint absolute ages for the Berriasian-Aptian interval...|$|E
40|$|The {{discussion}} is mainly {{focused on the}} Hauterivian and Barremian zonal schemes. For the <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>Stage,</b> the main changes concern the Subsaynella sayni and Balearites balearis Zones {{with the introduction of}} one horizon (Subsaynella begudensis Horizon) and four subzones (B. balearis, Binelliceras binelli, Crioceratites krenkeli, Spathicrioceras seitzi subzones), respectively. For the Lower Barremian, the main amendments concern the introduction of two subzones in the Taveraidiscus hugii auctorum Zone (T hugii auctorum and Psilotissotia colombiana subzones) and of four horizons in the Kotetishvilia compressissima Zone (Holcodiscus fallax, Nicklesia didayana, Heinzia communis and Subtorcapella defayae Horizons). The Coronites darsi Zone is replaced by the Moutoniceras moutonianum Zone in which two horizons occur (C darsi and Heinzia caicedi Horizons). The base of the Upper Barremian is defined by the base of the Toxancyloceras vandenheckii Zone and Subzone. The former Hemihoplites feraudianus and Martelites sarasini Zones are lowered in rank to subzones of the Gerhardtia sartousiana and Imerites giraudi Zones, respectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This part of the Pacific plate was formed during the Early Cretaceous, as shown by northeast-trending M-series magnetic lineations that become younger toward the northwest (Larson and Chase, 1972, doi: 10. 1130 / 0016 - 7606 (1972) 83 [3627 :LMEOTW] 2. 0.

The site is situated on magnetic Anomaly M 8 (Nakanishi et al., 1999, doi: 10. 1029 / 1999 JB 900002), corresponding to an age of ~ 129 Ma and the <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Early Cretaceous (Gradstein et al., 1994, doi: 10. 1029 / 94 JB 01889; 1995).

Unit I (0 - 221. 52 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) is a dominantly olive-gray clay- and radiolarian-bearing diatom ooze. Unit II (221. 52 - 246. 0 mbsf) is a yellowish brown to light brown clay-rich and diatom-bearing radiolarian ooze. Unit III (246. 0 - 283. 53 mbsf) is composed of brown pelagic clay. Unit IV (283. 53 - 377. 15 mbsf) is composed of chert and some porcellanite; any softer sediments present were washed out of the core barrel by the fluid circulating during the coring process...|$|E
40|$|During {{more than}} twenty years, a {{controversy}} appeared {{about the age of}} the Urgonian formation (lower Urgonien Jaune and upper Urgonien Blanc) from the Western Swiss Jura. Depending on previous works, these formations are considered to be Late Hauterivian or Late Barremian in age. This divergence mainly results from different calibration of orbitolinids distribution, as well as divergent sequence stratigraphic models. Because these formations, as well as the underlying Pierre Jaune de Neuchâtel, are linked to the historical succession for the <b>Hauterivian</b> <b>stage,</b> and because they represent the proximal part of a carbonate platform that rose on the northern Tethyan margin during the Early Cretaceous, we developed new approaches to date, as precisely as possible, the Urgonian formations in the Neuchâtel area. At the base of the Urgonien Jaune, high reworking implied that the biostratigraphy did not give an accurate age model. Moreover, biostratigraphical dating can greatly differ {{as a function of the}} used taxon. Consequently, we developed sedimentological and geochemical approach. The boundary between the Pierre Jaune de Neuchâtel and the Urgonien Jaune is clearly marked by erosional and reworking processes, suggesting the presence of a sedimentary gap. Indeed, strontium-isotope dating performed on rhynchonellids shells rather indicate a Barremian age for both the Urgonien Jaune and the Urgonien Blanc. The comparison of the phosphorus evolution between the Western Swiss Jura and hemipelagic sections from the Vocontian Trough helped to precise this age to the Late Barremian, as oligotrophic conditions allowing the rise of the Urgonian platform in a photozoan mode only occurred during this period. Finally, sequence stratigraphic correlation of the Western Swiss Jura with the Helvetic realm, the Subalpine Chains and the Northern Vercors implied that the base of the Urgonien Jaune is characterized by the stacking of several sequence boundaries, which may mirror an episode of condensation linked to a carbonate platform drowning event previously described in the Helvetic realm. Moreover, there is no evidence for an other break within the geological record in the Western Swiss Jura after the sequence boundary B 3 of the late Early Barremian Coronites darsi ammonite zone. In addition, these results are coherent with the fact that the rise of the Urgonian platform began from the maximum flooding surface of the depositional sequence B 3 upward in the Northern Tethys. The Urgonien Blanc of the Western Swiss Jura may thus correspond to the lower Urgonian and to the lower Schrattenkalk formations of the Northern Vercors and the Helvetic realm, respectively. The stable isotopes study of several (hemi-) pelagic sections of the Northern Tethyan margin and their mineralogical contents revealed that the Urgonian platform had a role in paleoceanographic changes that occurred during the Barremian. Whereas the  13 C curve exhibits negligible changes during the latest Hauterivian – Early Barremian, it is shifted toward more positive values from the sequence boundary B 3 upward. This behaviour may be linked to the production and the export of 13 C-enriched aragonitic material by benthic organisms present on the platform. Moreover, the correlation of the kaolinite content along a platform to basin transect through the Northern Tethyan margin showed that the main part of the Barremian was characterized by a humid climate, whereas a seasonally-contrasted climate dominated during the Hauterivian. This correlation also highlighted a differential settling of clay particles, as high amounts of kaolinite were measured in shallow-water carbonates of the Neuchâtel area, whereas hemipelagic limestones from the Vocontian Trough were depleted in this mineral. Thanks to this multidisciplinary approach, the Western Swiss Jura is better integrated within the history of the Northern Tethyan margin. Finally, interactions between carbonate platforms and basinal environments are clearly highlighted...|$|E
