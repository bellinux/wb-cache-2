5000|$|On June 18, 1982 Tom {{went into}} NBC studios for a screen test.

His role of Officer Bobby Nelson was featured somewhat less prominently in the final episodes, with Officer Bruce Nelson (Bruce Penhall), his younger brother, eventually becoming Ponch's partner in the episode [...] "Fast Company." [...] This was due in part to his arrest by the LAPD for possession of controlled substances, quaaludes, during a traffic stop. CHiPs was eventually cancelled by the spring of 1983.

50|$|Donald Duck rose to fame {{with his}} comedic roles in {{animated}} cartoons. Donald's first appearance was in 1934 in The Wise Little Hen, {{but it was}} his second appearance in Orphan's Benefit which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse. Throughout the next two decades, Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films, several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards. In the 1930s, he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy and was given his own film series in 1937 starting with Don Donald. These films introduced Donald's love interest Daisy Duck and often included his three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After the 1956 <b>film</b> <b>Chips</b> Ahoy, Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983). His most recent appearance in a theatrical film was 1999's Fantasia 2000. Donald has also appeared in direct-to-video features such as Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers (2004), television series such as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006-2016), and video games such as QuackShot (1991).|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Limonitic alteration halos associated with two copper prophyry deposits were successfully mapped at Battle Mountain. Alteration halos from both a hypogene system at Copper Canyon and a supergene system at Copper Basin are recognizable in the composite. Both copper porphyry deposits {{are located in}} sedimentary rock units that commonly have ferruginous coatings; yet, in most cases, the hydrothermally derived limonite was distinguishable in the CRC from sedimentary limonite. Large format playback images with pixel sizes from 200 to 400 micron m provided details of spatial resolution and color separation unachievable on enlargements from 70 mm <b>film</b> <b>chips.</b> Details of the alteration halos could be resolved only in the large format images. Two aspects of the alteration halos of the porphyry copper deposits were not mapped on the CRC. The optimum CRC image for the area studied consists of MSS 4 / 5 as blue, MSS 4 / 6 as yellow, and MSS 6 / 7 as magenta using diazo films. The disseminated gold deposits at Gold Acres are not depicted in the CRC image...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, thick <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> {{resistors}} {{with two}} different types of solder alloys namely SnPb and SnAgCu have been evaluated for the effects of the solder alloy elemental composition on the solder joint failures under cyclic temperature loading conditions. The creep properties of both solders have been modelled using the Garofalo equation and the creep strain energy density has been extracted and used as the damage indicator for lifetime prediction. Three thick <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> resistors of different sizes have been modelled and the effect of device size on the failures in the solder joints has been analysed. In addition, both thermal cycling and thermal shock conditions have been modelled in order to simulate effects of extreme harsh conditions and the total damage has been calculated using the Miner's law of linear damage accumulation. Based on the modelling results, the most vulnerable places in the solder joints where the failures may originate and propagate have been identified. Empirical lifetime models have used to predict the life time of the resistor solder joints...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fundamentally new approach for the manufacturing {{and the possible}} applications of lab on a chip devices, mainly {{in the form of}} disposable fluidic microchips for life sciences applications. The new technology approach is based on a novel microscale thermoforming of thin polymer films as core process. The flexibility not only of the semi-finished but partly also of the finished products in the form of <b>film</b> <b>chips</b> could enable future reel to reel processes in production but also in application. The central so-called ‘microthermoforming’ process can be surrounded by pairs of associated pre- and postprocesses for micro- and nanopatterned surface and bulk modification or functionalisation of the formed films. This new approach of microscale thermoforming of thin polymer film substrates overlaid with a split local modification of the films is called ‘SMART’, which stands for ‘substrate modification and replication by thermoforming’. In the process, still on the unformed, plane film, the material modifications of the preprocess define the locations where later, then on the spatially formed film, the postprocess generates the final local modifications. So, one can obtain highly resolved modification patterns also on hardly accessible side walls and even behind undercuts. As a first application of the new technology, we present a flexible chip-sized scaffold for three dimensional cell cultivation {{in the form of a}} microcontainer array. The spatially warped container walls have been provided with micropores, cell adhesion micropatterns and thin film microelectrodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} attenuation factor, Q(_γ) (^- 1), {{has been}} estimated from seismic Rayleigh waves in the frequency range 0. 015 - 0. 11 Hz. The 95 % confidence limits determine a narrow region around all estimates. The observational data consists of digitised Rayleigh wave traces from <b>film</b> <b>chips</b> of the long period vertical component instruments of the WWSSN stations. Events used are nuclear explosions in Movaya Zemlya, the Lop Nor region of China (Southern Sinkiang Province) and the Aleutian Islands. The group velocity and spectral amplitudes are obtained for each seismogram using an improved "multiple filter technique Q(^- 1) (_ γ) is estimated by a least squares regression fit to the subsequent amplitude distance plots. Values of Q(^- 1) (_ γ) are generally larger when determined from Novaya Zemlya (. 004) than for the Lop Nor test site (. 003). The largest values of (. 009) are found at low frequencies (0. 02 Hz), implying a zone of high dissipation in the upper mantle sampled by these frequencies alone. - 1 The observed values of Q(^- 1) *_ Q(^- 1) (_ γ) are directly inverted using an extended Monte-Carlo technique - "Hedgehog". This successfully inverted the data from Novaya Zemlya revealing a region of high dissipation coincident with the low velocity zone, although low velocity is not assumed. The inversion model shows Q(^- 1) (_a) =. 002, Q(^- 1) (_β) =. 0045 for the uppermost 120 km and Q(^- 1) (_a) =. 007, Q(^- 1) (_β) =. 015 (Q(_a) = 140, Q(_β) = 65) in the absorption zone below 120 km...|$|E
