50|$|To {{minimize}} {{the percentage of}} carriers that recombine before reaching the collector-base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority carrier lifetime. In particular, {{the thickness of the}} base must be much less than the diffusion length of the electrons. The collector-base junction is reverse-biased, and so little electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but electrons that diffuse through the base towards the collector are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region of the collector-base junction. The thin shared base and asymmetric collector - <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two separate and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.|$|E

The local lifetime control technique is shown to have major advantages compared to the <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> reduction technique in terms of up to 50 % lower switching losses at the same on-state losses due to a heavily reduced maximum reverse recovery current. Additionally, a softer switching behavior is observed for the ion-irradiated diodes. An explanation for this experimentally found behavior is provided by calibrated computer simulations.

30|$|Sheet {{resistance}} {{plays an}} important role in determining the efficiency of a crystalline silicon (C-Si) solar cell because it is related to the surface recombination velocity. The sheet resistance of a common solar cell for commercial applications is about 40 to 50 Ω/sq, which is achieved with homogeneous <b>doping</b> of the <b>emitter</b> region. This <b>doping</b> method can reduce the contact resistance in the metal–semiconductor interface.

The use of low sheet-resistant emitters in conventional crystalline silicon solar cells usually results in poor short wavelength responses [3]. A lightly <b>doped</b> <b>emitter</b> would provide high sheet resistance and low surface recombination rate, resulting in high internal quantum efficiency in the short wavelength region. However, a lightly <b>doped</b> <b>emitter</b> has a high contact resistance and thus high series resistance [4].

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{recombination}} mechanisms in ion-implanted black silicon (bSi) emitters and discuss their advantages over diffused emitters. In {{the case of}} diffusion, the large bSi surface area increases <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> and consequently Auger recombination compared to a planar surface. The total doping dose is on the contrary independent of the surface area in implanted emitters, and as a result, we show that ion implantation allows control of <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> without compromise in the surface aspect ratio. The possibility to control surface doping via implantation anneal becomes highly advantageous in bSi emitters, where surface passivation becomes critical due to the increased surface area. We extract fundamental surface recombination velocities Sn through numerical simulations and obtain the lowest values at the highest anneal temperatures. With these conditions, an excellent emitter saturation current (J 0 e) is obtained in implanted bSi emitters, reaching 20 fA/cm 2 ± 5 fA/cm 2 at a sheet resistance of 170 O/sq.

25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The <b>emitter</b> is heavily <b>doped,</b> while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down.

Taking into account the grain size (g), the grain boundary recombination velocity (Sgb) and the <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> density (Nemitter), the Gauss’s Law helped us to calculate the width emitter extension region of the solar cell operating in open circuit condition. To determine the width emitter extension region, we first showed that grain size (g), grain boundary recombination velociy (Sgb) are oppesite effects and concluded that best solar cells are characterized by low junction extension region width observed only with high grain size (g) and low grain boundary recombination velocity (Sgb). In a second way using Gauss’s law, we deduced that the ratio R of the width emitter extension region on the base extension region is equal to the ratio of the base doping density to emitter 15 − 3 doping density. We concluded that when N < 1. 5 ⋅ 10 cm, the ration R is practically emitter 16 − 3 16 − 3 constant and when 10 cm ≤ N emitter ≤ 5 ⋅ 10 cm the ration R variation is soft and we finely saw that the emitter contribution to the photoccurent can be neglected for <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> density greater than 10 17 cm- 3.

This selectively patterned <b>emitter</b> <b>doping</b> profile has historically been obtained by using expensive photolithographic or screen-printed alignment techniques and multiple high-temperature diffusion steps. We built on a self-aligned emitter etchback technique first described by Spectrolab. We included PECVD-nitride deposition because the low- recombination emitter produced by the etchback requires good surface passivation for improved cell performance. The nitride also provides a good antireflection coating. We studied whether plasma-etching techniques can use standard screen-printed gridlines at etch masks to form self-aligned, patterned-emitter profiles on multicrystalline (MC-Si) cells from Solarex Corp. This investigation determined that reactive ion etching (RIE) is compatible with using standard, commercial, screen printed gridlines as etch masks to form self- aligned, selectively-doped emitter profiles. This process results in reduced gridline contact resistance when followed by PECVD treatments, an undamaged emitter surface easily passivated by plasma-nitride, and a less heavily doped emitter between gridlines for reduced emitter recombination. This allows for heavier doping beneath the gridlines for even lower contact resistance, reduced contact recombination, and better bulk defect gettering.

An interesting {{feature of the}} complexes is that the HOMO is localized on the Ir d-orbitals and the phenoxylate part of the “ancillary” ligand, while the LUMO {{is located on the}} pyridyl ring of the ppy ligands. A few other complexes containing 2 ′-oxyphenyl- 2 -oxazoline/oxazole ancillary ligands have been reported previously; however, until now {{there has not been a}} systematic investigation into manipulating this unusual frontier orbital distribution to tune the emissive properties. It is shown that exchanging the phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand for 2, 4 -difluoro-ppy gives a blue shift of 21 – 22 nm (from 1 to 2 and from 4 to 5), and the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents (SO 2 Me, CF 3) onto the phenoxylate ring of the (2 ′-oxyphenyl) - 2 -oxazole ligand results in a further blue shift of 13 – 20 nm. Combining these functionalizations gives sky-blue emission with λmaxPL 476 and 479 nm for complexes 5 and 6 in dichloromethane solution. The solution quantum yields of all the complexes are within the range ΦPL 0. 42 – 0. 73. The observed lifetimes (τobs = 1. 52 – 3. 01 μs) and spectral profiles are indicative of phosphorescence from a mixture of ligand-centered and MLCT excited states. (TD-) DFT calculations are in close agreement with the observed photophysical and electrochemical properties of the complexes. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes have been fabricated using complexes 2, 3, 5, and 6 as the <b>emitter,</b> <b>doped</b> in a 4, 4 ′-bis(N-carbazolyl) biphenyl host, giving efficient emission in the blue-green region. Notably, complex 5 gives λmaxEL 480 nm with a maximum brightness of 26150 cd m– 2...|$|R
