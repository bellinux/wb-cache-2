5|$|Tarla Makaeff, {{who paid}} nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought {{a class action}} lawsuit against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC, sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent {{misrepresentation}} and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald Trump as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action {{on the part of}} Trump University clients <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>states</b> – California, Florida, and New York – based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states. He also narrowed the case to five of the plaintiffs' original fourteen charges.|$|E

25|$|Enzymatic {{methylation}} {{of arsenic}} is a detoxification process; {{it can be}} mehylated to methylarsenite, dimethylarsenite or trimethylarsenite, {{all of which are}} trivalent. The methylation is catalyzed by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) in mammals, which transfers a methyl group on the cofactor S-adenomethionine (SAM) to arsenic (III). An orthologue of AS3MT is found in bacteria and is called CmArsM. This enzyme was tested <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>states</b> (ligand free, arsenic (III) bound and SAM bound). Arsenic (III) binding sites usually use thiol groups of cyseine residues. The catalysis involves thiolates of Cys72, Cys174, and Cys224. In an SN2 reaction, the positive charge on the SAM sulfur atom pulls the bonding electron from the carbon of the methyl group, which interacts with the arsenic lone pair to form an As−C bond, leaving SAH.|$|E
25|$|When {{the film}} was released, riots broke out in Boston, Philadelphia, and other major cities in the United States.

On April 24, 1916, the Chicago American reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in Lafayette, Indiana after seeing the film, {{although there has been}} some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen The Birth of a Nation. The mayor of Cedar Rapids, Iowa was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens. The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national boycott of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when {{the film was}} screened in Boston, and it was banned <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>states</b> and several cities.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the Joseph N.

A banker and Sisseton resident became fascinated with Nicollet's story and work after reading Joseph N. Nicollet on the Plains and Prairies, a translation of Nicollet's journals, and raised $335,000 from seven local donors to build the monument. The 80 feet tall tower with 96 steps was primarily built of Douglas-fir from Idaho with concrete pillars and steel bolts. From the top, six counties <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>states</b> (South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota) can be seen, {{a view of the}} Laurentian Divide, the Coteau des Prairies and the ancient glacial valley that Nicollet mapped.

A large part of these gains came {{at the expense of}} the MCA, which soon announced that it would not participate in the new government after the election, as the MCA no longer had a mandate to represent Chinese interests in the government. The jubilant DAP and Gerakan organised victory parades in the national capital of Kuala Lumpur on 11 and 12 May, where participants taunted the Malays while bearing slogans such as [...] "Semua Melayu kasi habis" [...] ("Finish off all the Malays"). An apology was issued soon after the rallies. Nevertheless, the shocked Malays blamed Chinese voters for betraying [...] "the Alliance formula by voting for an opposition that had revived fundamental questions of language and Malay special rights".|$|E

Cervical cancer has been declining over {{the last thirty years}} <b>in</b> all <b>three</b> <b>states</b> and is largely attributable to widespread opportunistic cervical cancer screening. The age-standardized incidence rates of cervical cancer are 9. 6 per 100, 000 women in Hong Kong in 2004, 10. 6 per 100, 000 women in Singapore in 2002 and 18. 6 per 100, 000 women in Taiwan in 2003.
