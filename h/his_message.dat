5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>message</b> to the {{legislature}} in 1904, Beckham again {{raised the issue of}} a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.|$|E
5|$|Morales had {{not taken}} {{a leading role in}} these protests, but did use them to get across <b>his</b> <b>message</b> that the MAS was not a single-issue party, and that rather than simply {{fighting}} for the rights of the cocalero it was arguing for structural change to the political system and a redefinition of citizenship in Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|Raël {{focused on}} {{spreading}} <b>his</b> <b>message</b> in Japan in the 1980s, and by 1987, he met Lisa Sunagawa. Sunagawa soon began accompanying Raël during his travels to Lima, Miami, Brazil, and Martinique. In a television documentary, They're Coming! (1990) by Radio Canada, Raël was seen with four women, while Lisa, in slow-motion, wore a pink tutu and held hands with him.|$|E
50|$|Gwathmey {{is known}} for {{simplifying}} compositions and using symbolic abstraction to create <b>his</b> <b>messages.</b> <b>His</b> style is recognized by the color, shapes, and figures he uses in his artwork.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to writing Chain of Change and journal articles, King has used poetry to share <b>his</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present <b>his</b> <b>message</b> of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|He {{added that}} while he regretted that <b>his</b> <b>message</b> had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, state Sen. Joseph F. Timilty {{resigned}} his Norfolk and Suffolk seat {{to pursue}} a career in private law, and Keating became the only major Democratic contender for the office. In the general election he faced Republican Marion Boch, who promoted a plan for dramatic cuts to legislators' pay and hours, invoking the energy of the Ronald Reagan campaign. Keating focused his campaign on expanding resources for crime prevention and education, tailoring <b>his</b> <b>message</b> to the Boston constituency he would pick up as a senator. He was successful, winning about 64 percent of the vote, and was sworn in the following January.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{returned}} to the campaign trail and entered the General election stretch of the campaign a year ahead of the nominees for the two major parties. He traveled to Universities held press conferences and filmed an eight-minute television advertisement, to be shown in small states and on cable television, to help spread <b>his</b> <b>message.</b> He focused on gaining enough support to win {{a place in the}} League of Women Voters-sponsored presidential debates.|$|E
5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting <b>his</b> <b>message,</b> and so he was placed into a Folding Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Values {{features}} lifelike robotics and dioramas which display incidents from Swaminarayan's life, portraying <b>his</b> <b>message</b> {{about the}} importance of peace, harmony, humility, service to others and devotion to God. Set in 18th century India, the audience experiences eternal messages gleaned from ancient Hindu culture such as non‐violence, vegetarianism, perseverance, prayers, morality, and family harmony through 15 3-D dioramas which make use of state of the art robotics, fibre optics, light and sound effects, dialogues, and music. The hall also features the world's smallest animatronic robot in the form of Ghanshyam Maharaj, the child form of Swaminarayan.|$|E
50|$|Smedley's radio {{transmissions}} to Massa have even achieved cult status, with many Ferrari fans putting <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> on their mobile phones as ringtones.|$|R
5000|$|<b>His</b> primary <b>message</b> was to [...] "do it now". In the marking of Scroll IX, [...] "I {{will act}} now" [...] is written 18 times. While <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> did have Christian {{undertones}} (by referring to Paul {{as the greatest}} salesman in the world), {{it was still a}} message of repetitive actions to build good habits.|$|R
50|$|At Kalayapuram near Kottarakara {{he started}} Bible study classes and open air {{meetings}} where people gathered to hear <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> {{and out of}} respect they wore white dress.|$|R
5|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing began on March 13, 1951, and lasted three days, {{during which the}} Crown called 20witnesses. Diefenbaker alleged that {{the rules of the}} CNR did not require that the telegraph operator listen to the repeat of <b>his</b> <b>message,</b> but merely recommended that he should. Nevertheless, Diefenbaker's motion to dismiss was unsuccessful and Atherton was committed for trial before the Supreme Court of British Columbia (a trial-level court). Manslaughter was a charge for which the accused did not have the option of a speedy trial before a county court judge, and Atherton's case was set for the Spring Assizes in Prince George.|$|E
5|$|The {{prints were}} {{intended}} {{as a form of}} moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress <b>his</b> <b>message</b> on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in <b>his</b> <b>message</b> on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E
50|$|Branch Davidian leader David Koresh used KRLD to {{broadcast}} <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> in 1993 during his standoff {{with the government}} and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, near Waco, Texas.|$|R
50|$|From the Christian Fellowship Centre, Austin-Sparks and his {{co-workers}} ran a publishing operation that printed a bi-monthly magazine, A Witness and a Testimony. This magazine was printed from 1923 until Austin-Sparks' death in 1971. Austin-Sparks also published books he had written or edited from transcripts of <b>his</b> recorded <b>messages.</b> He was a prolific author/speaker and published most of <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> in <b>his</b> bimonthly magazines.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{the company}} was incorporated. That year, Ciright {{developed}} an application, While You Were Out, a pen based executive messaging software, that allowed an executive to receive <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> on a digital tablet device.|$|R
5|$|At first, Botaneiates lacked {{enough troops}} to oppose Bryennios, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had consolidated his control over his native Thrace, effectively isolating the capital from the remaining imperial territory in the Balkans. Botaneiates sent an embassy under the proedros Constantine Choirosphaktes, a veteran diplomat, to conduct negotiations with Bryennios. At {{the same time he}} appointed the young Alexios Komnenos as his Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief), and sought aid from the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman, who sent 2,000 warriors and promised even more. In <b>his</b> <b>message</b> to Bryennios, the aged Botaneiates (76 years old at his accession) offered him the rank of Caesar and his nomination as heir to the throne. Bryennios agreed in principle, but added a few conditions of his own, and sent the ambassadors back to Constantinople for confirmation. Botaneiates, who likely had initiated negotiations only to gain time, rejected Bryennios's conditions, and ordered Alexios Komnenos to campaign against the rebel.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} Franklin D. Roosevelt for the Democratic {{presidential nomination}} in 1932, but facing a re-election bid himself, {{he did not}} announce his support, fearing that <b>his</b> <b>message</b> might not resonate with Kentucky voters. Roosevelt supporters offered Barkley the keynote address and temporary chairmanship of the 1932 Democratic National Convention if he would endorse their candidate. Both opportunities would help Barkley's re-election chances, so he announced his support for Roosevelt on March 22, 1932. In his keynote, Barkley warmly recalled the Wilson administration and denounced {{more than a decade}} of Republican dominance. Applause frequently punctuated the speech, with the longest interruption – a 45-minute near-riot – erupting after Barkley called for a platform plank directing Congress to repeal prohibition. According to Libbey, the remark was not a repudiation of his prohibitionist position but a desire for the people to express their will on repeal. Prohibitionist constituents still supported Barkley because, for most of them, the depression trumped all other concerns.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In <b>his</b> <b>message</b> to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E
50|$|In one American study, {{researchers}} found that less than 20% of messages used SMS language. Looking at his own texting history, the study's author, linguist David Crystal, noted just 10% of <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> used SMS language.|$|R
5000|$|He {{has been}} criticized for <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> {{regarding}} the political situation in Venezuela, and for calling opposition protests in Venezuela a [...] "show"; Maduro responded that Vallenilla is an excellent man, and that critics are [...] "envious".|$|R
5000|$|Defenders of the Bush <b>messages</b> liken <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> {{to those}} of Franklin D. Roosevelt's {{re-election}} campaign, which used images of the December 7 attack by Japan on the United States and advised Americans to [...] "Remember Pearl Harbor." ...|$|R
5|$|Curtin {{replied to}} Churchill and Roosevelt on 8 December, and again {{stressed}} the need to return the 9th Division to Australia {{as soon as possible}} to make good the Army's losses to tropical diseases and prepare for future offensives in the Pacific. In <b>his</b> <b>message</b> he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested only that it travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in <b>his</b> <b>Message</b> to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that <b>his</b> <b>message</b> would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E
5000|$|He is a Basque {{traditional}} folk {{dancer and}} in some academic events, {{in addition to the}} word, he used dance to convey <b>his</b> <b>messages.</b> He is currently the director of the Amilotx Folk Dance group (Mungia, Basque Country) ...|$|R
50|$|In 1550, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576), {{known in}} French as , {{proposed}} a simple grid for writing hidden messages. He intended to cloak <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> inside an ordinary letter {{so that the}} whole would {{not appear to be}} a cipher at all.|$|R
5000|$|... "The claimant's {{ostensible}} {{cloak of}} respectability {{is likely to}} have made <b>his</b> extremist <b>message</b> in these speeches all the more compelling and seductive. For this reason, therefore, <b>his</b> <b>messages</b> would have been all the more effective and dangerous.It is all too easy for someone in the claimant's position of power and influence as an Imam to plant the seed of Islamic extremism in a young mind, which is then liable to be propagated on the internet." ...|$|R
