Drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} process in producing a good quality of rosella tea. The study was aimed to evaluate the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> of rosella tea by using a cabinet dryer. The source of energy for the dryer was from the burning of charcoal. The charcoal was prepared from the coconut shell since it was abundant biomass product. About 7. 5 kg of fresh rosella flower was dried for 17 hours. The total of charcoal consumed was 17 kg. The moisture content of rosella flower was reduced from 90 to 12 %. The analysis showed that the total of energy produced from the burning of 17 kg charcoal was 309. 4 MJ, whilst the total energy needed to dry the flower was 15, 72 MJ. Therefore, the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> was still low about 4. 58 %.

40|$|Summary Bovine hydrolyzed {{collagen}} (BHC) is {{an important}} food supplement normally consumed {{in the form of}} capsules or powder in order to stimulate the synthesis of collagen, promote health and assist in esthetics. The transformation of liquid foods into powders by drying is a difficult operation due to the complex physical and chemical changes resulting from the use of high temperatures, which may result in low <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> and unwanted physicochemical and nutritional characteristics in the final product. In this work, a process engineering approach was used aiming to maximize the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> and investigate the potential of using a spouted bed on the drying performance of BHC. The effects of feed mode, type of inert material and use of an adjuvant on powder production efficiency were analyzed using a 23 factorial experimental design. A statistical analysis showed significant effects of all the independent variables on drying performance. The maximum powder production efficiencies were achieved using polypropylene as the inert material and atomization as the feed mode. Under the optimal process conditions, up to 85 % efficiency was obtained, demonstrating that the spouted bed is a technically viable equipment for drying BHC...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) {{requirements}} for the reduction of energy consumption, European national requirements have been created for building envelope thermal properties and calculation methodology to determine if building energy efficiency is created. This is however not true in all methodologies. The necessity of building air tightness appears only for new A class buildings, {{and there are no}} requirements for air tightness for other building classes. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the methodology for the calculation of energy efficiency of buildings, while taking into account the air tightness of the buildings. In order to achieve this aim, the sum energy consumption of investigated buildings was calculated, energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes</b> were determined, air tightness of the buildings was measured, and reasons for insufficient air tightness were analyzed. Investigation results show that the average value of air tightness of A energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>class</b> buildings is 0. 6 h− 1. The results of other investigated buildings, corresponding to B and C energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes,</b> show insufficient air tightness (the average n 50 value is 6 h− 1); herewith, energy consumption for heating is higher than calculated, according to the energy efficiency methodology.

40|$|The drying of {{distillers}} dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a coproduct of dry-grind corn processing to ethanol utilizes about 30 % of {{the total}} energy required {{for the production of}} a liter of fuel ethanol. Therefore, improving DDGS <b>drying</b> energy <b>efficiency</b> could have significant impact on the economics of the dry-grind corn-to-ethanol process. Drying process improvements must take account into the effects of various drying strategies on the final quality of DDGS which is primarily utilized as a feed ingredient. Previous studies in the literature have shown that physical and chemical properties of DDGS vary according to the ratio of the two primarily feed streams, wet distillers grains (WDG) and condensed distillers solubles (CDS) which make up DDGS. Extensive research using plant-scale and bench-scale experiments have been conducted on the effect of process variables (ratios of WDG, CDS and DDGS add-back) during drying on the physical and chemical properties of DDGS. However, these investigations did not correlate the product characteristics data to <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Additionally, it cannot be clearly determined from the literature on DDGS drying that processes used in the industry are optimized for both product quality and energy efficiency. ^ A bench-scale rotary drum dryer heated by an electrically powered heat gun was used to investigate the effects of WDG, CDS and add-back ratios on both energy <b>efficiency,</b> <b>drying</b> performance and DDGS physical and chemical properties. A two stage drying process with the bench-scale rotary dryer was used to simulate the drying of DDGS using ICM (ICM, Inc., Colwich, KS) dry-grind process technology for DDGS drying which uses two rotary drum dryers in series. Effects of drying process variables, CDS content (0, 10, 20 and 40 % by mass) and percent DDGS add-back (0, 20, 40 and 60 % by mass) on energy performance and product quality were determined. Sixteen different drying strategies based on drying process variable ratios were tested and the response variables were measured which included energy performance (specific power consumption, energy <b>efficiency,</b> <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency,</b> <b>drying</b> rate), physical properties [particle size distribution (PSD), geometric mean particle size (dwg), bulk density, tapped bulk density, true density, color, compressibility index (CI), Hausner ratio (HR) ], and chemical properties [acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), oil, crude protein, starch, ash, etc]. The results of the bench-scale study were also compared with data from a previous plant-scale DDGS production process investigation that used similar drying strategies. ^ Results from the experiments indicated that among all 16 drying strategies, the 10 % CDS content and 60 % DDGS add-back strategy achieved the least specific power consumption (SPC) while the 40 % CDS content and 20 % DDGS add-back strategy had the highest SPC. The energy <b>efficiency</b> and <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the bench-scale data in both drying stage I and drying stage II presented similar trends as process parameters changed. The highest energy and <b>drying</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were achieved in strategies with 10 % CDS content while the lowest were in strategies with 40 % CDS content. A comparison of the energy and <b>drying</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the bench-scale strategies conducted in this study with those of similar plant-scale strategies from a previous study showed a similar trend in the data for drying stage 1, even though the actual numbers were quite different for the two experimental scales. On average, the energy and <b>drying</b> <b>efficiencies</b> for the bench-scale study was 40 % less than the corresponding plant-scale strategy. CDS content had the most influence on the energy performance during DDGS drying, while percent DDGS add-back had more impact on the SPC given a constant CDS content level. By comparing both the physical properties, bulk density in particular which relates to logistics, and energy performance data, the drying strategy with 20 % CDS and 60 % add-back performed the best. Therefore, it is not surprising why this is the strategy used by ICM drying process technology for DDGS. The particle size (dwg) and particle size distribution (PSD) of DDGS varied with the drying strategies; by varying CDS content and percent DDGS add-back. It was determined that the percent DDGS add-back had no effect on either PSD or dgw. Under the same drying strategy, drying stage I always had a higher drying rate than stage II. Also, the drying curves under the same CDS content showed similar shapes. ^ As CDS content increased, the color of DDGS became darker; both DDGS bulk density and tapped bulk density increased. In addition, CI and HR values decreased, ADF and NDF contents decreased and oil and ash contents increased with increased CDS content. Changes in percent DDGS add-back had a negligible effect on the DDGS chemical composition. Overall, the physical and chemical composition analysis of DDGS for both bench-scale and plant-scale studies followed similar trends. ...|$|R
