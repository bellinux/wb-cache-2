These compounds arrest mitosis within a narrow range of high concentrations and induce aneuploidy in recovering cell populations. DES was the most effective arrestant on a comparative molar basis. Estradiol and estriol were less potent as arrestants but were effective inducers of aneuploidy. Aneuploidy was induced in a non-random manner. The smallest chromosomes were most frequently recorded in aneuploid cells. Using anti-tubulin antibody and indirect immunofluorescence, it was found that DES inhibits bi-polar spindle assembly and disrupts the cytoplasmic microtubule complex (CMTC). Estradiol arrests mitosis in a manner that allows spindle assembly. Estradiol has no apparent effect on the CMTC. The naturally occurring estrogens caused chromosome displacement during mitotic arrest. Electron microscopy confirmed that the displaced chromosomes appeared at the polar regions of arrested cells.

The relative estrogenic potencies determined, based on ERa binding to coregulator peptides {{in the presence of}} ligands on the PamChip® plate, were compared to the relative estrogenic potencies as determined in the in vivo uterotrophic assay. The results show that the estrogenic potencies predicted by the 57 coactivators on the peptide microarray for 18 compounds that display a clear E 2 dose-dependent response (goodness of fit of a logistic dose-response model of 0. 90 or higher) correlated very well with their in vivo potencies in the uterotrophic assay, i. e., coefficient of determination values for 30 coactivators higher than or equal to 0. 85. Moreover, this coregulator binding assay is able to distinguish ER agonists from ER antagonists: profiles of selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen, were distinct from those of pure ER agonists, such as <b>dienestrol.</b> Combination of this coregulator binding assay with other types of in vitro assays, e. g., reporter gene assays and the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, will frame an in vitro test panel for screening and prioritization of chemicals, thereby contributing to the reduction and ultimately the replacement of animal testing for (anti-) estrogenic effects...|$|E

In this study, we investigate murine SULT 1 E 1 inhibition and and compare this to data for the human enzyme. 34 potential EDCs were screened {{for their ability to}} inhibit both murine and human SULT 1 E 1 and IC values were determined for 14 of the inhibitory EDCs. Only estrone, <b>dienestrol</b> and enterolactone showed significant differences in affinity between the human and murine SULT 1 E 1. Extensive molecular modelling was performed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. During the MD simulations the ligands moved away from the catalytically active position, something which was not observed when simulating the unit cell of the crystal structure. This finding suggests that catalytically inactive binding modes, other than the one observed in the crystal structures, are possible in SULT 1 E 1. The ligands stayed longer in the catalytically active position in mSULT 1 E 1, which is likely a result of simultaneous hydrogen bond formation {{on both sides of the}} binding pocket, which does not seem to be possible in hSULT 1 E 1. The ligands in the human protein moved to a sub-pocket near the entrance of the active site, which offers hydrogen bond formation possibilities with Asp 22 and Lys 85 as well as favourable hydrophobic interactions. The ligands moved more randomly in mSULT 1 E 1. These observations offer a possible explanation for the substrate inhibition only observed in hSULT 1 E 1...|$|E
