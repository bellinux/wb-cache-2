40|$|Part {{fabrication}} from {{composite materials}} usually costs less when larger fiber tow bundles are used. On the other hand, mechanical properties generally are lower for composites made using larger size tows. This situation {{gives rise to}} a choice between costs and properties in determining the best fiber tow bundle size to employ in preparing prepreg materials for part fabrication. To address this issue, unidirectional and eight <b>harness</b> <b>satin</b> fabric composite specimens were fabricated from 3 k, 6 k, and 12 k carbon fiber reinforced LARC-TPI powder coated towpreg. Short beam shear strengths and longitudinal and transverse flexure properties were obtained for the unidirectional specimens.

Copolymerization of alkyl- and alkenylsilanes (RSiH 3) represents a new precursor system for the production of Beta-SiC on pyrolysis, with copolymer composition controlling polymer structure, char yield, and ceramic stoichiometry and morphology. Polysilsesquioxanes which are synthesized readily and can be handled in air serve as precursors to Si-C-O ceramics. Copolymers of phenyl and methyl silsesquioxanes display rheological properties favorable for composite fabrication; these can be tailored by control of pH, water/methoxy ratio and copolymer composition.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that voids and {{environmental}} conditions may affect the strength of composite laminates. Despite the fact that voids facilitate moisture absorption, the effect of voids on the composite laminates in the presence of moisture has not been addressed in the literature.

This article presents experimental results on the combined effect of voids and moisture in polymer composites. The experiments consider two types of reinforcement (eight <b>harness</b> <b>satin</b> fabric and unidirectional tape), two types of resin systems (epoxy and bismaleimide), and two types of loading (interlaminar shear and compression).

Similar compression strength reductions due {{to the effects of}} idealized nesting were identified for each material. The diagonal nesting geometry produced the largest reduction in static strength when compared to the compression strength of a conventional textile composite.

Although, in oxygen rich environments at temperatures above 500 'C, carbon-carbon composites will oxidize without a protective coating to seal the laminate from oxygen penetration. The outer protective coatings do not provide complete protection against oxidation. Secondary protection agents such as boron carbide particulates are added to the substrate and used in conjunction with the coatings in order to enhance the oxidation resistance. The effectiveness of these particulates has not yet been qualitative and quantitatively measured.

These inhibitor particles included in the oxidation protection system (OPS) react with oxygen that penetrates through the cracks of the external barrier coatings to form a glass phase, and act as an internal sealant to provide extended oxidation protection. Oxidation testing of the carbon-carbon specimens is performed as a function of time and temperature in order to isolate the contribution of the inhibitor. Oxidation at constant temperature examines the importance of temperature on the length of exposure.

Six different fiber architectures; four <b>harness</b> <b>satin</b> (4 HS) woven fabric, uni-tape, woven-uni hybrid, stitched woven fabric, stitched uni-tape and triaxial braided structures have been investigated for optimum stiffness-thickness-weight-hygrothermal performance design criteria for the hygrothermal-mechanical propulsion service exposure conditions including rapid heating up to 200 F/sec, maximum operating temperature of 600 F, internal pressure up to 100 psi. One of the specific objectives in this study is to improve composite blistering resistance in z-direction at minimum expense of in-plane mechanical properties.

The experiments included investigations {{on the effects of}} applied pressure, speed of compression, fabric orientation, number of plies and different resin systems on fibre volume fraction,Vf, of the compressed assembly. It was found that the {{compression of}} dry fabrics followed a power-law relationship between pressure and Vf where the power law index, b, was determined to be approximately equal to 10. 3, 9. 8 and 9. 1 for assemblies consisting of plain, twill and 5 <b>harness</b> <b>satin</b> weaves, respectively. A mathematical analysis was performed for the viscoelastic compression of resin impregnated assemblies of fabrics and a model was developed incorporating the deformation of the fibre network and resin flow through the reinforcement. A methodology was devised for the geometrical representation of plain weaves in the microstructural analysis of cured laminates. The microstructural studies then provided data for the area and geometrical parameters of the yam cross-section; the mean amplitude, wavelength and phase angle of the yarn waveform and the distance between plies at different compression pressures. Cross-sections of laminates with each of the considered fabrics were compared in terms of fibre area fractions, porosity and void content, for the different compression pressures. The aim for the microstructural analysis was to elucidate the mechanism of compression and to follow the development of fibre and pore structure under different degrees of compression. It was concluded that the compression of resin impregnated woven fabrics could be considered as a combination of four modes of deformation; (a) the elimination of a resin rich interlayer between adjacent layers of fabric; (b) the nesting of layers of fabric by slipping while under compression; (c) the deformation of the yam waveform which results in the reduction of thickness of individual plies and (d) the compression and deformation of the cross-sections of individual yarns...|$|E
