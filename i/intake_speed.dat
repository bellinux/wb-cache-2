40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of different feed flavors on feed intake and intake behavior in growing pigs under auto feeding system. A total of 30 barrows (Landrace x Yorkshire) of 95 days old were selected and allocated to 1 of 5 treatments by BW for this 14 days experiment. There were 6 replicates in each treatment and 1 pig in each replicate. Diets containing: CON, the basal diet; BF, CON + 400 mg kg - 1 banana flavor; MF, CON + 400 mg kg - 1 sow milky flavor; SF, CON + 150 mg kg - 1 sweetener and BMS, CON + 400 mg kg - 1 banana flavor + 400 mg kg - 1 milky flavor + 150 mg kg - 1 sweetener. The ADFI in BF, MF, SF and BMS complex group was enhanced compared to the CON, respectively. The ADG and feed efficiency was respectively increased (p< 0. 05) related to the control treatment. The feed intake speeds and feed intake time of fruit, milky, sweetener and complex group were increased (p< 0. 05) than control. The results indicated that feed flavors affect feed intake behavior by elevating the feed <b>intake</b> <b>speed</b> and reducing the time of feed intake to enhance the feed intake of growing pigs and no difference {{was found between the}} three flavors...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether chronic intake of isocaloric high-fat diets differing partly in the source of {{carbohydrates}} (starch, glucose or fructose) and fed at the same level of intake impacts eating behaviour in the adult Yucatan minipig. MethodsAdult minipigs were offered for 8 weeks either of three high-fat diets in which 20 % of dry matter weight (36. 3 % of metabolizable energy) was provided as pure maize starch (SD), glucose (GD) or fructose (FD) (n = 5 per diet). Three eating behaviour tests, including a three-feed choice test, an eating microstructure test and operant conditioning with progressive ratio test were performed before and after dietary treatment in order to evaluate the impact of these carbohydrates on feed preferences and animal's motivation. ResultsAfter 8 -week treatment, all groups had similar increases in body weight (from 36. 2 ± 1. 2 to 57. 5 ± 0. 1 kg, P < 0. 0001). Animals showed initial preference and higher motivation for the GD over the SD, FD being intermediate. Importantly, only pigs chronically fed the FD developed a large preference for this diet: increase in FD intake (from 15 ± 3 to 35 ± 6 g/kg 0. 75, P < 0. 05). After 8 weeks of experimental diets, <b>intake</b> <b>speed</b> of FD (19 ± 6 g/min) was higher compared to GD and SD (P = 0. 001). ConclusionOur data indicate that chronic intake of diets differing in a part of the carbohydrate source induced substantial weight gain, regardless of the carbohydrate source. Pigs’ initial preference and higher motivation was for the GD, compared to SD and FD. Intake of the fructose-containing diet for 8 weeks induced a stronger preference for this diet. Our data may have important implications in terms of impact of prolonged fructose consumption on eating behaviour in humans...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{of alcohol}} use often depend on {{self-reported}} alcohol intake measured by quantity/frequency questionnaires. Previous {{research has shown}} that alcohol consumption may be underestimated by this type of retrospective questionnaire. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} compare the accuracy of an Alcohol Use Questionnaire (AUQ) with a 4 -week diary account. A further aim was to explore patterns of drinking in young social drinkers, with particular attention to binge drinking, which has been suggested as a factor in increasing the risk of alcohol dependency. University students completed the AUQ in the laboratory. They were then asked to keep a record of their alcohol, nicotine and caffeine consumption over a 4 -week period (diary). The questionnaire and the diaries were compared on factors of alcohol intake (units per week) and patterns of drinking behaviour (speed of drinking, number of times being drunk and percentage of times getting drunk when drinking). The two measures (AUQ and diary) were highly correlated on alcohol consumption and the other questions relating to drinking behaviour. However, differences were found between the two measures on alcohol <b>intake,</b> <b>speed</b> of drinking (drinks per hour) and number of times being drunk. Alcohol consumption was underestimated by ~ 12 % on the questionnaire, and, when the accuracy of estimation of drinking habits was examined, it was found that high drinkers tended to underestimate their drinking behaviour, whereas lower drinkers tended to overestimate. The results suggest that the AUQ can be used with a reasonable degree of confidence, bearing in mind the tendency for high drinkers to underestimate consumption and drinking behaviour. Relationships between ‘binge scores’, beverage specificity and alcohol consumption support the idea that the criteria for binge drinkers should be based on patterns of drinking rather than alcohol consumption...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{system to}} recover {{part of the}} energy from man-made wind resources (exhaust air systems) is introduced. A {{vertical axis wind turbine}} (VAWT) in cross-wind orientation, with an enclosure is mounted above a cooling tower’s exhaust fan to harness the wind energy for producing electricity. The enclosure is designed with several guide-vanes to create a venturi effect (to increase the wind speed) and guide the wind to the optimum angle-of-attack of the turbine blades. Another feature of the enclosure is the diffuser-plates that are mounted at a specific angle to accelerate the airflow. Moreover, safety concerns due to blade failure or maintenance activities are tackled by the design of the enclosure. The performance of the VAWT and its effects on the cooling tower were investigated. Laboratory test conducted on a scaled model (with a 5 -bladed H-rotor with 0. 3 meter rotor diameter) shows no measureable difference on the air <b>intake</b> <b>speed</b> (1. 6 ~ 1. 8 m/s) and current consumption of the power-driven fan (0. 39 ampere) when the turbine was spinning on top of the scaled model of the cooling tower. Field test on the actual induced-draft cross flow cooling tower with 2 meters outlet diameter and powered by a 7. 5 kW motor was performed using a 3 -bladed Darrieus wind turbine with 1. 24 meter rotor diameter. There were no significant differences on the outlet air speed of the cooling tower, i. e. the outlet speed of the cooling tower without and with wind turbine was 10. 63 m/s and 10. 67 m/s respectively (the rotational speed of the turbine was 881 rpm). No measureable difference was observed on the power consumption which was recorded between 7. 0 to 7. 1 kW for both cases. This system is retrofit-able to the existing cooling towers and has very high market potential due to abundant cooling towers and other unnatural exhaust air resources globally. In addition, the energy output is predictable and consistent, allowing simpler design of the downstream system...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate then early weaning and concentrate supplementation effect at pasture characteristics, forage intake and ingestive behavior of lambs grazing Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.). A randomized block design was used with four treatments, three replications and five lambs per replicate. A total of 60 Suffolk lambs, that 36 were females and 24 steers. The treatments had corresponded to the combinations between early weaning precocious and concentrate supplementation strategies, that resulted in the following ones finishing systems: 1) lambs kept with mothers without supplementation; 2) lambs kept with mothers supplemented with concentrate in creep feeding at 2 % of body weigh (BW) in DM/day; 3) weaned lambs at 45 ± 5 days without supplementation and 4) weaned lambs at 45 ± 5 days and supplemented with concentrate at 2 % of BW in DM/day. Grazing utilization method was continuous stocking with adjustment every 21 days, to maintain forage offer at 12 % of BW in DM/day. To characterize the pastoral environment was assessed: morphological composition of pasture. There were made four observations the behavioral activities for individually lambs per 24 hours, such as: grazing, ruminating, suckling, supplementation, and others activities. The intake rate was measured using the technique of double sampling and determination of bite rate was made by visual observation of the number of bits made for animal. The behavior and the distribution of daily activities made by the lambs are influenced for the strategies evaluated. The exclusive presence of milk or supplement concentrate in the diet are important modulators of grazing activity, and the absence of these nutrient sources were offset per an increase in grazing time. This response considered the decrease in nutritional support and lower efficiency in harvesting the forage by lambs. The weaning influenced the morphological characteristics of the pasture, which showed favored the grazing by lamb when their mother was present. The results obtained in the evaluation of forage intake indicated that weaning was affected by the variables that describe the grazing process, except for bite mass and <b>intake</b> <b>speed.</b> We conclude that the finishing of early weaned lambs at grazing causes changes at pasture characteristics, which may limit forage intake.

So jets sized for full power tend to starve the engine at lower speed and part throttle. Most commonly this has been corrected by using multiple jets. In SU and other movable jet carburetors, it was corrected by varying the jet size. For cold starting, a different principle was used in multi-jet carburetors. A flow resisting valve called a choke, similar to the throttle valve, was placed upstream of the main jet to reduce the intake pressure and suck additional fuel out of the jets.|$|R

In Southern China, the {{prevalence}} of childhood obesity increased from 6. 2 to 7. 5  % between 2007 and 2011. This study aimed to report the current prevalence of overweight and obesity, analyzed the early life and behavioral determinants of obesity, and investigated the weight-loss practices among Chinese children in Guangzhou. Methods Three thousand seven hundred sixty-six primary school students aged 7 – 12 years were recruited in Guangzhou, China in 2013. Questionnaires {{were used to assess}} (1) early life factors: birth weight, delivery mode, gestational age and feeding patterns; (2) behavioral factors: dietary <b>intake,</b> eating <b>speed,</b> sedentary time, physical activities and sleep duration; and (3) weight-loss practices: improving diet, increasing exercise, taking weight-loss drugs and undergoing a diet. The criteria of Working Group of Obesity in China were applied to classify overweight and obesity based on measured weight and height. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the determinants of overweight/obesity and adoption of weight-loss practices. Results The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity were 11. 2 and 10. 0  %, respectively. High birth weight (≥ 4. 0  kg versus 2. 5 [*]~[*] 4. 0  kg, odd ratio [OR]: 2. 34; 95  % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 53 – 3. 58), sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) intake (OR: 1. 39; 95  % CI: 1. 05 – 1. 85), vegetable intake (OR: 1. 12; 95  % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 24), and doing homework (OR: 1. 24; 95  % CI: 1. 08 – 1. 43) were positively associated with obesity. Eating speed faster than peers was positively associated with obesity and yielded the highest OR (versus “as fast as peers”, OR: 3. 18; 95  % CI: 2. 28 – 4. 44). Approximately 57, 81 and 87  % of normal-weight, overweight and obese children, respectively, reported weight-loss practices. Self-perception of weight status presented as the strongest determinant for weight-loss practices. Conclusions The prevalence of overweight and obesity were high in Chinese children in Guangzhou, and both were higher than previous level in 2011. Further research should address the unhealthy dietary (e. g. SSBs <b>intake,</b> fast eating <b>speed)</b> and sedentary behaviors (e. g. doing homework) of these children.

Carbon-carbon bond-scission reactions in the low-temperature oxidation chemistry may provide an explanation for the intermediate-temperature heat release observed in the engine experiments. Overall, the results indicate that isopentanol has a good potential as a HCCI fuel, either in neat form or in blend with gasoline...|$|R
