50|$|In other words, {{double top}} twins and <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> twins are with-trend signals, when the {{underlying}} short time frame double tops or <b>double</b> <b>bottoms</b> (reversal signals) fail. The price action trader predicts that other traders {{trading on the}} shorter time scale will trade the simple double top or <b>double</b> <b>bottom,</b> and if the market moves against them, the price action trader will take a position against them, placing an entry stop order 1 tick above the top or below the bottom, {{with the aim of}} benefitting from the exacerbated market movement caused by those trapped traders bailing out.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a comparison with experimental {{data of the}} resistance of stiffened panels to penetration damage. It also carried out comparisons between numerical simulations and experiments investigating the grounding of ships. The finite element method and FEA software are used to predict penetration damage and this modelling simulation is then extended to investigate damage to a ship’s <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structure in different grounding scenarios. The progressive failure of the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> is investigated in terms of plastic deformation and also the evolution of damage including material rupture. Three different levels of complexity were used in modelling the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structure concerning {{the inner and outer}} shell plating; longitudinal stiffeners in the shell plating, and structures with stiffening in longitudinal floors. The analysis was carried out in the ABAQUS explicit code. The results presented include the crushing force as a function of time, an investigation of the energies involved in the plastic deformation and rupture of the <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> structure, and comparisons with experimental data where available...|$|R

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>bottoms</b> are {{significantly}} safer than single bottoms.

40|$|Achieving the <b>Double</b> <b>Bottom</b> Line: A Framework for Corporations Seeking to Deliver Profits and Public Services {{argues that}} many people who object to for-profit {{corporations}} that deliver public services, such as kindergarten through 12 th grade education or foster care, have greatly exaggerated {{the extent to which}} the for-profit regime will compel such corporations to subordinate the delivery of those services to financial considerations. Because of this over-exaggeration, these opponents have not focused on designing a framework that would assist these entities in meeting their <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line—achieving profit for their shareholders while also delivering a high quality public service. The Article seeks to remedy this failure. The Article therefore proposes that <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line corporations be required to have an independent committee, similar to the audit committee, which would focus not on financial issues, but rather on issues pertaining to the attainment of the entities’ public goals. By providing for both committees within the corporate framework, this proposal makes it more likely that <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> line corporations actually achieve their dual objectives...|$|R

50|$|When {{the market}} reaches an extreme {{price in the}} trader's view, it often pulls back from the price only to return to that price level again. In the {{situation}} where that price level holds and the market retreats again, the two reversals at that level are known as a double top bear flag or a <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> bull flag, or simply double top / <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> and indicate that the retrace will continue.|$|R

50|$|Consecutive bars with {{relatively}} large bodies, small tails {{and the same}} high price formed at the highest point of a chart are interpreted as double top twins. The opposite is so for <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> twins. These patterns appear on as shorter time scale as a double top or a <b>double</b> <b>bottom.</b> Since signals on shorter time scales are per se quicker and therefore on average weaker, price action traders will take a position against the signal when it is seen to fail.|$|R

30|$|We have {{designed}} and analyzed {{the performance of}} solar cells by considering various parameters. It is observed {{that the combination of}} metal layer at the bottom with grating and DBR reduces the requirement of DBR pairs. The <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> grating-based solar cell showed better performance against to single grating. Our results showed that the use of <b>bottom</b> <b>double</b> grating is helpful to diffract longer wavelength whereas top grating is found to be a promising one to diffract shorter wavelength of solar spectrum. A relative enhancement in short-circuit current approximately 68 % and 55 % is achieved with dual grating and <b>double</b> <b>bottom</b> grating-based solar cells, respectively. This presented designing of solar cell is helpful to trap UV and infrared part of solar spectrum whereas fabrication challenges remain.|$|R
