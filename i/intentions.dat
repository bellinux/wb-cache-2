40|$|Abstract—The human {{friendly}} {{interaction is}} the key function of a human-centered system. Over the years, it has received much attention to develop the convenient interaction through <b>intention</b> recognition. <b>Intention</b> recognition processes multimodal inputs including speech, face images, and body gestures. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach of <b>intention</b> recognition using a graph representation called <b>Intention</b> Graph. A concept of valid <b>intention</b> is proposed, as a target of <b>intention</b> recognition. Our approach has two phases: goal recognition phase and <b>intention</b> recognition phase. In the goal recognition phase, we generate an action graph based on the observed actions, and then the candidate goals and their plans are recognized. In the <b>intention</b> recognition phase, the <b>intention</b> is recognized with relevant goals and user profile. We show that the algorithm has polynomial time complexity. The <b>intention</b> graph is applied to a simple briefcase domain to test our model. T Keywords—Intention recognition, <b>intention,</b> graph, HCI...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Weight gain {{prevention}} (WGP) {{among adults}} who are overweight is an important target {{in the prevention of}} obesity. However, {{little is known about the}} process from WGP as a goal to successful weight-management. The present study aimed to: (i) gain more insight into this process; (ii) identify cognitive predictors of <b>intention</b> for WGP; and (iii) examine WGP as a potential predictor for the <b>intention</b> to change weight-related behaviours [dietary intake (DI) and physical activity (PA) ] and specific action planning. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, overweight adults [n = 510; body mass index 25 - 30 kg m(- 2); mean (SD) age 48 (9. 5) years; 30. 8 % male] completed an online questionnaire, assessing goal <b>intention</b> for WGP, behavioural <b>intention</b> for DI and PA, planning for change in DI and PA and socio-cognitive correlates. Ordinal regression analyses were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: In 89 % of the sample, (parts of) the proposed sequence from goal <b>intention</b> (for WGP), behavioural <b>intention</b> (for DI/PA) and planning (for DI/PA) was observed. Attitude, social norm and perceived control towards WGP, and perceived weight status and risk perception, were associated with <b>intention</b> for WGP. Behaviour-specific perceived control and preferences were more strongly associated with <b>intention</b> to change DI or PA and planning for change than <b>intention</b> for WGP was. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Intention</b> for WGP is important in the process toward weight-management because, for most people, <b>intention</b> for WGP precedes behavioural <b>intention,</b> which precedes planning. <b>Intention</b> for WGP is associated with behavioural <b>intention</b> but behaviour-specific factors are the strongest correlates of behavioural <b>intention</b> and planning...|$|R

Thinking of <b>intention</b> as a judgement, as Davidson did, raises another question. What connection between one’s <b>intention</b> and his movement does it need for the movement to be an action?

My <b>intention</b> (disposition) to do A implies that I will do A if some conditions are met. In this respect, it looks better than Davidson's theory. However, there are some differences between <b>intention</b> and disposition. 1) It is impossible that I fail to know what <b>intention</b> I have, but it is possible that I do not know what disposition I have. 2) One can have <b>intention</b> to do A in a proper sense or in an accidental sense.
