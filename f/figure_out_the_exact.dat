500|$|Much of {{the beliefs}} held by Han-era {{physicians}} {{are known to}} modern historians through such texts as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (Huangdi neijing) medical corpus, which was compiled from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE and was mentioned in the Book of Later Han. It is clear from this text and others that their metaphysical beliefs in the five phases and yin and yang dictated their medical decisions and assumptions. The Han-era Chinese believed that each organ in the body was associated {{with one of the}} five phases (metal 金, wood 木, water 水, fire 火, earth 土) and had two circulatory qi channels (任督二脉). If these channels were disrupted, Han medical texts suggest that one should consume an edible material associated with one of these phases that would counteract the organ's prescribed phase and thus restore one's health. For example, the Chinese believed that when the heart—associated with the fire phase—caused one to become sluggish, then one should eat sour food because it was associated with the wood phase (which promoted fire). The Han Chinese also believed that by using pulse diagnosis, a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted [...] "vital energy" [...] (qi) and what qualities the latter had, in order to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> disorder the patient was suffering. Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine, Han texts also give practical advice, such as the proper way to perform clinical lancing to remove an abscess. The Huangdi neijing noted the symptoms and reactions of people with various diseases of the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidneys in a 24-hour period, which was a recognition of circadian rhythm, although explained in terms of the five phases.|$|E

According to Von Morgenstern, some Paraguayan miners while working nearby some hills at the Caaguazú Department found some stones with ancient letters carved in them.

Other interviewees disagreed, saying that positioning is not a huge problem and does not greatly affect the maintenance decision. However, no statistical study shows the number of positioning problems over the whole data.

30|$|Contact here {{becomes the}} driver for {{promoting}} diversity-advantages, which basically means {{the use of}} diversity as a policy resource for cultivating some public benefits: creativity, social and economic development, community cohesion, community identity, sense of city belonging. The premise is clear: only within diversity can we create the conditions for living within diversity. This view of diversity as a resource is probably instrumental, because it originally comes from the initial approach on diversity of business, urban and even social psychology studies. All these approaches deal with diversity {{in terms of what}} it can produce in relation to benefits. As a policy paradigm, IC views diversity production as public benefits. The assumption is that contact can only produce positive outcomes if it is done under equal conditions and in the context of power sharing. This supposition becomes the premise for policy engineering. Evidence tells us that creative cities, economically developed cities in our global world are all-diverse and have taken diversity as a resource to produce positive outcomes. IC is a policy tool for this. It follows that IC does not have a direct interest in justice (as MC does), its interest lie on making diversity work. Without this view of diversity as advantage, IC would simply lose its normative meaning. It is much more than the simplification made by Joppke (2018), when he states that diversity is “business-minded” in interculturalism. The link between diversity, creativity and development is something that is absent in the MC normative project. In this sense IC becomes some sort of policy engineering since is seeks to promote contact as a way to cultivate a resource that could only have in short and long terms, public benefits at the individual and social levels. It is at this point where its normative force and its political attractiveness resides. To <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what are <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> contents of <b>the</b> advantages when we “make diversity work” through contact promotion {{is probably one of the}} research areas that will require deep exploration in the coming years.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{applications}} of the reluctance torque motor have been quite limited due to their inherent limitation of noise and vibration and thus, researches on the reluctance motor have been limited as well. However, with the tremendous increase {{in the cost of}} rare earth material magnets, studies of the reluctance torque motor are being conducted more and more. In principle, reluctance torque is generated when the inductance is changed. Therefore, in order to generate continuous torque in the switched reluctance motor, it is necessary to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> inductance level corresponding to the rotor position and the current level to be applied in that rotor position, respectively. If the current level or the rotor position is not accurately determined, then the generated reluctance torque becomes unstable and undesirable torque ripples prevail to eventually cause noise and vibra-tions. In this research, a flux switched reluctance motor (FSRM), which is classified into the switched reluc-tance motor (SRM), was studied. A methodology using the current shaping control according to the rotor position was proposed. Based on the proposed methodology, the optimal current waveform and the torque dis-tribution function for the FSRM to minimize torque ripple was established and demonstrated in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Nový Svět Glass Factory in Harrachov {{represented}} {{the best of}} what was achieved in the field of refined glass production {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century, not only in the technological arena, but also in the artistic one. Absolutely key in achieving these extraordinary results lies within the personality of Johann Pohl, who had ran the glass factory between 1808 - 1850. Pohl was not just an expert in the area of glass technology, but he was also an extraordinary administrator and economist. And he showed the same talent as a glass refiner. His exceptional artistic sensibility helped him precisely to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> proportion, tectonics and refinement of the manufactured products. Of the technological innovations that the glass factory introduced during this period, the most important was the melting of ceramic incrustations into the glass. The factory was already able to handle this perfectly by the end of the 1820 s, making it the equal of the French and English glass producers of the time. At the same time, the production of colored glass prevailed over clear glass, because it better served the aesthetic demands of customers, or rather, of buyers and merchants. The Harrachov Glass Factory was among the leaders in this field in Central Europe, as its range of colored molten glasses was respectable [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{weighting}} {{process to}} justify the importance of different items. This paper is about how the estimator distributes profiling the weights to different items. This paper is about using design of psychological experiment {{to figure out the}} profiles of the weights of different ranked items in three weighting methods, and in the experiment we use five topics as experimental materials. At the same time, we controlled the factors such as the familiarity about the topic and the number of items. Then we use the curve estimation to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> profiles and use ANOVA to test the topic effects. Curve estimation result shows that there is difference between the profiles of the weights of different ranking items in three weighting methods. To PA, the weighting profile is logarithmic curving style, and to DR, the weighting profile is linear style. ANOVA result shows that there are topic effects to different weighting profiles. But to go ahead, when we use point allocation (PA) to the more important items, the topics seems to have little effects. The methods have relatively more effect than the topics. The result also indicates that to PA methods, there is no significant difference the weight profiles between the fix-sum and the open-sum. This result has a contribution to the basic research to the management science and social science. 对项目的重要性进行判断，是一个心理权重赋值的过程。本文的研究是希望能够了解人们在给若干项目分配权重时候的基本规律。 本文用实验方法来研究在三种权重赋值方法下，不同重要性项目的权重分配变化的趋势。在研究中采用了五个话题来探讨这种规律是否受话题变化的影响。同时在实验中控制了问题的熟悉程度和选择项目的数目等等影响因素，最后用曲线拟和来描述这种规律，并用方差分析来检验话题效应。 曲线拟和的结果发表明：三种方法下不同重要性的项目的权重分配的变化趋势是不一样的，用PA方法所得到的权重的变化趋势是一种先陡后缓的变化，其曲线拟和结果符合对数形式；在DR方法下，所得到的权重的变化趋势是一种直线，其曲线拟和结果更加符合直线形式。 方差分析结果表明：话题间的这种权重变化趋势是有差异的，不过进一步发现，重要的项目在分配点数（PA）方法下话题效应不显著。针对于所有方法，方法效应均大于话题效应。针对PA法，人为设定开放总数和固定总数的权重曲线曲度系数没有显著性差异。 本文的研究结论对管理科学和社会科学项目权重赋值方式提供了研究基础...|$|E
40|$|Structures {{consisting}} of G-actin or other filament-forming monomers show {{a variety of}} morphologies with widely different properties in regard to pore size, degree of isotropy, and extent of cross-linking. These characteristics are primarily determined by the concentration and feature of proteins which cross-link filaments, but little is known how the filament-forming monomers and cross-linking proteins are organized {{in order to produce}} various network morphologies. In addition, it's generally known that mechanical force {{plays an important role in}} the physiology of eukaryote cells whose major structural component in cortex is actin cytoskeleton. Thus, understanding the origin of viscoelasticity of cross-linked networks should be crucial to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> role of cytoskeletal behaviors in many cellular functions. Here, we introduce a Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation model in three dimensions in which actin monomers polymerize into a filament and become cross-linked by two types of cross-linking molecules that constitute either perpendicular or parallel cross-links. We evaluate the influences of system parameters on the morphology of resultant networks. Some scaling behaviors that are independent of the specific choice of most parameters appear. (cont.) Additionally, the modified model is employed to investigate the viscoelastic property of actin-like network by tracking the trajectories of filaments. This method is theoretically more direct and more precise than micro-bead rheology used in experiments. The viscoelastic property appears to be highly affected by characteristics of cross-linking molecules, average filament length, and concentration of actin monomers. Our model has the high potential as a BD model that can be applied for investigating a variety of actin-related phenomena after further refinement and modification. by Taeyoon Kim. Thesis (S. M.)
