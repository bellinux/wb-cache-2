If we voluntarily place road-racing under police control, we sign its death warrant.... If we are to race on the road, for heaven's sake let us do it as free citizens, and not by permission of the police.|$|E
25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> there is speculation, but some day justice {{will be done}} there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days {{it is not so}} much about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E

[...] On his run-in to the finish line with Terpstra, he commented: [...] "At the end, I came with Niki, and he didn't really want to work with me, but <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that.</b> In the end I could still beat him." [...] Geraint Thomas was {{disappointed}} with his performance, tweeting after the race that he [...] "just lacked the legs of last weekend", referring to his E3 Harelbeke victory.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the various}} changes from real-life events, Abagnale {{believed}} Spielberg {{was the only}} filmmaker who [...] "could do this film justice". However, Abagnale had little involvement with the film. In November 2001, he had [...] "never met nor spoken to Steven Spielberg and I have not read the script. I prefer not to. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> they now portray my father in a better light, as he really was. Steven Spielberg has told the screenplay writer (Jeff Nathanson) that he wants complete accuracy in the relationships and actual scams that I perpetrated", Abagnale reported. [...] "I hope {{in the end the}} movie will be entertaining, exciting, funny and bring home an important message about family, childhood and divorce".|$|E
500|$|Discussing May's {{sickness}} in {{the episode}} after being [...] "infected" [...] by the ghost Lucy {{in the season}} premiere, Wen explained that [...] "It starts to affect May’s perception of things. It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she’s going in the same direction I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} on the incident, while also adding that since August 2016, PewDiePie has included anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery in nine separate videos. The publication reported he removed three of the videos, including the January 2017 Fiverr one. In a 12 February Tumblr post, PewDiePie expressed: [...] "I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes, [...] I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary," [...] and conceded, [...] "though this was not my intention, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> these jokes were ultimately offensive." [...] In his post, he also reiterated he does not support anti-Semitic groups. PewDiePie's motivation for his Tumblr post was partially driven {{by the fact that}} neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups and publications, such as The Daily Stormer, were referencing and praising PewDiePie for his jokes.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{messages}} he posted in October 2012 {{on the social}} network Twitter, regarding a discrimination claim won by a gay couple, sparked widespread opprobrium. Cambridgeshire police investigated the tweets, which included the couple's address and a suggestion that a [...] "British Justice team" [...] would give them [...] "a bit of drama", but took no further action. [...] In 2012, although he denied being [...] "anti-gay", he claimed that civil partnerships undermined [...] "the institution of marriage, {{and as a result}} of that, children will die over the next few years, because they'll be brought up in homes which aren't married". In 2009 he also said that: [...] "a lot of people find the sight of two grown men kissing in public really creepy. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> homosexuals don't understand that but that's how a lot of us [...] feel." [...] He also suggests that gay pride marches [...] " [...] on heterophobia which, like its twin Christianophobia, is on the rise." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E

500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and I respect her. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she’s going in the same {{direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E
500|$|Their {{action was}} {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference on 29 April 1963. The following day they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many white people supported them. In an editorial, the Bristol Evening Post pointed out that the TGWU opposed apartheid in South Africa and asked what trade union leaders were doing to counteract racism in their own ranks. When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: [...] "The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a white man in London to admit it, but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: [...] "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She {{looked exactly}} like her mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott Lasley, a {{political}} science professor at Western Kentucky University and chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, [...] "Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot about the campaign and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive. Otherwise you don't go there." [...] On April 25, 2014, Bevin apologized for attending the event, saying [...] "I am genuinely sorry that my attendance at an event which, other than my comments, appears to have primarily involved a discussion of cockfighting, has created concern on the part of many Kentucky voters. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> concern. I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty." [...] The Daily Beast said the issue could be the [...] "nail in the coffin" [...] for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, [...] "On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign. But viewed in the context of the string of other distractions he's had to deal with, it reinforces the reality that his campaign is in serious need of repairs down the stretch." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] fastball {{from the}} Cubs' Mike Montgomery on August 11, 2016, struck Holliday {{on the right}} thumb, {{fracturing}} it. [...] The Cardinals placed him on the DL. [...] Presented with the option to either allow the thumb to heal naturally or with surgery, Holliday elected surgery as that would have potentially allowed him to return before season's end. [...] He encountered multiple delays in recovery. [...] Having been informed {{in the final days}} of the 2016 season that the Cardinals would not pick up the option for 2017 worth $17 million, he was activated from the DL − although his thumb was still fractured − in time for the September 30 game against Pittsburgh. [...] He hit his first career pinch-hit home run in that game and 20th of the season. [...] Holliday released a statement: [...] "While I'm disappointed this could be it here in St. Louis, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it might be time to move on." [...] While his batting average had dropped to a career-low [...]246, Holliday was optimistic about a rebound. [...] Because he produced the third-highest exit velocity at [...] of all hitters with at least 100 batted balls in 2016, he concluded that to [...] "have my misses be more in the air than on the ground, my numbers could really get back toward where they have been my whole career." ...|$|E
500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become a man. So what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eliot once said, [...] "Well, {{this year}} I'm told the team did well because one pitcher {{had a fine}} curve ball. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a curve ball is thrown with a {{deliberate}} attempt to deceive.

2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it is a figure with a thousand sides as well as <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).
