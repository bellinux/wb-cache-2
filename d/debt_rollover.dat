50|$|Rolling over debt is {{a process}} in which the {{borrower}} extends the length of their debt into the next period, generally with a fee while still accruing interest. An empirical study published in The Journal of Consumer Affairs found that low income individuals who reside in states that permit three or more rollovers were more likely to use payday lenders and pawnshops to supplement their income. The study also found that higher income individuals are more likely to use payday lenders in areas that permit rollovers. The article argues that payday loan rollovers lead low income individuals into a debt-cycle where they will need to borrow additional funds to pay the fees associated with the <b>debt</b> <b>rollover.</b> Of the states that allow payday lending, 22 states do not allow borrowers to rollover their debt and only three states allow unlimited rollovers.

Under dynamic tradeoff theory, HFIs should therefore exhibit smaller issue sizes, lower leverage ratio volatility, and higher speed-of-adjustment to deviations from target leverage ratios than LFIs, which our evidence fails to support. However, consistent with dynamic financing and investment models, over-leveraged firms occasionally issue debt followed by equity issues and leverage ratio reductions.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} `Keynesian' fiscal stimuli when government deficits and <b>debt</b> <b>rollovers</b> are (possibly partially) financed by balance sheet constrained financial intermediaries. Because financial intermediaries operate under a leverage constraint, deficit financing of fiscal stimulus packages will cause interest rates to rise as private loans are crowded out by government debt in the credit provision channel. This lowers investment and (future) capital stocks, which affects output negatively for a prolonged period. Anticipations of these future consequences cause the price of capital and bonds to drop immediately when the policy is announced, inflicting capital losses on banks which leads to further tightening of leverage constraints and credit market conditions. This balance sheet effect triggers a negative amplification cycle further lowe ring the fiscal multiplier. Longer maturity debt leads to larger capital losses and lower Keynesian multipliers. When in addition sovereign default risk is introduced, additional capital losses may occur and outcomes deteriorate further after a deficit financed stimulus package, eventually implying a cumulative Keynesian multiplier close to zero or even negative. We do not argue that multipliers are always negative; but financial fragility and sovereign risk problems may severely lower them, possibly {{to the point of}} becoming negative...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three self-contained essays in microeconomics. The first chapter studies the rollover risk of financial institutions. It presents a competitive-equilibrium model of financial institutions optimally choosing their <b>debt</b> maturity structure. <b>Rollover</b> risk arises endogenously from the interaction of creditors in a global-game framework. When only idiosyncratic risk is present short-term debt acts as an effective disciplining device but once aggregate risk is added a two-sided inefficiency arises. Good aggregate states lead to excessive risktaking while bad aggregate states suffer from fire-sale liquidation. In the competitive equilibrium with endogenous liquidation values, the two-sided inefficiency reinforces itself through a feedback effect. It increases the volatility of liquidation values and thereby amplifies the impact of aggregate risk. The second chapter is coauthored with Martin Schmalz and studies the effects of anxiety in decision-making. We model an anxious agent as one who is more risk averse for imminent than for distant risk. Such preferences can lead to dynami...|$|R

When the information structure is based on “optimistic” expectations, the arrival of no news about the asset is good news; under this structure, debt capacity does not depend upon rollovers and liquidation cost, and is simply equal to expected cash flows from the asset. In contrast, when the information structure is based on “pessimistic” expectations, no news about the asset is bad news; under this structure, debt capacity of the asset is decreasing in the liquidation cost and frequency of rollovers. In the limit, as the number of rollovers becomes unbounded, the debt capacity goes to zero even for an arbitrarily small default risk.

40|$|The U. S. shadow {{banking system}} played a {{significant}} role in the financial crisis that started in August 2007. The {{shadow banking system}} is a system of “financial institutions that mostly look like a bank, borrow short term in <b>rollover</b> <b>debt</b> markets, leverage themselves significantly, and lend and invest in longer-term and illiquid assets ” (see Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer 2009). Unlike banks, however, the shadow banking system is much less regulated. Shadow banking is a recently minted term. However, the emergence of a shadow banking system in the United States may be traced as far back as the early 1970 s. 1 Its most important component is securitized debt, or simply debt secured by underlying assets (many of which are debt securities themselves), such as U. S. Treasuries, agencies, corporate bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), equities, and so on.

40|$|The sub-prime {{crisis of}} 2007 and 2008 has been {{characterized}} by a sudden freeze {{in the market for}} short-term, secured borrowing. We present a model that can explain a sudden collapse in the amount that can be borrowed against assets with little credit risk. The borrowing in this model takes the form of asset-backed commercial paper that has to be rolled over several times before the underlying assets mature and their true value is revealed. In the event of default, the creditors (holders of commercial paper) can seize the collateral. We assume that there is a small cost of liquidating the assets. The debt capacity of the assets (the maximum amount that can be borrowed using the assets as collateral) depends on how information {{about the quality of the}} asset is revealed. In one scenario, there is a constant probability that "bad news" is revealed each period and, in the absence of bad news, the value of the assets is high. We call this the "optimistic" scenario because, in the absence of bad news, the expected value of the assets is increasing over time. By contrast, in another scenario, there is a constant probability that "good news" is revealed each period and, in the absence of good news, the value of the assets is low. We call this the "pessimistic" scenario because, in the absence of good news, the expected value of the assets is decreasing over time. In the optimistic scenario, the debt capacity of the assets is equal to the fundamental value (the expected NPV), whereas in the pessimistic scenario, the debt capacity is below the fundamental value and is decreasing in the liquidation cost and frequency of rollovers. In the limit, as the number of rollovers becomes unbounded, the debt capacity goes to zero even for an arbitrarily small default risk. Our model explains why markets for <b>rollover</b> <b>debt,</b> such as asset-backed commercial paper, may experience sudden freezes.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2012 Major: Economics. Advisors:Timothy J. Kehoe and Fabrizio Perri. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 100 pages, appendices A-B. This dissertation {{consists of two}} essays. The first essay analyzes the labor market effects of import competition in the U. S. Recent empirical research indicates, in contrast to standard trade theory, that trade and foreign competition negatively impact some locations by worsening labor market outcomes such as unemployment. I extend and confirm this work using unique data on the U. S. Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs since 1983. I find that locations that face more foreign competition have higher job destruction rates, lower job creation rates, and thereby higher unemployment rates. I introduce a simple trade model with unemployment and segmented local labor markets facing different degrees of foreign competition. Import competition has a correlated effect on job destruction and job creation because the most vulnerable locations to foreign competition have lower productivity. Despite large reductions in employment rate in the worse hit local labor markets and in contrast to an exogenous increase in foreign productivity, an unexpected trade liberalization yields aggregate welfare gains in the model calibrated to the U. S. The second essay studies the accumulation of foreign reserves in emerging economies. Emerging economies, unlike advanced economies, have accumulated large foreign reserve holdings. We argue that this policy is an optimal response {{to an increase in}} foreign <b>debt</b> <b>rollover</b> risk. In our model, reserves {{play a crucial role in}} reducing <b>debt</b> <b>rollover</b> crises ("sudden stops''), akin to the role of bank reserves in preventing bank runs. An unexpected increase in rollover risk leads to a global rise in sudden stops, prompting emerging economies to update their priors about the risk they face.

Where supply-side reforms might help is in making some types of flow less unstable: for example, the Buiter/Sibert proposal for a Universal <b>Debt</b> <b>Rollover</b> Option (which needs amendment to alter the term for which rollover might apply); allowing investors with fiduciary responsibilities to hold (though not to buy) bonds of sub-investment grade; penalizing put options in bond contracts and inserting collective action clauses; requiring foreign loans to be denominated in domestic currency; and modifying the remuneration practices of portfolio managers...|$|E

40|$|Our model {{shows that}} {{deterioration}} in debt market liquidity {{leads to an}} increase in not only liquidity premium of corporate bonds but also credit risk.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two chapters that concern with the consumption cycle and corporate finance. The first chapter analyzes the role of durability in characterizing the consumption cycle. There is strong empirical evidence demonstrating that decreases in residential investments and durable expenditures are early indicators of economic downturns. Analogously, once the economy goes into recession, early increases in residential investments and durable expenditures signal economic recoveries. So far, little {{work has been done}} detailing the mechanisms explaining these important empirical stylized facts. In this article, I develop a general equilibrium asset pricing production model that includes durability and substitutability between perishable and durable service consumption. Results indicate that large shocks in the productivity of the capital accumulation process and a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution are both needed to create the correct timing of changes in durable expenditures and nondurable consumption characterized in the data. The study also uses this general equilibrium model as a framework to make predictions about the term structure of forward contracts settled on a national housing price index. Such work will create a foundation for further developing this important derivatives market. The second chapter analyzes the link between debt maturity and the term spread. This chapter is co-authored with Pratish Anilkumar Patel. Evidence shows that a firm's debt maturity and term spread are intricately linked. Firms issue short term debt when the term spread is significantly positive and they increase maturity as the term spread decreases. The current literature explains this link with market frictions such as agency problems, asymmetric information, and liquidity risk. We explain the link between debt maturity and term spread using the trade-off theory of capital structure. When the term spread is small or even negative, transaction costs of <b>debt</b> <b>rollover</b> outweigh bankruptcy costs. Therefore, the firm optimally chooses to increase debt maturity. On the other hand, when the term spread is significantly positive, bankruptcy costs outweigh transaction costs of <b>debt</b> <b>rollover.</b> Therefore shorter debt maturity is optimal as it minimizes the chance of bankruptcy. In addition, we contribute to the current discussion in the literature concerning the speed of adjustments of capital structure, finding that firms are active in adjusting their capital structure. The model is consistent with a variety of stylized facts concerning debt maturity...|$|E

The research objectives are mainly devoted to quantitative and qualitative assessments of the current and long run challenges of the external debt sustainability faced by Romania. The results of the study highlight inter-conditional ties between short-term and medium-long term debt, public and private debt, internal and external public debt. The increase in the long-term external debt stock (more than two times during 2007 - 2013) led to a significant rise in the related annual service (17. 8 % of GDP in 2013), deteriorating the financial framework of Romania and the growth perspectives.

An increase in the firm’s total debt load can move the firm from the first regime to the second, a phenomenon we call debt-induced collapse because it is accompanied by a sharp drop in equity value. We show that setting the contractual trigger for conversion sufficiently high avoids this hazard. With this condition in place, we investigate the effect of contingent capital and debt maturity on optimal capital structure, debt overhang, and asset substitution. We also calibrate the model to past data on the largest U. S. bank holding companies to see what impact contingent convertible debt might have had under the conditions of the financial crisis...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{investigation of the}} asset pricing implication of rollover risk, the risk that a firm {{might not be able}} to refinance its due liabilities. I focus on the long-term <b>debt</b> <b>rollover</b> risk and use the proportion of long-term debt falling due within the year to measure a firm’s exposure to rollover risk. I find that firm-specific rollover risk coupled with deteriorating market wide credit conditions indeed increase a firm’s credit spreads. During the peak period of the financial crisis, namely the second half of 2008, one-year CDS spreads for a firm that needs to refinance more than 20 % of its long-term debt are 72 basis points higher than the spreads for a similar firm with low refinancing needs. The differences are smaller, around 32 basis points, but still significant at the early and final stages of the financial crisis. Compared to oneyear CDS spreads, CDS spreads for longer maturities are also sensitive to rollover risk information but at lower magnitudes throughout the financial crisis. During normal periods, CDS spreads are mostly explained by fundamental risk while rollover risk is not a significant determinant of credit spreads. Similar rollover risk effect is also observed in other financial markets, including the corporate bond, stock and option markets...|$|E
40|$|Essay One: Financial Constraints, Macroeconomic Conditions, and Financing Decisions This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the impact of}} real economic activity and capital market conditions on firms’ financing choices between 1975 and 2006. Through principal component analysis, we decompose a number of macroeconomic variables into three principal components that capture different aspects of macroeconomic conditions. High (low) values of the first component correspond to a recovering economy with low inflation (stagflation); high (low) values of the second component correspond to an overheating economy (recession); and high (low) values of the third correspond to high (low) stock and bond market returns but are unrelated to real economic activity. Financially constrained and unconstrained firms respond differently to these macroeconomic conditions. Financially unconstrained firms increase debt maturity during recovery when long-term debt appears less risky, and reduce debt maturity towards {{the crest of the}} business cycle when the opposite is the case. In contrast, the benefits of improving debt and equity market conditions spread more slowly to the financially constrained firms, and they appear to have less flexibility in financing choices when conditions worsen. However, the financing activities of the financially constrained firms are much more sensitive to capital market conditions that seem unrelated to economic fundamentals. Essay Two: Determinants and Real Impact of Debt Rollover: Evidence from Debt Reclassifications <b>Debt</b> <b>rollover,</b> as an integral aspect of firms’ financing decisions, remains relatively underexplored because it is difficult to be identified empirically. Debt reclassifications, which indicate intent by firms to roll over their short-term debt on a long-term basis, provide us a unique opportunity to study <b>debt</b> <b>rollover.</b> Reclassifications are surprisingly common among S&P 1500 firms. Over the 1993 - 2005 period, on average, 33 % of the firms reclassify short-term debt as long-term debt each year. Among firms that reclassify short-term debt, the average percentage of reclassified debt to total debt is as high as 40 %. We empirically examine the factors that determine the decision of firms to roll over existing or new short-term debt via reclassification. We find that younger and smaller firms, as well as firms with intermediate and no S&P credit ratings, are more likely to roll over debt via reclassifications. Firms {{are also more likely to}} roll over debt via reclassification when they have major investment projects, market conditions are not favorable for equity and long-term debt issuance, and refinancing risk is high. Firms that reclassify overcome the financing frictions and achieve significantly higher sales and asset growth, and invest more in both fixed assets and working capital. Consistent with the idea that firms face tighter financial constraints around periods of reclassification than expected future constraints, we find that the cash flow-sensitivity of investment increases and that of cash holdings decreases at the time of debt reclassification...|$|E
