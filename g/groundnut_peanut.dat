40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} 1988 and 1989 rainy seasons to assess yield loss at different growth stages in <b>groundnut</b> (<b>peanut)</b> due to insect pests.

The greatest yield loss caused by insect pests at any crop stage was 31. 4 % in 1988 and 23 % in 1989. Damage occurring during the bloom and vegetative stages resulted in maximum yield loss. Thus, crop protection measures at the vegetative and bloom stages are most effective in minimizing the yield loss due to insect pests in groundnut...|$|E

40|$|Primary {{carcinoma}} of the liver or hepatoma, is a disease with a striking geographic distribution. It appears to be most uncommon in the United States ' and Scandinavia, 2 while its incidence reported to date is greatest in Africa south of the Sahara. 23 Of particular interest {{is the fact that}} Negroes in the United States have an incidence of hepatoma almost identical to the white population, and therefore significantly less than their African counterparts. " 6 Interest in hepatoma has been heightened by the recent observations regarding <b>groundnut</b> (<b>peanut)</b> contamination with Aspergillus flavus. 7 This fungus elaborates a toxin (aflatoxin) which has been shown to produce hepatomas in rats. 8 Groundnut meals containing aflatoxin also are capable of inducing hepatomas in ducks 9 and rainbow trout, 10 as well as in rats.

40|$|The damage {{potential}} of two phytophagous scarab larvae on <b>groundnut</b> (<b>peanut)</b> yield was determined.

H. serrata larva reduced groundnut yield {{by an average of}} 7. 52 g/ larva. In crops yielding less and more than 1900 kg ha- 1, H. piceus reduced yield by 4. 20 g and 1. 43 g/ larva, respectively.

For H. piceus, the provisional EIL is 1. 67 and 4. 91 larvae/ row-metre in crops yielding less and more than 1900 kg/ha, respectively. For H. serrata, the provisional EIL is one H. serrata larva in 7. 1 m 2.
