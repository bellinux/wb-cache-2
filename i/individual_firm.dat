40|$|We propose using Solow's {{macroeconomic}} {{approach and}} the concept of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) as a microeconomic tool for analyzing <b>individual</b> <b>firms.</b> TFP long used in analyzing macroeconomic growth among countries, is a useful strategic performance benchmark for <b>individual</b> <b>firms.</b> TFP calculations permit managers and investors to partition labor productivity growth between two sharply different underlying causes: capital-deepening (higher capital per worker), and exogenous technological change. The TFP benchmark can be computed from readily-available information in financial statements. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a simple version of Solow's model, suitable for use in <b>individual</b> <b>firms,</b> and provides a numerical example. Section 3 gives detailed total factor productivity calculations for the 20 largest firms in the world.

RV indicates that organisational capabilities can be developed by spanning the boundary of firms through the combination of resources from different firms in the SC. SCC and collaborative advantage are based on the RV theory, which takes into account the dyad/network, instead of <b>individual</b> <b>firms,</b> as the unit of analysis. Thus, it provides the mechanism of joint value creation, such as inter-firm rent generation [11, 27].|$|R
