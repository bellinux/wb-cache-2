5000|$|In general, {{the defect}} {{propagation}} theory plays {{a bigger role}} at low sediment transport rates since for high rates defects maybe washed away and bedforms generally initiated across the entire bed spontaneously. Venditti et al. (2005) report that instantaneous initiation begins {{with the formation of}} a cross-hatch pattern, which leads to chevron-shaped forms that migrate independently of the pattern structure. This chevron-like structure reorganizes to form the future crest lines of the bedforms. Venditti et al. (2006), based on the earlier model by Liu (1957), proposed that instantaneous initiation is a manifestation of an interfacial <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> of Kelvin-Helmholtz type between a highly active pseudofluid sediment layer and the fluid above it. In addition, Venditti et al. (2005) imply that there is no linkage between the instantaneous initiation and coherent turbulent flow structures, since spatially- and temporally-random events should lock in place to generate the cross-hatch pattern. Moreover, there is no clear explanation of the effect of turbulence in the formation of bedforms since bedforms may also occur under laminar flows [...] It is important to note, that laminar-generated bedform studies used the temporally-averaged flow conditions to determine the degree of turbulence, indicating Reynolds number in the laminar regime. However, instantaneous process, such as burst and sweeps, which are infrequent at low Reynolds number but still present, can be the driving mechanisms to generate the bedforms. The generation of bedforms in laminar flows is still a topic of debate within the scientific community, since if true, it suggests that there should be other processes for defect development other than the one suggested by Best (1992). This alternative model for bedform development at low sediment transport rates should explain the generation of defects and bedforms for cases where the flow is not turbulent.|$|E

As a result of such hydrodynamic coupling the transition from initially planar or wrinkled laminar flames to fast turbulent flames or detonations is possible, even when diffusive-thermal effects associated with non-unity reactant Lewis numbers are not destabilizing.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a flame and a vortex pair is investigated by a front-tracking numerical method, developed for multifluid flows, {{in which a}} sharp interface separates incompressible fluids of different densities and viscosities. It is shown that, in a weak vortical flow field, the initial vortex simply serves as an initiation agent for the onset of flame front <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability,</b> which in turn dominates the evolution of flame wrinkling and postflame voracity generation. The flame-generated vorticity (FGV) is of opposite sign of the incoming vortices and {{is due to the}} baroclinic torque formed by the density gradient across the flame and the pressure gradient along the wrinkled flame surface. The relevance of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> is further demonstrated by analyzing the flame dynamics with the instability mechanism suppressed by imposing a perturbation length scale with minute growth rate. For sufficiently strong vortices, however, results show that while flame wrinkling is dominated by the incoming vortices, the FGV is affected by the combined pressure gradients of the vortices {{as well as that of}} the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability.</b> In fact, the only situation in which the course of the incoming vortices is preserved is for flames with small thermal expansion and thereby weak <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> influences...|$|E

40|$|A {{pulsating}} form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> {{has recently}} been shown to arise during liquid-propellant deflagration in those parameter regimes where the pressure-dependent burning rate {{is characterized by a}} negative pressure sensitivity. This type of instability can coexist with the classical cellular, or Landau form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability,</b> with the occurrence of either dependent on whether the pressure sensitivity is sufficiently large or small in magnitude. For the inviscid problem, it has been shown that, when the burning rate is realistically allowed to depend on temperature as well as pressure, sufficiently large values of the temperature sensitivity relative to the pressure sensitivity causes like pulsating form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> to become dominant. In that regime, steady, planar burning becomes intrinsically unstable to pulsating disturbances whose wave numbers are sufficiently small. This analysis is extended to the fully viscous case, where it is shown that although viscosity is stabilizing for intermediate and larger wave number perturbations, the intrinsic pulsating instability for small wave numbers remains. Under these conditions, liquid-propellant combustion is predicted to be characterized by large unsteady cells along the liquid/gas interface...|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic (Landau) {{instability}} in combustion is {{typically associated with}} the onset of wrinkling of a flame surface, corresponding to the formation of steady cellular structures as the stability threshold is crossed. In the context of liquid-propellant combustion, such instability has recently been shown to occur for critical values of the pressure sensitivity of the burning rate and the disturbance wavenumber, significantly generalizing previous classical results for this problem that assumed a constant normal burning rate. Additionally, however, a pulsating form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> has been shown to occur as well, corresponding to the onset of temporal oscillations in the location of the liquid/gas interface. In the present work, we consider the realistic influence of a nonzero temperature sensitivity in the local burning rate on both types of stability thresholds. It is found that for sufficiently small values of this parameter, there exists a stable range of pressure sensitivities for steady, planar burning such that the classical cellular form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> and the more recent pulsating form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> can each occur as the corresponding stability threshold is crossed. For larger thermal sensitivities, however, the pulsating stability boundary evolves into a C-shaped curve in the (disturbance-wavenumber, pressure-sensitivity) plane, indicating loss of stability to pulsating perturbations for all sufficiently large disturbance wavelengths. It is thus concluded, based on characteristic parameter values, that an equally likely form of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> in liquid-propellant combustion is of a nonsteady, long-wave nature, distinct from the steady, cellular form originally predicted by Landau...|$|E

The unstretched laminar burning velocities were compared with data from the previous literature and simulated results. The results indicate that excellent agreements are obtained. The cellular instabilities of syngas-air flames were discussed and critical flame radii were measured. When hydrogen fractions are above 50 %, the flame {{tends to be more}} stable as the equivalence ratio increases; however, the instability increases for flames of lower hydrogen fractions. For the premixed syngas flame with hydrogen fractions greater than 50 %, the decline in cellular instabilities induced by the increase in equivalence ratio can be attributed to a reduction of diffusive-thermal instabilities rather than increased <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> For premixed syngas flames with hydrogen fractions lower than 50 %, as the equivalence ratio increases, the cellular instabilities become more evident because the enhanced <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> become the dominant effect.

30|$|The <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> theory {{developed}} by Zuber [37] suggests that CHF is dependent only on fluid properties. Since nanofluids {{at the low}} concentrations {{used in this study}} have fluid properties nearly identical to pure water, the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> theory would predict that nanofluids and water have the same value for CHF, which is contrary to experimental evidence. It {{is interesting to note that}} recently, the reliability of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> theory has been questioned even for pure fluids (e.g. [29]) based on experimental evidence that micro-hydrodynamics at the heater surface represents the key physics of the burnout process. Three other theories take into account surface wettability on CHF: the macrolayer dryout theory [38, 39], hot/dry spot theory [17, 40, 41], and the bubble interaction theory [42 – 44]. A thorough review of these theories is presented by Kim et al. [16], where they showed how the hot/dry spot theory of Kandlikar [40] supports an increase in CHF due to the increased surface wettability of the nanofluid-boiled surfaces. Gerardi [23] used the macrolayer dryout theory of Sadasivan et al. [39] and the bubble interaction theory of Kolev [44] to additionally link increased surface wettability with CHF increase.|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between a flame and vortices {{has been investigated}} {{by means of a}} front-tracking method. Extending previous studies on the role of hydrodynamic (Darrieus-Landau) instability in the wrinkling of flame surface at the incipient stage, we have further investigated the flame dynamics in the course of long-time evolution when interactions between the flame front, the instability, and the vortical flow result in highly convoluted flame configurations. It is shown that, with the inherent mechanisms of merging and dividing of flame cells at multiple scales that are generated by the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability,</b> propagation of flame wrinkles can evolve to a quasi-stable state characterized by a solitary wave or cha-otic motion associated with corrugated front. If the vortical flow is sufficiently strong, however, the flame geometry is contorted by the vortices while the effect of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability</b> degenerates. Therefore, according to the relative magnitudes of the intensity of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instability,</b> determined by the density ratio as well as the curvature parameter that is relevant to the flame thickness, and the strength of the vortices, the interaction pattern can be classified as flame-instability dominated, flow dominated, and a hybrid of the two...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in {{miscible}} fluids are ubiquitous, {{from natural}} phenomena up to geological scales, to industrial and technological applications, where {{they represent the}} only way to control and promote mixing at low Reynolds numbers, well below the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. As for immiscible fluids, the onset of <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in miscible fluids {{is directly related to the}} physics of their interfaces. The focus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth of disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of forcing conditions. In the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these disturbances would grow indefinitely. For immiscible fluids, interfacial tension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost associated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. For miscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic an effective surface tension is debated. Other mechanisms, however, may also be relevant, such as viscous dissipation. We shall review the stabilizing mechanisms that control the most common <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> highlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension poses deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear stability analysis. Finally, we provide a short overview on the ongoing research on the effective, out of equilibrium interfacial tension between miscible fluids. Comment: 9 figure...|$|R
40|$|Can we exploit <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities</b> {{to trigger}} an efficient, {{selective}} and spontaneous flow of encapsulated chemical information? One possible {{answer to this}} question is presented in this paper where cross-diffusion, which commonly characterizes compartmentalized dispersed systems, is shown to initiate buoyancy-driven <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> A general theoretical framework allows us to predict and classify cross-diffusion-induced convection in two-layer stratifications under the action of the gravitational field. The related nonlinear dynamics is described by a cross-diffusion-convection (CDC) model where fickian diffusion is coupled to the Stokes equations. We identify two types of hydrodynamic modes (the negative cross-diffusion-driven convection, NCC, and the positive cross-diffusion-driven convection, PCC) corresponding to the sign of the cross-diffusion term dominating the system dynamics. We finally show how AOT water-in-oil reverse microemulsions are an ideal model system to confirm the general theory and to approach experimentally cross-diffusion-induced hydrodynamic scenarios.
