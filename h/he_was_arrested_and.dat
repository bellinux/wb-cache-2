5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders.

Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy.

5|$|The Zurich council {{decided that}} no {{compromise}} was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate {{that no one}} shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death. Although Zwingli, technically, {{had nothing to do}} with the mandate, there is no indication that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the Limmat. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Paris, Custine {{displayed}} his usual , {{which seemed to}} exasperate his political enemies. He took private rooms in a furnished hotel, and rented a room for his secretary.

The Committee of Public Safety ordered a policeman to accompany him everywhere. On 22 July, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned in the Luxembourg.
