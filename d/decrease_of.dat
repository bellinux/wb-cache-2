40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of {{laboratory}} experiments the nonlinear wave transformation above submerged rectangular permeable and solid bars was investigated. A transmission coefficient and a change of mean wave period as parameters of wave transformation were considered. Both of these parameters can characterize an ability of submerged structure to reduce a wave impact in coastal zone. It was revealed that for <b>decreasing</b> <b>of</b> mean wave period solid submerged bar is more effective, but permeable bar is more effective for <b>decreasing</b> <b>of</b> wave height. The optimal relations for transmission coefficient and change of mean wave period in dependence of parameters of bar and waves were revealed. For <b>decreasing</b> <b>of</b> wave mean period the optimal length of solid bar must be 0. 4 of initial wavelength and 0. 1 - for permeable bar. For <b>decreasing</b> <b>of</b> wave height the length of bar for permeable bar must be 0. 21 of initial wavelength and for solid bar - 0. 55. It was revealed that maximal <b>decreasing</b> <b>of</b> mean wave period will be at relative depth of bar 1. 25 independently of permeability of bar.

5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and <b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (<b>decrease</b> <b>of</b> bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
