These were not corrections to the original poem, but instead a development of the themes and ideas along with changes in style, <b>genre,</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> These changes parallel Coleridge's own changing view of Chatterton. The original version, from 1790, was an imitation of 18th-century poetry written for school and follows the Pindaric ode form that ignores many of the structures of the Pindaric ode. The versions in-between shift to a more Romantic structure and then finally become Augustinian in the final version. As a whole, the poems can be broken into three sets: the 1790 Pindaric ode, the Romantic odes from 1794 until 1829, and the elegy from 1829 until the final publication in 1834.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this {{research}} project is that the music of Frank Bridge (1879 - 1941) is characterised by recurring effects that are disproportionately appealing to familiar listeners, and that these effects have {{had a significant impact}} on the shape of his critical reception. Two types of effect are described, which arise respectively out of genre and hierarchical structure, and are suggested by selected reviews of Bridge’s music. The composer’s treatment of genre is presented as subtle, complex, and misleading, creating what this thesis defines as generic misdirection, suggestions of genre within a musical work that act to veil a more fundamental and counter-generic aesthetic. These features are linked to the historical generic sensitivities of interwar British listeners, and potential effects on the listening experience are described. Similarly, the musical structures of Bridge’s later works are shown to be deceptively simple, partially veiled behind an appearance of complexity that arises out of surface features of lesser importance. This effect is argued to possess an ongoing significance for listeners, a likely influence on the experiences of present-day hearers of Bridge’s music. These effects are presented as an important part of understanding Bridge’s history and music, relevant to its dissemination and scholarly understanding. They also provide valuable new insights into the role of <b>genre</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> in music listening, reception, and composition, and for the developing relationship between criticism and new music...|$|E

She argues that Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 s experimentation is always juxtapositional, his narrative strategy combining two contrasted tendencies: the figural and the parodic. Although present in all Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 s novels, this doubleness, however, also allows her to make significant distinctions or groupings within the major period where "Absalom, Absalom!" {{should be seen as}} the great divide between the first figural group and the second 2 ̆ 7 parodic 2 ̆ 7 group.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundI {{discuss a}} method of {{facilitation}} that I have used in my Creative Writing courses at the University of Lethbridge for many years. I tend to focus primarily on potentials and possibilities in third-year courses {{and then move on}} to questions of forms, <b>genre,</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> in the “Advanced” or exit-year courses. These courses rely heavily on rapport and a specific structure which has the effect (most of the time) of opening the spigot of the students’ creative energies. Purpose of Study. Data from this pedagogy is plotted in a qualitative exploration using in-depth phenomenological “prompts” or thought experiments. This data will be presented in order to depict how art making or (in this case, Creative Writing journaling) contributes to mental health recovery and stability. The hope of our team is that this method may be deploy at a downtown satellite program open to street people and all and any who seek help. Sources of Evidence. An interpretative phenomenological approach is applied to data collected in several years of Creative Writing workshops at the University of Lethbridge. This data is broken down into three main categories: explanatory models of how the skills, qualities and approaches of the facilitator assisted recovery, on transformative characteristics of art making in this particular venue, and the wider social benefits of such art making. Main Argument. Using collaborative techniques grounded on the premise that the workshop is unconditionally a “safe place”, a progressive conversation is established in which the matter of the self is drawn into both language that is fresh and control of language that holistically conforms to the group dynamic. In this dynamic, remarkable recoveries may take place. I will focus the discussion on the structure of the collaborative journalizing, the purpose of which is to bring structure into the very production of personal and creative recovery. The journaling is an extended process-meditation, begun {{on the first day of}} a half-semester course and finished on the day a final portfolio is submitted for grading. I argue that the dream-journaling should have a basic structure in any case, and discuss several such schema as they have been used not only in Creative Writing but also in the community and in the literature of counselling and guidance. Conclusions. The findings provide a initial but profound exploration into art facilitators’ pragmatic knowledge and wisdom related to the health and recovery benefits of art making in the area of counselling and guidance. It also explores important skills and competencies required by those facilitating art making programs in mental health recovery contexts. Such data may help to inform policy and design of health recovery programs associated with Creative Writing workshops both in the college or university setting as well as the community health unit...|$|E

40|$|Kim Sisup (1435 1493) was a Confucian literatus, Buddhist monk and Taoist philosopher in the {{beginning}} of the Korean Choson dynasty (1392 1910). He was also politically active and wrote within various genres; poetry, travelogues and treatises on subjects such as philosophy, politics, religion and economy. In addition, he wrote within what we could classify as a more fictional genre, chuánqí. The collection Kumo Sinhwa consists of five chuánqí. In Korean history and literature history, Kim Sisup is now presented as an important writer and thinker of the early Choson dynasty. His collection Kumo Sinhwa written in Literary Chinese has been translated into modern Korean several times. Its various topics, such as the female personages, ideological elements, and comparative relation to the Chinese collection Jian deng Xinhuà by Qú Yòu, have undergone research. Also in Asia and Eastern parts of Europe has Kŭmo Sinhwa been translated and been object for research. In the Western world (Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand) however, Kim Sisup and his work Kumo Sinhwa are not well known. Very little of Kim Sisup s work has been translated into Western languages, and works in Western languages concerning him or his work are scarce. As my master thesis I therefore wished to present a work on Kim Sisup and his collection, and a natural way of doing it was through translating a section of Kumo Sinhwa into English. As the text to be translated (source text, ST) was not decided, I formulated three criteria - not previously translated into a Western language, containing various topics for future research as well as female personages (female ghosts) - in order to select ST. Among the five chuánqí in the collection, Manboksa chop'o ki - a love story between the student Yang and a ghost - fulfilled all three criteria. I discussed my translation methods through presenting the concrete problems I encountered through the translation process, such as annotated versus non-annotated translation, emphasis on source language (SL) versus target language (TL) and structural problems. I also provided examples from my translation to illustrate these problems and how I solved them. In order to place ST in a context and provide a fuller understanding of the text, background information to the source text was presented. The information consisted of a historical background where I concentrated on society, politics and religion, language and literature, and gender relations. An introduction of the author and the text itself concerning <b>genre</b> <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> was also presented. As I wished to contribute to the arena of further research on Kim and his Kŭmo Sinhwa through this first translation of Manboksa chop'o ki into a Western language, I suggested several topics for future research; a discussion of the writer Kim Sisup and the male protagonist in ST concerning autobiographical traits, a discussion of whether the active and strong female personages in ST are a representation of Kim Sisup s criticism of the female ideals in Confucianism or merely a reflection of Kim s wish to create an amusing and fantastic literary experience, an identification of the Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist elements, a deeper structural analysis of the text, to mention but a few...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a three-year naturalistic inquiry into {{intertextuality}} in early grade classrooms. Specifically, the paper focuses on intertextual conflicts during teacher-class interactions where teachers are reading and modeling texts as well as guiding children to read and talk about text content, purposes, <b>genres,</b> <b>and</b> <b>structures.</b> These conflicts are identified and examined within a conceptual framework that accounts for intertextuality in terms of written texts, lived experiences, lessons, and processes in individuals. In exploring these conflicts, the study reveals that intertextuality in classrooms is not a systematic business. Rather, intertextuality can take on many guises in classroom interactions around texts and is a highly idiosyncratic and often elusive affair. The paper further concludes that the greater power of mandated syllabus documents over teachers and the greater power of teachers over children make intertextuality a complex venture, for children are expected to locate and articulate preferred, predetermined intertextual meanings in ways that teachers expect and state syllabus documents mandate. This expectation renders intertextuality very challenging for teachers and children alike...|$|R

5000|$|A {{contemporary}} of Cervantes, Lope de Vega consolidated {{the essential}} <b>genres</b> <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> which would characterize the Spanish commercial drama, {{also known as}} the [...] "Comedia", throughout the 17th century. While Lope de Vega wrote prose and poetry as well, he is best remembered for his plays, particularly those grounded in Spanish history. Like Cervantes, Lope de Vega served with the Spanish army and was fascinated with the Spanish nobility. In the hundreds of plays he wrote, with settings ranging from the Biblical times to legendary Spanish history to classical mythology to his own time, Lope de Vega frequently took a comical approach just as Cervantes did, taking a conventional moral play and dressing it up in good humor and cynicism. His stated goal was to entertain the public, much as Cervantes's was. In bringing morality, comedy, drama, and popular wit together, Lope de Vega is often compared to his English contemporary Shakespeare. Some have argued that as a social critic, Lope de Vega attacked, like Cervantes, many of the ancient institutions of his country - aristocracy, chivalry, and rigid morality, among others. Lope de Vega and Cervantes represented an alternative artistic perspective to the religious asceticism of Francisco Zurbarán. Lope de Vega's [...] "cloak-and-sword" [...] plays, which mingled intrigue, romance, and comedy together were carried on by his literary successor, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, in the later seventeenth century.

[...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 2001 In {{recent times}} in Australia {{much has been}} written and debated about what {{literacy}} is, what schools should teach in regards to literacy and how teachers should teach it. Teachers vary in their approaches to teaching literacy in the primary school, depending on many factors. One important factor is the quality of teacher knowledge of language and the associated capacity to use it to guide student literacy learning. This study focuses on teacher knowledge of <b>genres</b> <b>and</b> its relevance to the teaching of literacy in a Victorian Catholic primary school classroom with students from diverse language backgrounds. The concept of genres is clearly embedded in current curriculum documents, namely. the Curriculum and Standards Framework Il- English (Board of Studies, 2000).

40|$|Abstract The present project {{conducts a}} study of the {{experimental}} play with intertextual references present in postmodern movies. The project focusses on four movies made by the American auteur, Quentin Tarantino. His movies represent postmodern film tendencies and will illustrate how intertextual references contribute to a mixture of <b>genres</b> <b>and</b> the engagement of audiences. We make use of the term den medievante tilskuer with a view to describe the viewer who is familiar with the postmodern tendencies and knows what to expect from a postmodern film. By explaining how postmodern movies break away from the traditional way of understanding genre, we examine what impact the extensive use of intertextual references has on the audience. This involves both theories about <b>genre</b> conventions <b>and</b> narrative <b>structures</b> as well as different views of intertextuality and the effect of metafiction. We make use of Helle Haastrup and Roland Barthes in order to understand and summarize intertextuality, Lauridsen & Svendsen for understanding genres, while Per Helmer Hansen contributes to an understanding of postmodernism in general. Based on Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds and Kill Bill Vol. I, our analysis emphasize the fact that fragmented narrative structures as well as <b>genre</b> combinations <b>and</b> intertextual references establish a metatextual film universe. This creates new dynamic genres (as opposed to static <b>genres)</b> <b>and</b> challenges the attention of the audience and its engagement with the film. By discussing how the viewer engages with the movie, what happens when something known is seen from a new perspective and how intertextuality influenced the constitution of new genres, we found that the use of intertextuality contributes to revitalization of static genres...|$|R
40|$|Academic writing, {{including}} in English as an Academic Lingua Franca, {{has become a}} central feature {{for the majority of}} European university students. Despite a large body of research, we find that conceptualisations of student writing still tend to assume a direct link to expert academic genres, which are often explicitly evoked as models. Within a genre analytic paradigm, however, the importance of communicative purpose for the identification of genres suggests a need for a different conceptualisation, namely one where student genres are viewed as independent genres. Following such an argumentation, this paper investigates the communicative purposes that are represented in L 2 academic student papers, with a focus on introductions and conclusions. Altogether 56 papers were analysed in terms of their <b>genre</b> <b>structures,</b> <b>and</b> all student authors provided questionnaire data about their communicative purposes. Findings suggest a clear set of shared communicative purposes, with, however, some interesting mismatches in student writing. Firstly, communicative purposes are identified and realised which are not deemed appropriate by expert members of the discourse community and, secondly, despite overtly identifying appropriate communicative purposes, textual realisations do not match these. Both of these mismatches have clear pedagogic implications related to fostering students’ <b>genre</b> awareness <b>and</b> <b>genre</b> competence...|$|R
40|$|This article investigates how journalists {{employed}} pre-defined culturally grounded meta-narratives <b>and</b> <b>genres</b> in journalistic {{communication of}} climate change at the Bali summit in 2007. The journalists investigated {{in this article are}} found to have constructed a variety of “protagonists”. The most typical is based on the representative from a “tiny” state that stood up to the “most powerful nation on earth”. Other varieties place the protagonists and helpers firmly within longer, well-known national narratives on nation and its role in the world. The constant ingredient in almost all narratives seems to be the construction of the “opponent”, with the USA universally portrayed as the opponent who has to be defeated in order for the desired goal to be achieved. A large majority of journalists in this selection systematically chose to construct narratives conforming to pre-defined <b>genres,</b> <b>structuring</b> <b>and</b> framing the information according to historically constructed notions of what the audience want. The need to construct a “good story” took precedence over the critical ideal of “informing society”. From a critical realism perspective, this is problematic because ontology must have priority over epistemology...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} genre {{represents}} a meaningful pattern of communication, {{which has been}} applied in the information systems field. Genres are socially constructed: they may consequently be socially more or less acceptable or contested. This paper focuses {{on the concept of}} communicative <b>genre</b> <b>and</b> addresses the issue of how meta-communication processes guided by discursive-ethical principles can promote a rational and legitimate definition, design <b>and</b> <b>structuring</b> of <b>genres.</b> Such a meta-communication process has not yet been thoroughly discussed in relation to the concept of genre as a means for structuring (organizational) communication. This paper claims to make the following contributions: firstly, it provides a wider spectrum of discursive concepts for critically reflecting on and discursive evaluation of the content <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> of <b>genres</b> <b>and</b> <b>genre</b> instances. Secondly, it demonstrates how different kinds of meta-communications (ex ante, in-action, and ex post) can be used to legitimate genres in a manner compatible with the discourse ethics. It illustrates the discourse-ethical viewpoint concerning the legitimacy of <b>genre</b> <b>structuring</b> processes <b>and</b> thus, also, the legitimacy of resultant norms and contents of communication, especially in global contexts...|$|R
