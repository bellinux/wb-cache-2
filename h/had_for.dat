5|$|Irish {{immigrants}} generally remained {{loyal to}} the Democratic Party, but McKinley's promises of sound money attracted German-Americans who were appalled by Bryan's inflationary proposals. German-Americans had long been Democratic; efforts by that party to rebut McKinley, including circulating a statement by Bismarck in support of bimetallism, were ineffective. Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association <b>had</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England.

40|$|Competing {{interests}} {{over the}} park 2 ̆ 7 s land use between conservation and forest use result in many conflicts. The conservation group {{is interested in}} seeing more land be allocated for conservation, while the community forestry-working group is interested in seeing more land be allocated for community forestry, but both view that their utilities would be maximized if they consume {{some of the other}} 2 ̆ 7 s good. The conservation groupvalues the land based on zone because of conservation nalue, while the community forestry values the land besed on habitai because of productivity. This study optimizing preferences of both groups attempts to propose the optimal allocation of the park 2 ̆ 7 s forestland between the two interests. The result suggests that the total evergreen forest land in the general conservation zone could be allocated 2, 742 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> the conservation and 1, 871 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry and the total evergteen forest land in the managed resources zone could be allocated 237 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> conservation and 475 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry. And the total mengrove forestland in the general conservation zone could be allocated 608 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> conservation and 352 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry and the total mangrove forestland in the managed resource zone could be allocated 585 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> conservation and 1, 079 <b>ha</b> <b>for</b> community forestry. For better management, it is recommended that all community forestry land should be confined in the managed resource zone only rather than in both zones. This requires some of the land in the general conservation zone be added into the managef resource zone...|$|R

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero <b>had</b> <b>for</b> his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys <b>had</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|E

In order to project his influence northwards to control the people of the Danelaw (an area that <b>had</b> <b>for</b> a time been under the control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and Viking city of Lincoln.|$|E
