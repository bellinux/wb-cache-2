50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some lathe chucks have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are <b>flexible</b> <b>collars</b> or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|R
40|$|This section {{comprises}} the diesel generator building ventilation system (with warm moist air as the normal environment), which contains ducts, piping and fittings, equipment frames and housings, <b>flexible</b> <b>collars</b> and seals, and {{heating and cooling}} air handlers. Based on Regulatory Guide 1. 26, "Quality Group Classifications and Standards for Water, Steam, and Radioactive Waste-Containing Components of Nuclear Power Plants, " all components that comprise the diesel generator building ventilation system are governed by Group C Quality Standards. With respect to seals, these items are to be addressed consistent with the NRC position on consumables, provided in the NRC letter from Christopher I. Grimes to Douglas J. Walters of NEI, dated March 10, 2000. Specifically, components that function as system seals are typically replaced based on performance or condition monitoring that identifies whether these components are {{at the end of}} their qualified lives and may be excluded, on a plant-specific basis, from an aging management review under 10 CFR 54. 21 (a) (1) (ii). The application is to identify the standards that are relied on for replacement as part of the methodology description, for example, NFPA standards for fire protection equipment.

40|$|Sufficient {{ballistic}} {{protection of}} the neck area would significantly reduce the vulnerability of an infantry soldier. So far this protection is offered by extensions on the ballistic vest or combat helmet. However, the requirements for head agility and the various body to head positions combined with the design of current body armour solutions, generally result in an unprotected in-between gap. The combination of critical body functions in the neck area, causing casualties in case of fragment penetrations, has motivated TNO to investigate options for ballistic protection of this area. In this paper {{the vulnerability of the}} neck area is briefly addressed. Casualty data of infantry operations and model analysis show the potential value of sufficient ballistic protection of this part of the body. A range of options has been considered, finally resulting in a closed 3 -dimensional geometry that maintains its ballistic function, independently of head position and angle of the ballistic threat. In this so called <b>flexible</b> ballistic <b>collar,</b> aramid weave layers were combined with a rubber support structure. By using the possibility of the two main fibre orientations of these weaves to shear to non-perpendicular orientations, the product can deform to different heights (in shoulder to head direction) at minimum force. With this deformation capability, the gap between combat helmet and ballistic vest is closed at any conceivable head position. A range of prototypes was manufactured and tested on fragment penetration resistance. Because of the geometry of the <b>flexible</b> ballistic <b>collar,</b> combining a wide range of angle of impact effects over the contour of the collar, standard V 50 testing was not possible. An alternative method has been developed and used, providing a clear limit velocity for 1. 1 gram Fragment Simulating Projectiles (FSPs). Operational use of the ballistic collar, results in multiple collar compressions while following head to body movements. The productâ€™s ballistic performance has been determined also after 10. 000 of these simulated deformations of the product. It showed that the products ballistic performance was not significantly affected by these repeated deformations...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the collar graft (standard dacron graft with a customized <b>flexible</b> <b>collar</b> attached to the proximal rim) decreased anastomotic bleeding and the overall clamp time. DesignProspective randomised single center study. MethodsBetween November 2003 and January 2006, 21 patients were treated with a collar graft and 19 with a standard dacron graft. Routine endoaneurysmorraphy was used. Only infra-renal aneurysms between 5. 5 cm and 6. 5 cm were included. Aneurysms were diagnosed by CT scans. The total number of bleeding points, the total clamp time, and the number of teflon felt pledgets, was determined. ResultsThe total number of bleeding points; the number of aortic re-clamps and total clamp time (minutes) per patient were all significantly lower in the collar graft group (1. 2 versus 2, p< 0. 04; 0. 5 versus 2. 0, p< 0. 001; 13. 6 versus 20. 1, p< 0. 003 respectively). The number of teflon felt pledgets and new sutures used was significantly lower in the collar graft group (p< 0. 001 and p< 0. 003 respectively). ConclusionThe collar graft resulted in fewer anastomotic bleeding points and a shorter clamp time...|$|E
40|$|System {{and methods}} are {{disclosed}} for fluid measurements {{which may be}} utilized to determine mass flow rates such as instantaneous mass flow of a fluid stream. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention may be utilized to compare an input mass flow to an output mass flow of a drilling fluid circulation stream. In one embodiment, a fluid flow rate is determined by utilizing a microwave detector in combination with an acoustic sensor. The acoustic signal is utilized to eliminate 2 pi phase ambiguities in a reflected microwave signal. In another embodiment, a fluid flow rate may be determined by detecting a phase shift of an acoustic signal across two different predetermined transmission paths. A fluid density may be determined by detecting a calibrated phase shift of an acoustic signal through the fluid. In another embodiment, a second acoustic signal may be transmitted through the fluid to define a particular 2 pi phase range which defines the phase shift. The present invention may comprise multiple transmitters/receivers operating at different frequencies to measure instantaneous fuel levels of cryogenic fuels within containers positioned in zero or near zero gravity environments. In one embodiment, a moveable <b>flexible</b> <b>collar</b> of transmitter/receivers may be utilized to determine inhomogenuities within solid rocket fuel tubes...|$|E
50|$|The righting reflex is {{the attempt}} of cats {{to land on}} their feet at the {{completion}} of a jump or a fall. They can do this more easily than other animals due to their <b>flexible</b> spine, floating <b>collar</b> bone, and loose skin. Cats also use vision and/or their vestibular apparatus to help tell which way to turn. They then can stretch themselves out and relax their muscles. The righting reflex does not always result in the cat landing on its feet{{at the completion of}} the fall.|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{reactions}} {{associated with}} the formation of lesions generated in the carotid artery of rabbits fed either normal or high cholesterol diets by the placement of a <b>flexible,</b> silastic <b>collar</b> around the artery, were studied by electron microscopy. Endothelial cells remained as a monolayer throughout lesion development. The endothelial cell surface in both experimental and sham operated carotids, 4 hours and 8 hours after the initiation of the experiments, were covered with platelets and leukocytes. Neutrophils were present until 7 days in the arteries from within the collar of animals maintained on a normal diet, but only to 1 day in the cholesterol-fed animals. Neutrophils were observed within the medial layer. Few monocytes were identified. An intimal lesion had formed after 7 days in both groups of animals. Macrophage-like cells and foam cells were identified in the cholesterol-fed animals. The size of the lesion increased up to 56 days in animals maintained on a high cholesterol diet, but regression occurred after the 14 -days sample in those animals on a normal diet. Concurrently a proportion of the smooth muscle cells changed from contractile to synthetic phenotype within the intimal and medial region of the collared artery of both high cholesterol and normocholesterolaemic animals. Lesions did not form in the contralateral, sham operated arteries...|$|R
40|$|Stream {{networks}} {{have recently been}} discovered to be major but poorly constrained natural greenhouse gas (GHG) sources. A fundamental problem is that several measurement approaches have been used without cross-comparisons. Flux chambers represent a potentially powerful methodological approach if robust and reliable ways to use chambers on running water can be defined. Here we compare the use of anchored and freely drifting chambers on various streams with different flow velocities. The study clearly shows that (1) anchored chambers enhance turbulence under the chambers and thus elevate fluxes, (2) drifting chambers have a very small impact on the water turbulence under the chamber and thus generate more reliable fluxes, (3) the bias of the anchored chambers greatly depends on chamber design and sampling conditions, and (4) there is a promising method to reduce the bias from anchored chambers by using a <b>flexible</b> plastic foil <b>collar</b> to seal the chambers to the water surface, rather than having rigid chamber walls penetrating into the water. Altogether, these results provide novel guidance on how to apply flux chambers in running water, which will have important consequences for measurements to constrain the global GHG balances.

40|$|The in vivo {{activity}} of different 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (vastatins) on neointimal formation induced by insertion of a <b>flexible</b> <b>collar</b> around one carotid artery of normocholesterolemic rabbits was investigated. The contralateral carotid artery {{served as a}} sham control. Pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin were given mixed with food at daily doses of 20 ing/kg body wt for 2 weeks starting {{on the day of}} collar placement. The treatment with vastatins did not modify rabbit plasma cholesterol concentrations. The neointimal formation was assessed by measuring the cross-sectional thickness of intimal and medial tissues of fixed arteries with light microscopy. Fourteen days after collar placement, intimal hyperplasia (mostly cellular) was pronounced in treated carotid arteries. The intimal/medial (I/M) tissue ratio was 12 -fold higher in treated arteries than in arteries without the collar (0. 36 Â± 0. 04 versus 0. 03 Â± 0. 02). Animals treated with lovastatin (R= 12), simvastatin (n= 12), and fluvastatin (R= 12) showed significantly less neointimal formation; I/M tissue ratios were 0. 24 Â± 0. 03, 0. 20 Â± 0. 03, and 0. 17 Â± 0. 03, respectively. The inhibition elicited by pravastatin (n= 12, 032 Â± 0. 03) did not reach statistical significance. or-Actin antibody immunofluorescence analysis of serial sections revealed that cells present in the hyperplastic intima were mostly myocytes. Rates of intimal myocyte proliferation were also measured by incorporation of 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine, a thymidin...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} (i. e., temperature management) is {{an effective}} option for improving survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest and is potentially useful {{for the care of}} the critically ill neurological patient. We analyzed the feasibility of a device to control the temperature of the brain by controlling the temperature of the blood flowing through the neck. METHODS: A lumped parameter dynamic model, with one-dimensional heat transfer, was used to predict cooling effects and to test experimental hypotheses. The cooling system consisted of a <b>flexible</b> <b>collar</b> and was tested on 4 adult sheep, in which brain and body temperatures were invasively monitored {{for the duration of the}} experiment. RESULTS: Model-based simulations predicted a lowering of the temperature of the brain and the body following the onset of cooling, with a rate of 0. 4 Â°C/h for the brain and 0. 2 Â°C/h for the body. The experimental findings showed comparable cooling rates in the two body compartments, with temperature reductions of 0. 6 (0. 2) Â°C/h for the brain and 0. 6 (0. 2) Â°C/h for the body. For a 70 kg adult human subject, we predict a temperature reduction of 0. 64 Â°C/h for the brain and 0. 43 Â°C/h for the body. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a non-invasive method to induce brain hypothermia using a portable collar. This device demonstrated an optimal safety profile and represents a potentially useful method for the administration of mild hypothermia and temperature control (i. e., treatment of hyperpyrexia) in cardiac arrest and critically ill neurologic patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} computation {{of forces}} and corresponding deformation of cages subjected to waves and current loading {{is critical to}} the design of mooring systems for fish farms. In the present work, a complete methodology describing the numerical modeling of net structures and its corresponding interaction with mooring lines and floating platforms has been developed. The effect of every element on the cage over the global response and the effective numerical representation of these components of a cage system are studied. The numerical model of cages is built and calculated using the commercial software OrcaFlex v 9. 6 a. In this software, an equivalent net model is created using an array of cylinders connected by buoys. This model has the same wet mass, axial stiffness and projected area as the prototype net, allowing for the accurate calculation of forces and deformations over the cage due to wave and current loading. A variable drag coefficient formulation is implemented in the software, based on the relative normal velocity between line elements and fluid. This drag coefficient is fed into the modified version of the Morison equation, which accounts for relative motion, to obtain the drag force on the netting using the cross flow principle. In addition, shielding effect is included in the calculations by using riser interaction models. Furthermore, blockage due to large deformations of flexible cages is also accounted for by the derivation of a semi empirical formulation for drag coefficient on Raschel nets. Careful validation of the present methodology is conducted by comparing numerical results with experimental published data. Validation is presented for a single cage, which includes a surface <b>flexible</b> <b>collar,</b> netting, ballast and mooring lines. Applied loads include current, regular waves and a combination of regular waves and current to evaluate interaction effects. The influence of wave kinematics stretching models on mooring line tension results is also analyzed. Additionally, calculations considering irregular waves and following current are performed for the completeness of the study. Further analyses consider the coupled response of a mooring/platform/cage system. The system intends to describe the interaction of a single cage and a feeder vessel installed in deep water. Effects of the location of the cage in the water column and the net selection on the dynamics of the platform are studied. The results are qualitatively compared against field measurements in a similar installation 6 miles offshore of Kona Hawaii. This study can directly be applied to the calculation of the coupled response of multiple technologies such as floating offshore wind turbines, wave energy conversion and offshore fish farming...|$|E
