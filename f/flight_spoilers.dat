2500|$|Meanwhile, {{airspeed}} {{continued to}} decrease, and the autopilot rolled the control wheel {{to the maximum}} left limit of 23 degrees. As the speed decreased even further, the plane began to roll to the right, even though the autopilot was maintaining the maximum left roll limit. [...] By the time the captain disconnected the autopilot, the plane had rolled over 60 degrees {{to the right and}} the nose had begun to drop. Ailerons and <b>flight</b> <b>spoilers</b> were the only means available to the autopilot to keep the wings level as the autopilot does not connect to the rudder during normal flight. To counteract the asymmetrical forces created by the loss of thrust from the No. 4 engine, it was essential for the pilot to manually push on the left rudder. However, the captain failed to use any rudder inputs at all, before or after disconnecting the autopilot. The resulting uncontrolled flight path is depicted in the diagram.|$|E

The two spoilers had about 7. 5 years of commercial flight experience on All Nippon Airways Model 737 aircraft.

40|$|An {{aircraft}} <b>flight</b> <b>spoiler</b> {{control mechanism}} is described. The invention enables the conventional, primary spoiler control system {{to retain its}} operational characteristics while accommodating a secondary input controlled by a conventional computer system to supplement the settings made by the primary input. This is achieved by interposing springs between the primary input and the spoiler control unit. The springs are selected to have a stiffness intermediate to the greater force applied by the primary control linkage and the lesser resistance offered by the spoiler control unit. Thus, operation of the primary input causes the control unit to yield before the springs, yet, operation of the secondary input, acting directly on the control unit, causes the springs to yield and absorb adjustments before they are transmitted into the primary control system...|$|R
40|$|The trailing-wing sensor {{technique}} {{was used in}} the Langley V/STOL tunnel to determine the effectiveness of 11 combinations of the existing flight-spoiler segments on a jumbo-jet transport aircraft model when they were deflected as trailing-vortex-alleviation devices. All 11 of the flight-spoiler configurations investigated were effective in reducing the induced rolling moment on the trailing model. This investigation is an extension of earlier wind-tunnel and flight tests which showed that the existing <b>flight</b> <b>spoilers</b> on the jumbo-jet aircraft can be used as effective trailing-vortex-alleviation devices. Essentially, all of the reduction in induced rolling moment on the trailing-wing model was realized at a spoiler deflection of 45 deg for single-spoiler configurations, 30 for two-spoiler configurations, and 15 deg for both the three- and four-spoiler configurations. Of the 11 flight-spoiler configurations investigated, the most promising configuration for trailing-vortex abatement on the jumbo-jet aircraft appears to be the three inboard <b>flight</b> <b>spoilers</b> deflected 15 deg...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of ground-based and flight investigations that have been performed at NASA for the purpose of development of spoilers as trailing-vortex hazard alleviation devices.

Substantial reductions in induced rolling moment occur when the spoiler vortex attenuator is located well forward on both unswept and swept wing models. In addition, it was found by ground-based model tests and verified by full-scale flight tests that the existing <b>flight</b> <b>spoilers</b> on the B- 747 aircraft are effective as trailing vortex attenuators. Based on the results of wind-tunnel investigations of the DC- 10 - 30 and L- 1011 aircraft models, the existing <b>flight</b> <b>spoilers</b> on both the DC- 10 - 30 and L- 1011 aircraft may also be effective trailing vortex attenuators...|$|E

The ground plane caused modifications in the vortex trajectories but did not alter vortex interactions and merging patterns in these multiple vortex wakes.

40|$|This report {{covers the}} fifth {{of a series}} of {{systematic}} investigations in which lateral control devices are compared with particular reference to their effectiveness at high angles of attack.

With the proper combination of spoiler and aileron, however, it is possible to obtain satisfactory rolling control up to high angles of attack (15 degrees to 20 degrees), together with favorable yawing moments and small control forces.

5000|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} SS.10 which steered {{similarly}} to an airplane with small flight controls called [...] "spoilers", {{located on the}} missiles wings, the SS.11 is steered in flight by unique system developed by NORD for France's first air-to-air missile, the AA.20, called TVC (thrust vectoring control) where four small vanes are located around the sustainer's exhaust which under command momentarily push into the sustainer's thrust causing the missile {{to move in the}} direction commanded. Since the missile spins slowly in flight by having the four swept wings slightly offset, a gyroscope is needed to determine the missile's relative orientation to the ground, that is, up, down and right, left. Unlike the earlier <b>spoiler</b> <b>flight</b> control, TVC is a far more precise method of controlling a missile in flight.

The aircraft landed on runway 6 right with a 90 degree crosswind from the left, gusting from 13 to 23 knots. The aircraft first contacted the runway in a left-wing-down sideslip.

40|$|Aircraft {{morphing}} {{is referred}} to as the ability for an aircraft to change its geometry in <b>flight.</b> Formally, flaps, <b>spoilers,</b> and control devices are considered morphing, but in general, morphing in aerospace is associated with geometrical changes using smart materials such as shape memory alloys. Shape memory alloy is a material that changes shape under heating and produces force and deflections, which make it potential actuator for a wing morphing system. The motivation behind this study is the application to small-sized and medium-sized unmanned air vehicles and the potential to increase range or endurance for a given fuel load through improved lift-to-drag ratio. The camber line of an airfoil section, the predominant parameter affecting lift and drag, is changed by resistive heating of a shape memory alloy actuator and cooling in the surrounding air. Experiments were conducted under wind tunnel conditions to verify analysis and to investigate the effects of its application on the aerodynamic behavior of the wing. This study investigated three control methodologies: the conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller, proportional-integral-derivative with robust compensator, and proportional-integral-derivative with anti-windup compensator. The latter proved to have superior performance in achieving and maintaining a required level of morphing. In addition, the power required to the shape memory alloy actuators under aerodynamic load, and the effect of ambient temperature was also investigated...|$|R
