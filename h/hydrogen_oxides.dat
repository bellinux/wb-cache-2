Much of the theoretical research {{was done with the}} aid of one-dimensional models. Different aspects of these models are discussed. Measurements of the chlorofluoromethanes, hydrochloric acid, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and hydrogen oxide were conducted. It is noted that the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> are now assuming a larger role in stratospheric photochemistry than have been postulated before. The effect of water vapor and the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> on the overall chemistry of the stratosphere was investigated theoretically, along with the possible relationship between solar activity and atmospheric ozone.

The demonstrated detection limit (S/N= 2, 5 min.) for OH is about 0. 005 pptv (1 x 10 (exp 6) /cu cm at 2 km altitude) and for HO 2 is 0. 05 pptv (1 x 10 (exp 6) /cu cm at 2 km altitude). We will use ATHOS to measure OH, HO 2, and HO 2 /OH during TRACE- P, analyze these results by comparing them against fundamental relationships and computer models, and publish the analyses.

40|$|Energetic {{particles}} {{enter the}} polar atmosphere {{and enhance the}} production of nitrogen oxides and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> in the winter stratosphere and mesosphere. Both components are powerful ozone destroyers. Recently, it has been inferred from observations that the direct effect of energetic particle precipitation (EPP) causes significant long-term mesospheric ozone variability. Satellites observe a decrease in mesospheric ozone by up to 34  % between EPP maximum and EPP minimum. Here, we analyze the climate impact of polar mesospheric and polar stratospheric ozone losses due to EPP in the coupled climate model MPI-ESM. Using radiative transfer modeling, {{we find that the}} radiative forcing of a mesospheric ozone loss during polar night is small. Hence, climate effects of a mesospheric ozone loss due to energetic particles seem unlikely. A stratospheric ozone loss due to energetic particles warms the winter polar stratosphere and subsequently weakens the polar vortex. However, those changes are small, and few statistically significant changes in surface climate are found...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of oxidation in forest atmospheres {{is being challenged}} by measurements of unexpectedly large amounts of hydroxyl (OH). A significant number of these OH measurements were made by laser-induced fluorescence in low-pressure detection chambers (called Fluorescence Assay with Gas Expansion (FAGE)) using the Penn State Ground-based Tropospheric <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>Oxides</b> Sensor (GTHOS). We deployed a new chemical removal method to measure OH in parallel with the traditional FAGE method in a California forest. The new method gives on average only 40 – 60 % of the OH from the traditional method and this discrepancy is temperature dependent. Evidence indicates that the new method measures atmospheric OH while the traditional method is affected by internally generated OH, possibly from oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds. The improved agreement between OH measured by this new technique and modeled OH suggests that oxidation chemistry {{in at least one}} forest atmosphere is better understood than previously thought...|$|E

A recent airborne experiment (March-April, 1999) focused over the southern hemisphere (SH) Pacific Ocean (PEM-tropics-B) provided a first opportunity for a detailed characterization of the oxygenated organic composition of the remote southern hemisphere troposphere. Three co-located multi-channel airborne instruments measured a dozen key oxygenated species (carbonyls, alcohols, organic nitrates, organic pernitrates, peroxides) along with a comprehensive suite of C 2 -C 8 Nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC).

40|$|Recent {{progress}} {{in the understanding of}} the chemistry and photochemistry of the paleoatmosphere is reviewed with emphasis on the application of photochemical models to the investigation of the evolution of the atmosphere.

Estimations of O 2 produced from the photolysis of water vapor prior to the emergence of photosynthesis range from less than 10 to the - 14 th to 0. 1 times the present atmospheric level, indicating the need for further research. A series of photochemical models of increasing complexity has been developed to study the evolution of atmospheric ozone taking into account reactions with O atoms, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides,</b> nitrogen oxides, and chlorine as well as vertical transport, temperature and tropospheric chemistry so that the total content and vertical distribution of O 3 may be determined for a specified level of paleoatmospheric O 2...|$|E

40|$|In-situ HO(x) (OH and HO 2) {{measurements}} are {{an essential part}} of understanding the photochemistry of aircraft exhaust in the atmosphere. HO(x) affects the partitioning of nitrogen species in the NO(y) family. Its reactions are important sources and sinks for tropospheric ozone, thus providing a link between the NO(x) in aircraft exhaust and tropospheric ozone. OH mixing ratios are enhanced in aircraft wakes due to the photolysis of the HONO that is made close to the engine. Measurements of HO(x) in aircraft wakes, along with NO(x) measurements, thus provides a constraint on chemical models of the engine combustion and exhaust. The development of the Airborne Tropospheric <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>Oxides</b> Sensor (ATHOS) is reported. We designed, developed, and successfully flew this instrument. It was part of the instrument complement on board the NASA DC- 8 during SUCCESS, which took place in Kansas in April and May, 1996.

While this sensitivity is about 2 - 3 times less than the initial projections in the proposal, it is more than adequate for good measurements of OH and HO 2 from the planetary boundary layer to the stratosphere.

40|$|Ozone {{pollution}} affects human health, {{especially in}} urban areas on hot sunny days. Its basic photochemistry {{has been known for}} decades and yet it is still not possible to correctly predict the high ozone levels that are the greatest threat. The CalNex_SJV study in Bakersfield CA in May/June 2010 provided an opportunity to examine ozone photochemistry in an urban area surrounded by agriculture. The measurement suite included hydroxyl (OH), hydroperoxyl (HO_ 2), and OH reactivity, which are compared with the output of a photochemical box model. While the agreement is generally within combined uncertainties, measured HO 2 far exceeds modeled HO_ 2 in NO_x-rich plumes. OH production and loss do not balance as they should in the morning, and the ozone production calculated with measured HO_ 2 is a decade greater than that calculated with modeled HO_ 2 when NO levels are high. Calculated ozone production using measured HO 2 is twice that using modeled HO_ 2, but this difference in calculated ozone production has minimal impact on the assessment of NOx-sensitivity or VOC-sensitivity for midday ozone production. Evidence from this study indicates that this important discrepancy is not due to the HO_ 2 measurement or to the sampling of transported plumes but instead to either emissions of unknown organic species that accompany the NO emissions or unknown photochemistry involving nitrogen oxides and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides,</b> possibly the hypothesized reaction OH + NO + O_ 2 → HO_ 2 + NO_ 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydroxyl}} and hydroperoxy radicals (OH and HO 2, collectively {{referred to}} as HOx) are extremely reactive species, causing most of the photochemical processing of trace gases in the atmosphere and influencing both ozone production and aerosol formation. OH and HO 2 were observed during the TexAQS campaign in Houston in August/September 2000 with the Penn State GTHOS instrument (Ground-based Tropospheric <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>Oxides</b> Sensor) by laser induced fluorescence of OH. A {{detailed description of the}} technique is given in Stevens (1994). HO 2 was quantitatively converted to OH by titration with NO. The 1 σ precision for OH was about 2. 5 × 105 molec/cm 3 for 10 -min averages or approximately 0. 01 ppt. For HO 2 the 1 σ precision was approximately 0. 1 ppt for 1 -min averages. The 2 -sigma-accuracy was ± 40 %, due to uncertainties of the absolute calibration. In addition total OH loss rates in ambient air were measured using the TOHLM expe-riment (Total OH Loss rate Measurement). OH produced by photolysis of water vapour is injected at different positions into ambient air pumped through a flow tube. The remaining OH {{at the end of the}} flow tube is measured by LIF.

40|$|Abstract. Simultaneous {{measurements}} of the oxides of hydrogen and nitrogen made during the NASA Subsonic Assessment, Ozone and Nitrogen Oxide Experiment (SONEX) afforded an opportunity to study the coupling between these two important families throughout the free troposphere and lowermost stratosphere. Moreover, the suite of measurements made during the campaign was unprecedented in its completeness, thus providing a uniquely de-tailed picture of the radical photochemistry that drives oxidation and ozone production {{in this part of}} the atmosphere. On average, observed <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> (HOx = OH + HO 2) agree well with both instantaneous and diel steady-state models; however, there is a persistent deviation of the observations that correlates with the abundance of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) in the sampled air mass. Specifically, the observed HO • tends to exceed the model predictions in the presence of high NO • concentrations, byas much as a factor of 5 (> 500 pptv NOx), and is sometimes as little as half that expected by steady state at lower NOj levels. While many possibilities for these discrepancies are discussed, it is argued that an instrumental rtifact is not probable and that the discrepancy may bespeak a shortcoming of our understanding of HO • chemistry. The consistently elevated HO • in the presence of elevated NOx leads directly to greater ozone production than expected, thereby extending the NOx-limited regime of the upper troposphere. These results could thus have bearing on the predicted impacts of in-creasing NO • emissions into this region of the atmosphere from, for example, the growth of global air traffic...|$|E

Although the next such excursion is certain to come, {{little is known about the}} timing and possible consequences for the state of the atmosphere and the ecosystems. Here we use the global chemistry climate model SOCOL-MPIOM to simulate the effects of geomagnetic excursions on atmospheric ionization, chemistry and dynamics. Our simulations show significantly increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO x) in the entire stratosphere, especially over Antarctica (+ 15 %), due to enhanced ionization by galactic cosmic rays. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> (HO x) are also produced in greater amounts (up to + 40 %) in the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, while their destruction by reactions with enhanced NO x prevails over the poles and in high altitudes (by − 5 %). Stratospheric ozone concentrations decrease globally above 20 km by 1 – 2 % and at the northern hemispheric tropopause by up to 5 % owing to the accelerated NO x -induced destruction. A 5 % increase is found in the southern lower stratosphere and troposphere. In response to these changes in ozone and the concomitant changes in atmospheric heating rates, the Arctic vortex intensifies in boreal winter, while the Antarctic vortex weakens in austral winter and spring. Surface wind anomalies show significant intensification of the southern westerlies at their poleward edge during austral winter and a pronounced northward shift in spring.

Starting with an assumed black-body stellar emission for an M 7 class dwarf star, the stellar UV irradiation was increased stepwise and the resulting climate-photochemical response of the planetary atmosphere was calculated. Results suggest a Goldilocks effect {{with respect to the}} spectral detection of ozone. At weak UV levels, the ozone column was weak (due to weaker production from the Chapman mechanism) hence its spectral detection was challenging. At strong UV levels, ozone formation is stronger but its associated stratospheric heating leads to a weakening in temperature gradients between the stratosphere and troposphere, which results in weakened spectral bands. Also, increased UV levels can lead to enhanced abundances of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> which oppose the ozone formation effect. At intermediate UV (i. e. with x 10 the stellar UV radiative flux of black body Planck curves corresponding to spectral class M 7) the conditions are just right for spectral detection. Results suggest that the planetary O 3 profile is sensitive to the UV output of the star from about(200 - 350) nm. We also investigated the effect of increasing the top-of-atmosphere incoming Lyman-alpha radiation but this had only a minimal effect on the biosignatures since it was efficiently absorbed in the uppermost planetary atmospheric layer, mainly by abundant methane.

Photochemical models self-consistently solve these equations to determine species concentrations. Recent Nimbus 7 measurements give us a first chance to analyze diagnostically the global atmosphere for consistency. We compute the diurnal average photochemical production and loss terms of ozone using monthly and zonally averaged limb infrared monitor of the stratosphere (LIMS) 03, H 20, HNO 3, NO 2, and temper-ature and stratospheric and mesospheric sounder (SAMS) CH, • data. The loss rates of ozone by pure oxygen species, by the nitrogen oxides, and by the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> are calculated along with the production rate of ozone by oxygen photolysis. The other major loss rate for ozone, which is the loss rate by the chlorine family, is calculated from a two-dimensional model including SAMS CH, • measurements and a total C 1 x of 3 ppbv at the stratopause, yielding a C 10 profile in good agreement with balloon measurements. All loss rates of ozone are therefore tied to experimental measurements. Ozone is thought to be in photochemical equilibrium at low latitudes near 2 mbar; however, our calculations show the diurnal average ozone loss to be about 40 - 60 % higher than the production. Therefore photochemical models using LIMS H 20, HNO 3, NO 2, and temperature and SAMS CH, • will predict lower ozone concentrations than those measured by LIMS.
