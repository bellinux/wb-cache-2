25|$|When ingested, it {{is usually}} {{recommended}} that the more water-soluble, short-acting tetracyclines (plain tetracycline, chlortetracycline, Oxytetracycline, <b>demeclocycline</b> and methacycline) be taken with a full glass of water, either two hours after eating or two hours before eating. This is partly because most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Dairy products, antacids and preparations containing iron should be avoided near the time of taking the drug. Partial exceptions to these rules occur for doxycycline and minocycline, which may be taken with food (though not iron, antacids, or calcium supplements).

50|$|The use in SIADH {{actually}} {{relies on}} a side effect; <b>demeclocycline</b> induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (dehydration due to the inability to concentrate urine).

50|$|Tetracyclines bind to cations, such as calcium, iron (when given orally), and magnesium, {{rendering}} them insoluble and inabsorbable for the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Demeclocycline</b> {{should not}} be taken with food (particularly milk and other dairy products) or antacids.|$|E
50|$|As with related {{tetracycline}} antibiotics, <b>demeclocycline</b> acts by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit {{to inhibit}} binding of aminoacyl tRNA which impairs protein synthesis by bacteria.

50|$|It {{is officially}} {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of various types of bacterial infections. It is used as an antibiotic in the treatment of Lyme disease, acne, and bronchitis.

The cornerstone of therapy for SIADH is reduction of water intake. If hyponatremia persists, then <b>demeclocycline</b> (an antibiotic with the side effect of inhibiting ADH) can be used.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>demeclocycline</b> {{and its main}} impurities by capillary electrophoresis is described. <b>Demeclocycline</b> is a tetracycline antibiotic. Main impurities are demethyltetracycline, 4 -epidemeclocycline and 4 -epidemethyltetracycline, which are formed due to fermentation or degradation.

40|$|Binding of {{vasopressin}} to its type 2 receptor in renal {{collecting ducts}} induces cAMP signaling, transcription and translocation of aquaporin (AQP) 2 water channels to the plasma membrane, and water reabsorption from the prourine. <b>Demeclocycline</b> is currently {{used to treat}} hyponatremia in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Demeclocycline's mechanism of action, which is poorly understood, is studied here. In mouse cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cells, which exhibit deamino- 8 -d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) -dependent expression of endogenous AQP 2, <b>demeclocycline</b> decreased AQP 2 abundance and gene transcription but not its protein stability. <b>Demeclocycline</b> did not affect vasopressin type 2 receptor localization but decreased dDAVP-induced cAMP generation and the abundance of adenylate cyclase 3 and 5 / 6. The addition of exogenous cAMP partially corrected the <b>demeclocycline</b> effect. As in patients, <b>demeclocycline</b> increased urine volume, decreased urine osmolality, and reverted hyponatremia in an SIADH rat model. AQP 2 and adenylate cyclase 5 / 6 abundances were reduced in the inner medulla but increased in the cortex and outer medulla, {{in the absence of}} any sign of toxicity. In conclusion, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that <b>demeclocycline</b> mainly attenuates hyponatremia in SIADH by reducing adenylate cyclase 5 / 6 expression and, consequently, cAMP generation, AQP 2 gene transcription, and AQP 2 abundance in the renal inner medulla, coinciding with a reduced vasopressin escape response in other collecting duct segments...|$|E

The rise in serum sodium was accompanied by mild sodium retention, as measured by external balance and exchangeable sodium. A complication of treatment was the development of acute renal failure possibly induced by a nephrotoxic effect of high circulating levels of demeclocyline. On stopping demeclocyline renal function returned to normal and, after some delay, SIADH returned, and was still present 9 months after initial presentation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Fourteen {{patients}} with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) have been treated with demethylchlortetracycline (<b>demeclocycline)</b> 1200 mg daily. In 12 patients the underlying lesion was malignant. The serum sodium returned to normal (> 135 mmol/l) in all patients after a mean of 8 - 6 days (SD+ 5 - 3 days). Blood urea rose significantly from the pretreatment level of 4 - 2 ± 2 - 3 mmol/l to 10 - 1 ± 5 - 1 mmol/l at ten days (p< 0 001). The average maximum blood urea was 13 - 4 - 6 - 8 mmol/l. In four patients the urea rose above 20 mmol/l, and in two of these demecyocycline was discontinued because of this rise. The azotaemia {{could be attributed to}} a combination of increased urea production and a mild specific drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Discontinuation of <b>demeclocycline</b> in six patients led to a fall in serum sodium, in one case precipitously, and return of the urea towards normal levels. <b>Demeclocycline</b> appears therefore to be an effective maintenance treatment of SIADH, and the azotaemia that occurs is reversible and probably dose dependent. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) has become increas-ingly recognised as a treatable cause of stupor and confusion in {{patients with}} a wide variety of diseases (De Troyer and Demanet, 1976). Until recently treatment has been directed at correcting the electrolyte abnormalities by fluid restriction, which may be difficult in a confused patient (Perks et al, 1976), or treatment of the primary condition. Several case reports (Cherrill et al, 1975; De Troyer and Demanet, 1975; Perks et al, 1976; Perks et al, 1978) have suggested that de-meclocycline is effective in SIADH. Demeclo-cycline interferes with the action of antidiuretic hormone on the renal collecting ducts and thus induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (Singer and Rotenberg, 1973). Recent publications (De Troyer, 1977; Forrest et al, 1978) have recorded the efficacy of <b>demeclocycline</b> in correcting hypo-natraemia in SIADH.

40|$|Inhibition of the {{proliferation}} of Ehrlichia risticii cultured in murine macrophage P 388 D 1 cells by eight antibiotics was evaluated by indirect fluorescent-antibody staining with an antiserum specific to E. risticii. There was a negative correlation between the percentage of infected cells and the log 10 of the concentrations of all antibiotics examined. The ranks of the antibiotics {{in the order of}} 50 % inhibitory concentrations (on a microgram-per-milliliter basis) after 48 h of exposure were as follows: <b>demeclocycline,</b> doxycycline, and oxytetracycline less than minocycline less than rifampin less than tetracycline less than erythromycin and nalidixic acid. When the antibiotics were removed after 48 h of incubation, continuous inhibition of proliferation was evident at 72 h. At 96 h regrowth of the organisms occurred in most of the cultures. The rate of regrowth was the highest with nalidixic acid, followed by erythromycin, at all concentrations of the antibiotic tested. Regrowth was observed with less than 0. 1 microgram of minocycline per ml and less than 0. 01 microgram of oxytetracycline, tetracycline, and doxycycline per ml. With more than 0. 01 microgram of <b>demeclocycline</b> per ml, however, the inhibition persisted for up to 72 h after removal of the antibiotic. These results indicate that <b>demeclocycline</b> was slightly more effective than doxycycline, oxytetracycline, and minocycline in eliminating E. risticii in macrophages in vitro, whereas tetracycline and rifampin were less effective.

30|$|The {{traditional}} {{approach to the}} treatment of such cases involves restriction of free water intake [12], use of loop diuretics [13], <b>demeclocycline</b> [14], osmotic diuretics, such as urea [15] or intravenous administration of normal or hypertonic saline [16]. In ICU patients, fluid restriction is in fact poorly tolerated and difficult to achieve [17], and increased intake of salt does not address the causative factor, which is free water excess.|$|E
