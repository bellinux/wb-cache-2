50|$|However, {{when the}} MOSFET {{is in the}} ON-state, this N− layer has no function. Furthermore, {{as it is a}} lightly doped region, its {{intrinsic}} resistivity is non-negligible and adds to the MOSFET's ON-state <b>Drain-to-Source</b> <b>Resistance</b> (RDSon) (this is the Rn resistance in figure 2).|$|E
40|$|Performance {{limits of}} silicon MOSFETs are {{examined}} {{by a simple}} analytical theory augmented by self-consistent Schrdinger-Poisson simulations. The on-current, transconductance, and <b>drain-to-source</b> <b>resistance</b> in the ballistic limit (which corresponds to the channel length approaching zero) are examined. The ballistic transconductance in the limit that the oxide thickness approaches zero is also examined. The results show that as the channel length approaches zero (which corresponds to the ballistic limit), the on-current and transconductance approach finite limiting values and the channel resistance approaches a finite minimum value. The source velocity can {{be as high as}} about 15 10 7. cm/s. The limiting on-current and transconductance are considerably higher than those deduced experimentally by a previous study of MOSFET's with channel lengths greater than 0. 2 m. At the same time, the transconductance to current ratio is substantially lower than that of a bipolar transistor. ______________________________________ F. Assad, Z. Ren, S. Datta, and M.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedSpace power supply manufacturers {{have tried to}} increase power density and construct smaller, highly efficient power supplies by increasing switching frequency. Incorporation of a power MOSFET as a switching element alleviates switching loss. However, values of R sub DS(on) (<b>drain-to-source</b> <b>resistance</b> in the on-state) for MOSFET's are of such magnitude to produce greater on-state losses than an equivalent BJT operated in saturation. This research serves to introduce a design concept, pertinent to low-voltage relatively-high-current applications, that minimizes the peak current through the switching element {{in order to reduce}} average power loss. Basic waveforms produced by different PWM and resonant mode topologies were examined. Theoretical analysis reveals that a ramp-sine current waveform could cut conduction power loss by at least 18 % over a conventional Buck switching converter. A 14 V, 14 W combination quasi-resonant Buck/ZCS, Quasi-Resonant Buck dc-dc converter with an unregulated input voltage of 28 V was built for simplicity to demonstrate one particular waveshaping technique. This converter represents a useful example of an actual circuit which is capable of producing the desired ramp-sine switch-current waveform. Final results confirm improvement in conduction loss enhancing existing power MOSFET technology for use in dc-dc power conversion. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new non-isolated DC-DC {{converter}} with high voltage gain using a three-state switching cell and voltage multiplier stages based on capacitors. The {{value of the}} gain can be modified depending on {{the requirements of the}} application by means of the number of multiplier stages and the duty cycle. The proposed converter can be employed in renewable energy systems where commonly low input voltages (12 Vdc to 48 Vdc) are involved or in uninterrupted power supply (UPS) systems {{in order to avoid the}} necessity of a step-up transformer. One first advantage of the proposed solution is the reduced voltage stress across the active switches that is lower than half of the output voltage, what allows the use of MOSFETs with lower <b>drain-to-source</b> <b>resistance.</b> Moreover, by employing the three-state switching cell, the size of the inductor is reduced because the operating frequency of the inductor is double of the switching frequency. The current share between the active switches allows further reduction of the conduction losses. A prototype was built for an input voltage range of 30 - 45 V, 400 V output voltage and 250 W output power. The operation was evaluated and the experimental waveforms and experimental efficiency curves as a function of the output power are presented...|$|E
40|$|High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT 2 ̆ 7 s) {{have emerged}} as the device of choice for high {{frequency}} and low-noise amplifier applications. To design superior low-noise amplifier circuits at high frequencies, accurate small signal and noise model of the device must be extracted. ^ Traditionally, test-amplifiers and wafer probe measurements {{have been used to}} perform HEMT modeling. A critical study of the two techniques resulted in the design and construction of a new test fixture that attempts to combine the advantages of these two techniques. In this new fixture, a device is probed by a matched test amplifier circuit. It was found that the calibration accuracy of such a fixture was limited due to coupling between the probes and the difficulty in fabricating appropriate calibration standards. A new type of calibration standards made of micro-coaxial lines was used to calibrate the fixture. To correct for the coupling between probes, a form of a new technique called 11 -term calibration was used. ^ The effect of coupling between conventional wafer-probes on the accuracy of S-parameter measurement of a discrete HEMT was studied. A second form of the 11 -term calibration technique was used to calibrate the coupled wafer-probes. This procedure uses calibration standards that are readily available on a commercial wafer-probe calibration-substrate. ^ A critical study of HotFET/ColdFET equivalent-circuit extraction procedure revealed certain errors that can adversely affect high frequency HEMT modeling. A modified HotFET/ColdFET technique has been demonstrated, which eliminates this error, and in fact, simplifies the procedure. The new procedure uses just one forward bias measurement at low gate-current (as opposed to several high gate-current measurements required in the original procedure). ^ A low noise HEMT modeling is incomplete without extracting its noise model. The Pospieszalski noise model, which involves the determination of equivalent temperature of the <b>drain-to-source</b> <b>resistance</b> in the device circuit model, simplifies the task of noise model extraction. However, it is important to accurately measure the noise produced by the device; and to know the exact source impedance presented to the device at the time of noise measurement. These requirements make noise modeling of ultra-low-noise devices a challenging task. These issues are described in detail in the last chapter. ...|$|E
