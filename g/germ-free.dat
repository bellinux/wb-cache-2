25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be thoroughly cleaned. He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or carbolic acid as he called it. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (anti-septic, <b>germ-free)</b> techniques in surgery.|$|E

Immediately after being removed from his mother's womb, Vetter entered the plastic <b>germ-free</b> environment that would be his home {{for most of his}} life. Vetter was baptized a Roman Catholic with sterilized holy water once he had entered the bubble. Initial plans to proceed with a bone marrow transplant came to a halt after it was determined that the prospective donor, Vetter's sister, Katherine, was not a match.|$|E
25|$|The MK-4 form {{of vitamin}} K2 is {{produced}} by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls. While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in <b>germ-free</b> rats and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats. In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4. There {{is evidence that the}} conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also prenylation) to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.|$|E
500|$|Peter's devout Catholic father, Francis, visits Quahog. Upon arrival, {{he insists}} that Stewie be baptized as a Catholic. After visiting a church with Peter and Stewie, Francis is {{informed}} that the holy water is tainted and {{he will have to}} wait. Francis is in disbelief, and baptizes Stewie himself. Stewie soon becomes unwell and is informed that he must be quarantined and kept in a <b>germ-free</b> environment by a doctor for the time being until his immune system's strength recovers {{at the end of the}} episode. Then Lois discovers that Francis coaxed Peter into having Stewie baptized without her knowledge, and tells Peter to choose his own religious beliefs and not allow himself to be a slave to his father's religion. Peter initially converts to Mormonism, but then discovers that Mormons cannot drink alcohol; he then tries Jehovah's Witnesses and attempts door-to-door preaching. He finds someone who is actually interested in hearing what he has to say; however, he fails to teach them anything about the religion. As a final attempt, Peter tries Hinduism; when he tackles the Hindu leader to the floor, believing the red dot on his head to be a laser spot from a sniper rifle, he is dismissed from the meeting. Unable to find a religion suited to him, Peter decides to create his own religion, based on Happy Days, calling his newly founded church the [...] "First United Church of the Fonz".|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, W.D. Miller, {{considered}} {{the father of}} oral microbiology, {{was the first to}} associate pulpal disease with the presence of bacteria. [...] This was confirmed by Kakehashi, who, in 1965, proved that bacteria were the cause of pulpal and periradicular disease in studies using animal models; pulpal exposures were initiated in both normal and <b>germ-free</b> rats, and while no pathologic changes were exhibited in the mouths of the <b>germ-free</b> rats, introduction of the normal oral microbial flora produced pulpal necrosis and led to periradicular lesion formation in the normal rats. [...] The <b>germ-free</b> rats healed regardless of the severity of pulpal exposure, demonstrating that {{the presence or absence of}} bacteria was the determinant for pulpal and periapical disease.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after birth, the {{gastrointestinal}} tract is colonized with bacteria, which, {{on the basis}} of models with animals raised in a <b>germ-free</b> environment, have beneficial effects on function of the {{gastrointestinal tract}}. [...] There are 500-1000 different species of bacteria that reside in the bowel. [...] However, if the flora of the small bowel is altered, inflammation or altered digestion can occur, leading to symptoms. [...] Many patients with chronic diarrhea have bacterial overgrowth as a cause or a contributor to their symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Germ-free</b> {{animals are}} animals {{that have no}} {{microorganisms}} living in or on them. Such animals are raised within <b>germ-free</b> isolators {{in order to control}} their exposure to viral, bacterial or parasitic agents. [...] When known strains of bacteria or microbiota are introduced to a <b>germ-free</b> animal, it usually is referred to as a gnotobiotic animal, however technically speaking, <b>germ-free</b> animals are also gnotobiotic because the status of their microbial community is known.|$|E
50|$|<b>Germ-free</b> {{animals are}} used in the study of {{probiotic}} research and other animal research requiring careful control of outside contaminants that can affect the experiment. They also exhibit defects in the immune system. Because intestinal microorganisms provide additional energy to the animal by breaking down dietary fiber, <b>germ-free</b> animals require more food to keep the same weight than animals that are not <b>germ-free.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{gnotobiotic}} animal is an animal {{in which only}} certain known strains of bacteria and other microorganisms are present. Technically, the term also includes <b>germ-free</b> animals, as the status of their microbial communities is also known.

50|$|Commensal {{bacteria}} in the GI tract survive despite the abundance of local immune cells. Homeostasis in the intestine requires stimulation of toll-like receptors by commensal microbes. When mice are raised in <b>germ-free</b> conditions, they lack circulating antibodies, and cannot produce mucus, antimicrobial proteins, or mucosal T-cells. Additionally, mice raised in <b>germ-free</b> conditions lack tolerance and often suffer from hypersensitivity reactions. These data suggest that commensal microbes aid in intestinal homeostasis and immune system development.|$|E

5000|$|Gnotobiosis (from Greek roots gnostos [...] "known" [...] and bios [...] "life") is a {{condition}} in which all the forms of life present within an organism can be accounted for. Typically gnotobiotic organisms are <b>germ-free</b> or gnotophoric (having only one contaminant).|$|E
50|$|Histone deacetylases can be {{regulated}} by endogenous factors, dietary components, synthetic inhibitors and bacteria-derived signals. Studies in mice {{with a specific}} deletion of HDAC3 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) show a deregulated IEC's gene expression. In these deletion-mutant mice, loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in intestinal composition of commensal bacteria were observed. These negative effects were not observed in <b>germ-free</b> mice, indicating {{that the effects of}} the deletion are only seen in the presence of intestinal microbial colonization. But the negative effects of HDAC3 deletion are not due to the presence of an altered microbiota because normal <b>germ-free</b> mice colonized with the altered microbiota did not show the negative effects seen in deletion mutants.|$|E

50|$|When adult <b>germ-free</b> mice are colonized {{with the}} gut flora of obese mice, they can gain weight {{dramatically}} {{with an increased}} metabolism of monosaccharides and short-chain fatty acids.

50|$|Studies with <b>germ-free</b> mice have {{suggested}} that the absence of gut microbes protects against obesity. While the exact mechanism by which microbes play a role in obesity has yet to be elucidated, it has been hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota is involved in converting food to usable energy and fat storage.|$|E

Julius Nieuwland, C.S.C., a Notre Dame chemist and botanist, establishes 1909 The American Midland Naturalist, a Midwestern plant life quarterly that today {{is an international}} journal of ecology, evolution, and the environment. His research leads to the development in 1930 at DuPont industries of Neoprene, the first synthetic rubber. Because of his contribution, in 1952 DuPont paid in part the construction of Nieuwland Science Hall, that to this day hosts research in physics and chemistry.The Laboratories of Bacteriology at the University of Notre Dame (LOBUND) {{is established}} in 1935 after the <b>germ-free</b> research of Prof. James Reyniers.
