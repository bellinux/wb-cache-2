It {{was followed by}} two sequels, Necromaniac: Schizophreniac 2 in 2003 and The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell in 2011, the latter being a crossover with Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Michael Watkins (September 17, 1948 [...] - [...] March 6, 2007) was a film {{director}} {{best known for}} the notorious 1970s grindhouse movie Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street. He also directed several porn films. He worked with famous porn actors like Jamie Gillis and Vanessa del Rio.|$|R
50|$|The Internet Movie Database lists {{a number}} of Watkins' aliases (see the {{information}} box at right), most of which {{he seems to have}} used in Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street to conceal the fact that he worked in several technical capacities on that film - director, actor, cameraman, etc.|$|R
50|$|Aside from Broadway, she choreographed many {{industrial}} shows including Chevrolet and Westinghouse in the 1970s. While {{touring the}} 1976 production of El Grande de Coca-Cola, she met co-actor Stephen Sweet {{with whom she}} had a long-standing relationship who coincidentally was one of the co-stars in the cult classic film, Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street.|$|R
50|$|Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street (also {{known as}} The Fun House, At the Hour of Our Death, and The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell) is a 1977 American surrealist {{exploitation}} horror film written, produced, {{and directed by}} Roger Watkins, under the pseudonym Victor Janos. The plot follows a disgruntled ex-convict (also played by Watkins) who takes revenge on society by kidnapping four strangers and filming their murders in an abandoned building.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} unsuccessfully prosecuted as a video nasty in the UK {{a few years}} after its release. Some {{commentators}} have questioned its attempted banning, given that the film is fairly tame in comparison to other entries on the list, leading some to suggest it was mistakenly chosen instead of the infamous Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street, which was released under an alternative title The Fun House and oddly didn't appear on the list. It was released uncut on VHS in 1987 and later on DVD in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|Film {{scholars}} have noted Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street for its unique preoccupation and self-reflexivity regarding the aestheticization of violence. In Holy Terror: Understanding Religion and Violence in Popular Culture (2010), film scholars Gerry Carlin and Mark Jones note the film's similarities with the Manson family murders, also noting its religious undertones which are amplified by the film's choral soundtrack: [...] "Though principally a metafilmic commentary on cinematic perversity, the character's gnomic pronouncements, and the excessively ritualized evisceral [...] "sacrifices" [...] allude to a debased if fundamentally unrepresentable religiosity." ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{over two}} decades {{following}} its theatrical release, the true identities of the director and cast were unknown to the public, with the credits being made up of pseudonyms. This led to a multitude of decades-long rumors about the film, most famously that it had surfaced from underground cinema circles in New York and had featured actual footage of real murders. In his 1995 book Killing for Culture, David Kerekes stated that [...] "Any attempt to trace the names behind Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street will lead {{no further than the}} credits themselves, all obviously false." ...|$|R
50|$|Guðrøðr and the Manxmen having {{rejected}} the terms offered, battle was joined before sunrise the following day, 8 October. In the following fighting the Manxmen were routed and suffered heavy casualties. Guðrøðr was probably among the <b>dead,</b> <b>ending</b> the male <b>line</b> of the Manx Norse dynasty, although some theorize {{that he might}} have survived and fled to Wales.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} screened {{in its original}} three-hour-long version titled The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell in 1973, and purportedly caused theater riots in New York City and Chicago, the latter of which's theater was {{claimed to have been}} burned down. The following year, the film had a brief release under the title The Fun House, before being released yet again through Cinematic Releasing Corporation in 1977 under its most widely known title, Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street, a play on the Wes Craven film The Last House on the Left (1972). Both of these cuts of the film were significantly shorter, running at 78 minutes as opposed to the original 175 minutes.|$|R
50|$|During {{all this}} time, as heavy industry, {{shipbuilding}} and quay facilities were moving west, the NBR's North Clyde network {{continued to be}} accessed only from Cowlairs via Maryhill, a long way round. On 15 March 1886 the Glasgow City and District Railway opened. It was a subsurface line running east to west through the centre of Glasgow, from College in the east, through a new Low Level station at Queen Street, to Stobcross which was now on a through line instead of a <b>dead</b> <b>end.</b> The <b>line</b> proved immensely popular with passengers, and goods traffic could now be brought in by a shorter route. A short branch was opened {{on the same day}} from Partick Junction (on the original Stobcross line) to a terminus at Hyndland.|$|R
50|$|After the {{discovery}} of gold in October 1867 by James Nash in Gympie, the requirement of a railway line linked to a port became apparent. In 1877, the Queensland Government approved the construction of three railways to connect mining towns to their principal ports: Townsville to Charters Towers; Bundaberg to Mount Perry; and Maryborough to Gympie. The station buildings at Gympie and Maryborough were positioned at the terminus of the track line, marking the railway’s <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> status. The <b>line</b> opened on 6 August 1881.|$|R
500|$|Harrison {{was born}} and lived the first six {{years of his life}} at 12 Arnold Grove, Wavertree, Liverpool, a terraced <b>house</b> in a <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> street. The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire. In 1949 the family were offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green, Speke. In 1948, at the age of five, Harrison {{enrolled}} at Dovedale Primary School. He passed the eleven-plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959. Though the institute did offer a music course, Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars, and felt the school [...] "moulded [...] into being frightened".|$|R
5000|$|The film {{underwent}} many name changes, including Sex Crime of the Century (from the characters' {{dialogue in}} the car ride scene), Krug and Company (a version included on the DVD release), and The Men's Room (simply because one poster showed a men's bathroom). None of these names were particularly successful. Someone then {{came up with the}} title The Last House on the Left, along with the infamous [...] "To avoid fainting, keep repeating 'It's only a movie'..." [...] advertising campaign. (In actuality, it had been used twice before: first for gore-meister H.G. Lewis's 1964 splatter film Color Me Blood Red, and then for William Castle's Strait-Jacket the following year.) The film under the Last House... title proved to be a massive hit. Stories as to where the advertising campaign originated vary somewhat. Sean Cunningham claims that the person who gave the idea for it was watching a cut of the film with his wife, who continually covered her eyes, prompting him to tell her that it was [...] "only a movie". Other origins have been suggested, however. The tagline was so successful that many other exploitation films later used it, sometimes with their own spin. The title was sometimes imitated, {{as in the case of}} Last <b>House</b> on <b>Dead</b> <b>End</b> Street.|$|R

40|$|The correct {{design and}} {{selection}} of line supports {{is of great}} importance for successful operation and safety of transmission lines. For this purpose, various forces acting on the line supports must be estimated for normal and abnormal conditions of operation. The author develops algorithm and programme for optimal calculation of these forces, which the line supports should withstand. The main programme MDFLS and fourteen subroutines are constructed for calculation the forces acting on the line supports. The subroutines (FSUS, FDES, and FCSTA) are for determining the forces from line conductors and (FGWSU, FSWDE, FSWSA) from ground wires at suspension, <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> and strain/angle <b>line</b> supports respectively. The other eight are subsidiary subroutines. The parameters of the conductors (homogenous or non-homogenous) are found by DPMPN and DPMPH. The physical-mechanical properties of the conductor are calculated using PMPL. The specific loadings are determined by RLOLC. The sag-tension calculations are prepared by subroutines CSCT, CSOP and SEQS. Subroutine FSPCB is for calculation of forces due to broken conductor at suspension support in the section. The elaborated programmes are written in FORTRAN 90 and adopted for personal computer...|$|R

40|$|It is known, {{that the}} {{existence}} of <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> (of arbitrary depth) in the Cayley graph of a group depends on the chosen set of generators. Nevertheless there exist many groups, which do not have <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> of arbitrary depth with respect to any set of generators. Partial results in this direction were obtained by ˇ Sunić and by Warshall. We improve these results by showing that abelian groups have only finitely many <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> and that groups with more than one end (in the sense of Hopf and Freudenthal) have only <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> of bounded depth. Only few examples of groups with unbounded <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> depth are known. We show that the Houghton group H 2 with respect to the standard generating set is a further example. In addition we introduce a stronger notion of depth of a <b>dead</b> <b>end,</b> called strong depth. The Houghton group H 2 has unbounded strong depth with respect to the same standard generating set...|$|R
