[...] / [...] "I had an old Zaporozhets car, and I installed my war trophy Messerschmitt jet engine in it. While driving on a highway, I saw a Ferrari ahead and tried to overtake it. My speed was too high, I lost control, and crashed into a tree... And {{how did you get}} here?" [...] / [...] "I was driving my Ferrari when I saw a Zaporozhets overtaking me. I thought that my car might have broken down again, and had coasted to a stop. So <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and stepped out..." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to Catriona {{and stopped}} {{her on the}} threshold.|$|E
60|$|My mother spoke {{over the}} banisters, and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and let in McPherson.|$|E
6000|$|... "'The boy 'ad got it,' he ses. 'Now shall <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and {{let your}} missis in, or would you rather {{stay where you are}} in peace and quietness?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Easy," [...] commented Billy, relieved. [...] "Get {{ready to}} beat it when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> got a pony south o' town that'll {{have to carry}} double for a little way tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless my soul!' thought Tom at last. 'Perhaps {{he lives}} here, and is calling to me. I {{never thought of}} that. Can <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> from <b>the</b> outside, I wonder. Yes, to be sure I can.' ...|$|R
60|$|WHEN I {{arrived at}} my rooms, my {{colleague}} hurried {{to meet me}} the moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{must try}} also. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Pouf! It shut with a bang. We all exclaimed with joy.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, and I {{led the way}} upstairs. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and closed}} it again softly, leaving them alone....|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hah! I am of a fair size, {{but could}} not have the honour of {{presenting}} myself in that room without a ladder. Now, madam, frankly--frankness {{is a part of}} my character--shall <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Depend upon me," [...] Arsenio {{answered}} him. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of your tower I shall whistle to you. The key of the postern {{hangs on}} the guardroom wall. I shall possess myself of that before I come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "we won't {{have any}} of this. If she comes in she must see you--and think if she likes there's {{something}} wrong! But how can <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to her, when she dislikes me--wishes to see not me, but her son? <b>I</b> won't <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door!" ...|$|R
60|$|Kate {{was alone}} when I entered. She looked up quickly as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and turned away}} {{disappointed}} when she recognized me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardieu!" [...] quoth I, as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> [...] "it seems, Lieutenant, that I {{must have}} fallen asleep over those musty documents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} no second opportunity, Miss Gracedieu, of {{insulting}} me." [...] With that foolish reply, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> violently and went out.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> flung <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in a fury--and confronted Oscar on the threshold.|$|R
50|$|Two goats bleating objectionsto my {{car in the}} yard,flee from meas <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed and}} shook her head as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> chart-house <b>door</b> for her to pass.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} the boarder was yelling and {{pounding}} at the door. When Euphemia was ready <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and took her out.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for him, and, {{taking up}} his brick again, he entered, and I {{followed}} him in. There was a deal of talk.|$|E
60|$|Grieved that I had unintentionally roused her fear, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and called}} Dumps. My doggie rose, with his three {{indicators}} erect and expectant.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But s'pose,' said Joey, after a glassy look at {{his future}} {{appearance}} in the position alluded to, 'that any of your gentle-people come to see ye, and when <b>I</b> <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and lets 'em in a swinging big lodger stalks downstairs. What will 'em think? Up will go their eye-glasses at one another till they glares each other into holes. My gracious!' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and as Ganymede obediently {{slipped past}} me and {{vanished}} down the passage [...] "Monsieur l'Hote," [...] I called. [...] "Ho, there, Gilles!" ...|$|E
60|$|The hostess was all ears, {{struck by}} the respectful manner in which this very evidently noble lady {{addressed}} a Fool. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for her.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and a {{storm of}} sleet and spray stung our faces. Old Pegg, who had been there to sell and collect tickets, shouted to us.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be sure," [...] {{the knight}} replied, [...] "that {{it was just}} because I foresaw {{that you might be}} useful that <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of your cell that night. It is always handy in times like these to be able to lay one's hand on a man whom you can hang if you choose to open your mouth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man!" [...] sternly replied Ethan Brand, [...] "what need have I of the Devil? I {{have left}} him behind me, on my track. It is with such half-way sinners as {{you that he}} busies himself. Fear not, because <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> do but act by old custom, and am going to trim your fire, like a lime-burner, as I was once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor fellow!" [...] said Rollo; [...] "if I had you {{and your}} cage in Africa, where you belong, <b>I</b> would <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and let you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{with all}} the blood in my body {{seemingly}} surging into my head, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and on the instant heard Hiram say in an exceedingly friendly tone: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} writing. The {{air of the}} room was thick with {{cigarette}} smoke. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gently, and Lady Dennisford glided past me. I myself hastened downstairs.|$|E
60|$|I {{had not yet}} sat down, and I {{went first}} to see who it was. When <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> Madame Fosco confronted me with my {{handkerchief}} in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was hardly}} able to reply. 'Not just now,' he said, confusedly. 'Forgive me if <b>I</b> don't <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> {{will speak to}} you a little later.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't mind {{letting you}} out," [...] said the Gardener. [...] "But <b>I</b> mustn't <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for children. D'you think I'd disobey the Rules? Not for one-and-sixpence!" ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>I</b> pushed <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and entered}} <b>the</b> hall, I found myself {{suddenly}} {{face to face}} with the Count again. He was just putting a letter into the post-bag.|$|R
