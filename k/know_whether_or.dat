5|$|In 1851, the Oatman {{family was}} ambushed {{by a group}} of Ɖo:lkabaya Yavapai (though many historians argue that it is {{impossible}} to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not these were Yavapai, or some other tribe). Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves as slaves. The story was widely published, and increased White settlers' fears of attack in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though many}} studies have been {{undertaken}} in this area, neither position has yet claimed a consensus view in the academic literature. Recent {{studies have demonstrated that}} direct rebound effects are significant (about 30% for energy), but that there is not enough information about indirect effects to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> how often back-fire occurs. Economists tend to the first position, but most governments, businesses, and environmental groups adhere to the second. Governments and environmental groups often advocate further research into fuel efficiency and radical increases in the efficient use of energy as the primary means for reducing energy use and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (to alleviate the impacts of climate change). However, if the first position more accurately reflects economic reality, current efforts to invent fuel-efficient technologies may not much reduce energy use, and may in fact paradoxically increase oil and coal consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions, over the long run.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the petroglyphs mentioned above, {{there are a few}} other very short uncatalogued texts that may be rongorongo. Fischer reports that [...] "many statuettes reveal rongorongo or rongorongo-like glyphs on their crown." [...] He gives the example of a compound glyph, , on the crown of a mo‘ai pakapaka statuette. Many human skulls are inscribed with the single 'fish' glyph 700 , which may stand for îka [...] "war casualty". There are other designs, including some tattoos recorded by early visitors, which are possibly single rongorongo glyphs, but since they are isolated and pictographic, it is difficult to <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not they are actually writing.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the legends}} {{that have grown}} up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least not for any reason {{connected}} with independence), as no public announcement {{was made of the}} Declaration of Independence. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, [...] "We do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence." ...|$|E

While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts {{ascending}} into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says [...] "Where do you think you're going, missy?" [...] The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite joke of the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending [...] "drives them [...] crazy", since they do not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homer's line [...] "Oh, I smell barbeque!" [...] was included in Bobby Bryant of The States list [...] "20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson".

500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Macfadyen enjoyed {{working in}} the series, {{he began to feel}} [...] "very {{sluggish}} and fed up" [...] with playing the same character for two years. When the producers knew Macfadyen planned to leave, they did not <b>know</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he would appear {{in the beginning of the}} third series. Howard Brenton, who wrote the series two finale, originally killed Tom off by drowning him while trying to escape onto the North Sea, while labouring under the impression that he was not to return. The producers would have continued the third series without Tom, however when they heard the actor would be prepared to return for the first two episodes of the third series, they were rewritten to include his character Tom. Brenton had to [...] "unkill him." [...] After a seven-year absence, in October 2011, it was announced that Macfadyen was to make a [...] "fleeting" [...] cameo appearance in the final episode of the series.
