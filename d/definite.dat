40|$|A unitary {{approach}} to the interpretation of <b>definites</b> * RICHARD BREHENY This paper proposes a unitary {{approach to}} the interpretation of <b>definites</b> which accounts {{for the fact that}} all forms of such expressions can get weak and strong readings in all types of constructions. The analysis proposed is an underdetermination account, where the universal force of <b>definites</b> is understood not to be determined by the grammar, but is routinely inferred at the pragmatic level. The analysis assumes that the basic mechanism for interpreting <b>definites</b> is the same as that for indefinites, but that the behaviour of <b>definites</b> is to be explained by reference to certain non-truth-conditional properties of <b>definites</b> in combination with pragmatic principles. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer {{a study on}} the {{interpretation}} of plural <b>definites</b> in discourse (‘the tank engines’) and their interaction with spatial adpositions (‘to’ and ‘at’). The novel empirical findings in the paper support the following assumptions on the contribu-tion of spatial adpositions to the interpretation of plural <b>definites.</b> First, the interpre-tation of plural <b>definites</b> can be influenced by the lexical aspect type of adpositions. While ‘to’ as ‘telic’ predicate can license both a ‘collective’ and a ‘distributive’ reading for plural <b>definites,</b> ‘at’ as an ‘atelic’ predicate only licenses a ‘collective’ reading. Second, the precise lexical content of adpositions determines which interpretation is accessed. It is claimed that ‘at’ denotes a ‘general location’ relation between locatum and landmark object, and thus licenses a collective reading for plural <b>definites...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how the lexical nature of weak <b>definites</b> influences {{the phenomenon of}} direct object scrambling in Dutch. Earlier experiments have indicated that weak <b>definites</b> are more resistant to scrambling than strong <b>definites.</b> We examine how the notion of weak definiteness used in this experimental work {{can be reduced to}} lexical connectedness. We explore four different ways of quantifying the relation between a direct object and the verb. Our results show that predictability of a verb given the object (verb cloze probability) provides the best fit to the weak/strong distinction used in the earlier experiment...|$|R
5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks a <b>definite</b> noun and a or an an {{indefinite}} one. A <b>definite</b> noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the syntactic properties of weak <b>definites</b> and bare singulars in locative PP constructions. The realization of these weakly referential phrases (i. e. nominal phrases {{that do not}} seem to set up individual discourse referents) is studied in nine European languages. The goal of this study is twofold. First of all, this thesis is aimed at achieving a descriptive overview of the realization of weakly referential phrases. Regarding the realization of these phrases, the empirical facts show that languages do not behave differently in a systematic way {{on the basis of their}} geographical location. The second goal of this thesis is to provide a syntactic analysis for weak <b>definites</b> and bare singulars. The syntactic structure of weakly referential phrases is studied using syntactic elements that exist in the nominal domain (diminutives, adjectives, plural morphology). The thesis dicusses their effects on the grammaticality and interpretation of weak <b>definites</b> and bare singulars. The general pattern across languages is that bare singulars do not allow adjectival modification and diminutives. In some cases bare singulars can bear plural morphology, but in those cases the bare nouns lose their weak reading. Weak <b>definites</b> generally allow diminutives, adjectives and plural morphology, but these elements cause the weak <b>definites</b> to lose their weak reading. Following Longobardi (2004), most of these facts can be accounted for in terms of N-to-D movement and expletive articles...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{conditions}} under which singular <b>definites,</b> on the one hand, and universally quantified DPs, on the other hand, receive interpretations according to which the sets denoted by the NP-complements of the respective determiner vary with the situations quantified over by a Q-adverb. I show that in both cases such interpretations depend on the availability of situation predicates that are compatible with the presuppositions associated with the respective determiner, as co-variation in both cases comes about via the binding of a covert situation variable that is contained within the NP-complement of the respective determiner. Secondly, I offer an account for the observation that the availability of a co-varying interpretation is more constrained in the case of universally quantified DPs than in the case of singular <b>definites,</b> as far as word order is concerned. This is shown to follow from the fact that co-varying <b>definites</b> in contrast to universally quantified DPs are inherently focus-marked...|$|R

40|$|Partitive {{contexts}} {{are those}} in which a set of similar individuals has been introduced, and the speaker needs to refer to one of them. If that referent {{has not yet been}} individualized in the context, the only adult-like option is to refer to it with an indefinite. But in such contexts, children have been shown to often produce (illicit) <b>definites.</b> In comprehension, if children are made to identify a referent in a partitive context, they do not always interpret correctly the definiteness clues in the input, and tend to interpret <b>definites</b> as if they were indefinite. This article reviews production and comprehension studies in light of new experimental data, and argues that children’s errors in this type of context are due to processing limitations...|$|R

40|$|Catalan {{is usually}} {{described}} as a language without prepositional accusative, with the only exception of some pronouns. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present some data showing that in most spoken varieties prepositional accusatives are indeed licensed in a specific construction, namely when appearing as topics in Clitic-Dislocation. Interestingly enough, the preposition is systematically excluded with rhematic, nontopical, objects. Dialects differ with respect to the conditions governing the use of the preposition with topics: whereas in written Catalan the preposition appears with pronouns only, spoken Central Catalan extends its use to proper names and human <b>definites</b> as well, and Ibizan shows the wider extension of the phenomenon, with prepositional marking for almost all kinds of topics (pronouns, proper names, human and non-human <b>definites,</b> and even inanimate indefinites). This shows that for Catalan the crucial factor for the occurrence of prepositional accusatives is topicality –not definiteness or animacy, as in Spanish...|$|R

5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the <b>definite</b> suffix -en and the <b>definite</b> article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that extraposition from DP is derived {{differently}} according to whether a complement or an adjunct is extraposed, with complement extraposition being derived by movement and adjunct extraposition being derived via covert QR of the host DP plus Late Merge of the adjunct (Fox & Nissenbaum 1999). We argue that adjunct extraposition is itself derivationally ambiguous, and may be derived either by movement of the adjunct or by base-generation of the adjunct in extraposed position. Accordingly, we argue for a relaxation of the strictly compositional view that nominal modification is always mediated by syntactic sisterhood. We argue that while base-generated extraposition is possible with quantificational host DPs, adjunct extraposition from <b>definites</b> must be derived by movement. This accounts for a number of asymmetries between extraposition from <b>definites</b> and from other types of DP, concerning reconstruction for Condition C, scope reconstruction, and information-structural restrictions on extraposition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{proposes a}} novel {{solution}} to the problem of exceptional scope (ES) of (in) <b>definites,</b> exemplified by the widest and intermediate scope readings of the sentence Every student of mine read every poem that a famous Romanian poet wrote. We propose that the ES readings have two sources: (i) discourse anaphora to particular sets of entities and quantificational dependencies between these entities that restrict the domain of quantification of the two universal determiners and the indefinite article; (ii) non-local accommodation of the discourse referent that restricts the quantificational domain of the indefinite article. Our account, formulated within a compositional dynamic system couched in classical type logic, relies on two independently motivated assumptions: (a) the discourse context stores not only (sets of) individuals, but also quantificational dependencies between them, and (b) quantifier domains are always contextually restricted. Under this analysis, (in) <b>definites</b> are unambiguous and there is no need for special choice-functional variable...|$|R
