5000|$|Stream mode: Data is sent as a {{continuous}} stream, relieving FTP from doing any processing. Rather, all processing is left up to TCP. No <b>End-of-file</b> <b>indicator</b> is needed, unless the data is divided into records.|$|E
5000|$|Input from a {{terminal}} never really [...] "ends" [...] (unless {{the device is}} disconnected), but {{it is useful to}} enter more than one [...] "file" [...] into {{a terminal}}, so a key sequence is reserved to indicate end of input. In UNIX the translation of the keystroke to EOF is performed by the terminal driver, so a program does not need to distinguish terminals from other input files. By default, the driver converts a Control-D character {{at the start of a}} line into an <b>end-of-file</b> <b>indicator.</b> To insert an actual Control-D (ASCII 04) character into the input stream, the user precedes it with a [...] "quote" [...] command character (usually Control-V). AmigaDOS is similar but uses Control-\ instead of Control-D.|$|E
