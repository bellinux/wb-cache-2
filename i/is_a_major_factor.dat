5|$|Of course, {{the angle}} of the terrain can {{influence}} all of the calculations above. All else remaining equal, the risk of pitching over the front end is reduced when riding up hill and increased when riding down hill. The possibility of performing a wheelie increases when riding up hill, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in motorcycle hillclimbing competitions.|$|E
5|$|The El Niño–Southern Oscillation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in the {{variation}} of annual precipitation within Buenos Aires and the Pampas, particularly during spring and summer. During an El Niño year, precipitation is higher, {{with a significant}} increase in precipitation from November to January. In contrast, La Niña years are associated with lower precipitation; precipitation is below average during October–December.|$|E

5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E

25|$|The way {{contact lenses}} {{interact}} with the natural tear layer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People suffering from dry eyes are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief blurry vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} passage of the Endangered Species Act, the United States ban on DDT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in the {{comeback}} of the bald eagle (the national bird of the United States) and the peregrine falcon from near-extinction in the contiguous United States.|$|E
25|$|Improper sharps {{management}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> {{involved in}} what is categorized as unsafe injections. Annually these account for 21 million, 2 million, and 260,000 of new HBV, HCV, and HIV infections annually. 40-65% of new HBV and HCV are due to percutaneous occupational exposure.|$|E

25|$|Test, in this sense, {{can refer}} to any medical test (but usually {{in the sense of}} {{diagnostic}} tests), and in a broad sense also including questions and even assumptions (such as assuming that the target individual is a female or male). The ability to make a difference between pre- and post-test probabilities of various conditions <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in the indication of medical tests.|$|E
25|$|Most {{residence}} halls {{are much}} closer to campus than comparable private housing such as apartment buildings. This convenience <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> {{in the choice of}} where to live since living physically closer to classrooms is often preferred, particularly for first-year students who may not be permitted to park vehicles on campus. Universities may therefore provide priority to first-year students when allocating this accommodation.|$|E
25|$|A gaping North–South divide <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> of {{socio-economic}} weakness. It can {{be noted}} by the huge difference in statistical income between {{the northern and southern}} regions and municipalities. The richest department,Alto Adige-South Tyrol, earns 152% of the national GDP per capita, while the poorest region, Calabria, 61%. The unemployment rate (11.1%) stands slightly above the Eurozone average, but the disaggregated figure is 6.6% in the North and 19.2% in the South.|$|E

25|$|Two {{species of}} Banksia are found on Mount Henry Peninsula, B.attenuata (candlestick banksia) and B.menziesii (firewood banksia). B.attenuata flowers from spring into {{summer and the}} B.menziesii {{flowering}} occurs in autumn and winter, the presence of both these species on Mount Henry Peninsula means that {{at any time during}} an annual period, {{at least one of the}} species of Banksia will be in flower, This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in the support of Mount Henry Peninsula's bird population.|$|E
25|$|The {{adequacy}} of surgical resection <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> {{in determining the}} role of postoperative adjuvant therapy. In {{the presence of a}} positive margin on pathological examination, most radiation oncologists recommend radiation to the primary site, and concurrent chemotherapy. A negative margin {{is more likely to be}} treted with lower doses and a smaller treatment volume. Also the removal of a bulky tumour may allow reduced dosage to adjacent uninvolved pharyngeal structures and hence less effect on normal swallowing.|$|E
25|$|Budding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> {{underlying}} the invasiveness of pharaoh ants. A single seed colony can populate a large office block, {{almost to the}} exclusion of all other insect pests, in less than six months. Elimination and control are difficult because multiple colonies can consolidate into smaller colonies during extermination programs only to repopulate later. Pharaoh ants are a major hazard in hospitals, where their small size means they can access wounds and medical instruments, causing the spread of infection and electrical interference.|$|E

As of 2016, the airport ships more than 126 million pounds of cargo annually with growth of nearly 166% in cargo tonnage shipped between 2015 and 2016 alone. Companies such as Amazon.com and FedEx Ground are increasingly using the airport for these purposes which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in its growth.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{the public}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> for the {{effective}} prevention of eutrophication. In order for a policy to have any effect, the public {{must be aware of}} their contribution to the problem, and ways in which they can reduce their effects. Programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes, as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies.|$|E
25|$|It {{is aimed}} to resolve points of difference, to gain {{advantage}} {{for an individual}} or collective, or to craft outcomes to satisfy various interests. It is often conducted by putting forward a position and making small concessions to achieve an agreement. The {{degree to which the}} negotiating parties trust each other to implement the negotiated solution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in determining whether negotiations are successful. In many cases, negotiation is not a zero-sum game, allowing for cooperation to improve the results of the negotiation.|$|E
