5|$|The {{performance}} of a solar park {{is a function of}} the climatic conditions, the equipment used and the system configuration. The primary <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays, and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) {{as can be seen}} in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge tube as a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E
5|$|Solar {{heating systems}} are a well known second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E
25|$|Life cycle energy {{analysis}} (LCEA) is an approach {{in which all}} <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> to a product are accounted for, not only direct <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> during manufacture, but also all <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> needed to produce components, materials and services needed for the manufacturing process. An earlier term for the approach was {{energy analysis}}.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, we {{can apply}} the panel data {{stochastic}} production frontier approach {{to estimate the}} TFEE. Moreover, if we use disaggregated <b>energy</b> <b>inputs,</b> we can change the logged inverse <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> on the left-hand side of Eq. (5) and keep the other logged inputs {{on the right-hand side}} fixed, thereby obtaining the TFEE scores for different <b>energy</b> <b>inputs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides <b>energy</b> <b>input.</b> Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of <b>energy</b> <b>input,</b> the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E

40|$|Mechanized {{agriculture}} uses {{energy for}} machinery, fertilizers, pestcides, electricity, and other management tools. Especially, after World War II, fossil fuel inputs on agriculture have increased rapidly in Japan. The increase of fossil fuel inputs causes {{not only the}} exhaustion of raw materials but the ecological diseconomy as to cultivated land. From this point of view, it is needed either to estimate the quantity of <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> or to analyze it in Japanese agriculture. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to estimate <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> requirement for factors of production in agriculture as the first step. The results (table 15) have not been done perfectly because of limitations of data. However, it gives the basic data for analysis of <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> on agricultural production.

5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E

Also the Marginal Physical Product (MPP) method was {{used to analyze the}} sensitivity of <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> on mandarin yield and returns to scale of econometric model was calculated. For this purpose, the data were collected from 110 mandarin orchards which were selected based on random sampling method. The results indicated that total <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> were 77501. 17 MJ/ha. The energy use efficiency, energy productivity and net energy of mandarin production were found as 0. 77, 0. 41 kg/MJ and - 17651. 17 MJ/ha. About 41 % of the total <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> used in mandarin production was indirect while about 59 % was direct. Econometric estimation results revealed that the impact of human labor energy (0. 37) was found the highest among the other inputs in mandarin production. The results also showed that direct, indirect and renewable and non-renewable, energy forms had a positive and statistically significant impact on output level. The results of sensitivity analysis of the <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> showed that with an additional use of 1 MJ of each of the human labor, farmyard manure and chemical fertilizers energy would lead to an increase in yield by 2. 05, 1. 80 and 1. 26 kg, respectively.

40|$|Food {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the most polluting everyday activities when impacts during product life cycles are considered. Greenhouse gas emissions from the food sector are substantial and need to be lowered to stabilise climate change. Here, we present an inventory of life cycle <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> for 150 food items available in Sweden and discuss how energy efficient meals and diets can be composed. <b>Energy</b> <b>inputs</b> in food life cycles vary from 2 to 220 MJ per kg due to a multitude of factors related to animal or vegetable origin, degree of processing, choice of processing and preparation technology and transportation distance. Daily total life cycle <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> for diets with a similar dietary energy consumed by one person can vary by a factor of four, from 13 to 51 MJ. Current Swedish food consumption patterns result in life cycle <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> ranging from 6900 to 21, 000 MJ per person and year. Choice of ingredients and gender differences in food consumption patterns explain the differences. Up to a third of the total <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> is related to snacks, sweets and drinks, items with little nutritional value.

40|$|Within highly {{mechanised}} agricultural productions {{systems such}} as the Australian cotton industry, operational <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> represent a major cost to the growers. In this paper, a framework to assess the operational <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> of various production systems and the relative performance of a grower within an adopted system is developed. It divides energy usage of cotton production into six broadly distinct processes, including fallow, planting, in-crop, irrigation, harvesting and post harvest. This enables both the total <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> and the <b>energy</b> usage of each production processes to be assessed. This framework is later implemented and incorporated into an online energy assessment tool (EnergyCalc). Using the developed software, seven farm audits are conducted.
