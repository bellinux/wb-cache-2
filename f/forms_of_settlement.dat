Yet neither can we conclude that they are merely subjective. Is space, over which wars erupt, merely imaginary? And is time, which tears us along and tears us away, merely subjective? Such metaphysical interpretations of space and time will be of no help in understanding the locality and journeying at the heart of Hölderlin's non-metaphysical poetising.

Because of migration Silesia's population density, the <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> and the population changed dramatically. Large, well-planned villages became the norm. A network of almost 130 towns covered the country almost evenly, with a distance from town to town of approximately 18 km [...] The Weichbild constitution replaced the old Slavic castellany constitution. Every village built its own church (at {{the end of the}} 13th century numbering 1,200) the network of parishes also became much more dense, and the diocese was split into the archdeaconries of Breslau, Glogau, Opole and Liegnitz. There are different estimates of the population of Silesia in the 14th century. They vary from approximately 500,000 people, to over 1,000,000 in 1400 and 1,200,000 in 1500. It is estimated that in the year 1400 some 30,000 Czechs and 30,000 Germans inhabited Upper Silesia along with a Polish population of 240,000 (80%). In Lower Silesia the number of Poles and Germans has been estimated as around 375,000 for each language group. After the era of German colonization, the Polish language was still predominant in Upper Silesia and parts of Lower and Middle Silesia north of the Oder river. Here, the Germans who arrived during the Middle Ages were mostly Polonized; the Germans dominated large cities and Poles lived mostly in rural areas. The Polish speaking territories of Lower and Middle Silesia, commonly described {{until the end of the}} 19th century as the Polish side were mostly Germanized in the 18th and 19th centuries, except for some areas along the northeastern frontier.|$|E

The idea of the contribution was to research and analyze Jewish <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> – Jewish Streets in medieval towns, Ghettos, the “Shtetl” in Eastern Europe, the Jewish Quarters of big cities, the new settlements in Israel – as representations of different identity constructions which differ {{in time and space}} and which are informed by various religious, political and economical factors. Any given form of settlement reflects a Jewish community’s feeling and practice of “longing and belonging”, it also reflects the tension between a diasporic existence and the traditional – but changing – relationship to the land of Israel. Even medieval ghettoes were not completely isolated, patterns of cultural contact and cultural conflict {{have an impact on the}} outer form of a “Jewish Street”, the place of a synagogue or a cemetery – in relation to the built world (and the laws) of the non-Jewish neighbourhood.

40|$|Why is the {{countryside}} {{in some parts}} of England and Continental Europe dominated by large villages, while in many regions looser groupings of houses in hamlets, or isolated farms, provide the main <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement?</b> The answer lies in the period c. 850 - 1200, when the settlement pattern which still survives was created. This volume sets out to provide explanations of the process behind that great formative movement in the fabric of our culture. Using a combination of archaeological and documentary evidence, the authors show that there is no single, easy reason for the development of villages and hamlets, but that they grew out of a complex combination of social, agricultural and political influences. The text explores the origins and developments of villages, hamlets and farms in the Middle Ages, using the landscape of four East Midland counties as a focus. It provides a basis for understanding early settlement...|$|E
40|$|Inter-professional {{conflict}} over insolvency work in Victorian England and Wales is often considered a formative instance of jurisdictional competition between accountants and lawyers. The paper explores this {{episode in the}} context of Abbott's theory of The System of Professions. It is shown that the Bankruptcy Act, 1869 disturbed inter-professional relations and unleashed competition between accountants and lawyers for insolvency work. However, the resultant hostility was substantially conducted through the professional media and did not engage unified occupational communities. In everyday practice accountants and lawyers maintained relations of mutual dependency rather than conflict. Some elements of a jurisdictional settlement between accountants and lawyers over bankruptcy work was achieved during the 1870 s and 1880 s through an intellectual division of labour, judicial decision making and organisational change. However, these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> seldom proved conclusive and statutory changes effectively perpetuated inter-professional competition for insolvency work into the 20 th century...|$|E
