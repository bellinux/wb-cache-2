40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a <b>built-in</b> <b>filter</b> method to enhance the {{isolation}} level between closely packed MIMO antennas. The <b>built-in</b> <b>filter</b> is composed of several slits etched on the ground of the antenna structure. The number and length of slits depend on both the resonance frequency {{and the structure of}} the MIMO antenna system. To illustrate its usefulness, two designs of compact planar four-port MIMO antenna systems <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>filters</b> are proposed. One MIMO system is composed of different types of antennas with similar radiation characteristics, such as polarization. The lateral size of the whole system is 0. 64 λ× 0. 48 λ. To further reduce the size of the MIMO structure, polarization diversity is utilized in the second example. The dimension is only 0. 4 λ× 0. 4 λ. In both cases, <b>with</b> the <b>built-in</b> <b>filters,</b> the isolation level can be improved by 10 dB. In both MIMO systems, the measured port isolations between antennas are below − 25 dB, and the envelope correlations are smaller than 0. 04, indicating good MIMO performance...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a clustering-based approach {{to decrease the}} computational cost of data association in multi-target tracking. This is achieved by clustering the sensor tracks using approximate distance functions, thereby decreasing the number of possible associations {{and the need to}} calculate expensive statistical distances between tracks. The studied tracking problem includes passive and active sensors <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> <b>filters.</b> Statistical and non-statistical distance functions were designed to account for the characteristics of the different combinations of sensors. The computational cost and accuracy of these distance functions were evaluated and compared. Analysis is done in a simulated environment with randomly positioned targets and sensors. Simulations show that there are approximate distances with a cost of calculation ten times cheaper than the true statistical distance, with only minor drops in accuracy. Spectral clustering is used on these distances to divide complex association problems into sub-problems. This algorithm is evaluated on a large number of random scenarios. The mean size of the largest sub-problem is 40 % of the original, and the mean number of errors in the clustering is 5 %...|$|R

40|$|Biomolecular logic systems {{processing}} biochemical input {{signals and}} producing "digital" outputs {{in the form}} of YES/NO were developed for analysis of physiological conditions characteristic of liver injury, soft tissue injury and abdominal trauma. Injury biomarkers were used as input signals for activating the logic systems. Their normal physiological concentrations were defined as logic- 0 level, while their pathologically elevated concentrations were defined as logic- 1 values. Since the input concentrations applied as logic 0 and 1 values were not sufficiently different, the output signals being at low and high values (0, 1 outputs) were separated with a short gap making their discrimination difficult. Coupled enzymatic reactions functioning as a biomolecular signal processing system <b>with</b> a <b>built-in</b> <b>filter</b> property were developed.

40|$|An accelerometer, {{mounted to}} a {{structure}} near an explosion to measure elasto-plastic deformation, can be excited at its resonant frequency by impulsive stresses transmitted within the structure. This results in spurious high peak acceleration levels {{that can be}} much higher than acceleration levels from the explosion itself. The spurious signals also have higher frequencies than the underlying signal from the explosion and can be removed by a low pass filter. This report assesses the performance of four accelerometer and filter assemblies. The assessment involves measurements of the response of a mild steel cylinder to an underwater explosion, in which each assembly is mounted onto the interior surface of the cylinder. Three assemblies utilise a piezoresistive accelerometer in which isolation is provided mechanically.

40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of an extended package of preventive measures on the incidence of nosocomial respiratory infections in surgical patients at an intensive care unit (ICU). Subjects and methods. The study included 809 patients aged 35 to 80 years. A study group comprised 494 patients in whom an extended package of preventive measures was implemented during 7 months (March-September). A control group consisted of 315 patients treated in 2004 {{in the same period}} of time (March-September). The groups were stratified by age, gender, underlying diseases, and APACHE- 2 and SOFA scores. The extended package of anti-infectious measures involved a high air purification in ICUs («Flow-M» technology), routine use of ventilatory filters, closed aspiration systems <b>with</b> a <b>built-in</b> antibacterial <b>filter</b> under artificial ventilation for over 2 days. Results. The proposed technologies could reduce the frequency of tracheobronchitis and ventilator-associated pneumonias in the groups of patients at high risk for nosocomial infections substantially (by more than twice).

Of special note is the proper prevention of upper airway contamination with pathogenic microorganisms, by employing the closed aspiration systems <b>with</b> a <b>built-in</b> antibacterial <b>filter.</b> The routine use of high-tech consumables in the intensive care of surgical patients causes a considerable decrease in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and purulent tracheobronchitis and a reduction in the number of microbiological studies.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the continuation of}} the research work started in 2004. The previous results have been published both in ASPRS and ISPRS conferences. Now we intend to emphasize the latest developments and extended application areas of the system. Due to the increasing demand of the transportation authorities for rapid, accurate data acquisition about the road pavement, a mobile mapping system has been developed primarily for road surface detection. Our system involves a data archiving and system control unit (notebook), an imaging unit (two industrial cameras), a positioning unit (combined GPS/IMU system <b>with</b> <b>built-in</b> Kalman <b>filtering),</b> a marker unit (point-projection by laser diode array) and the mobile platform (pickup with special carrier frame and specified power supply). The first reported results were about creating the digital road surface model and detecting the cracks on the pavement. The system is now in test-phase at the road maintenance company of Budapest city (Municipal Public Service); during the practical tests several new demands have been raised. For the complex transportation management (scheduling road construction works, reconstruction etc.) the roads have to be classified into coarse categories. Therefore the resulted digital surface model has to be transformed into basic numeric form. Internationally, the so-called IRI (International Roughness Index) is used to represent the road condition. Besides the digital surface model of the road pavement, the INS measurements can be used without the images to derive data that indicate the pavement condition. Our experiments showed that vertical acceleration and the roll/pitch values are strongly correlated with the road roughness and waviness. Based on the single INS measurements, the roads can be classified into categories, our tests and initial results are also discussed in the paper. 1...|$|R

40|$|A single-port uniplanar antenna <b>with</b> a <b>built-in</b> tunable <b>filter</b> is {{presented}} for operation in multiple LTE bands for cognitive femtocell applications. The antenna {{is based on}} a monopole microstrip patch fed by coplanar waveguide. The frequency reconfigurability is achieved by using two PIN diodes to couple or decouple a ring slot resonator filter from the antenna feed line. By switching the PIN diodes, the proposed design can operate in either wideband or narrowband modes. When the antenna operates in the narrowband state, two varactor diodes are used to continuously tune the narrowband frequency from 2. 55 to 3. 2 [*]GHz, while the wideband state is obtained over the 1. 35 – 6. 2 [*]GHz band. The diodes and their biasing networks have nearly no severe effect on the antenna characteristics. Prototypes of the proposed structure using ideal and real switches, with and without varactors, are fabricated and tested. Measured and simulated results are in good agreement, thus verifying the good performance of the proposed design. The obtained results show that the proposed antenna is very suitable for cognitive radio applications, in which the wideband mode is used for spectrum sensing and the narrowband mode for transmission at different frequency bands...|$|R
