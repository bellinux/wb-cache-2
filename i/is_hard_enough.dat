5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>enough</b> for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaf fall}} season causes the most {{disruption}} to rail operations. In heavily deciduous forested areas like the American Mid-Atlantic states, New England, {{many parts of}} Europe including the UK, and Southern Ontario, Canada [...] the problem can arise. [...] Where the leaves fall onto a railway route, some collect on the [...] and are then heavily compressed by trains into a slippery low-friction coating on the rail and on the wheel treads. [...] If the climate is damp, the wet leaves adhere to the rail very effectively. [...] The draft caused by {{the passage of the}} train causes nearby leaves to be caught up in air currents, and more leaves are deposited on the railhead. The build up of this material is incremental, and it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>enough</b> not to be quickly worn away by the ordinary passage of trains.|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat later, in 1862, the {{residents}} of Placer County (Auburn, Foresthill) came upon a scheme to build a road from the Foresthill divide to Squaw Valley {{with the intent of}} luring immigrant trains away from Nevada City and into Placerville and neighboring vicinities. George Wharton James, the author, described the road as an ill-fated enterprise: [...] "The grade is frightful. For an hour or more, we go slowly up it stopping every few yards or so to give our horses breath," [...] James wrote of a ride on the old road a half century after it was built. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>enough</b> for horses to go up this grade but to pull heavily-ladened (sic) wagons - it seems impossible, [...] " [...] he concluded. Later attempts to improve this road or forge other wagon roads not successful.|$|E

6000|$|But Clyffurde {{interrupted}} him roughly: [...] "I pray you, Sir, make {{no comment on}} mine actions. My own silent comments on these <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>enough</b> to bear: your eulogies would raise bounds to my patience." ...|$|R
