5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an <b>equatorial</b> sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is {{parallel}} to the Earth's <b>equatorial</b> plane. Two primary examples of modified <b>equatorial</b> sundials are bowstring <b>equatorial</b> and armillary dials. Both of these modified <b>equatorial</b> sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the <b>equatorial</b> plane whereas a standard <b>equatorial</b> sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the <b>equatorial</b> plane.|$|E
5|$|An {{extreme example}} of an <b>equatorial</b> bulge is found on the star Regulus A (α Leonis A). The equator of this star has a {{measured}} rotational velocity of 317±3km/s. This corresponds to a rotation period of 15.9 hours, which is 86% of the velocity at which the star would break apart. The <b>equatorial</b> radius of this star is 32% larger than polar radius. Other rapidly rotating stars include Alpha Arae, Pleione, Vega and Achernar.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers use three {{different}} systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. SystemI has {{a period of}} 10hr 14min 00sec (844.3°/d) and encompasses the <b>Equatorial</b> Zone, the South <b>Equatorial</b> Belt and the North <b>Equatorial</b> Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to SystemI. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding {{the north and south}} polar regions, are indicated as SystemII and have been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 38min 25.4sec (810.76°/d). SystemIII refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet in the period of the Voyager flybys, it has been assigned a rotation period of 10hr 39min 22.4sec (810.8°/d). Because it is close to SystemII, it has largely superseded it.|$|E
5|$|Malawi's {{climate is}} {{hot in the}} low-lying areas {{in the south of}} the country and {{temperate}} in the northern highlands. The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an <b>equatorial</b> climate. Between November and April the temperature is warm with <b>equatorial</b> rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March. After March, the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus, with almost no rainfall during these months.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the <b>equatorial</b> plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the <b>equatorial</b> plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the <b>equatorial</b> sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the <b>equatorial</b> plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the <b>equatorial</b> current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{atmospheric}} circulation bands consist {{of the trade}} winds in the <b>equatorial</b> region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the <b>equatorial</b> oceans to the polar regions.|$|E
5|$|Voyagers 1 and 2 {{arrived to}} Jupiter in 1979–1980 and {{traveled}} almost in its <b>equatorial</b> plane. Voyager 1, which passed within 5RJ from the planet's center, {{was first to}} encounter the Io plasma torus. Voyager 2 passed within 10RJ and discovered the current sheet in the <b>equatorial</b> plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was Ulysses in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than <b>equatorial</b> regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the <b>equatorial</b> {{plane of}} Uranus, {{which is almost}} {{perpendicular}} to the orbit of Uranus and so has an extreme seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 14 was {{an early}} Apollo mission, landing sites were {{restricted}} to <b>equatorial</b> regions for technical reasons. After Apollo 12 demonstrated the ability to land at a pre-specified landing zone, mission planners considered landings in rough, but geologically interesting areas of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's <b>equatorial</b> plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme {{seasonal}} cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to the zenith {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its <b>equatorial</b> plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E

Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its <b>equatorial</b> plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. In 2007–2008 a number of such events were observed including two occultations of Titania by Umbriel on August 15 and December 8, 2007 as well as of Ariel by Umbriel on August 19, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Gravity {{tends to}} {{contract}} celestial bodies into a perfect sphere, the shape {{where all the}} mass {{is as close to}} the center of gravity as possible. But a rotating star is not spherical in shape, it has an <b>equatorial</b> bulge.|$|E
5|$|Images {{from the}} Akatsuki orbiter {{revealed}} {{something similar to}} jet stream winds in the low and middle cloud region, which extends from 45 to 60 kilometers in altitude. The wind speed maximized near the equator. In September 2017 JAXA scientists named this phenomenon 'Venusian <b>equatorial</b> jet'.|$|E
5|$|Improved {{telescope}} {{technology in}} the late 19th and 20th centuries allowed astronomers to resolve (that is, see as distinct objects) large-scale surface features on Io. In the 1890s, Edward E. Barnard {{was the first to}} observe variations in Io's brightness between its <b>equatorial</b> and polar regions, correctly determining that this was due to differences in color and albedo between the two regions and not due to Io being egg-shaped, as proposed at the time by fellow astronomer William Pickering, or two separate objects, as initially proposed by Barnard. Later telescopic observations confirmed Io's distinct reddish-brown polar regions and yellow-white <b>equatorial</b> band.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{dissipated}} {{in an area}} of low {{wind shear}} and warm sea surface temperatures. The National Hurricane Center attributed the weakening to dry air from the Sahara. The dry air may have been caused by a lack of southwesterlies bring moisture from <b>equatorial</b> areas, and continental influence from South America.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation than at the planet's <b>equatorial</b> region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|On 7 December 1917 {{the last}} of the {{northern}} Sudanese troops were withdrawn from Mongalla, replaced by <b>Equatorial</b> troops. These southern and at least nominally Christian troops remained the only permanent garrison of the town and province until their mutiny in August 1955.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, the Mauritius Meteorological Services (MMS) {{released}} {{their summer}} 201516 outlook. An average season, with around seven to nine cyclones forming, was expected. MMS {{also indicated that}} the <b>equatorial</b> region {{to the north of}} Mauritius, east of Agaléga and west of Diego Garcia, could be significantly conducive for cyclone formation.|$|E
5|$|Reïna-Flor Okori, at age 36, was {{the only}} Equatoguinean female competitor. She had {{previously}} competed at the previous three Summer Games but with the French Olympic team. She was notable for being the flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Okori qualified for the Games via a wildcard because she had not recorded a qualifying standard time for her event, the women's 100 metres hurdles. She spent time training in <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea and France preparing for the Games. In an interview before the Games Okori said she aimed to reach {{the final stage of}} her event and earn <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea's first Olympic gold medal. She was due to compete in the contest's sixth heat on 16 August alongside seven other participants but was unable to start the event because of a ruptured popliteal cyst.|$|E
5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their <b>equatorial</b> regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the <b>equatorial</b> regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|The two athletes {{that were}} {{selected}} to compete at the London Games were Benjamín Enzema in the men's 800 metres and Bibiana Olama in the women's 100 metres hurdles. Olama was the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies. The country's Olympic women's football team was disqualified from the event's qualification stage after {{it was discovered that}} they were fielding an ineligible player. The <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea delegation was led by the NOC president Manuel Sabino Asumu Kawan and the country's Ambassador in London, Mari-Cruz Evuna Andeme. The athletes were coached by Jose Moises Bodipo Minter, and the competitors said that despite training being difficult in <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea, they wanted to establish a good reputation for their country.|$|E
5|$|The two athletes {{that were}} {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} Rio Games were Benjamín Enzema in the men's 800 metres and Reïna-Flor Okori in the women's 100 metre hurdles. <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea was one of several countries who sent a delegation of two athletes in 2016, with only Tuvalu sending a single competitor. Along with the two athletes, the country's delegation was led by the vice-president of <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue. The country's Olympic women's football team failed to qualify for the Games after being defeated by South Africa on aggregate in a two-leg playoff match in October 2015. Okori was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|A {{river of}} sea water, called the Atlantic North <b>Equatorial</b> Current, flows westward {{off the coast}} of Central Africa. When this current interacts with the northeastern coast of South America, the current forks into two {{branches}}. One passes into the Caribbean Sea, while a second, the Antilles Current, flows north and east of the West Indies. These two branches rejoin north of the Straits of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Sun, the {{gravitational}} influence of Jupiter has {{helped shape the}} Solar System. The orbits {{of most of the}} system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's orbital plane than the Sun's <b>equatorial</b> plane (Mercury is the only planet that is closer to the Sun's equator in orbital tilt), the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt are mostly caused by Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner Solar System's history.|$|E
5|$|Altair is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its <b>equatorial</b> diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 15 was {{the first}} mission in which landing sites were not {{restricted}} to <b>equatorial</b> areas. The Hadley-Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon than had been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating Hadley Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|As part of Sabah area, Kota Kinabalu {{features}} a typical <b>equatorial</b> climate with constant temperature, {{considerable amount of}} rain and high humidity. Two prevailing monsoons characterise the climate {{of this part of}} Sabah are the Northeast Monsoon and the Southwest Monsoon. The Northeast Monsoon occurs between November and March, while the Southwest Monsoon occurs between May and September. There are also two successive inter-monsoons from April to May and from September to October.|$|E
5|$|Baltic German {{astronomer}} Hermann Struve {{used the}} observed {{changes in the}} orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's oblate shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the <b>equatorial</b> diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Barthélemy Boganda (4 April 1910 – 29 March 1959) was {{the leading}} {{nationalist}} politician {{of what is now}} the Central African Republic. Boganda was active prior to his country's independence, during the period when the area, part of French <b>Equatorial</b> Africa, was administered by France under the name of Oubangui-Chari. He served as the first Prime Minister of the Central African Republic autonomous territory.|$|E
5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide <b>equatorial</b> zone rotates with {{a period}} of about 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|DST is {{generally}} not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes it while <b>equatorial</b> Brazil does not. Only {{a minority of the}} world's population uses DST because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.|$|E
5|$|David joined WISPA {{and turned}} {{professional}} in 2000 {{when she won}} her first WISPA title, after only {{a month in the}} tour. The victory came in February, when she defeated Salma Shabana in the final of the Savcor Finnish Open with a score of 9–1, 9–0 and 9–5. Within a month, Hotel <b>Equatorial</b> announced its two-year worldwide sponsorship for her. David also won a sponsorship on the WISPA tour by Dunlop squash.|$|E
5|$|Merian Caldwell Cooper {{was born}} in Jacksonville, Florida, to the lawyer John C. Cooper and the former Mary Caldwell. He was the {{youngest}} of three children. At age six, Cooper decided {{that he wanted to be}} an explorer after hearing stories from the book Explorations and Adventures in <b>Equatorial</b> Africa. He was educated at The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and graduated in 1911.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2010, Chamakh captained the {{national}} team {{for the first time}} in a 2–1 win over the <b>Equatorial</b> Guinea. Three months later, he scored the opening goal in the team's 1–1 away draw to Northern Ireland. After going scoreless for six months at international level, on 4 June 2011, Chamakh scored the second goal in a 4–0 win over Algeria in qualification for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations.|$|E
