40|$|The PACTEL {{is a test}} {{facility}} designed to model the thermal-hydraulic behaviours of the Soviet-designed VVER- 440 pressurized water reactors currently in use in Finland. These reactors have unique features that differ from other PWR designs. The PACTEL simulates the major components and systems of the reference PWR, {{making it possible to}} examine postulated small- and medium-break LOCA's and operational transients. The PACTEL is a volume-scaled model (1 : 305). To ensure that gravitational forces remain equal to those in the reference reactor, the major components and systems in the PACTEL preserve a 1 : 1 elevation equivalence to the reference reactor. Preserving the elevation equivalence and scaling by volume results in relatively small <b>hydraulic</b> <b>diameters.</b> This report describes some of the affects of the smaller <b>hydraulic</b> <b>diameters</b> on the thermal-hydraulic characteristics of the PACTEL.

Mini/micro-channel systems that utilize boiling fluids are particularly useful due to the superiority of boiling heat transfer mode over single-phase flow convection. Although forced flow boiling in mini and micro-channels has been investigated by several research groups in the past, a verified and reliable predictive method is not yet available. 	 In this study, the capability {{of a large number}} of forced flow boiling heat transfer correlations for application to mini channels is examined by comparing their predictions with three experimental data sets. The data all represent recently-published experiments with mini-channels The tested correlations include well-established methods for forced-flow boiling in conventional boiling systems, as well as correlations recently proposed for mini-channels. 	 Based on these comparisons, the most accurate existing predictive methods for mini-channel boiling are identified. The deficiencies of the predictive methods and the potential causes that underlie these deficiencies are also discussed. M. S. Committee Chair: Ghiaasiaan, S.

2500|$|For flow in a pipe of {{diameter}} , experimental observations {{show that}} for [...] "fully developed" [...] flow, laminar flow occurs when [...] < 2300 and turbulent flow occurs when [...] > 2600. At {{the lower end}} of this range, a continuous turbulent-flow will form, but only at a very long distance from the inlet of the pipe. The flow in between will begin to transition from laminar to turbulent and then back to laminar at irregular intervals, called intermittent flow. This is due to the different speeds and conditions of the fluid in different areas of the pipe's cross-section, depending on other factors such as pipe roughness and flow uniformity. Laminar flow tends to dominate in the fast-moving center of the pipe while slower-moving turbulent flow dominates near the wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the continuous turbulent-flow moves closer to the inlet and the intermittency in between increases, until the flow becomes fully turbulent at [...] > 2600. This result is generalized to non-circular channels using the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>diameter,</b> allowing a transition Reynolds number to be calculated for other shapes of channel.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of smaller}} passage {{dimensions}} {{is becoming more}} prevalent in flow boiling applications. Passages with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>diameters</b> {{on the order of}} 1 mm provide higher heat transfer coefficients resulting in more compact heat exchanger arrangements. Passages with 1 mm <b>hydraulic</b> <b>diameters</b> do not pose severe clogging or blocking constraints as opposed to micro-channels and have a less pronounced pressure drop penalty. The present paper explores the flow regimes during flow boiling of water in mini-channels. High-speed photography is used to obtain visual pictures of the flow phenomena from subcooled flow boiling all the way to critical heat flux conditions. The tests include one single-channel and a set of six parallel channels with electric heating from three sides of the channel. The top cover is made of Lexan to permit visual observations. The results are used to identify specific features of flow boiling in smaller diameter mini-channels.
