25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by heterodyning, an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E

25|$|Under {{repeated}} iteration of the horseshoe map, most orbits <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{fixed point}} in the left cap. This is because the horseshoe maps the left cap into itself by an affine transformation that has exactly one fixed point. Any orbit that lands on the left cap never leaves it and converges to the fixed {{point in the}} left cap under iteration. Points in the right cap get mapped into the left cap on the next iteration, and most points in the square get mapped into the caps. Under iteration, most points {{will be part of}} orbits that converge to the fixed point in the left cap, but some points of the square never leave.|$|E

2500|$|These {{two sets}} {{intersect}} at exactly one point. [...] There {{is only one}} possible signal field that both has the correct intensity to match the data trace and fits the mathematical form dictated by the nonlinear interaction. [...] To find that point, which will give the pulse {{we are trying to}} measure, generalized projections is used. [...] The generalized projections algorithm operates in this electric field space. [...] At each step, we find the closest point to the current guess point that will satisfy the constraint for the other set. [...] That is, the current guess is “projected” onto the other set. [...] This closest point becomes the new current guess, and the closest point on the first set is found. [...] By alternating between projecting onto the mathematical constraint set and projecting onto the data constraint set, we eventually <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> solution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the Ford Trimotor on {{commercial}} aviation was immediate, as the design represented a [...] "quantum leap over other airliners." [...] Within {{a few months of}} its introduction, Transcontinental Air Transport was created to provide [...] coast-to-coast operation, capitalizing on the Trimotor's ability to provide reliable and, for the time, comfortable passenger service. While advertised as a transcontinental service, the airline had to rely on rail connections with a deluxe Pullman train that would be based in New York being {{the first part of the}} journey. Passengers then met a Trimotor in Port Columbus, Ohio, that would begin a hop across the continent ending at Waynoka, Oklahoma, where another train would take the passengers to Clovis, New Mexico, where the final journey would begin, again on a Trimotor, to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grand Central Air Terminal in Glendale, a few miles northeast of Los Angeles. [...] This demanding trip would be available for only a year before Transcontinental was merged into a combine with Western Air Service.|$|E
2500|$|If several samples {{have been}} loaded into {{adjacent}} wells in the gel, they will run parallel in individual lanes. Depending {{on the number}} of different molecules, each lane shows separation of the components from the original mixture as one or more distinct bands, one band per component. Incomplete separation of the components can lead to overlapping bands, or to indistinguishable smears representing multiple unresolved components. [...] Bands in different lanes that <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same distance from the top contain molecules that passed through the gel with the same speed, which usually means they are approximately the same size. There are molecular weight size markers available that contain a mixture of molecules of known sizes. If such a marker was run on one lane in the gel parallel to the unknown samples, the bands observed can be compared to those of the unknown in order to determine their size. The distance a band travels is approximately inversely proportional to the logarithm {{of the size of the}} molecule.|$|E

2500|$|In the Third Test at Melbourne Tony Greig was {{controversially}} run {{out when}} England were 157/6. Ian Chappell had thrown {{the ball in}} from the boundary as Greig was completing his third run and Marsh caught the ball and smashed the stumps as the 6'7" [...] South African reached for the crease with his long handled bat. Photographs later showed {{that he had just}} made his ground, but Bailhache gave him out and Greig refused to go until rudely told to leave by Greg Chappell. In the Fifth Test at the Adelaide Oval Max Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same end as Lillee as Mike Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee tried to walk to keep Walker in as he was the better batsman, but Dennis Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go as Lillee has not left his ground and the umpire agreed. Walker had trouble again (see the above quote) in the Sixth Test at Melbourne: the burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out that sent both to the ground, but Walker survived with his wicket intact. In the Third Test at Melbourne John Edrich tried to glance a ball from Ashley Mallett and was caught by Rod Marsh for 49. Bailhache gave him out, though the batsmen later said he had missed and the ball had come off his pads.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Redpath (21) and Rick McCosker (35) {{upset the}} England plans by adding 52 in 83 {{minutes for the}} first wicket. Geoff Arnold made the ball cut and lift immediately, but Bob Willis {{struggled}} and after six overs Derek Underwood replaced Arnold, who changed ends so as to {{have the advantage of}} the wind behind him. [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] (7/113) was called an umbrella bowler – there in case of a rain-affected wicket – {{and he was able to}} make the ball leap and turn from his first over. The openers managed to survive, and by surviving most of the first session they ensured that the Australian middle order would be able to play on a less lethal wicket. Denness failed to bring on Fred Titmus at the other end until the last over before lunch in conditions tailor made for spin bowling, a decision for which he was greatly criticised though E.W. Swanton thought the damps patches were not on Titmus's length. As it was Underwood had to do all the work, bowling 29 overs compared to 31 by the other five bowlers. He achieved the breakthrough when McCosker clipped a ball to Cowdrey in the slips, then both Chappell brothers, Ian was surprised by a leaping ball and skyed it to Knott, while Greg was lbw to a ball that turned from leg to middle stump while he tried to run a leg-bye. With the last ball before lunch Redpath edged the ball the Greig at silly-point and Australia were 77/4. After lunch Marsh tried to hit Underwood out of the attack, but was taken by Greig at mid-wicket at 84/5 with the Kent bowler having taken all the wickets 5/35. The South Australian sun was now drying out the wicket, which reverted to its normal, placid self in the afternoon. The brilliant Doug Walters hit 55 off 66 balls with 7 fours and a six, adding 80 with Terry Jenner who made his only Test fifty on his home ground. Titmus replaced Underwood just as the pitch was losing its turn and Walters was getting into his stride. The Australian batsmen took 24 runs off two overs and Walters's six was caught one handed in the member's stand. The tired Underwood was brought back as his left arm spin could not be hit so easily and Walters spooned a catch to a surprised Willis at mid-off. The tall Max Walker had yet to fail in the series and hit 41, adding 77 with Jenner until the latter became Underwood's seventh successive wicket when he misjudged the flight and hit over a ball. Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same end as Lillee while Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee walked to keep Walker in until Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go and the umpire agreed. Lillee (26) added 36 with Mallett (23 not out) and hooked Willis for four until the new ball was taken. Willis then spread Lillee's stumps and Arnold those of Thomson and Australia were out for 304, the mystery being why they had not been out in the morning such a poor wicket.|$|E
