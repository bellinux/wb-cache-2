40|$|Purpose: This paper {{comparatively}} analyzes {{resistance spot}} weldability {{depending on whether}} or not 440 MPa-grade steel is <b>galvanized</b> at inverter DC spot welding. Design/methodology/approach: To compare the resistance spot weldability depending {{on whether or not}} the steel is <b>galvanized,</b> an inverter DC welding system was designed. Then, using this system, both tensile strength testing and macro-section testing were conducted on SPRC 440 (uncoated steel) and SGARC 440 (<b>galvanized</b> steel), and weldability was evaluated. Suitable welding conditions were calculated using the resistance spot welding variables such as electrode force, welding time and lobe diagram on the welding current. The low limit of the lobe diagram was set to the low limit of the tensile strength of 440 MPa-grade steel while the high limit was set depending on whether or not expulsion was detected. Findings: Compared to uncoated steel, <b>galvanized</b> steel had lower suitable welding current conditions anda narrower lobe diagram. Research limitations/implications: This paper compared resistance spot weldability and lobe diagram depending on whether or not 440 MPa-grade steel is <b>galvanized.</b> Practical implications: This paper confirms the weldability of <b>galvanized</b> steel by comparing resistance spot weldability depending on whether or not steel is <b>galvanized.</b> Originality/value: For analysis of resistance spot weldability depending on whether or not steel is <b>galvanized,</b> weldability was compared between SPRC 440 (uncoated steel) and SGARC 440 (<b>galvanized</b> steel) under the same welding conditions.

5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode.

5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in <b>galvanizing</b> and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E

5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth).
