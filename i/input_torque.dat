This consists of developing suitable forcing functions so that the dominant vibration modes of the system are not excited and hence the system vibration is reduced.

40|$|Split-path {{transmissions}} are promising, attractive {{alternatives to}} the common planetary transmissions for helicopters. The split-path design offers two parallel paths for transmitting torque from the engine to the rotor. Ideally, the transmitted torque is shared equally between the two load paths; however, because of manufacturing tolerances, the design must be sized to allow for other than equal load sharing. To study the effect of tolerances, experiments were conducted using the NASA split-path test gearbox. Two gearboxes, nominally identical except for manufacturing tolerances, were tested. The clocking angle {{was considered to be}} a design parameter and used to adjust the load sharing of an otherwise fixed design. The torque carried in each path was measured for a matrix of <b>input</b> <b>torques</b> and clocking angles. The data were used to determine the optimal value and a tolerance for the clocking angles such that the most heavily loaded split path carried no greater than 53 percent of an <b>input</b> shaft <b>torque</b> of 367 N-m. The range of clocking angles satisfying this condition was - 0. 0012 +/- 0. 0007 rad for box 1 and - 0. 0023 +/- 0. 0009 rad for box 2. This study indicates that split-path gearboxes can be used successfully in rotorcraft and can be manufactured with existing technology...|$|R

The car driveline simulation model demonstrates better accuracy in terms of driving cycles and constant velocity condition at speeds below 120  km/h.

40|$|Critical {{components}} of a rotating machinery such as bearings and couplings are often subjected to unbalanced axial and radial loads due to excessive machine vibrations arising from shaft misalignment(s). The paper presents Symbolic Time Series Analysis (STSA) of bearing acceleration data for detection and estimation of gradually developing parametric changes in flexible disc/diaphragm couplings. The analytical method is built upon the principles of Symbolic Dynamics, Automata Theory, and Statistical Pattern Recognition. The anomaly detection methodology is validated on a real-time simulation test bed, where the dynamic model of a flexible mechanical coupling is subjected to angular misalignment(s) leading to coupling failure.
