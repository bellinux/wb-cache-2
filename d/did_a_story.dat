25|$|The Franks murder has {{inspired}} works of film, theatre, and fiction, including the 1929 play Rope by Patrick Hamilton, performed on BBC television in 1939, and Alfred Hitchcock's {{film of the}} same name in 1948. A fictionalized version of the events formed the basis of Meyer Levin's 1956 novel Compulsion and its 1959 film adaptation. In 1957, two more fictionalized novels were released: Nothing but the Night by James Yaffe and Little Brother Fate by Mary-Carter Roberts. Never the Sinner, John Logan's 1988 play, was based on contemporary newspaper accounts of the case, and included an explicit portrayal of Leopold and Loeb's sexual relationship. The documentary series Behind Mansion Walls also <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> on Leopold and Loeb's crimes.|$|E
500|$|A {{court of}} enquiry praised the {{surviving}} crew and their dead captain and authorised the award of the Victoria Cross posthumously to Thomas Crisp and Distinguished Service Medals to his son and {{another member of the}} crew. On 29 October 1917, David Lloyd George made an emotional speech in the House of Commons citing Crisp's sacrifice as representative of the Royal Navy's commitment [...] "from the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean to the stormy floods of Magellan", which promoted Crisp into an overnight celebrity whose story ran in all the major London papers for nearly a week, containing as it <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of personal sacrifice, filial devotion and perceived German barbarity. The medal presentation was made to Tom Crisp Jr. at Buckingham Palace on 19 December 1917, shortly before he was promoted to Skipper in his own right.|$|E

2500|$|Rather <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> on heroin. Under {{the auspices}} of the Houston Police, he {{experienced}} the drug which he characterized as [...] "a special kind of hell." [...] While at Sam Houston State, Rather worked for KSAM-FM radio in Huntsville, Texas, calling junior high, high school, and Sam Houston State football games. He later spent four seasons as the play-by-play announcer for the University of Houston football team. During the 1959 minor league baseball season, Rather was the play-by-play radio announcer for the Houston Buffs team of the triple A American Association. In 1959, he began his television career as a reporter for KTRK-TV, the ABC affiliate in Houston. Rather was subsequently promoted to the director of news for KHOU-TV, the CBS affiliate in Houston. Ray Miller, news director of KPRC-TV, the NBC affiliate in Houston, also mentored Rather in the early years.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon {{had been}} re-elected. Kissinger {{returned}} from Paris with a peace deal. Reston praised him highly. Nixon, however, decided to bomb North Vietnam {{to demonstrate his}} support for the South. Reston <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> on December 13, 1972, based on his talks with Kissinger citing obstruction by Saigon, which was true. But he did not, could not, report what Kissinger had suppressed from him—he was privy to the decision to bomb Hanoi. That happened five days after the story was published. Kissinger now tried to distance himself from it and Reston was taken in by his claims. Kissinger [...] "undoubtedly opposes" [...] the bombing, he wrote and tried to explain Kissinger's compulsions. Reston's line had not gone unnoticed. The December 13 column was the last straw. It harmed his reputation. Reston had spiked the Pentagon reporter's story because it conflicted with his perceptions. The reporter was proved right.|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson {{refused to}} give {{interviews}} to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004.

The same newspaper article {{made it clear that}} [...] "Ferguson Jnr" [...] was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: [...] "They [...] <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [...] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' {{and all that kind of}} carry-on. It was a horrible attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that." [...] Subsequent interviews on BBC programmes such as Match of the Day were done by his assistant Carlos Queiroz, and later Mike Phelan.|$|E
