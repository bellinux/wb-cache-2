This system uses the birds desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day.

In this last portion occurs the well-known legend (also found in the Shankhayana-sutra, but not in the Kaushitaki-brahmana) of Shunahshepa, whom his father Ajigarta sells and offers to slay, the recital of which formed part of the inauguration of kings.|$|E
