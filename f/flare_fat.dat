40|$|This study {{compared}} {{effects of}} diets containing regular or low fiber extruded linseed and of tissue location on deposition of fatty acids (FA) in pigs. Thirty-six crossbreed growing-finishing male pigs (51 kg initial liveweight) received {{one of three}} experimental diets: control, extruded linseed (EL) and low fiber extruded linseed (EL-). Diets respectively contained 0. 57, 3. 90 and 4. 35 g of α-linolenic acid (ALA) per kg of feed. Pigs were stunned at 115 kg liveweight and tissues were sampled to determine their FA composition (g/ 100 g of total FA). Compared to EL diet, the EL- diet increased the ALA content by 18 % in the longissimus dorsi muscle, 19 % in the diaphragm, 9 % in subcutaneous adipose tissues and 17 % in <b>flare</b> <b>fat.</b> Content of n- 3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) significantly increased with both linseed diets in the diaphragm, <b>flare</b> <b>fat</b> and subcutaneous adipose tissues in the back (SCB) and ham (SCH). The longissimus dorsi and semimembranosus muscles contained more PUFA and n- 3 PUFA derivatives and less C 18 : 3 n- 3 than the diaphragm. <b>Flare</b> <b>fat</b> contained {{the largest percentage of}} SFA, followed by SCB and belly. In contrast, subcutaneous adipose tissue in the neck (SCN), adipose tissue in the ham (IH) and the SCH had a higher percentage of PUFA and C 18 : 3 n- 3 than belly, SCB and <b>flare</b> <b>fat.</b> The SCB contained the most C 22 : 6 n- 3, while the SCH contained the most C 20 : 5 n- 3. These results revealed the greater capacity of <b>flare</b> <b>fat,</b> SCB and to a lesser extent, the belly to synthesize saturated FA and the greater capacity of SCN, SCH and IH to store PUFA. This study confirmed the utility of feeding animals with interesting FA to increase their content in meat and by that to improve consumer's health...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of {{slaughter}} weight on adipose and muscular tissues development of Alentejano hogs thirty animals were used. With an average live weight of 35 kg, pigs were allocated in individual pens at outdoor and fed a commercial diet (15 % CP and 3100 Kcal ED/kg) offered at 85 % Ad Libitum. Pigs were sequentially slaughtered in groups (n= 5) with an average live weight of 40, 70, 80, 90, 100 and 110 kg. After carcass chilling at 5 º C for 24 h <b>flare</b> <b>fat</b> was weighed and subcutaneous backfat thickness and loin eye area were recorded at 10 - 11 ribs, last rib and 3 - 4 lombar vertebras. <b>Flare</b> <b>fat</b> increased significantly (P< 0, 01) with the increase of slaughter weight: 1, 26, 2, 08, 3, 22, 3, 36, 3, 68 e 4, 02 Kg, respectively at 40, 70, 80, 90, 100 e 110 Kg.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the carcasses and the percentage effect of the cuts can provide useful data for establishing breeding techniques which can improve the productive performance of autochthonous pigs. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate some post mortem performances of Sarda and Nero Siciliano pigs, reared outdoors. The study was carried out on 30 male, castrated pigs over the age of 2 years and with a live weight at slaughtering of 106. 4 ± 4. 2 kg for the “Sarda” (15 subjects) and 107. 2 ± 3. 6 kg for the “Nero Siciliano” (15 subjects) pigs. The Sarda pigs were reared in a wooded area in the Ogliastra mountains (Sardinia-Italy) and the Nero Siciliano pigs in the Nebrodi mountains (Sicily-Italy), at an altitude of 550 ± 50 m a. s. l., where they fed on underwood vegetation consisting mainly of acorns. After being slaughtered, which for both groups took place in March 2006, we determined the productivity for each subject, the thickness of dorsal fat located at the first (1 T) and the last (UT) thoracic vertebra and at the top of the middle gluteus (GM). Subsequently, on the right side of each subject, we carried out the dissection of the lean cuts (loin, ham, shoulder and neck), adipose cuts (belly, backfat, jowl, <b>flare</b> <b>fat)</b> and bone cuts (head and feet). The data obtained were submitted to variance analyses using the procedure GLM of SAS (2001). The pigs belonging to the two genetic types registered top yield, both hot (Sarda 82. 1...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} the {{application}} of covariance models, the linear effects of the proportion of Duroc genes were evaluated with respect to growth (from 6 to 170 kg live weight) and feed/gain ratios, as well as carcass (lean cuts, adipose cuts, linear measures, backfat thickness, loin area and lean percentage) and meat quality (L* a* b* colour, reflectance, electrical conductivity, pH) in 167 heavy pigs (87 castrated males, 80 females) from different crosses of Duroc (D), Large White (LW) and Landrace (L) breeds, from 25 to approximately 300 d of age. The pigs were weighed at 25, 105, 170, 235 d {{and at the end}} of the trial (298 ± 6 d of age), and were raised under the same conditions. The proportion of Duroc genes was 0 % (LWxL; no. 33), 25 % [(LWx(DxL); n. 31 and Lx(DxLW); n. 35) ] and 50 % [Dx(LWx(LWxL)); n. 68]. The increase in the proportion of Duroc genes negatively affected the live weight at the different ages (P 0. 10). In fact, during the final phase (from 120 to 170 kg l. w.) the effect of the Duroc breed on daily gain became positive (P= 0. 08), and the feed/gain ratios were significantly lower (P= 0. 02). The carcass composition was not significantly influenced by the increase in the proportion of Duroc genes, with the exception of a rise in the weight of neck (P< 0. 01) and <b>flare</b> <b>fat</b> (P= 0. 02) and a reduction of ham (P= 0. 09). Carcass length resulted lower as the proportion of Duroc genes increased (P< 0. 01); at 24 h from slaughtering, meat colour showed lower values for lightness (P= 0. 08), redness (P= 0. 02) and yellowness (P= 0. 03) ...|$|E
