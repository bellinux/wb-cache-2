5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the <b>fisting</b> movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors, but {{its association with}} dominance and submission, as well as taboo, makes it an appealing stimulus to people of all sexual orientations. In addition to sexual penetration by the penis, people may use sex toys such as butt plugs or anal beads, engage in fingering, anilingus, pegging, anal masturbation or <b>fisting</b> for anal sexual activity, and different sex positions may also be included. <b>Fisting</b> is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon that people can relax enough to accommodate an object {{as big as a}} fist being inserted into the anus.|$|E
25|$|Anal sex can {{exacerbate}} hemorrhoids {{and therefore}} result in bleeding; in other cases, {{the formation of}} a hemorrhoid is attributed to anal sex. If bleeding occurs as a result of anal sex, it may also be because of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues (an anal fissure) or perforation (a hole) in the colon, the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention. Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal mucous membrane being thin, and small blood vessels being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible. By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal <b>fisting</b> poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal <b>fisting</b> injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and sigmoid colon (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.|$|E

Nine minutes later, after several wides from both sides, Alan Brogan curled a shot inside the upright to equalise. Paul Flynn was booked for a high {{challenge}} on Aidan O'Mahony a minute later. In the 15th minute, Alan Brogan scored his second point of the match to give Dublin the lead. Two minutes later, Darren O'Sullivan broke through the Dublin defence and offloaded the ball to Colm Cooper who put it past Stephen Cluxton to score a goal for Kerry. With the score at Kerry 1-01 – 0-02 Dublin, Bernard Brogan got his first point of the day from a free. In the 24th minute, Rory O'Carroll was given a yellow card for an off-the-ball incident with Darren O'Sullivan. A minute later, Kerry made their first substitution, bringing on Paul Galvin for corner-forward Kieran O'Leary. In the 28th minute, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton scored for Dublin from a free and then Bernard Brogan scored his second and third points, giving Dublin a two-point lead. Substitute Galvin then scored his first point, leaving the score Kerry 1-02 – 0-06 Dublin at half time.|$|E

(2008) {{study also}} found that people who engaged in BDSM {{were more likely to have}} {{experienced}} a wider range of sexual practices (e.g. oral or anal sex, more than one partner, group sex, phone sex, viewed pornography, used a sex toy, <b>fisting,</b> rimming, etc.). They were, however, not any more likely to have been coerced, unhappy, [...] anxious, or experiencing sexual difficulties. On the contrary, men who had engaged in BDSM scored lower on a psychological distress scale than men who did not.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July, Bennett was {{informed}} by the Hate Crime Unit at Harlow police station that they had received a complaint about comments attributed {{to him about the}} practice of <b>fisting</b> on the Lubbock Trust website. The police said that as someone had accused him of a homophobic hate crime, they were investigating him over a hate crime. Bennett immediately complained to the Chief Constable of Essex, stating that {{there was no such thing}} in British Law as a homophobic hate crime. He stated further that, [...] "There is material on the website which is critical of the lifestyle of homosexuals which activists might take exception to, but I don't have a problem with people from gay lobbies contacting us." [...] Bennett believed the complaint was made because of the forthcoming release of the Not Awight book.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} Long <b>Fist</b> had a {{very small}} amount of techniques that were learned quickly once one had mastered the three common Long <b>Fist</b> stances of Horse, Dragon and Snake. With the Winding Roundhouse Punch, Meteor <b>Fist</b> Punch, Long Uppercutting Punch, Reverse <b>Fist</b> Punch and the Twin Gorilla Punch all the hand techniques were covered. Adding the Winding or Whirling Roundhouse Kick the original style was complete. The only variation on this allowed Long <b>Fist</b> practitioners to also strike with their fore-arm and shins, not just feet and <b>fists,</b> though still using the same techniques and movements. There are no blocks in Long <b>Fist,</b> although the execution of Long <b>Fist</b> techniques allowed the 'brushing' aside of attacks whilst delivering the powerful techniques.|$|R

Uncle Jaw was so far wrought upon by the magnanimity of the good old man as to be very {{materially}} changed for the better. Instead of quarrelling in real earnest all around the neighborhood, he confined himself merely to battling the opposite side of every question with his son, which, as the latter was somewhat of a logician, afforded a pretty good field for the exercise of his powers; and he was heard to declare at the funeral of the old deacon, that, [...] "after all, a man got as much, and may be more, to go along as the deacon did, than to be all the time <b>fisting</b> and jawing; though I tell you what it is," [...] said he, afterwards, [...] "'tain't every one that has the deacon's faculty, any how." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the United Kingdom <b>fisting</b> {{is legal}} to perform; however, the Crown Prosecution Service {{considers}} publication of <b>fisting</b> material to be grounds for prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. Despite the CPS's guidance, {{in the case}} of R v Peacock in 2012, Michael Peacock was found not guilty of breaching the Obscene Publications Act for selling DVDs containing anal <b>fisting.</b> There was also an unsuccessful extreme pornography prosecution in 2012 where it was argued by the prosecution that images of anal <b>fisting</b> constitute extreme pornography and thus are illegal to possess because the act is [...] "likely to result in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals".|$|E
