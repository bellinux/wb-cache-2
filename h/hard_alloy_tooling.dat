40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to {{formation}} of modified layers with ultra-dispersed structure and improved level of exploitation qualities at surface treatment of <b>hard</b> <b>alloy</b> plates by highly concentrated plasma jet plasma jet. A mathematical simulatuioion {{of the process of}} plasma surface modification of <b>hard</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>tools</b> was carried out, as well as engineering methods of evaluation of optimal treatment modes, based on solution of heat conductivity equation, which is to make it possible to solve both a direct assignment?determination of ?max and W at specified treatment conditions and a reverse problem of evaluating the required (optimal) modes of plasma treatment (I, q, V). Application of the developed simulation model allowed carrying out of the parameters of thermal cycles of plasma heating of <b>hard</b> <b>alloy</b> plates. Also investigated were the mechanisms of structural transformations in <b>tool</b> <b>hard</b> <b>alloys</b> at surface plasma modification. Regularities of structural transformations in <b>hard</b> <b>alloys</b> at heating with highly concentrated plasma jet were revealed. It was found out that the highest strengthening effect for alloys of TK and BK types (HV? 1700) could be reached at plasma treatment without melting of the composition with transformations of carbides and in the matrix.

40|$|Abstract – The latest {{published}} results concerning to novel nitride compositions are reviewed. A spe-cial {{attention was}} attended to promising coatings on the tools for dry metal-working. TiAlN coatings {{are the most}} often used at present to increase du-rability metal cutting tools. The most wear resistant coatings contain 50 – 67 at % of Al (without nitro-gen account) and are deposited {{on the surface of}} high speed steel and <b>hard</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>tools</b> by CVD or PVD (magnetron or vacuum arc) method in nitro-gen containing medium. A main reason of high du-rability of the tools, coated with TiAlN, is an out-standing heat resistance of the nitride. TiAlN nitride keeps high hardness up to 800 – 900 °C being heated in air. A doping silicon to TiAlN results in additional improvement of coating properties. The coatings containing 7 – 9 at % Si have nanocrystal-line structure and hardness nearly twice higher then TiN hardness. Silicon raises the heat resis-tance of the coatings {{and at the same time}} reduces a friction coefficient at sliding on steel. It results in raise of the durability of tools covered with nitride coatings doped by silicon. Resent years a number of novel promising nitride compositions have been investigated as coatings on metal cutting tools.

40|$|The basic {{conditions}} {{to reduce the}} cost of processing technology and improve productivity through the use of modern cutting tools produced by leading foreign firms producing tools have been appraised from theory in the work. Theoretically, it has been found that an increase in the cost of processing varies according to extremum dependence, passing the minimum point. It is possible to reduce the minimum processing cost due to the increase of productivity using cutting edge tools, characterized by a high capacity for work in high cutting temperatures. The criterion showing the technological price cost minimum is the ratio of the expenditures on workers’ wages to the expenditures on the cutting tools, it being quite specific for various processing conditions. To analyze the possibilities of practical use of the proposed criterion, a complex of experimental researches of the technological prime cost and productivity of the processing with <b>hard</b> <b>alloy</b> cutting <b>tools</b> with wear-resistant coatings produced by the company «Iscar» has been carried out. It has been established that their use makes it possible by more than one half to reduce the labour consumption and overall costs as compared to the <b>hard</b> <b>alloy</b> cutting <b>tools</b> traditionally used in home industry. It has been shown that this effect is achieved by increasing the cutting speed and feed due to increased wear resistance and heat resistance of the «Iscar» company tools.

It was stated with regard to all major expenditures including the workers' wages, the cost of the cutting tools, equipment and other costs, allowing more correctly estimate the cost-effectiveness of mechanical processing.

To {{develop an}} {{effective}} approach for the numerical solution of transient thermo-contact problems and present a typical example of its utilization regarding devices {{working on the}} principle of thermoelasticity produced by induction heating and specific technological processes intended for assembly and disassembly of systems containing shrink fits. Methodology. A finite element technique for solution of 2 D multiphysics (electromagnetic, thermal and structural) problems is developed, taking into account temperature dependences of material properties and continuous variations of the contact surfaces. Modeling of the contact interaction between two parts is based on the concept of a special contact finite element having no thickness. The functional for the temperature problem is supplemented with components corresponding to the thermal conductivity of this contact layer. The heat generated due to mutual sliding of both parts can also be taken into account, but the heat capacity (specific heat) of the contact layer is neglected. Using a special 1 D 4 -node finite elements a system of equations for the description of the thermo-contact problem is obtained. Originality. Relatively simple analytical formulae for calculation of the contact thermal resistances occurring in specific parts of electrical machines are known. The paper offers an alternative approach for the numerical solution of transient thermo-contact problems based on the concept of a special 1 D contact finite element having no thickness. Results.
