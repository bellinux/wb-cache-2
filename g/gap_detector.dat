However, existing approaches are limited to only preserving normal discontinuous features (ridges, ravines and crest lines) while position discontinuous features (boundaries) are also universal in urban scenes.

By extending recent developments in geometry refinement to explicitly regularize boundary points, both normal and position discontinuous features are preserved and enhanced. The refinement includes two steps: i) the smoothing step applies a two-stage feature preserving bilateral filtering, which first filters normals and then updates positions {{under the guidance of}} the filtered normals. In a separate similar process, boundary points are smoothed directed by tangent directions of underlying lines, and ii) the up-sampling step interpolates new points to fill gaps/holes for both interior surfaces and boundary lines, through a local <b>gap</b> <b>detector</b> and a feature-aware bilateral projector.

The UTA High Energy group has been working on using GEMs as the sensitive <b>gap</b> <b>detector</b> in a DHCAL for the ILC. The physics goals at the ILC put a stringent requirement on detector performance. Especially the precision required for jet mass and positions demands an unprecedented jet energy resolution to hadronic calorimeters. A solution to meet this requirement is using the Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA). In order for PFA to work well, high calorimeter granularity is necessary. Previous studies based on GEANT simulations using GEM DHCAL gave confidence on the performance of GEM in the sensitive gap in a sampling calorimeter and its use as a DHCAL in PFA.

40|$|Much of the {{chemistry}} that affects life on planet Earth {{occurs in the}} condensed phase. The TeraHertz (THz) or far-infrared (far-IR) region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} (from 0. 1 THz to 10 THz, 3 cm - 1 to 300 cm - 1, or 3000 μm to 30 μm) has been shown to provide unique possibilities in the study of condensed-phase processes. The goal of this work is to expand the possibilities available in the THz region and undertake new investigations of fundamental interest to chemistry. Since we are fundamentally interested in condensed-phase processes, this thesis focuses on two areas where THz spectroscopy can provide new understanding: astrochemistry and solvation science. To advance these fields, we had to develop new instrumentation that would enable the experiments necessary to answer new questions in either astrochemistry or solvation science. We first developed a new experimental setup capable of studying astrochemical ice analogs in both the TeraHertz (THz), or far-Infrared (far-IR), region (0. 3 - 7. 5 THz; 10 - 250 cm - 1) and the mid-IR (400 - 4000 cm - 1). The importance of astrochemical ices lies in their key role in the formation of complex organic molecules, such as amino acids and sugars in space. Thus, the instruments are capable of performing variety of spectroscopic studies that can provide especially relevant laboratory data to support astronomical observations from telescopes such as the Herschel Space Telescope, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). The experimental apparatus uses a THz time-domain spectrometer, with a 1750 / 875 nm plasma source and a <b>GaP</b> <b>detector</b> crystal, to cover the bandwidth mentioned above with 10 GHz (0. 3 cm - 1) resolution. Using the above instrumentation, experimental spectra of astrochemical ice analogs of water and carbon dioxide in pure, mixed, and layered ices were collected at different temperatures under high vacuum conditions with the goal of investigating the structure of the ice. We tentatively observe a new feature in both amorphous solid water and crystalline water at 33 cm - 1 (1 THz). In addition, our studies of mixed and layered ices show how it is possible to identify the location of carbon dioxide as it segregates within the ice by observing its effect on the THz spectrum of water ice. The THz spectra of mixed and layered ices are further analyzed by fitting their spectra features to those of pure amorphous solid water and crystalline water ice to quantify the effects of temperature changes on structure. From the results of this work, it appears that THz spectroscopy is potentially well suited to study thermal transformations within the ice. To advance the study of liquids with THz spectroscopy, we developed a new ultrafast nonlinear THz spectroscopic technique: heterodyne-detected, ultrafast THz Kerr effect (TKE) spectroscopy. We implemented a heterodyne-detection scheme into a TKE spectrometer that uses a stilbazoiumbased THz emitter, 4 -N,N-dimethylamino- 4 -N-methyl-stilbazolium 2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzenesulfonate (DSTMS), and high numerical aperture optics which generates THz electric field in excess of 300 kV/cm, in the sample. This allows us to report the first measurement of quantum beats at terahertz (THz) frequencies that result from vibrational coherences initiated by the nonlinear, dipolar interaction of a broadband, high-energy, (sub) picosecond THz pulse with the sample. Our instrument improves on both the frequency coverage, and sensitivity previously reported; it also ensures a backgroundless measurement of the THz Kerr effect in pure liquids. For liquid diiodomethane, we observe a quantum beat at 3. 66 THz (122 cm - 1), in exact agreement with the fundamental transition frequency of the υ 4 vibration of the molecule. This result provides new insight into dipolar vs. Raman selection rules at terahertz frequencies. To conclude we discuss future directions for the nonlinear THz spectroscopy in the Blake lab. We report the first results from an experiment using a plasma-based THz source for nonlinear spectroscopy that has the potential to enable nonlinear THz spectra with a sub- 100 fs temporal resolution, and how the optics involved in the plasma mechanism can enable THz pulse shaping. Finally, we discuss how a single-shot THz detection scheme could improve the acquisition of THz data and how such a scheme could be implemented in the Blake lab. The instruments developed herein will hopefully remain a part of the groups core competencies and serve as building blocks {{for the next generation of}} THz instrumentation that pushes the frontiers of both chemistry and the scientific enterprise as a whole. </p...|$|E

One of the scanners, the ClearPET™ Neuro is designed for applications in neuroscience. Four detector blocks with 64 2 × 2 × 10 mm LSO and LuYAP crystals, arranged in line, build a module. Twenty modules are arranged in a ring with a ring diameter of 13. 8 cm and an axial size of 11. 2 cm. An insensitive region at the border of the detector heads results in <b>gaps</b> between the <b>detectors</b> axially and tangentially.

Coincidences are associated off line by software. After sorting the data into 3 D sinograms, image reconstruction is performed using the Ordered Subset Maximum A Posteriori One-Step Late (OSMAPOSL) iterative algorithm implemented in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) library. Due to the non-conventional scanner design, careful estimation of the sensitivity matrix is needed to obtain artifact-free images from the ClearPET™ Neuro...|$|R
30|$|SAXS {{datasets}} of tooth slices {{consist of}} 30, 000 or more individual scattering patterns. To process this {{huge amount of}} data, automation is needed. In azimuthal segments radially integrated SAXS data are approximated by a cosine through an FFT algorithm, see above. When the scattering specimen does exhibit a moderate degree of orientation, {{as is the case}} for dentin, deviation from a perfect cosine is small (cf. Fig.  2). The inversion symmetry of scattering patterns can be exploited to compensate drawbacks of the modular detector structure of the PILATUS 2 M, where no photons can be detected in the <b>gaps</b> between the <b>detector</b> modules.|$|R
40|$|ClearPET (TM) is {{a family}} of small-animal PET {{scanners}} which are currently under development within the Crystal Clear Collaboration (CERN). All scanners {{are based on the}} same detector block design using individual LSO and LuYAP crystals in phoswich configuration, coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes. One of the scanners, the ClearPET (TM) Neuro is designed for applications in neuroscience. Four detector blocks with 64 2 x 2 x 10 turn LSO and LuYAP crystals, arranged in line, build a module. Twenty modules are arranged in a ring with a ring diameter of 13. 8 cm and an axial size of 11. 2 cm. An insensitive region at the border of the detector heads results in <b>gaps</b> between the <b>detectors</b> axially and tangentially. The detectors are rotating by 360 in step and shoot mode during data acquisition. Every second module is shifted axially to compensate partly for the <b>gaps</b> between the <b>detector</b> blocks in a module. This unconventional scanner geometry requires dedicated image reconstruction procedures. Data acquisition acquires single events that are stored with a time mark in a dedicated list mode format. Coincidences are associated off line by software. After sorting the data into 3 D sinograms, image reconstruction is performed using the Ordered Subset Maximum A Posteriori One-Step Late (OSMAPOSL) iterative algorithm implemented in the Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) library.

5000|$|According to Defense Industry Daily {{significant}} limitations {{were put}} on the PS1 survey to avoid recording sensitive objects. Streak detection software (known as [...] "Magic") was used to censor pixels containing information about satellites in the image. Early versions of this software were immature, leaving a filling factor of 68% of the full field of view (which figure includes <b>gaps</b> between the <b>detectors),</b> but by March 2010 this had improved to 76%, a small reduction from the approximately 80% available. At the end of 2011, the USAF completely eliminated the masking requirement (for all images, past and future). Thus, {{with the exception of}} a few non-functioning OTA cells, the entire field of view can be used.|$|R
