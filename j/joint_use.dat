Also, different animals have different pain tolerances and different weights, and use their bodies differently, so a light dog who only walks, will have a different <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> than a more heavy or very active dog.

Garrow's will was written in 1830 and contained only two demands; {{to be buried in}} his birthplace, Hadley, with his uncle, his father's younger brother William (who had left Garrow the best part of his fortune), and to set up a trust. The trust contained his entire estate, with the trustees being Leonard Smith, a merchant, Edward Lowth Badeley of Paper Buildings, Inner Temple and William Nanson Lettsom of Gray's Inn. The money was divided between Joseph, Garrow's nephew, who received £1,000, £200 to each of the children of Garrow's sister, £2,000 to the sister and £300 a year to the widow of Garrow's son. Eliza, Garrow's daughter, received £300 a year from the interest on the trust, with an additional provision of £200 for the <b>joint</b> <b>use</b> of Eliza and her husband. The estate was structured by a legal professional, and as such no death duties were paid. The second instruction was ignored: Garrow was buried in the churchyard of St Laurence, [...] Ramsgate, his parish church.|$|E

The additional 40,000 acres were leased in 1966 in the Navajo-Hopi <b>Joint</b> <b>Use</b> Area, leases being entered into {{with each of the}} two tribes – Joint Mineral Lease No. 14-20-0450-5743, aka J-5743, with the Hopi tribe, and 14-20-0603-9910, aka J-9910, with the Navajo Tribe. When the <b>Joint</b> <b>Use</b> Area was later partitioned between the tribes in 1974, much of the mine lease area and surface rights ended up with Navajo Nation, but the two tribes retained joint and equal interest in the coal and other minerals under the partitioned lands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tensile strength, {{metallographic}} {{and structural}} analyses of anodized aluminum sheet–copper sheet dissimilar welds produced under various {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) conditions were conducted. The 6061 specimens were heated to 530 ~ 570 oC, held for 1 hour, followed by water quenching and furnace cooling. AA 6061 -T 6 Al sheets were anodized to thicknesses of 5 µm and 12 µm, respectively. FSW <b>joints</b> were characterized <b>using</b> microstructural analysis, microhardness measurements and tensile testing. The tensile strength of the 6061 -T 6 / 6061 -T 6 <b>joint</b> <b>using</b> FSW is 145 MPa. However, the tensile strength of the 6061 -T 6 /Cu <b>joint</b> <b>using</b> FSW is decreased to 100 MPa. When the anodized layer was increased the tensile strength of the 6061 -T 6 /Cu <b>joint</b> <b>using</b> FSW was decreased to a value below 50 MPa. Increasing the anodized layer thickness disturbed material mixing {{and the formation of}} increasing amounts of oxide rich structures. The oxide phase content and the mixed area homogeneity were increased with increasing layer thickness, decreasing the tensile strength of the FSW joints...|$|R
