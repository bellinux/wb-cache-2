25|$|For example, the {{following}} algorithm is a <b>direct</b> <b>implementation</b> {{to compute the}} function A(x) = (x−1) / (exp(x−1) − 1) which is well-conditioned at 1.0, however it can {{be shown to be}} numerically unstable and lose up to half the significant digits carried by the arithmetic when computed near 1.0.|$|E
25|$|In summary, theoretically, the {{plasmids}} {{for use in}} {{this method}} can be constructed to allow for absolute customization of the protocol. One stipulation is {{that each of the}} two constructed plasmids should have distinct selectable markers, such as genes conferring resistance to two different antibiotics, to allow for targeted selection and counterselection. Furthermore, the pCas9cr4 plasmid can be purchased from Addgene (ID 62655) for <b>direct</b> <b>implementation</b> into a no-SCAR recombination experiment, and the pKDsgRNA-p15 (ID 62656) and pKDsgRNA-ack (ID 62654) plasmids can also be purchased from Addgene.|$|E

25|$|All {{proposed}} {{solar radiation}} management techniques require implementation on a relatively large scale, in order to impact the Earth's climate. The least costly proposals are budgeted at {{tens of billions of}} US dollars annually. Space sunshades would cost far more. Who was to bear the substantial costs of some climate engineering techniques may be hard to agree. However, the more effective {{solar radiation management}} proposals currently appear to have low enough <b>direct</b> <b>implementation</b> costs that {{it would be in the}} interests of several single countries to implement them unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{voted on}} each of the 18 {{proposals}} separately in two rounds. The first round served as an indicator of whether the amendments would gather sufficient support, with amendments being proposed by all parties present in the chamber. In the second round, parties are no longer permitted to propose changes to the proposals. The results of the second round are taken into account, with 330 votes needed to send them to a referendum or 367 for <b>direct</b> <b>implementation.</b> A final vote on all of the approved proposals at large, with the same thresholds, was undertaken {{at the end of the}} second round, with the entire process being disbanded if votes in favour fell below 330.|$|E
2500|$|Solar {{radiation}} management (SRM) techniques {{would seek}} to reduce sunlight absorbed (ultra-violet, near infra-red and visible). [...] This would be achieved by deflecting sunlight away from the Earth, or by increasing the reflectivity (albedo) of the atmosphere or the Earth's surface. These methods would not reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and thus would not seek to address problems such as the ocean acidification caused by CO2. In general, solar radiation management projects presently appear {{to be able to}} take effect rapidly and to have very low <b>direct</b> <b>implementation</b> costs relative to greenhouse gas emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal. Furthermore, many proposed SRM methods would be reversible in their direct climatic effects. While greenhouse gas remediation offers a more comprehensive possible solution to global warming, it does not give instantaneous results; for that, solar radiation management is required.|$|E
