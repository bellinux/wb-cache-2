It was shown that plasma based ion implanta-tion as well as <b>ion-assisted</b> <b>coating</b> deposition may be realized for metal and dielectric samples by variation of negative bias potential in the range o...|$|E
40|$|The plasma or <b>ion-assisted</b> <b>coating</b> {{techniques}} such as sputtering and ion plating are discussed in view of wear and corrosion protection. The basic processes and the unique features of the technique are discussed {{in regard to the}} synthesis and development of high reliability wear and corrosion resistant films. The ions of the plasma which transfer energy, momentum, and charge to the substrate and the growing films can be beneficially used. As a result, coating adherence and cohesion is improved. Favorable morphological growth such as high density and porosity-free films can be developed, and residual stresses can be reduced...|$|E

Focuses upon treatment of materials destined for use in sliding, rolling, rotating, and/or oscillating contact under such severe environmental conditions as variable temperature, ionizing radiation, vacuum, and oxidizing or corrosive atmospheres at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The <b>ion-assisted</b> or plasma <b>coating</b> {{technology}} is discussed {{as it applies}} to the deposition of hard, wear resistant refractory compound films. Of the many sputtering and ion plating modes and configurations the reactive magnetron sputtering and the reactive triode ion plating techniques are the preferred ones to deposit wear resistant coatings for tribological applications. Both of these techniques incorporate additional means to enhance the ionization efficiency and chemical reaction to precision tailor desirable tribological characteristics. Interrelationships between film formation, structure, and ribological properties are strictly controlled by the deposition parameters and the substrate condition. The enhanced ionization contributes to the excellent adherence and coherence, reduced internal stresses and improved structural growth to form dense, cohesive, equiaxed grain structure for improved wear resistance and control...|$|R
