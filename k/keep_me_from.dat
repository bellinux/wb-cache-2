Here we are, two good old boats that have been {{faithful}} neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
500|$|Barry Beyerstein - [...] "One of {{the many}} enjoyable tasks I {{undertake}} for CSICOP is to lecture in Ray Hyman's annual summer workshop at the University of Oregon. [...] Not only is it the towering presence of Ray himself, and the joy of observing the sheer brainpower of my fellow faculty at work, {{it is also the}} people, literally from around the world, who enroll in this and other CSICOP functions that <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> suffering that occupational hazard 'skeptic's burnout.' [...] They are a remarkable lot, genuinely nice people committed to critical thinking and leaving the place a bit better than they found it. [...] They make me very pleased that my fate was to become a skeptical inquirer." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 16, 2007, LeMond {{rode the}} L'Ã‰tape du Tour cyclosportive with his son, {{and found it}} to be a {{defining}} moment in his post-competition life. [...] "I had the time of my life", he said, despite getting [...] "650th place" [...] and being [...] "impressed that I even finished". LeMond continued, [...] "I decided that day that nobody's going to <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody." [...] At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, should he appear in court as scheduled the following day. Undeterred, LeMond took the stand and testified, before admitting to the world that he had been molested.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gravity of}} the scandal was {{confirmed}} on November 2 when Van Doren said to the Committee in a nationally televised session that [...] "I was involved, deeply involved, in a deception. The fact that I too was very much deceived cannot <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> being the principal victim of that deception, because I was its principal symbol." ...|$|E
2500|$|On being wealthy, he {{said that}} [...] "if people know you're rich, they don't talk {{with you when you}} walk down the street." [...] He kept his wealth an open secret, {{amassing}} media outlets, hotels and casinos with a net worth widely estimated at more than a billion dollars. Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it [...] "would <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> sleeping at night". Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and he exchanged birthday greetings each July 6 for their shared birthday. Griffin was also an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, having been friends with both of the Reagans for many years.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{day after}} the wedding, Rev. Charles Smith, District Superintendent of the Northern California District of the Church of the Nazarene, {{contacted}} Norris and advised him that he had no right under Nazarene polity to conduct the wedding of a person who had divorced unless adultery was the grounds, and that he would [...] "unfrock him for marrying a person divorced on grounds outside those recognized by the church". Norris was confident he would be exonerated after Nazarene authorities investigated the situation. On Monday, January 28, 1929, Norris met with Wedge in the bridal suite on the seventh floor of the Hotel Oakland, and quarreled about the wedding. Norris initially refused to file the paperwork for the wedding, as he claimed Wedge had lied to him about the marital status of Holloway, creating the impression that she was a widow. After Wedge threatened to file a mandamus suit against him, Norris filed the paperwork at the hall of records. Wedge indicated that: [...] "To save his own ecclesiastical hide, Norris would like to get me out on a limb and then saw the limb off". Wedge insisted that even if the church did not recognize the legality of his wedding, that [...] "we are married in the eyes of God and that is enough to satisfy me". Wedge also indicated that while he expected never to be given a pastorate again, that {{he had no intention of}} resigning from the church: [...] "They may <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> preaching, but they won't kick me out of the church". Wedge planned to train and manage his son, who was a promising amateur boxer, but on January 30, 1929, Hugh informed his father that he had decided not to sign a contract with him, and to remain in high school and then work in a foundry. After this argument with his son, Wedge indicated that he lost control and contemplated throwing himself out of his hotel window to spare his bride anymore humiliation.|$|E
