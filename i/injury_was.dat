5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E
5|$|Accrington Stanley {{accepted}} an undisclosed bid from Wrexham in July 2005, {{which included a}} sell-on clause and a bonus if he returned to play international football. He scored on his debut in a friendly against UEFA Champions League winners Liverpool in the 4–3 defeat after he came on as a substitute. McEvilly suffered a stress fracture in a metatarsus bone on his right foot in the 1–1 home draw with Notts County on 11 December, although he declared himself fit to play their following game against Carlisle United, he was substituted after 45 minutes after receiving a mouth injury which had required temporary dental surgery the same evening. His foot <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> later operated on and he received further dental treatment. His return to the Wrexham team following his <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> on 9 April 2006, in their 2–1 home defeat to Shrewsbury Town when he came on as a substitute replacing Matt Crowell in the 45th minute. He made a further three appearances scoring one goal, before breaking the same bone again in mid-April sidelining him {{until the end of}} the season. During the 2005–06 season, McEvilly made a total of 23 appearances for Wrexham, scoring seven goals in League Two.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{match with}} Bret Hart, Lawler {{introduced}} a woman obviously younger than himself as his mother, and wished her a happy Mother's Day. Moments before the contest, Hart revealed that his knee <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> fake. During the contest, referee Earl Hebner became tied {{upside down in}} the ropes after being distracted by Shinja. While Hebner was tied upside down, Hakushi interfered and performed a diving headbutt to Hart. Lawler won the match when he rolled-up Hart for the pinfall.|$|E

One night, he {{threatened}} to punch his commanding officer, resulting in his being sentenced for insubordination to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour.

Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that he was hit by a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any <b>injury</b> <b>was</b> psychosomatic.|$|E

5|$|For the 1996 championship, Canavan {{was handed}} the {{captaincy}} of Tyrone, and was Ulster's leading scorer {{for the third}} year in a row, and subsequently awarded his third successive All Star.

5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate.
