40|$|Agriculture is {{undergoing}} extreme change. The {{introduction of new}} generation agricultural products has generated an increased need for efficient and accurate product segregation across a number of Canadian agricultural sectors. In particular, monitoring, controlling and preventing commingling of various wheat grades is critical to continued agri-food safety and quality assurance in the Canadian grain handling system. The Canadian grain handling industry is a vast regional supply chain with many participants. <b>Grading</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> for blending had historically been accomplished by the method of Kernel Visual Distinguishability (KVD). KVD allowed a trained grain grader to distinguish the class of a registered variety of wheat solely by visual inspection. While KVD enabled rapid, dependable, and low-cost segregation of wheat into functionally different classes or quality types, it also put constraints {{on the development of}} novel traits in wheat. To facilitate the introduction of new classes of wheat to enable additional export sales in new markets, the federal government announced that KVD was to be eliminated from all primary classes of wheat as of August 1, 2008. As an alternative, the Canadian Grain Commission has implemented a system called Variety Eligibility Declaration (VED) to replace KVD. As a system based on self-declaration, the VED system may create moral hazard for misrepresentation. This system is problematic in that incentives exist for farmers to misrepresent their grain. Similarly, primary elevators have an incentive to commingle wheat classes in a profitable manner. Clearly, the VED system will only work as desired for the grain industry when supported by a credible monitoring system. That is, to ensure the security of the wheat supply chain, sampling and testing at some specific critical points along the supply chain is needed. While the current technology allows the identification of visually indistinguishable grain varieties with enough precision for most modern segregation requirements, this technology is relatively slow and expensive. With the potential costs of monitoring VED through the current wheat supply chain, there is a fundamental tradeoff confronting grain handlers, and effective handling strategies will be needed to maintain historical wheat uniformity and consistency while keeping monitoring costs down. There are important operational issues to efficiently testing grain within the supply chain, including the choice of the optimal location to test and how intensively to test. The testing protocols for grain deliveries as well as maintaining effective responsiveness to information feedback among farmers will certainly become a strategic emphasis for wheat handlers in the future. In light of this, my research attempts to identify the risks, incentives and costs associated with a functional declaration system. This research tests a series of incentives designed to generate truthful behavior within the new policy environment. In this manner, I examine potential and easy to implement testing strategies designed to maintain integrity and efficiency in this agricultural supply chain. This study is developed in the first instance by using an analytic model to explore the economic incentives for motivating farmer’s risk control efforts and handlers’ optimal handling strategies with respect to testing cost, penalty level, contamination risks and risk control efforts. We solve for optimal behavior in the supply chain assuming cost minimization among the participants, under several simplifying assumptions. In reality, the Canadian grain supply chain is composed of heterogeneous, boundedly rational and dynamically interacting individuals, and none of these characteristics fit the standard optimization framework used to solve these problems. Given this complex agent behavior, the grain supply chain is characterized by a set of non-linear relationships between individual participants, coupled with out of equilibrium dynamics, meaning that analytic solutions will not always identify or validate the set of optimized strategies that would evolve in the real world. To account for this inherent complexity, I develop an agent-based (farmers and elevators) model to simulate behaviour in a more realistic but virtual grain supply chain. After characterizing the basic analytics of the problem, the grain supply chain participants are represented as autonomous economic agents with a certain level of programmed behavioral heterogeneity. The agents interact via a set of heuristics governing their actions and decisions. The operation of a major portion of the Canadian grain handling system is simulated in this manner, moving from the individual farm up through to the country elevator level. My simulation results suggest testing strategies to alleviate misrepresentation (moral hazard) in this supply chain are more efficient for society when they are flexible and can be easily adjusted to react to situational change within the supply chain. While the idea of using software agents for modeling and understanding the dynamics of the supply chain under consideration is somewhat novel, I consider this exercise a first step to a broader modeling representation of modern agricultural supply chains. The agent-based simulation methodology developed in my dissertation can be extended to other economic systems or chains in order to examine risk management and control costs. These include food safety and quality assurance network systems as well as natural-resource management systems. Furthermore, to my knowledge there are no existing studies that develop and compare both analytic and agent-based simulation approaches for this type of complex economic situation. In the dissertation, I conduct explicit comparisons between the analytic and agent-based simulation solutions where applicable. While the two approaches generated somewhat different solutions, in many respects they led to similar overall conclusions regarding this particular agricultural policy issue...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the failure of}} sorghum to compete in Philippine feedgrain markets {{in spite of its}} seeming logic in certain cropping systems. Philippine sorghum production declined from 36. 29 thousand MT in 1979 to only 260 MT in 1985. The study first examines the structure of feedgrains markets, seeking clues to market behavior and performance. Quantitative analysis focuses directly on efficiency, a key performance variable. ^ Market structure analysis suggests potential market inefficiencies. Feedgrain markets are characterized by oligopsonistic buyers (traders) and atomistic sellers (farmers). Bilateral oligopolies dominate local trader-feedmill markets and traders often collude. There is a general lack <b>of</b> scientific <b>grading</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains.</b> Sorghum produced in Mindanao is often of low quality owing to the harvest <b>of</b> immature <b>grain.</b> A high resulting incidence of tannin leads to poor feeding efficiency. ^ A positive cross price elasticity of demand suggests the substitutability of sorghum and corn. Regressing prices of corn against prices of sorghum reveals that sorghum prices are 88 to 92 percent those of corn, a result commensurate with nutritional differences between the two crops. Price analysis indicates a generally close integration of markets for both corn and sorghum across time, space and form. ^ Analysis of price margins for corn and sorghum shows that, except at the wholesale level, prices are justified by costs of transportation, storage and processing. Wholesale price anomalies may stem from the market power of a few traders controlling large volumes <b>of</b> <b>grains.</b> Aside from somewhat higher costs associated with marketing low volumes of sorghum (threshing, storage, re-labelling of feed components), marketing costs are generally similar to those of corn. ^ Sorghum price is the primary determinant of quantity of sorghum demanded. Lower sorghum prices, however, are a producer disincentive, aggravating what may be sorghum 2 ̆ 7 s main drawback, the undependability of its supply. Thus, in order to compete successfully with corn, {{at least in the short}} term, sorghum prices must be lower than those for corn. But low prices result in low production which in turn dampens demand for sorghum as a feedgrain. The unreliability of supply is a concern that emphasizes the inseparability of production and marketing aspects of sorghum 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness in the Philippines. ...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} numerical techniques and methods for the evaluation and minimization of wound core distribution transformer no load losses. The aforementioned numerical techniques are combined with deterministic and stochastic optimization algorithms for the minimization of the manufacturing and the total owing cost of wound core transformers. The no load loss evaluation is achieved by {{the application of a}} new technique that combines the computed peak flux density distribution with the experimentally determined local specific core losses. The computation of the peak flux density distribution is performed by a novel iterative procedure and nonlinear finite element magnetostatic analysis, avoiding in this manner the computationally expensive harmonic and transient analysis. The representation of the wound core material anisotropy is accomplished by a new elliptic anisotropy model specifically developed for wound cores, in contrast with conventional elliptic anisotropy models that have been developed so far which are suitable for stack core transformers. The advantages of the aforementioned technique, in contrast with conventional techniques appearing in the literature, are its accuracy and low computational cost which renders the proposed numerical technique ideal for industry application. Furthermore, a novel technique for the no load loss minimization has been developed. The specific technique is based on the wound core flux density non-uniformity and makes use <b>of</b> multiple <b>grade</b> lamination wound cores which are constructed <b>of</b> two different <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> oriented magnetic steel. By applying the multiple grade lamination wound core technique a further reduction of the total owing cost of wound core distribution transformers is achieved.

40|$|Wheat midge is an {{established}} insect pest in most wheat-producing {{regions of the}} world. It was first detected in western Canada in the early 1900 ’s. However, the first major outbreak in Saskatchewan was not recorded until 1983. Since then, wheat midge populations have spread and now infest {{a large portion of}} the wheat-producing area of the prairies. Damage caused by larval feeding on kernels can reduce crop yields and lower the <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> harvested <b>grain.</b> Today, wheat producers in western Canada have access to one of the most comprehensive management programs of any insect pest of field crops. Forecasts and risk warnings, monitoring tools, cultural control, agronomic practices, chemical control, biological control and host plant tolerance are all available for producers to manage wheat midge and to conserve its natural enemies. Background and Current Status Wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is {{an established}} insect pest in most wheat-producing regions of the world. It was introduced into western Canada over 100 years ago. The insect was first reported in Manitoba in the early 1900 s but did not become a pest until the 1950 s 1. The first major outbreak of wheat midge occurred in northeast Saskatchewan in 1983 when producers in nine municipalities suffered over $ 30 million in yield losses 2. Since that time, wheat midge has become a chronic pest of spring wheat (Triticum spp.) throughout much of the wheat-growing area of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and neighboring states of North Dakota...|$|R
40|$|In December 1992, Ms Jennifer Hamilton of J. Hamilton & Associates {{contracted}} TWP {{to evaluate}} a specimen comprising a failed timber joist taken froma building site in the Glenwood Estate, Mackay. The timber was provisionally identified visually as Forest Red Gum or Red Ironbark, most probably Structural <b>Grade</b> 4 because <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> orientation. There was considerable cross-grain {{in the region of}} the failure. The grain ran at an angle of 40 degrees to the length of the joist. Before installation, the top surface of the joist had been painted with a "whitewash" which had evidently penetrated into an open shake (grain oriented split). All unpainted surfaces of the joist, including the region of failure, indicated substantial exposure to the weather because of the grey colour of fibres. There were no fresh, unexposed fibres apparent in the region of failure. The ambient density (963 kg/m 3) of the joist was determined by measuring volume and weight. The ambient moisture content (12 %) was determined using a moisture meter and by correcting readings for species factors. Measurements were taken at 23 deg. C and 65 % relative humidity. " [...] p.

The structure tensor is a simple and robust descriptor that was developed to analyze textures orientation. Contrarily to segmentation methods which rely on an object based modelling of images, the structure tensor views the sample at a macroscopic scale, like a continuum. Thanks to this tool, {{it is possible to}} extract useful information on the orientation <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> kernels even in a bulk. Knowing the rough orientation <b>of</b> a <b>grain</b> kernel could provide an initialization for segmentation techniques. The comparative results with ground truth orientations on four different grain kernels demonstrate the ability of the structure tensor to detect the seed orientations...|$|R
