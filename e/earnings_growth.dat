For example, the Chinese bottled water industry is forecast to more than double in size in 2008, becoming a $10.5 billion industry. Meanwhile, as those who once had no recourse but low-quality tap water take advantage of its availability in supermarkets, those who had little or no running water are now capitalising on its availability. Tap water production and supply is expected to grow by 29.3% in 2008, to $11.9billion. China's automotive industry is expected to expand by 29.5% to nearly $200billion. Also, consumption of chocolate and other confectionery is to increase by 24.3%, as the industry expands to $4.6billion. Additionally China's fast food industry has been growing at a 20.8% annual rate as major players such as McDonald's enter the market. The LVMH Group, who own major luxury brands including Louis Vuitton apparel, Moët & Chandon wines and champagne and Hennessy cognacs, reported <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> of over 25% in 2007 in China, with the country accounting for around 16% of LVMH's global business.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new technique}} for estimating earnings and employment volatility at the firm level, and applies it to Japanese firms. Unlike earlier studies for the United States, we estimate instantaneous volatility for every year, rather than a rolling ten-year average of volatility. In addition, our technique allows us to estimate the firm-specific component of firm volatility separately, by controlling for variation in firms’ <b>earnings</b> and employment <b>growth</b> induced by aggregate and sectoral factors. We find that firm-specific sales volatility was substantially higher before the 1990 stock market crash than in the following fifteen years. The conditional variance of <b>earnings</b> and employment <b>growth</b> stayed relatively constant until the late 1990 s, but increased substantially from 1999 onwards. ...|$|R

After controlling for current profitability, we find a strong negative relation of NOA with future stock returns. Moreover, {{the results indicate that}} this relation is associated with the sustainability implications of the underlying components of NOA. We also find that the hedge strategies on NOA and those NOA components that indicate low sustainability of current profitability generate positive abnormal returns and constitute statistical arbitrage opportunities. The findings on the sources of the NOA anomaly indicate a significant role for earnings management but no significant role for growth. However, it is found that the interaction of <b>earnings</b> management and <b>growth</b> is an important contributing factor in the anomaly. Overall, our evidence suggests that the interpretation of the NOA anomaly requires investor's limited attention on accounting distortions arising from earnings management.
