5|$|The {{secondary}} battery consisted of twelve 6-inch (15.2cm) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure. These guns were chosen because the 4-inch (10.2cm) guns on earlier battleships were {{deemed to be}} too weak and have too short a range to effectively combat torpedo boats with newer, more powerful torpedoes. Admiral Jackie Fisher had opposed the idea of increasing the {{secondary battery}}, though he retired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>post</b> of First Sea Lord in 1910. As a result, the Iron Dukes, which were designed in 1911, received the larger 6inch gun.|$|E

5|$|In 1085, when Alexios {{recovered}} the strategically important Adriatic {{port city of}} Dyrrhachium from the Normans who had occupied it, John Doukas was installed as the military governor (doux) of the local province. John remained there until 1092, when he was replaced by John Komnenos, {{the son of the}} emperor's brother, the sebastokrator Isaac. His tenure was apparently very successful. John repelled the Serbian incursions from Duklja and Raška, and even, according to Anna Komnene, captured the Dukljan king Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), before restoring him to power as a client of the Byzantine Empire. Thus John managed to restore order in the region of Albania and Dalmatia, which had suffered greatly during the Byzantine–Norman wars of the previous years. Surviving correspondence from the archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid is a testimony to his success; after John's departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>post,</b> Theophylact expressed nostalgia for the time of his governorship and asked for his advice.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{following}} the largest trans-national election in history, despite the European Council choosing a President from the largest political group (the EPP), the Parliament again exerted {{pressure on the}} Commission. During the Parliament's hearings of the proposed Commissioners MEPs raised doubts about some nominees with the Civil Liberties committee rejecting Rocco Buttiglione <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>post</b> of Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security over his views on homosexuality. That {{was the first time}} the Parliament had ever voted against an incoming Commissioner and despite Barroso's insistence upon Buttiglione the Parliament forced Buttiglione to be withdrawn. A number of other Commissioners also had to be withdrawn or reassigned before Parliament allowed the Barroso Commission to take office.|$|E
5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>post</b> would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E
