5|$|The {{legend of}} Orion was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, {{probably}} the Astronomia; simple references to Hesiod will refer to this, unless otherwise stated. This version is known {{through the work}} of a Hellenistic author on the constellations; he gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's discourse on Orion. According to this version, Orion was likely the son of the sea-god Poseidon and Euryale, daughter of Minos, King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves because of his father; <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the island of Chios where he got drunk and attacked Merope, daughter of Oenopion, the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded Orion and drove him away. Orion stumbled to Lemnos where Hephaestus — the lame smith-god — had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, Cedalion, to guide Orion to the uttermost East where Helios, the Sun, healed him; Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to Crete where he hunted with the goddess Artemis and her mother Leto, {{and in the course of}} the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother Earth objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill Orion. The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked Zeus to place Orion among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the Scorpion to the heavens as well.|$|E

On October 6, Farber threw a bomb into a police station, injuring several policemen inside. Farber himself was killed by the explosion.|$|E
25|$|DePuy {{was born}} in Jamestown, North Dakota. His {{military}} career began when he enlisted in the South Dakota National Guard, eventually becoming a squad leader. He graduated from South Dakota State University with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Infantry in 1941. His first assignment was with the 20th Infantry Regiment at Fort Leonard Wood, and during this time <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the Louisiana Maneuvers and back with his platoon.|$|E

25|$|When he was {{released}} in June 1865, he had no food or money to aid in his journey home except useless Confederate bills. Bartering some blankets for some United States money, Wood returned home by way of Cleveland (although he wrote that he returned through Milwaukee, which seems unlikely as that would be far out of his way), then to Baltimore, then to Richmond and on to Charlottesville, where <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> his father's residence north of town. Many of the 19th's members performed similar odysseys {{on their way home}} after the war.|$|E
25|$|Climbing the Galibier, Eugène Christophe {{broke the}} fork of his bicycle. This {{was the third}} time in his career that this happened. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the top, and down the entire descent before he could fix it. He {{finished}} the stage three hours after the winner. The leader of the race, Alavoine, also suffered from mechanical problems. His chain broke several times, and in the cold rain he had to put it back on. He also had a cold, and could not go along with his competitors. Heusghem attacked on that stage, and won back more than half an hour, and was then third in the general classification.|$|E

At the Indy 500, Franchitti {{was running}} in the top ten for the final restart, but got loose in turn 1 and scraped across the turn 1 wall in a similar style to Takuma Sato's 2012 accident on the final lap. This brought out a final caution that found one of Franchitti's closest friends off the track, Tony Kanaan winning his first Indy 500 and his first win in a few years. After climbing out of his car, Franchitti was led to the infield hospital. Franchitti was cleared uninjured; and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> victory lane to hug Kanaan just before the broadcasting ended.|$|E

25|$|After five days, {{during which}} he used almost all his money, Riis found work as a {{carpenter}} at Brady's Bend Iron Works on the Allegheny River above Pittsburgh. After {{a few days of}} that he began mining for increased pay, but quickly resumed carpentry. Learning on July 19, 1870, that France had declared war on Germany, he expected that Denmark would join France to avenge the Prussian seizure of Schleswig, and determined to fight for France. He returned to New York, and, having pawned most of his possessions and without money, attempted to enlist at the French consulate, but was told that there was no plan to send a volunteer army from America. Pawning his revolver, he walked out of New York until he collapsed from exhaustion; on waking, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> Fordham College where a Catholic priest served him breakfast.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} {{primary school}} {{in his native}} village, his high school education was interrupted by World War I. Niculae was mobilized as a telephone operator at the mayor's office in Crevedia Mare. Notoriously philandering into his old age, Crevedia boasted that his first sexual encounters were war widows. Upon the end of war, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> Bucharest, the national capital, in order to complete his education. In 1923–1924, he was a clerk at the War Ministry, making his published debut in 1924, in the journal Cultul Eroilor Noștri. Crevedia graduated from Saint Sava High School in 1925, and then pursued a degree in Slavic studies at the University of Bucharest. Although he learned Latin and the rudiments of Bulgarian, he never in fact took his degree. He belonged to the sociological research teams led by Dimitrie Gusti and worked for a while as a substitute teacher, then as a private tutor.|$|E

25|$|According to Pelin, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the upper}} sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin {{and looked at}} it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a blip on the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming {{from the direction of}} Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions.

500|$|Despite being widely tipped as contenders, the Heat {{got off to}} a {{tentative}} 9–8 start. The Heat managed to go on to compile a 21–1 record, however, and were jostling with the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls for pole position in the Eastern Conference as mid-season approached. Miami finished the regular season with 58 wins and faced Philadelphia {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. Miami won the series in five games, and also prevailed in five games in the semi-finals against Boston. In the Conference Finals against Chicago, Bosh was particularly instrumental, averaging 23.2 points in the 4–1 series win. He was slow off the blocks in the Finals against Dallas, shooting below [...]300 in the first two games, but scored the winning shot in Game 3 to give Miami a 2–1 lead. That was the last game Miami won, as Dallas won the next three to win its first ever championship. Bosh was seen sobbing as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the locker room following the loss.|$|E
500|$|By June 21, Guatemalan {{soldiers}} had gathered at Zacapa {{under the command}} of Colonel Víctor M. León, who was believed to be loyal to Árbenz. The leaders of the communist party also began to have their suspicions, and sent a member to investigate. He returned on June 25, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. PGT Secretary General Alvarado Monzón informed Árbenz, who quickly sent another investigator of his own, who brought back a message asking Árbenz to resign. The officers believed that given US support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and Árbenz was to blame for it. The message stated that if Árbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas. On June 25, Árbenz announced that the army had abandoned the government, and that civilians needed to be armed in order to defend the country; however, only a few hundred individuals volunteered. Seeing this, Díaz reneged on his support of the president, and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed US ambassador John Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to Árbenz and informed him of their decision. Árbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8pm on June 27, 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later. In it, he stated that he was resigning in order to eliminate the [...] "pretext for the invasion," [...] and that he wished to preserve the gains of the October Revolution. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the nearby Mexican Embassy, seeking political asylum.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 25 June, Árbenz called {{a meeting of the}} senior leaders of the government, the {{political}} parties, and the labor unions. Colonel Díaz was also present. The President told them that the army at Zacapa had abandoned the government, and that the civilian population needed to be armed in order to defend the country. Díaz raised no objections, and the unions pledged several thousand troops between them. When the troops were mustered the next day, only a few hundred showed up. The civilian population of the capital had fought alongside the Guatemalan Revolution twice before—during the popular uprising of 1944, and again during the attempted coup of 1949—but on this occasion the army, intimidated by the United States, refused to fight. The union members were reluctant to fight both the invasion and their own military. Seeing this, Díaz reneged on his support of the President, and began plotting to overthrow Árbenz with the assistance of other senior army officers. They informed Peurifoy of this plan, asking him to stop the hostilities in return for Árbenz's resignation. Peurifoy promised to arrange a truce, and the plotters went to Árbenz and informed him of their decision. Árbenz, utterly exhausted and seeking to preserve at least a measure of the democratic reforms that he had brought, agreed without demur. After informing his cabinet of his decision, he left the presidential palace at 8pm on 27 June 1954, having taped a resignation speech that was broadcast an hour later.

Some 120 Árbenz loyalists or communists were also allowed to leave, and none of the assassination plans contemplated by the CIA were actually implemented.|$|E
500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E
