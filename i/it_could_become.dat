5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} runway before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> airborne. It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 {{were taken from the}} Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{computer}} power: There was {{not enough}} memory or processing speed to accomplish anything truly useful. For example, Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because {{that was all that}} would fit in memory. Hans Moravec argued in 1976 that computers were still millions of times too weak to exhibit intelligence. He suggested an analogy: artificial intelligence requires computer power {{in the same way that}} aircraft require horsepower. Below a certain threshold, it's impossible, but, as power increases, eventually <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> easy. With regard to computer vision, Moravec estimated that simply matching the edge and motion detection capabilities of human retina in real time would require a general-purpose computer capable of 109 operations/second (1000 MIPS). As of 2011, practical computer vision applications require 10,000 to 1,000,000 MIPS. By comparison, the fastest supercomputer in 1976, Cray-1 (retailing at $5 million to $8 million), was only capable of around 80 to 130 MIPS, and a typical desktop computer at the time achieved less than 1 MIPS.|$|E

5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E

The source of new knowledge are research: basic, applied and industrial, which complement each other to form one whole. Each of these research has other sources of financing and other purposes.

The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to Middle High German, Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language {{as it did in the}} past.|$|E

25|$|When Congress {{passed the}} Second Organic Act in 1912, Alaska was reorganized, and renamed the Territory of Alaska. By 1916, its {{population}} was about 58,000. James Wickersham, a Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska's first statehood bill, but it failed {{due to the}} small population and lack of interest from Alaskans. Even President Warren G. Harding's visit in 1923 could not create widespread interest in statehood. Under {{the conditions of the}} Second Organic Act, Alaska had been split into four divisions. The most populous of the divisions, whose capital was Juneau, wondered if <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a separate state from the other three. Government control was a primary concern, with the territory having 52 federal agencies governing it.|$|E

25|$|North American beavers {{were also}} {{released}} in Finland in 1937, {{before it was}} realized that they formed a separate species. (Eurasian beavers had been extirpated from the region, so the release {{was intended as a}} reintroduction project.) By 1999, it was estimated that 90% of beavers in Finland were the American species. The species is not considered invasive, as in Europe it has a similar keystone effect to European beavers, which have not recolonized the area. The beaver population has been controlled by issuing hunting licenses. A report in 2010 concluded that while the current population was not problematic, as the species has larger litters than European beavers and builds somewhat larger dams, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a problem if its range continues expanding into Russia, but this {{does not seem to be}} taking place.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} loose patch clamp {{on a cell}} membrane, the pipette is moved slowly towards the cell, until the {{electrical}} resistance of the contact between the cell and the pipette increases to a few times greater resistance {{than that of the}} electrode alone. The closer the pipette gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the pipette tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> difficult to remove the pipette without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the pipette does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a permanent connection, nor to pierce the cell membrane. The cell membrane stays intact, and the lack of a tight seal creates a small gap through which ions can pass outside the cell without entering the pipette.|$|E

In that same year, Ashot had also relocated the capital from Kars to Ani. The Bagratuni kings had never chosen a city to settle in, alternating from Bagaran to Shirakavan to Kars; Kars never did reach a status where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a capital and Dvin was disregarded altogether, given its proximity to the hostile emirates.
