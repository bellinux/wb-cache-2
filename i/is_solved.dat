5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents <b>is</b> <b>solved</b> (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem <b>is</b> <b>solved</b> by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E

5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem <b>is</b> <b>solved</b> using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a methodology, called decomposition-based reductions, for showing the equivalence among various problems of bounded-width. First, {{we show that}} the following are equivalent for any α > 0 : * SAT can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, * 3 -SAT can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, * Max 2 -SAT can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, * Independent Set can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αtw) time, and * Independent Set can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(2 ^αcw) time, where tw and cw are the tree-width and clique-width of the instance, respectively. Then, we {{introduce a}} new parameterized complexity class EPNL, which includes Set Cover and Directed Hamiltonicity, and show that SAT, 3 -SAT, Max 2 -SAT, and Independent Set parameterized by path-width are EPNL-complete. This implies that if one of these EPNL-complete problems can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(c^k) time, then any problem in EPNL can <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in O^*(c^k) time.

5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem <b>is</b> <b>solved</b> by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
