5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female factory workers for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E

The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analysis}} of growth <b>in</b> labour <b>productivity</b> <b>in</b> the manufacturing sectors of six Canadian regions over the period 1962 - 84 is presented. A review of trends <b>in</b> labour <b>productivity</b> indicates that significant regional differences persist throughout the study period.

A model that decomposes growth <b>in</b> labour <b>productivity</b> into the contributions {{of growth in the}} capital - labour ratio, scale economies, and technical progress while controlling for business cycle effects is estimated for each of five Canadian regions. Alternative specifications are employed in order to help distinguish between the effects of internal scale economies and agglomeration economies. The results support the hypothesis that agglomeration economies make a significant contribution to growth <b>in</b> labour <b>productivity.</b> Although rapid growth in the capital - labour ratio contributed significantly to growth <b>in</b> labour <b>productivity</b> <b>in</b> the Atlantic region, it was not sufficient to erase regional differences. ...|$|R

5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E

Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love.

5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include hardiness, prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases <b>in</b> <b>productivity.</b> In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases <b>in</b> <b>productivity</b> were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E
