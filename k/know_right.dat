500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As far as I <b>know</b> <b>right</b> now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally wrong about that. I don't know." ...|$|E
