Anderson joined the newly formed Melbourne Storm with reserve grade coach Steve Folkes taking over the head coaching position.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Fitzroy Crossing, Oscar worked in state government community welfare and health departments, before becoming the Junjuwa Community Women’s Resource Officer in 1989. She then became the Chairperson of the Marra Worra Worra Aboriginal Corporation, one of Australia’s {{oldest and most}} respected Aboriginal community centres, until 1991, when she was appointed Commissioner of the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Commission for a 2-year term. When she was 29 years old, Oscar {{received a phone call}} from Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner asking her to join the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. She <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone because she thought the call was a hoax but then decided to call him back.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone and ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked {{to the front of the}} property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

500|$|When {{journalist}} Murat Halstead telephoned McKinley from Chicago {{to inform}} him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone. [...] Bryan's nomination briefly gratified the Republicans, believing that his selection {{would lead to}} an easy victory for McKinley. In those days when the presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until September, Hanna had planned a vacation while McKinley anticipated a quiet summer. [...] The Republicans were caught by surprise by the wave of enthusiasm that Bryan's speech and nomination caused, and scuttled these plans; as Hanna wrote to McKinley on July 16, [...] "the Chicago convention has changed everything".|$|E
500|$|All of {{the players}} were {{cooperative}} except for Jose Canseco, who was intimidating. He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly made him as heroic as possible. He was originally slated {{to wake up in}} bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. He disliked his caricature, stating that [...] "the animation looked nothing like ," [...] but that he found the acting was very easy. When asked in 2007 about his part by the San Jose Mercury News, he responded, [...] "that was 100 years ago," [...] <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone and did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Heavy Traffic, Bakshi {{received}} a call from Krantz, who questioned him about Harlem Nights. Bakshi told Krantz: [...] "I can't talk about that" [...] and <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> next day, Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio, reportedly tapping Bakshi's phone because he was wary of his loyalty as an employee. After Krantz fired Bakshi, he began to seek a replacement director for Heavy Traffic, calling several directors, including Chuck Jones. Arkoff threatened to pull the film's budget unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later. During the film's production, Krantz attempted to maintain some level of control by issuing memos to Bakshi and other artists requesting various changes. John Sparey remembers being issued a memo asking Sparey to stop posting caricatures of Krantz on the middle of his door.|$|E

Waters {{recorded}} the phone call used on the original demo for [...] "Young Lust", but neglected to inform its recipient, Mason, who assumed it was a prank call and angrily <b>hung</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> call references Waters' viewpoint of his bitter 1975 divorce from first wife Judy. Waters also recorded ambient sounds along Hollywood Boulevard by hanging a microphone from a studio window. Engineer Phil Taylor recorded some of the screeching tyre noises on [...] "Run Like Hell" [...] from a studio car park, and a television set being destroyed was used on [...] "One of My Turns". At Britannia Row Studios, Nick Griffiths recorded the smashing of crockery for the same song. Television broadcasts were used, and one actor, recognising his voice, accepted a financial settlement from the group in lieu of legal action against them.|$|E
500|$|Following his {{nomination}} in June, McKinley's team had {{believed that the}} election would be fought {{on the issue of}} the protective tariff. [...] Chicago banker Charles G. Dawes, a McKinley advisor who had known Bryan when both lived in Lincoln, had predicted to McKinley and his friend and campaign manager, Mark Hanna, that if Bryan had the chance to speak to the convention, he would be its choice. [...] McKinley and Hanna gently mocked Dawes, telling him that Bland would be the nominee. [...] In the three weeks between the two conventions, McKinley spoke only on the tariff question, and when journalist Murat Halstead telephoned him from Chicago to inform him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone. [...] When Bryan was nominated on a silver platform, the Republicans were briefly gratified, believing that Bryan's selection would result in an easy victory for McKinley.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} be the nominee, he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone. The Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be gone in a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign. Both men spoke to {{hundreds of thousands of people}} from their chosen venues.|$|E

500|$|While {{promoting}} the album, Cole said [...] "R, rock and pop {{has always been}} my forte" [...] and called the music something {{she wished she had}} recorded [...] "at least five years ago". She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard in a long time from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] had <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." [...] She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented [...] "leaving the past behind".|$|E
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the trades}} {{indicated}} production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg {{and asked him}} bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where {{he had heard the}} rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was [...] "out to get him" [...] and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. In truth, Katzenberg was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg.|$|E

2500|$|A {{major issue}} in the {{campaign}} that was considered to have hurt the DFL nominees was lieutenant gubernatorial candidate Judi Dutcher's response to a questiona about E-85. When asked {{about the impact of}} the gasoline alternative on the economies of rural Minnesota by then KSAX-TV anchor Corey Poppe, Dutcher was unable to comment, asking Poppe to define E-85. In the subsequent questioning about her response, gubernatorial candidate Mike Hatch reportedly called a Forum Communications reporter [...] "a Republican whore" [...] and promptly <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone. Hatch claimed he had said [...] "hack", not [...] "whore", but the incident, occurring only three days before the last poll listed in this article, is believed to have swung the race. It put Hatch on the defensive in the campaign's last week.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, {{one year}} after their live debut and now dubbed the Stooges, the band signed with Elektra Records, again {{following}} in the footsteps of The Doors, who were Elektra's biggest act at the time (reportedly, Pop called Moe Howard to see if it was all right to call his band [...] "The Stooges," [...] to which Howard responded by merely saying [...] "I don't care what they call themselves, as long as they're not the Three Stooges!" [...] and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone). The Stooges' first album The Stooges, (on which Pop was credited as [...] "Iggy Stooge"), was produced by John Cale in New York in 1969. Both it and the follow-up, Fun House produced by Don Gallucci in Los Angeles in 1970, sold poorly. Though the release of Fun House did not receive the recognition it expected, it was later ranked #191 in Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time' in 2003. Shortly after the new members joined, the group disbanded because of Pop's worsening heroin addiction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, Thayer was {{the author}} of a {{controversial}} series of articles about race demonstrations in Charleston, South Carolina, in the wake of shootings carried out by Dylann Roof. The stories, which were first published in MarxRand, eventually attracted attention from the mainstream press. In particular, a story called [...] "Patriot Games" [...] was picked up by mainstream news organizations after being published on MarxRand, and subsequently commissioned as a separate story run in Vice later the same week. In the original version of the story, Thayer claimed that a Ku Klux Klan leader named Chris Barker was doubling as an undercover FBI operative [...] "working for and protected by the U.S. Joint Terrorism Task Force." [...] As a result of Barker's outing, Thayer wrote in September 2015 that [...] "Mr Barker (has called and) <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone several times, sent me incendiary emails and made threatening phone calls, and has since gone on White Nationalist internet forums to try to denounce the articles and defend his reputation" [...] and that other Klan members had [...] "threatened to decapitate my dog." ...|$|E
2500|$|Abbott was incarcerated at San Quentin {{to await}} execution. His lawyers worked to commute his {{sentence}} {{for over a}} year. On March 15, 1957, {{the day of the}} execution which was scheduled for 11:00 am, his attorney appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, which was denied, and then tried to contact the governor of California, Goodwin J. Knight, but the governor was at sea on a naval ship and out of reach of the telephone. The attorney [...] arranged with a TV station to broadcast a plea to the governor. [...] At 9:02 Governor Knight granted one hour's stay by telephone. Within six minutes [...] a writ of habeas corpus was presented [...] to the Supreme Court of California but at 10:42 am the petition was denied. The attorney tried again with an appeal to the Federal District Court but the court refused a further postponement at 10:50 am. At 11:12 am Governor Knight was reached again and agreed to another stay. At 11:15 am Abbott was led to the gas chamber and strapped in the chair while the governor was contacting the warden by telephone. The executioner pulled the lever three minutes later and 16 pellets of sodium cyanide dropped into the sulfuric acid as Governor Knight reached the prison warden to stay the execution.
