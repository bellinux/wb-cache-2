5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E
5|$|In a DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix,</b> {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
30|$|The use of {{double-stranded}} precursors {{can help}} to take the advantage of template properties of nucleic acids. Mononucleotides cannot be organized into <b>double</b> <b>helixes.</b> Longer building blocks are needed.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{double-stranded}} DNA, RNA is a single-stranded molecule {{in many of}} its biological {{roles and}} has a much shorter chain of nucleotides. However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) <b>double</b> <b>helixes,</b> as in tRNA.|$|R
5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{are made}} from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The {{biological}} information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a <b>double</b> <b>helix.</b>|$|E
5|$|Helicases are {{proteins}} {{that are a}} type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.|$|E
50|$|An effect {{similar to}} coaxial {{stacking}} {{has been observed}} in rationally designed DNA structures. DNA origami structures contain {{a large number of}} <b>double</b> <b>helixes</b> with exposed blunt ends. These structures were observed to stick together along the edges that contained these exposed blunt ends, due to the hydrophobic stacking interactions.|$|R
50|$|The Carnival {{edition of}} Catch the Sperm is {{set against a}} {{background}} of what appears to be surreal paintings and includes drifting balloons and floating strands of confetti, some of which are spiral shaped like uncoiling DNA <b>double</b> <b>helixes.</b> The characters are a Waggis, a Joker, a Sambina, a Lipstick, a Clown, and Gold, Silver, and Bronze Sperm. There are six viruses.|$|R
5000|$|Outside of gene exons, {{there exist}} {{regulatory}} sequence motifs and motifs within the [...] "junk", such as satellite DNA. Some {{of these are}} believed to affect the shape of nucleic acids (see for example RNA self-splicing), but this is only sometimes the case. For example, many DNA binding proteins that have affinity for specific DNA binding sites bind DNA in only its double-helical form. They are able to recognize motifs through contact with the <b>double</b> <b>helix's</b> major or minor groove.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} famous pieces of {{scientific}} research performed at King's were the crucial contributions to the discovery of the <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> structure of DNA in 1953 by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, together with Raymond Gosling, Alex Stokes, Herbert Wilson and other colleagues at the Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics at King's.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, the {{strength}} of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their melting temperature (also called Tm value). When all the base pairs in a DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.|$|E
5000|$|EcoRI (pronounced [...] "eco R one") is a {{restriction}} endonuclease enzyme isolated from species E. coli. The Eco {{part of the}} enzymes name originates from the species from which it was isolated, while the R represents the particular strain, in this case RY13. The last part of its name, the I, denotes {{that it was the}} first enzyme isolated from this strain. EcoRI is a restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA <b>double</b> <b>helixes</b> into fragments at specific sites. It is also a part of the restriction modification system.|$|R
50|$|T = twist - {{total number}} of turns in the <b>double</b> {{stranded}} DNA <b>helix.</b> This will normally tend to approach the number of turns that a topologically open <b>double</b> stranded DNA <b>helix</b> makes free in solution: number of bases/10.5, assuming there are no intercalating agents (e.g., ethidium bromide) or other elements modifying the stiffness of the DNA.|$|R
2500|$|In eukaryotes, nuclear {{chromosomes}} are packaged by proteins into a condensed structure called chromatin. This {{allows the}} very long DNA molecules {{to fit into}} the cell nucleus. The structure of chromosomes and chromatin varies through the cell cycle. Chromosomes are even more condensed than chromatin and are an essential unit for cellular division. [...] Chromosomes must be replicated, divided, and passed successfully to their daughter cells so as to ensure the genetic diversity and survival of their progeny. Chromosomes may exist as either duplicated or unduplicated. Unduplicated chromosomes are single <b>double</b> <b>helixes,</b> whereas duplicated chromosomes contain two identical copies (called chromatids or sister chromatids) joined by a centromere.|$|R

Franklin's {{colleague}} at King’s, Maurice Wilkins, was played by Stephen Campbell Moore. The title refers to Photo 51, an x-ray crystallography image of the DNA <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> structure produced by Franklin and a PhD student in 1952 at King’s College, London.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Kepler’s law of areal {{velocity}} is mathematically {{equivalent to the}} Lorentz force. This provides the link between Gravity and Magnetism. We learn how gravity is an irrotational aether flow that is permeated with tiny swirling sinks that siphon the aether away from the larger sink. These tiny swirling sinks are stacked {{on top of each}} other in their axial planes so as to form the <b>double</b> <b>helixes</b> that constitute Faraday’s lines of force. The magnetic permeability represents the areal density in the equatorial plane of these vortices and hence it represents the flux density of a bundle of Faraday’s lines of force measured perpendicularly to the lines. Magnetic permeability and electric permittivity both represent a leakage factor in the gravitational field...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Current work in tuning DNA {{kinetics}} {{has focused}} on changing toehold lengths and DNA concentrations. However, kinetics can also be improved by enhancing the completion probability of the strand displacement process. Here, we execute this strategy by creating a toehold DNA motor device with {{the inclusion of a}} synthetic nucleotide, inosine, at selected sites. Furthermore, we found that the energetic bias can be tuned such that the device can stay in a stable partially displaced state. This work demonstrates the utility of energetic biases to change DNA strand displacement kinetics and introduces a complementary strategy to the existing designs. Improvement in the kinetics of strand displacement reactions of conventional <b>double</b> <b>helixes</b> is highly desirable for building efficient DNA motors. Toehold-driven process, such as toehold-mediated strand displacement, has allowed for creatin...|$|R
5|$|The genome of {{rotavirus}} {{consists of}} 11 unique <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> molecules of RNA which are 18,555 nucleotides in total. Each helix, or segment, is a gene, numbered 1 to 11 by decreasing size. Each gene codes for one protein, except genes 9, which codes for two. The RNA {{is surrounded by}} a three-layered icosahedral protein capsid. Viral particles are up to 76.5nm in diameter and are not enveloped.|$|E
5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a <b>double</b> <b>helix</b> has a defect, the other strand {{can be used as a}} {{template}} to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand.|$|E

5000|$|One recent {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the lights are formed by a cluster of macroscopic Coulomb crystals in a plasma produced by the ionization of air and dust by alpha particles during radon decay in the dusty atmosphere. Several physical properties including oscillation, geometric structure, and light spectrum, observed in the Hessdalen lights (...) can be explained through a dust plasma model. Radon decay produces alpha particles (responsible by helium emissions in [...] spectrum) and radioactive elements such as polonium. In 2004, Teodorani showed an occurrence where {{a higher level of}} radioactivity on rocks was detected near the area where a large light ball was reported. Computer simulations show that dust immersed in ionized gas can organize itself into <b>double</b> <b>helixes</b> like some of occurrences of the Hessdalen lights; dusty plasmas may also form in this structure.|$|R

50|$|Once riders board {{one of the}} two Jester's trains, a train {{will then}} take riders up a 79 ft tall lift hill. After the train goes up the lift hill it will then loop around and drop at speeds up to 40 mph through a Vertical loop and then the train will loop around over the station to the ride's double Corkscrew. Once the train passes the double corkscrews it will then take riders through a <b>double</b> <b>helix's</b> before {{entering}} the brake run that takes rides back to the station. There are two Vekoma Hurricane's in the world and The Jester is the only one to take riders backwards throughout the whole course of the coaster. The other Vekoma Hurricane is located at Walygator Parc as Waly Coaster that only travel riders forwards and not backwards.|$|R
5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} <b>double</b> <b>helix.</b> The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the <b>double</b> <b>helix.</b> In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the <b>double</b> <b>helix.</b> This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
