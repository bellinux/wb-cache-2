5000|$|In his 2003 paper, [...] "Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy", A. W. F. Edwards {{argued that}} rather than using a locus-by-locus {{analysis}} of variation to derive taxonomy, {{it is possible to}} construct a human classification system based on characteristic genetic patterns, or clusters inferred from multilocus genetic data. Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing {{of a large number of}} loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups. Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood. However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: [...] "Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> should throw it out? ...

40|$|Most {{performance}} analysis {{boils down to}} finding bottlenecks. In our context, a bottleneck is any event (e. g., branch mispredict, window stall, or ALU operation) that limits performance. Bottleneck analysis is critical for an architect’s work, whether the goal is tuning processors for energy efficiency, improving the effectiveness of optimizations, or designing a more balanced processor. Yet, despite its importance, bottleneck analysis methodology has lagged behind processor technology. While increasing supplies of transistors have been successfully converted into increasing performance, the resulting complexity has made bottleneck analysis much more challenging. Instructions are re-ordered and executed in parallel; processor events such as store-buffer stalls and BTB misses occur at the same time; and speculative computation is occasionally squashed with control redirected. This complexity and fine-grain parallelism {{makes it difficult to}} know what the bottlenecks actually are. For example, when two cache misses occur in the same cycle, we may need to optimize both to increase performance. How about if a multiply and window stall occur simultaneously? Is one of them the “true” bottleneck, or do we again need to optimize both? In general, there may be dozens of events occurring simultaneously in a single cycle on a modern machine. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> need to optimize all of them to remove the cycle? Or can we get by with just a subset...|$|E
40|$|This {{has been}} an {{extraordinary}} year. A considerable amount of time has been spent on budget cutting activities that {{were not part of}} our strategic plan. To get the support and understanding for the budget cuts that were required, we used an elaborate process that involved a team of staff and library faculty and the gathering of feedback from the entire staff at selected intervals. Our process was framed by the requirement that all cuts be made with the University’s goals in mind and within the framework of “What do the Libraries and the Center for Creative Photography have to be doing in three to five years to successfully contribute to the University’s goals and what <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> have to do now? ” We also kept our values in mind: customer focus, continual improvement, diversity, flexibility, and integrity. Further, we kept our promise to staff that we would maintain the staff’s ability to continually learn (travel, workshops), to have the necessary equipment and supplies to perform their work, and to receive rewards (merit) for their work. In spite of cutting over $ 800, 000, reallocating $ 300, 000, eliminating 22 positions, and holding many positions open to ensure no layoffs were necessary, the University Libraries did achieve a budget plan that met these requirements and allowed us to mak...|$|E

40|$|In the {{pastoral}} epistles the Lord lays down {{for us the}} various qualifications that he and we should expect from those who serve in the public gospel ministry. Arguably, the one qualification which undergirds them all is “apt to teach. ” There are many fine Christians who could meet any number of the other qualifications for serving in the ministry, {{but if they are}} unable to teach, then it would be most difficult to step into the pulpit or classroom.

Before jumping into what has been happening since the conference in Louisville, I wanted to thank one more time all of the attendees and contributors for making the ELD sessions in Louisville so successful. Despite competing with another big conference for the second straight year and losing some attendees due to travel budget cuts, we again had a respectable turnout of the ELD membership. The session evaluations from Louisville were universally positive and the Lightning Talks experiment for the Get Acquainted Session was very well received. Overall, all sessions were again rated between “Good (4) ” and “Excellent (5). ” There was, of course, also constructive criticism received and passed on to this year’s Program Chair and Program Planning Committee. There is always room for improvement and the evaluations are definitely being taken into account for this year’s planning.

40|$|Background I run my {{bioinformatics}} tasks on two machines. The {{first one}} is a Tru 64 DS 20 AlphaServer, bought in 1999. This has two processors running at 512 MHz with 2 Gb of memory. The second is a custom-built Linux box, purchased in early 2005, which has 8 processors running at 2. 7 GHz and 12 Gb of memory. Although performance speed does not quite scale linearly against processor speed, this represents just over a 5 -fold increase in computing power {{over a period of}} 6 years. This kind of thing has been happening since the 1960 s, when Intel-founder Gordon Moore observed that available processing power doubles every 2 years or so. Indeed, my "fast" Linux box is already quite pedestrian compared to the 3. 8 GHz processors that are now routinely available. Under these circumstances, it is easy to become complacent about handling awkward jobs. Large, viral-genome-scale ClustalW jobs that used to run for several days on my DS 20 are now finished overnight.
