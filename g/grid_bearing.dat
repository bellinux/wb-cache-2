The latter reduces sources of {{mistakes}} and {{made it easier to}} check that the guns were correctly laid. By the late 1950s, most armies had adopted the bearing method, the notable exception being the US.|$|E
5000|$|The {{convergence}} angle γ {{at a point}} on the projection {{is defined by the}} angle measured from the projected meridian, which defines true north, to a grid line of constant x, defining grid north. Therefore γ is positive in the quadrant north of the equator and east of the central meridian and also in the quadrant south of the equator and west of the central meridian. The convergence must be added to a <b>grid</b> <b>bearing</b> to obtain a bearing from true north. For the secant transverse Mercator the convergence may be expressed either in terms of the geographical coordinates or in terms of the projection coordinates: ...|$|E
5000|$|In land navigation, {{a bearing}} is ordinarily {{calculated}} in a clockwise direction starting from a reference direction of 0° and increasing to 359.9 degrees. [...] Measured in this way, a bearing {{is referred to}} as an azimuth by the US Army but not by armies in other English speaking nations, which use the term bearing. [...] If the reference direction is north (either true north, magnetic north, or <b>grid</b> north), the <b>bearing</b> is termed an absolute bearing. In a contemporary land navigation context, true, magnetic, and <b>grid</b> <b>bearings</b> are always measured in this way, with true north, magnetic north, or grid north being 0° in a 360-degree system.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} by Morgan (1) that at the beam intensities normally used by electron microscopists, there can be appreciable distortion of small structures in tissue sections and a complete loss {{of some of these}} structures. That there is also a substantial loss of embedding material from sections is well established (2). In the present work we investigate these phenomena and decribe a technique for reducing the destructive effects of the electron beam. Materials and Methods Intact tissues were fixed in 1 per cent OsO 4 buffered in veronal-acetate either with or without the addition of sucrose. Isolated mitochondria were fixed as pellets in unbuffered 1 per cent OsO 4 for 16 hours. All preparations were dehydrated in ethyl alcohol and embedded in butyl methacrylate. A Porter-Blum microtome provided with a glass knife and collection trough containing 10 per cent acetone was used. Sections were cut to a standard thickness giving definite silver interference colors from which traces of yellow were absent. The sections were mounted in various ways described in the text on <b>grids</b> <b>bearing</b> either carbon films or carbon nets (3 - 6) ...|$|R
40|$|Grid shells with {{continuous}} elastic rods {{have the}} advantages to generate curved spaces with uniform members and joints. However, finding the boundary conditions, including the <b>grid</b> pattern and <b>bearing</b> positions, {{which lead to}} a specific geometry, {{is not an easy}} task. Designers have to keep equal grid lengths, minimise the residual forces and ensure the smoothness of geometries simultaneously. In this paper, we present a new numerical method which can derive the <b>grid</b> pattern and <b>bearing</b> positions in accordance with a desired geometry. This is done by finding the least strain energy state of the elastic grid in the solution domain defined by constraints. This method can provide architects a grid pattern that satisfies all the geometrical demands. At the same time, a structure with less strain energy is favoured by engineers. This is especially important for elastic grid shells, whose structural stability is largely affected by the residual forces...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>grid</b> <b>bearing</b> is {{measured}} {{in relation to the}} fixed horizontal reference plane of grid north, that is, using the direction northwards along the grid lines of the map projection as a reference point, while a compass bearing, as in vehicle or marine navigation, {{is measured}} in relation to the magnetic compass of the navigator's vehicle or vessel (if aboard ship). It should be very close to the magnetic bearing. The difference between a magnetic bearing and a compass bearing is the deviation caused to the compass by ferrous metals and local magnetic fields generated by any variety of vehicle or shipboard sources (steel vehicle bodies/frames or vessel hulls, ignition systems, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|In most {{applications}} the Gauss-Krüger {{is applied}} to a narrow strip near the central meridians where {{the differences between the}} spherical and ellipsoidal versions are small, but nevertheless important in accurate mapping. Direct series for scale, convergence and distortion are functions of eccentricity and both latitude and longitude on the ellipsoid: inverse series are functions of eccentricity and both x and y on the projection. In the secant version the lines of true scale on the projection are no longer parallel to central meridian; they curve slightly. The convergence angle between projected meridians and the x constant grid lines is no longer zero (except on the equator) so that a <b>grid</b> <b>bearing</b> must be corrected to obtain an azimuth from true north. The difference is small, but not negligible, particularly at high latitudes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{space charge}} grid tube {{was the first}} type of tetrode to appear. In {{the course of his}} {{research}} into the action of the [...] "audion" [...] triode tube of Lee de Forest, Irving Langmuir found that the action of the heated thermionic cathode was to create a space charge, or cloud of electrons, around the cathode. This cloud acted as a virtual cathode. With low applied anode voltage, many of the electrons in the space charge returned to the cathode, and did not contribute to the anode current; only those at its outer limit would be affected by the electric field due to the anode, and would be accelerated towards it. However, if a <b>grid</b> <b>bearing</b> a low positive applied potential (about 10V) were inserted between the cathode and the control grid, the space charge could be made to extend further away from the cathode. This had two advantageous effects, both related to the influence of the electric fields of the other electrodes (anode and control grid) on the electrons of the space charge. Firstly, a significant increase in anode current could be achieved with low anode voltage; the valve could be made to work well with lower applied anode voltage. Secondly the transconductance (rate of change of anode current with respect to control grid voltage) of the tube was increased. The latter effect was particularly important since it increased the voltage gain available from the valve.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{quantitative}} {{descriptions of}} cellular ultrastructure {{have focused on}} spatial content (volume, surface area and number of organelles and membrane domains). It is possible to complement such descriptions by also quantifying spatial arrangements. Hitherto, applications of stereological methods for achieving this (notably, estimation of covariance and pair correlation functions) have been confined to organ and tissue levels. This study explores 3 -dimensional subcellular arrangements of key organelles within acinar cells of rabbit parotid salivary glands, highly polarised epithelial cells specialised for exocrine secretion of α-amylase. It focuses on spatial arrangements of secretion product stores (zymogen granules), rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and mitochondria. Systematic random samples of electron microscopical fields of view from 3 rabbits were analysed using test <b>grids</b> <b>bearing</b> linear dipole probes of different sizes. Unbiased estimates of organelle volume densities were obtained by point counting and estimates of covariance and pair correlation functions by dipole counting. Plots of pair correlation functions against dipole length identified spatial arrangement differences between organelle types. Volumes within RER and mitochondrial compartments were positively correlated with themselves at distances below 4 μm and 2 μm respectively but were essentially randomly arranged at longer distances. In sharp contrast, zymogen granules were not randomly arranged. They were clustered at distances below 6 – 7 μm and more widely scattered at greater distances. These findings provide quantitative confirmation of the polarised arrangement of zymogen granules within acinar cells and further support for the relative invariance of biological organisation between subjects...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{advances}} in nanoparticle design have generated new possibilities for nano-biotechnology and nano-medicine. Here we used cryo-soft X-ray tomography (cryo-SXT) to collect comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) data to characterise {{the interaction of}} superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) with a breast cancer cell line. Results: We incubated MCF- 7 (a human breast cancer cell line) from 0 to 24 h with SPION (15 nm average diameter, coated with dimercaptosuccinic acid), {{a system that has}} been studied previously using various microscopy and bulk techniques. This system facilitates the validation and contextualization of the new 3 D data acquired using the cryo-SXT-based approach. After vitrification, samples tested by correlative cryo-epifluorescent microscopy showed SPION accumulation in acidic vesicles related to the endocytic pathway. Microscopy <b>grids</b> <b>bearing</b> MCF- 7 cells were then analysed by cryo-SXT to generate whole cell volume 3 D maps. Cryo-SXT is an emerging technique that benefits from high X-ray penetration into the biological material to image close-to-native vitrified cells at nanometric resolution with no chemical fixation or staining agents. This unique possibility of obtaining 3 D information from whole cells allows quantitative statistical analysis of SPION-containing vesicle (SCV) accumulation inside cells, including vesicle number and size, distances between vesicles, and their distance from the nucleus. Conclusions: Correlation between fluorescent microscopy, cryo-SXT and transmission electron microscopy allowed us to identify SCV and to generate 3 D data for statistical analysis of SPION:cell interaction. This study supports continuous transfer of the internalized SPION from the plasma membrane to an accumulation area near the cell nucleus. Statistical analysis showed SCV increase in number and size concomitant with longer incubation times, and therefore an increase in their accumulated volume within the cell. This cumulative effect expands the accumulation area and cell organelles such as mitochondria are consequently displaced to the periphery. Our 3 D cryo-SXT approach demonstrates that a comprehensive quantitative description of SPION:cell interaction is possible, which will serve as a basis for metal-based nanoparticle design and for selection of those best suited for hyperthermia treatment, drug delivery and image diagnosis in nanobiomedicine...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into soil-reinforcement interaction by means of direct shear and pull-out tests. Scale and other factors affecting test results were studied; for this purpose an apparatus able to contain a 1 cu. m sample of sand was designed by the author in order to perform large scale tests. Plastic and metal sheet and grid reinforcements were used in conjunction with Leighton Buzzard sand. Direct Shear tests on unreinforced sand samples showed that soil strength parameters were not affected by the test scale, although the post peak behaviour and the shear band thickness at the centre of the sample were significantly affected by the scale of the test. The presence of a reinforcement layer inclined to the central plane of the box had a marked effect on the strength and behaviour of the sample. The reinforcement increased the vertical stress and inhibited the shear strain development in the central region of the sample. The behaviour of the reinforced sample was found to depend on the type and form of the reinforcement as well as its mechanical properties. Pull-out test results can be severely affected by boundary conditions, in particular by the friction on the front wall of the box. The results obtained in the series of tests showed that interference between <b>grid</b> <b>bearing</b> members is the main factor conditioning the pull-out resistance of a grid reinforcement. The intensity of such interference was quantified on the basis of results obtained in tests using single isolated bearing members and grids with different geometric characteristics. An expression for the bond coefficient between soil and grid, taking into account the degree of interference, was suggested. It was also observed that the maximum bearing pressure exhibited by a bearing member depends on the ratio of the member diameter to the mean particle size...|$|E

40|$|In current {{communication}} network for distribution in Chinese power grid systems, the fiber communication backbone network for distribution and TD-LTE power private wireless backhaul network of power <b>grid</b> are both <b>bearing</b> by the SDH optical transmission network, which also carries the {{communication network}} of transformer substation and main electric.

50|$|The present {{building}} on Queen Victoria Street {{was designed by}} City of London architect Thomas Meddings, an Old Citizen of the school {{as well as a}} former Temple Church chorister. It is a wholly modern building, although some of the stained glass and sculptures from the Victoria Embankment building has been relocated to this new building. A design and technology block was added to the building in 1990, though in 2008, the block was transformed into a building mainly used by the ICT and music departments, although some design and technology facilities remain. The building was designed on a structural <b>grid</b> and non-load <b>bearing</b> walls were used so that the internal layout of the building could easily be changed when necessary. The school's design is also slightly unusual in that it was built avoiding a road tunnel in the centre of the premises. This meant that the first and second floors of the building could only be built {{on either side of the}} road tunnel. The load on the third floor directly above the road tunnel is also limited and so a courtyard, surrounded by the building, which goes up to the fifth floor, exists in that area. The current building is opened to the public annually on one weekend in September as part of the Open House London event.|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} of this thesis concerns {{the possibility of}} illuminating the presence and impact of the irrational element that is play in an ancient societal structure. With this question as a lodestar, the investigation has come to concern {{the development of an}} alternative way of work that can manage to embrace the positively loaded, ‘fun’ dimension of play. The view of fragmented archaeological remains as autonomously working unities has been of central importance for this mode of procedure. The study is based on selected game-related finds from the site of Mohenjodaro. Located in Sindh in southern Pakistan, the site constitutes the remains of the largest urban settlement of the Bronze Age Indus Valley realm (ca. 2500 - 2000 BC). One of the typical features of this realm constitutes a focus on small-sized art. Among other artefacts, numerous small objects of a supposedly game-related purpose have been found in Mohenjo-daro, such as dice and gamesmen. The study tests its way along different paths. The mode of procedure builds on a modified form of grounded theory. In this form, emphasis has been put on the concept of abduction in the version of Bateson. Stress has also been laid on Simmel’s description of the process of understanding. With this reasoning, the researcher’s self is accentuated as an integrated component in the process. The consequence of the modifications is a model {{in the shape of a}} grid – a working grid – where the different rows, internally divided up into compartments representing stages of work, constitute different, autonomously working ways. The empirical investigation is based on a critical reading of older excavational documents. Rather than aiming at a systematic division between what is game-related and what is not game-related, the reading is undertaken with the aim of seeing whether this kind of material can be studied despite the problematic appearance of the sources. Through a practical application of the working <b>grid,</b> the <b>bearing</b> capacity of the materials is tested from different angles. In the following theoretical discussion, the grid is utilized in a more theoretical manner in order to reach different aspects of play. The most successful approach builds on the discernment of autonomously working unities in the studied materials. This is based on Simmel’s division between form and content, as well as on the emphasis by Bateson on autonomously working systems. The study argues that this way of work has the potential to yield alternative, more socially embedded insights into the settlement. It attains a twofold structure in that the aim of illuminating play both offers a test of the scientific linguistic usage, as well as forms into a methodological instrument with which to reach the individual of the past...|$|R
