50|$|The {{operating}} temperature should {{not exceed the}} melting temperature of the fuel. Fuel-to-cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) has to be designed against. FCCI is eutectic melting between the fuel and the cladding; uranium, plutonium, and lanthanum (a fission product) inter-diffuse with the iron of the cladding. The alloy that forms has a low eutectic melting temperature. FCCI causes the cladding to reduce in strength and could eventually rupture. The amount of transuranic transmutation {{is limited by the}} production of plutonium from uranium. A design work-around has been proposed to have an inert matrix. Magnesium oxide has been proposed as the inert matrix. Magnesium oxide has an entire order of magnitude smaller probability of interacting with neutrons (thermal and fast) than elements like iron.The SFR is designed for management of high-level wastes and, in particular, management of plutonium and other actinides. Important safety features of the system include a long thermal response time, a large margin to coolant boiling, a primary system that operates near atmospheric pressure, and intermediate sodium system between the radioactive sodium in the primary system and the water and steam in the power plant. With innovations to reduce capital cost, such as making a modular design, removing a primary loop, integrating the pump and <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> or simply find better materials for construction, the SFR can be a viable technology for electricity generation.|$|E

However, the convergence of Vignati’s algorithm, giving the temperature difference between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> {{has not yet been}} proved. In particular, it isn’t clear, if the number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> infinitely increases, the condition of a total (perfect) heat recovery may be asymptotically approximated. This remark is relevant because the claimed anomalous efficiencies appear only in the limit of a perfect heat recovery. Considering a suitable counterexample, we prove that, in general, the residual heat discharged on the external sources does not vanish in that limit, even when the isobars exchange the same amount of heat. Therefore the violation of the second law inferred from Vignati’s calculation is merely apparent, being referred to a situation which is not (in principle) physically realisable. The essentials of the Vignati’s argument are then applied to an Ericsson cycle involving an ideal gas undergoing chemical reactions. Again, no contradiction arises with the second principle...|$|R

40|$|The results corroborate the {{findings}} of tests with the RAMONA model. With the core power reduction at scram {{and the start of}} the decay <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operation cold fluid is delivered into the prevailing upper plenum. A temperature stratification develops with distinct large temperature gradients. The onset of natural convection is mainly influenced by two effects, namely, the temperature increase on the <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> primary sides as a result of which the downward pressures are reduced, and the startup of the decay <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> which leads to a decrease of the buoyancy forces in the core. The temperatures of the upper plenum are systematically reduced as soon as the decay <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are in operation. Then mixed fluid in the hot plenum reaches the <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> inlet windows and causes an increase in the core flow rate. The primary pump coastdown curve influences the primary system thermal hydraulics only during the first thousand seconds after scram. The longer the pumps operate the more cold fluid is delivered via the core to the upper plenum. The delay of the start of the decay <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operation separates the two effects which influence the core mass flow, namely the heatup of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> as well as the formation of the stratification in the upper plenum. Increasing the power as well as the operation of only half of the available decay <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> increase the system temperatures. A permeable above core structure produces a temperature stratification along the total upper plenum, and therefore a lower temperature gradient in the region between core outlet and lower edge of the above core structure, in comparison to the impermeable design. A complete flow path blockage of the primary fluid through the <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> leads to an enhanced cooling effect of the interstitial flow and gives rise to a thermosiphon effect inside the core elements. (orig. /GL) Die Ergebnisse bestaetigen Versuche mit der RAMONA-Anlage. Mit der ploetzlichen Leistungsreduktion des Kerns und dem Beginn des Tauchkuehlerbetriebes wird kaltes Fluid ins Oberplenum eingespeist. Damit beginnt die Ausbildung einer Temperaturschichtung mit starken Temperaturgradienten im Bereich der Tauchkuehleraustrittsfenster und der Kernoberkante. Die transienten Uebergangszustaende werden hauptsaechlich von zwei Vorgaengen gepraegt: Temperaturanstieg nach Scram auf der Primaerseite der Zwischenwaermetauscher (Reduktion der Abtriebskraefte) und dem Einschaltzeitpunkt der Tauchkuehler nach Scram (Reduktion der Auftriebskraefte). Beide Vorgaenge vermindern im Naturkonvektionsbetrieb den Massendurchsatz im Kern. Die Oberplenumstemperatur wird systematisch abgekuehlt, sobald die Tauchkuehler eingeschaltet werden. Kuehleres Fluid erreicht dann die Zwischenwaermetauscher-Eintrittsfenster, was eine Erhoehung der Kerndurchstroemung bewirkt. Die Auslaufzeit der Primaerpumpen beeinflusst das thermohydraulische Geschehen im Oberplenum nur in den ersten 1000 Sekunden nach Scram. Mit zunehmender Kernleistung steigen die Systemtemperaturen an. Der Ausfall der Haelfte der verfuegbaren Tauchkuehler beeinflusst das Temperaturniveau, nicht aber die charakteristische Temperaturverteilung im Oberplenum. Die Oberplenumstemperatur wird verzoegert abgekuehlt, wenn die Tauchkuehler bis zu einer Stunde nach Scram nicht in Betrieb genommen werden koennen. Die dabei auftretende Erhoehung der Oberplenumstemperatur ist gering, weil die Speicherkapazitaeten des Oberplenums gross sind.

Sufficient instrumentation was included in the experimental setup so that liquid temperatures on each tray in the column could be monitored. Pulse disturbances in four system parameters were used to generate dynamic responses for both conventional and heat integrated distillation using the methanol-water binary system. The disturbed parameters include the liquid feed flowrate, the bottom boilup rate, the external liquid reflux rate and the intermediate condensation rate. Based on comparisons of the dynamic responses for the two systems, it is concluded that heat integrated distillation in this case is more restrained in its response to disturbances. This restraint is attributed to a moderating effect provided by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The experimental dynamic responses were compared with dynamic responses predicted by a theoretical model.

40|$|One key long-standing {{issue that}} must be {{overcome}} to fully realize the successful growth of nuclear power is to determine other benefits of nuclear energy apart from meeting the electricity demands. The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) {{will most likely be}} producing electricity and heat for the production of hydrogen and/or oil retrieval from oil sands and oil shale to help in our national pursuit of energy independence. For nuclear process heat to be utilized, <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> exchange is required to transfer heat from the NGNP to the hydrogen plant or oil recovery field in the most efficient way possible. Development of nuclear reactor - process heat technology has intensified the interest in liquid metals as heat transfer media because of their ideal transport properties. Liquid metal <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> are not new in practical applications. An important rational for considering liquid metals is the potential convective heat transfer is among the highest known. Thus explains the interest in liquid metals as coolant for <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> exchange from NGNP. For process heat it is desired that, <b>intermediate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> (IHX) transfer <b>heat</b> from the NGNP in the most efficient way possible. The production of electric power at higher efficiency via the Brayton Cycle, and hydrogen production, requires both heat at higher temperatures and high effectiveness compact <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> to transfer <b>heat</b> to either the power or process cycle. Compact <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> maximize the <b>heat</b> transfer surface area per volume of heat exchanger; this has the benefit of reducing <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> size and <b>heat</b> losses.
