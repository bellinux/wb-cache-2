40|$|Abstract. For {{cold rolling}} process, the {{theoretical}} Bland-Ford-Hill model and Hitchcock model {{are used for}} the rolling force and roll <b>flatten</b> <b>radius</b> calculation. Friction coefficient and deformation resistance are calculated with empirical regression models. From rolling force model, the recalculation model for the friction coefficient and deformation resistance can be derived. After rolling, with actual measured data, friction coefficient and deformation resistance can be recalculated, and model parameter can be got by regression method. The practical application verifies that the accuracy of rolling force calculation model is good...|$|R
50|$|For {{the initial}} start {{up of the}} reactor neutron sources were located within the core to provide {{sufficient}} neutrons to initiate the nuclear reaction. Other aspects of the design included the use of <b>flux</b> <b>flattening</b> bars to even out (to some extent) the neutron flux density across the core. If not used, the flux in the centre would be very high relative to the outer areas making control more difficult and leading to excessive central temperatures. Each fuel channel would {{have a number of}} elements stacked one upon another to form a stringer. This required the presence of a latching mechanism to allow the stack to be withdrawn and handled. This caused some problems as the nemonic springs used contained cobalt, which became irradiated giving high gamma level when removed from the reactor. Additionally, thermocouples were attached to a number of elements and needed to be removed on fuel discharge from the reactor.|$|R
50|$|For low {{electrode}} {{wear the}} electrodes are usually made of tungsten, {{which has the}} highest melting point of any metal, to handle the thermionic emission of electrons. Cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound, which gives low work function; the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application. Anodes are usually made from pure tungsten, or, when good machinability is required, lanthanum-alloyed tungsten, and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading. DC arc lamps often have a cathode with a sharp tip, {{to help keep the}} arc away from the glass and to control temperature. Flashtubes usually have a cathode with a <b>flattened</b> <b>radius,</b> to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by peak currents, which may be in excess of 1000 amperes. Electrode design is also influenced by the average power. At high levels of average power, care has to be taken to achieve sufficient cooling of the electrodes. While anode temperature is of lower importance, overheating the cathode can greatly reduce the lamp's life expectancy.|$|R
40|$|String theory {{models of}} axion monodromy {{inflation}} exhibit scalar potentials which are quadratic for small {{values of the}} inflaton field and evolve to a more complicated function for large field values. Oftentimes the large field behaviour is gentler than quadratic, lowering the tensor-to-scalar ratio. This effect, known as flattening, has been observed in the string theory context through {{the properties of the}} DBI+CS D-brane action. We revisit such flattening effects in type IIB flux compactifications with mobile D 7 -branes, with the inflaton identified with the D 7 -brane position. We observe that, with a generic choice of background <b>fluxes,</b> <b>flattening</b> effects are larger than previously observed, allowing to fit these models within current experimental bounds. In particular, we compute the cosmological observables in scenarios compatible with closed-string moduli stabilisation, finding tensor-to-scalar ratios as low as r ~ 0. 04. These are models of single field inflation in which the inflaton is much lighter than the other scalars through a mild tuning of the compactification data. Comment: 56 pages, 11 plot...|$|R
40|$|In January 1997 a large {{fleet of}} NASA and US {{military}} satellites provided {{the most complete}} observations to date {{of the changes in}} 3 ̆e 2 MeV electrons during a geomagnetic storm. Observations at geosynchronous orbit revealed a somewhat unusual two-peaked enhancement in relativistic electron fluxes [Reeves et al., 1998]. In the heart of the radiation belts at L ≈ 4, however, there was a single enhancement followed by a gradual decay. Radial profiles from the POLAR and GPS satellites revealed three distinct phases. (1) In the acceleration phase electron fluxes increased simultaneously at L ≈ 4 – 6. (2) During the passage of the cloud the radiation belts were shifted radially outward and then relaxed earthward. (3) For several days after the passage of the cloud the radial gradient of the <b>fluxes</b> <b>flattened,</b> increasing the <b>fluxes</b> at higher L-shells. These observations provide evidence that the acceleration of relativistic electrons takes place within the radiation belts and is rapid. Both magnetospheric compression and radial diffusion can cause a redistribution of electron fluxes within the magnetosphere that make the event profiles appear quite different when viewed at different L-shells...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, mechanical and economic characteristics of fast breeder reactor configurations containing an internal blanket has been performed. This design, called the parfait blanket concept, employs a layer of axial blanket fuel pellets at the core midplane in the fuel pins of the inner enrichment zone; otherwise, the design {{is the same as}} that of the conventional LMFBR's to which the parfait configuration was compared. Two significant advantages were identified for the parfait blanket concept relative to the conventional design. First, the parfait configuration has a 25 % smaller peak fast flux which reduces wrapper tube dilation by 37 % and fuel element elongation by 29 %; and second, axial and radial <b>flux</b> <b>flattening</b> contribute to a 7. 6 % reduction in the peak fuel burnup. Both characteristics significantly diminish the problems of fuel and metal swelling. Other advantages identified for a typical parfait design include: a 25 % reduction in the burnup reactivity swing, which reduces control rod requirements; a 7 % greater overpower operating margin; an increased breeding ratio, which offsets the disadvantage of a higher critical mass; and more favorable sodium voiding characteristics which counteract the disadvantage of an 8 % smaller power Doppler coefficient. All other characteristics investigated were found to differ insignificantly or slightly favor the parfait design. "January 1974. "Also issued as a Ph.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete theoretical framework for plasma turbulence and transport in tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic {{expansion in the}} ratio of the gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order-by-order in this expansion, a framework for plasma turbulence is developed. It comprises an instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of mean profiles of these quantities driven by the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a rigid body. The magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov equation for a rotating plasma and the slow (resistive) evolution of the magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q. Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade of free energy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the neoclassical corrections and the fluctuations act back upon the mean profiles through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the mean profiles are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of <b>fluxes</b> <b>flattening</b> gradients, Ohmic heating, and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally, this framework is condensed, in the low-Mach-number limit, to a concise set of equations suitable for numerical implementation. Comment: 113 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new maximum likelihood method to model the density profile of Blue Horizontal Branch and Blue Straggler stars {{and apply it to}} the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 8 (DR 8) photometric catalogue. There are a large number (20, 000) of these tracers available over an impressive 14, 000 square degrees in both Northern and Southern Galactic hemispheres, and they provide a robust measurement of the shape of the Milky Way stellar halo. After masking out stars {{in the vicinity of the}} Virgo Overdensity and the Sagittarius stream, the data are consistent with a smooth, oblate stellar halo with a density that follows a broken power-law. The best fitting model has an inner slope = 2. 3 and an outer slope = 4. 6, together with a break radius occurring at 27 kpc and a constant halo flattening (that is, ratio of minor axis to major axis) of q = 0. 6. Although a broken power-law describes the density fall-off most adequately, it is also well fit by an Einasto profile. There is no strong evidence for variations in <b>flattening</b> with <b>radius,</b> or for triaxiality of the stellar halo. Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication by MNRA...|$|R

We present Lya and UV light profiles and show they are well-fitted by Sérsic profiles, but Lya profiles show indices systematically {{lower than those of}} the UV (n approx 1 - 2 instead of > 4). This reveals a general lack of the central concentration in Lya that is ubiquitous in the UV. Photometric growth curves increase more slowly for Lya than the FUV, showing that small apertures may underestimate the EW.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship of}} the H II region luminosity function (H II LF) to the H II region size distribution and density wave triggering in grand-design spiral galaxies. We suggest that the differential nebular size distribution is described by a power law of slope ∼ − 4, with <b>flattening</b> at <b>radii</b> below ∼ 130 pc. This contrasts with the conventional exponential description, but it is physically and quantitatively consistent with the typical observed value of − 2 for the H II LF slope. We have developed an interactive code that computes spatial isochrones for the evolving loci of spiral density waves in disk galaxies. This allows comparison of the nebular spatial distribution with the spatial isochrones for simple rotation curve parameters. Our comparisons for four grand-design galaxies suggest that the corotation radius rco coincides with the outer ends of the star-forming arms. This value for rco yields the best spatial correspondence between the H II regions and the isochrones, and also appears to yield a coincidence between the Inner Lindblad Resonance with the radial onset of star formation in the arms. Thus, we suggest that isochrones offer a new, simple, and effective technique for determining rco, and thus the spiral pattern speed. However, application of the isochrones also demonstrates that evolution of the nebular population is difficult to spatially isolate in these galaxies.

In GM 1 two lamellar, one hexagonal and two cubic (aspects # 5 and 13) phases were identified, in addition to the isotropic micellar solution. In GM 1 (acetyl) two of the phases are cubic (aspects # 8 and 13), one is the fluid isotropic solution. The structure of the lamellar and the hexagonal phases are trivial. The structure of the cubic phases was determined using a combination of freeze-fracture electron microscope and X-ray scattering experiments. The three cubic phases consist of lipid micelles of type I (oil-in-water); in two of the phases (Q 225 and Q 229) the micelles are all identical and of quasi-spherical shape. Phase Q 223 was previously known to contain two types of micelles, one quasi-spherical, the other slightly <b>flattened.</b> The <b>radii</b> of the micelles determined from the dimensions of the electron density troughs were consistent with the chemical data.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on recent {{advances}} made in global gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and other microinstabilities. The nonlinear development and saturation of ITG modes and the role of E × B zonal flows are studied with a global nonlinear δf formulation that retains parallel nonlinearity and thus allows for a check of the energy conservation property as a means of verifying the quality of the numerical simulation. Due to an optimized loading technique, the conservation property is satisfied with an unprecedented quality well into the nonlinear stage. The zonal component of the perturbation evolves to a quasi-steady state with regions of ITG suppression, strongly reduced radial energy flux and steepened effective temperature profiles alternating with regions of higher ITG mode amplitudes, larger radial energy <b>flux</b> and <b>flattened</b> effective temperature profiles. A semi-Lagrangian approach free of statistical noise is proposed as an alternative to the nonlinear δf formulation. An ASDEX-Upgrade experiment with an internal transport barrier is analysed with a global gyrokinetic code that includes trapped electron dynamics.

40|$|Non-axisymmetric components, such as spirals {{and central}} bars, {{play a major}} role in shaping galactic discs. An {{important}} aspect of the disc secular evolution driven by these perturbers is the radial migration of stars. It has been suggested recently that migration can populate a thick-disc component from inner-disc stars with high vertical energies. Since this has never been demonstrated in simulations, we study in detail the effect of radial migration on the disc velocity dispersion and disc thickness, by separating simulated stars into migrators and non-migrators. We apply this method to three isolated barred Tree-SPH N-body galaxies with strong radial migration. Contrary to expectations, we find that as stellar samples migrate, on the average, their velocity dispersion change (by as much as 50 %) in such a way as to approximately match the non-migrating population at the radius at which they arrive. We show that, in fact, migrators suppress heating in parts of the disc. To confirm the validity of our findings, we also apply our technique to three cosmological re-simulations, which use a completely different simulation scheme and, remarkably, find very similar results. We believe the inability of migration to thicken discs is a fundamental property of internal disc evolution, irrespective of the migration mechanism at work. We explain this with the approximate conservation of the (average) vertical and radial actions rather than the energy. This "action mixing" can be used to constrain the migration rate in the Milky Way: estimates of the average vertical action in observations for different populations of stars should reveal <b>flattening</b> with <b>radius</b> for older groups of stars.

The results of analysis for all the initial conditions favor oblate and near spherical halo shapes for the Galaxy.

40|$|PURPOSE: Myopia {{has been}} found to be {{predominantly}} axial in nature, i. e. myopic eyes have longer than normal axial lengths, with corneal radius variations having only a small influence on the magnitude of the refractive error. In this study we assess whether a similar relationship exists for hyperopia. METHODS: Biometric data were collected on 57 subjects with either emmetropic or hyperopic refractive errors ranging in magnitude from - 0. 37 D to + 17. 25 D. Our main analysis concentrated on subjects with less than + 10 D of hyperopia (group 1, n = 53), as subjects with + 10 D of hyperopia or more (group 2, n = 4) exhibited marked differences in their biometric characteristics. RESULTS: Analysis of group 1 data revealed a significant relationship (r 2 = 0. 611, p = 0. 0001) between the degree of hyperopia and the measured axial lengths. A weak but statistically significant relationship (r 2 = 0. 128, p = 0. 009) was also found between mean corneal radius measures and mean spherical refractive errors, with the mean corneal <b>radius</b> <b>flattening</b> with increasing hyperopia. In group 2, three of the four subjects exhibited much steeper corneal characteristics than predicted from the group 1 data. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hyperopia, like myopia, is predominantly axial in nature, although the corneal radius also plays a role in determining refractive error magnitude. These results have implications for refractive surgery and visual performance in hyperopic eyes...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{structures}} such as {{groups and}} clusters of galaxies show a universal, nearly linear entropy radial profile K(r). Using deprojected 16 clusters and 12 groups from the literature, we find that K∝ r^ 0. 96 ± 0. 01, consistent with the mean power-law index (0. 9 [...] 1. 1) of previous studies. A similarly good fit is given by a τ∝ r^ 0. 72 ± 0. 01 ratio between cooling and free-fall times. Both profiles slightly <b>flatten</b> at small <b>radii,</b> as τ becomes of order unity. The entropy profile is usually attributed to self-similar shock accretion (shown to be inconsistent with the data), to non-standard heat conduction, or to turbulent heating. We argue that a dynamical mechanism is needed to sustain such a universal profile, oblivious to the temperature peak {{at the edge of}} the core and to the virial shock at the outskirts, and robust to the presence of ongoing cooling, merger, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In particular, we show that such a profile can be naturally obtained in a spiral flow, which is likely to underlie most galaxy aggregates according to the ubiquitous spiral patterns and cold fronts observed. Generalizing a two-phase spiral flow model out to the virial radius surprisingly reproduces the thermal profile. A generalized Schwarzschild criterion indicates that observed spiral patterns must involve a convective layer, which may regulate the thermal profile. Comment: ApJ (accepted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the relaxation of a smooth two [...] dimensional vortex to axisymmetry after {{the application of}} an instantaneous, weak external strain field. In this limit the disturbance decays exponentially in time {{at a rate that}} is linked to a pole of the associated linear inviscid problem (known as a Landau pole). As a model of a typical vortex distribution that can give rise to cat's eyes, here distributions are examined that have a basic Gaussian shape but whose profiles have been artificially <b>flattened</b> about some <b>radius</b> r_c. A numerical study of the Landau poles for this family of vortices shows that as r_c is varied so the decay rate of the disturbance moves smoothly between poles as the decay rates of two Landau poles cross. Cat's eyes that occur in the nonlinear evolution of a vortex lead to an axisymmetric azimuthally averaged profile with an annulus of approximately uniform vorticity, rather like the artificially flattened profiles investigated. Based on the stability of such profiles it is found that finite thickness cat's eyes can persist (i. e. the mean profile has a neutral mode) at two distinct radii, and in the limit of a thin flattened region the result that vanishingly thin cat's eyes only persist at a single radius is recovered. The decay of non [...] axisymmetric perturbations to these flattened profiles for larger times is investigated and a comparison made with the result for a Gaussian profile...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{flexible}} set of action-based distribution functions (DFs) for stellar haloes. The DFs have five free parameters, controlling {{the inner and}} outer density slope, break <b>radius,</b> <b>flattening</b> and anisotropy respectively. The DFs generate flattened stellar haloes with a rapidly varying logarithmic slope in density, as well as a spherically aligned velocity ellipsoid with a long axis that points towards the Galactic centre - all attributes possessed by the stellar halo of the Milky Way. We use our action-based distribution function to model the blue horizontal branch stars extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as stellar halo tracers in a spherical Galactic potential. As the selection function is hard to model, we fix the density law from earlier studies and solve for the anisotropy and gravitational potential parameters. Our best fit model has a velocity anisotropy that becomes more radially anisotropic on moving outwards. It changes from β≈ 0. 4 at Galactocentric radius of 15 kpc to ≈ 0. 7 at 60 kpc. This is a gentler increase than is typically found in simulations of stellar haloes built from the mutiple accretion of smaller systems. We find the potential corresponds to an almost flat rotation curve with amplitude of ≈ 200 kms^- 1 at these distances. This implies an enclosed mass of ≈ 4. 5 × 10 ^ 11 M_ within a spherical shell of radius 50 kpc.

40|$|With the {{construction}} of the VLTI (Very Large Telescope Interferometer of the European Observatory ESO for the southern hemisphere) it is now possible to make observations with resolutions of the order of milli-arc-seconds, especially in IR with AMBER instrument (Astronomical Multi Beam Recombine). These new capabilities allow us to better constrain the stellar structures such as polar jets, equatorial disks and flattened photospheres of rotating stars. Thus the estimation of stellar fundamental parameters allows to explore in detail the mechanisms of mass loss, pulsation and magnetism governing the variability and the evolution of the stars. This thesis presents the results of fast rotating stars observations carried out on the AMBER spectro-interferometer VLTI in its high & medium spectral resolutions modes. The observations were highly degraded by the optical defects of AMBER and their analysis required the development of specific digital reduction tools to reach the necessary precision for the interferometric measurements interpretation. In order to interpret those measures I developed a chromatic semi-analytical model of rapidly rotating star that allowed me to estimate, from the differential phases; the degree of <b>flattening,</b> the equatorial <b>radius,</b> the rotation velocity, the angle of inclination, the position angle of the star rotation axis in the sky, the local distribution of the effective temperature and the surface gravity of the star within the von Zeipel theorem. The results for four massive stars of spectral types B, A and F have allowed me to characterize the mechanisms discussed above and thus open some prospect for more systematic studies of similar objects, with extending later these studies to the relationship photosphere - circumstellar envelope.

40|$|We present BVI surface {{photometry}} of 31 dwarf galaxy candidates {{discovered in}} a deep image stack from the KMTNet Supernova Program of ∼ 30 square degrees centered on the nearby NGC 2784 galaxy group. Our final images have a 3 σ surface brightness detection limit of μ_V≈ 28. 5 mag arcsec^- 2. The faintest central surface brightness that we measure is μ_ 0,V = 26. 1 mag arcsec^- 2. If these candidates are at the distance of NGC 2784, then they have absolute magnitudes greater than M_V = - 9. 5 mag and effective radii larger than 170 pc. Their radial number density decreases exponentially with distance {{from the center of}} NGC 2784 until it <b>flattens</b> beyond a <b>radius</b> of 0. 5 Mpc. We interpret the baseline density level to represent the background contamination and so estimate that 22 of the 31 new candidates are dwarf members of the group. The candidate's average color, 〈 (B-V) _ 0 〉≈ 0. 7, and Sersic structural parameters are consistent with those parameters for the dwarf populations of other groups. We find that the central population of dwarfs is redder and brighter {{than the rest of the}} population. The measured faint end slope of the luminosity function, α≈- 1. 33, is steeper than that of the Local Group but consistent with published results for other groups. Such comparisons are complicated by systematic differences among different studies, but will be simpler when the KMTNet survey, which will provide homogenous data for 15 to 20 groups, is completed.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of metals {{in groups of}} galaxies holds important information about the chemical enrichment history of the Universe. Here we present radial profiles of temperature and the abundance of iron and silicon of the hot intragroup medium for a sample of 15 nearby groups of galaxies observed by Chandra, selected for their regular X-ray morphology. All but one group display a cool core, the size of which is found to correlate with the mean temperature of the group derived outside this core. When scaled to this mean temperature, the temperature profiles are remarkably similar, being analogous to those of more massive clusters at large radii but significantly flatter inwards of the temperature peak. The Fe abundance generally shows a central excess followed by a radial decline, reaching a typical value of 0. 1 solar within r_ 500, a factor of two lower than corresponding results for clusters. Si shows less systematic radial variation, on average displaying a less pronounced decline than Fe and showing evidence for a <b>flattening</b> at large <b>radii.</b> Off-centre abundance peaks are seen both for Fe and Si {{in a number of}} groups with well-resolved cores. Derived abundance ratios indicate that supernovae type Ia are responsible for 80 per cent of the Fe in the group core, but the type II contribution increases with radius and completely dominates at r_ 500. We present fitting formulae for the radial dependence of temperature and abundances, to facilitate comparison to results of numerical simulations of group formation and evolution. In a companion paper, we discuss the implications of these results for feedback and enrichment in galaxy groups. Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the first XMM-Newton {{observation}} of the highly X-ray variable, radio-quiet, Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy IRAS 13224 - 3809 obtained during the guaranteed time programme with a 64 ks exposure. The most remarkable spectral feature is a sharp drop, by a factor ~ 5, in the spectrum at 8 keV. This is a similar, but stronger, feature to that which we found in 1 H 0707 - 495. Significant flattening of the hard X-ray spectrum occurs when the source <b>flux</b> decreases. The <b>flattening</b> of the spectrum can be modelled as {{an increase in the}} column density of the absorbing material and/or its covering fraction. Below ~ 1. 5 keV the spectrum is dominated by a giant soft X-ray excess, and at around ~ 1. 2 keV there is a significant absorption feature detected, most probably due to ionized Fe L absorption. The new X-ray spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton in IRAS 13224 - 3809 support a partial covering interpretation, i. e. the presence of dense material inside the accretion-disc region partially obscuring the emission from the accretion disc. However, the sharpness of the feature, if due to photoelectric absorption, is surprising and may require an alternative explanation. One possibility which does fit the whole spectrum is that it is dominated by ionized reflection rather than absorption. The unusual spectral properties detected with XMM-Newton from Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies increase the known spectral complexity of active galactic nuclei and should further stimulate a combined theoretical and observational effort to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} physics of the innermost regions of AGN.
