40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} trade liberalization in a non-integrated industry where a <b>marketing</b> agency controls <b>the</b> supply of a necessary input {{in the production of}} a processed commodity. Trade of the processed good is restricted through a Tariff-Rate Quota (TRQ) and domestic processors operate in an imperfectly competitive industry. Under a fixed proportions technology, an increase in the minimum access commitment of the TRQ will generally lower the domestic retail price to consumers <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> agency is a profit-maximizing monopolist. Conversely, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> agency pursues some specific non-economic objectives, it is shown that increases in the minimum access commitment holding the tariff rates constant can lead to higher retail prices and thus negate the benefits of trade liberalization for consumers. ...|$|R

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of overreaction is that average returns following announcements {{of good news}} is lower than following bad news. In other words, overreaction occurs <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring adjustment in the opposite direction. As a result, outperforming assets in one period are likely to underperform in the following period. This also applies to customers' irrational purchasing habits.|$|E

40|$|Broadly speaking, the {{literature}} on <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> audit and marketing of services has developed on a separate track.

25|$|Yield {{management}} and econometrics center on detailed forecasting and mathematical optimization of marginal revenue opportunities. The opportunities arise from segmentation of consumer willingness to pay. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> {{for a particular}} good follows the simple straight line Price/Demand relationship illustrated below, a single fixed price of $50 there is enough demand to sell 50 units of inventory. This results in $2500 in revenues. However the same Price/Demand relationship yields $4000 if consumers are presented with multiple prices.|$|E

25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> declines significantly on low volatility so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E

25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends {{on the notion that}} the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as the}} liquidity spread. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E
25|$|Duration is {{a linear}} {{measure of how}} {{the price of a}} bond changes in {{response}} to interest rate changes. It is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given change in yield, and may be thought of as the elasticity of the bond's price with respect to discount rates. For example, for small interest rate changes, the duration is the approximate percentage by which the value of the bond will fall for a 1% per annum increase in market interest rate. So the market price of a 17-year bond with a duration of 7 would fall about 7% <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> interest rate (or more precisely the corresponding force of interest) increased by 1% per annum.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> {{value of the property}} declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an Ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the value of the property.|$|E

25|$|If one invests $100 in {{an inverse}} ETF {{position}} in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes to $80 {{and then to}} $60, then {{the value of the}} inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent short position will however be $100–$60=$40, and so we see that the capital gain of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the short position. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the short position is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus the investment in shorts went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. The investment in the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.|$|E

40|$|RECENT EVENTS and {{research}} findings increasingly suggest that <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> is not driven solely by news about fundamentals. There {{seem to be}} good theoretical as well as empirical reasons to believe that investor sentiment, {{also referred to as}} fads and fashions, affects stock prices. By investor sentiment we mean beliefs held by some investors that cannot be rationally justified. Such investors are sometimes referred to as noise traders. To affect prices, these less-than-rational beliefs have to be correlated across noise traders, otherwise trades based on mistaken judgments would cancel out. When investor sentiment affects the demand of enough investors, security prices diverge from fundamental values. <b>The</b> debates over <b>market</b> efficiency, exciting as they are, would not be important <b>if</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> did not affect real economic activity. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>market</b> were a sideshow, market inefficiencies would merely redistribute wealth between smart investors and noise traders.
