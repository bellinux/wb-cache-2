40|$|Visual {{communication}} {{design is}} traditionally a practice {{embedded in the}} professional context of creative service provision within the fabric of post-industrial knowledge economies. The recent emergence of the visual communication designer as researcher and practitioner in collaborative, interdisciplinary and cross-cultural research projects suggests that a reconsideration {{of the practice of}} visual communication design is important (Findeli et al 2008; Poggenpohl 2 ̆ 6 Winkler 2010). This new role of researcher and practitioner challenges the service provision model by accentuating social relations and responsible action. In this role a critical attitude (Blauvelt 2002; Fry 2009; Malpass 2012; Maze 2014) is necessary, as participation in research projects requires the negotiation of social and cultural complexities and disciplinary uncertainty (Kagan 2011; Nicolescu 2002 a; Smith 1998). This exegesis encompasses three research strands in environmental communication design. These include Indigenous-led projects that I have participated in since 2002, interdisciplinary research projects in natural resource management and <b>Drawing</b> <b>Country,</b> a self-initiated creative drawing project. In this research through design (Jonas 2012), the analysis of these strands is informed by an historical and theoretical investigation of chorography, the practice of tracing or describing a region or place (Casey 2002; Rickert 2007; Ulmer 1994). Tracing and its connection to drawing provides a way of thinking about the practice of visual communication design as a critical material, conceptual and performative act (Butler 2010; Petherbridge 2012). In this thesis I argue that critical tracing practice not only shapes innovative connections between designer, multi-disciplinary research team and community stakeholders, but also shapes a new relationship between designer and ground...|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of global {{trade in the}} post-war period is subject to various interpre-tations. Some stress the trade-promoting role of the novel features in the world economy; some insist {{on the role of}} traditional factors, such as geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity, in continuously depressing trade flows; others even argue that the importance of these traditional factors has been on the rise. To adjudicate the divergence, this article applies the gravity model to a large data set on global bilateral trade from 1950 through 2000. Although the global institutional factor does promote bilateral trade and global economic activity indeed becomes more trade-generating, the trade-depressing effects of geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity remain strong. Moreover, geographic and cultural proximity actually generates greater gravity over time that <b>draws</b> <b>countries</b> together, which may trigger fragmentation in global trade along geo-cultural lines...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to predict the {{academic}} performance of PhD students understood as publications and presentations at conferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use a multimethod approach, a quantitative web survey of PhD students and their supervisors and in-depth interviews. We surveyed all PhD students at the University of Girona (Spain) in their 4 th and 5 th year, who held either a PhD grant or a teaching position at the university. RESULTS: The explanatory variables of PhD performance are of three types: characteristics of the PhD students’ research groups understood as social networks, background variables and attitudinal characteristics. The quantitative analyses show the importance of some background and attitudinal variables like supervisor performance, having a grant, or motivation. The qualitative results show networking to be also important. Policy implications are <b>drawn</b> at <b>country</b> and university level. DISCUSSION: Policy implications are <b>drawn</b> at <b>country</b> and university level...|$|R
