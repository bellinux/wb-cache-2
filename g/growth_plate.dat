5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in <b>growth</b> <b>plate</b> vesicles {{is necessary for the}} nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} after different treatments varies and {{is based}} on several factors which include the age of the patient, the affected joint, the stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the <b>growth</b> <b>plate.</b> It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in open growth plates, usually affecting {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 15 years. The adult form commonly occurs between ages 16 to 50, although it is unclear whether these adults developed the disease after skeletal maturity or were undiagnosed as children.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} vitamin D {{metabolites}} on alkaline phosphatase [ALPase; orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase (alkaline optimum), EC 3. 1. 3. 1] activity, {{a marker of}} terminal differentiation, in chondrocyte cultures and <b>growth</b> <b>plates</b> in vivo were examined. In cultures of pelleted rabbit growth-plate chondrocytes, 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol (1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3) increased the contents of DNA and macromolecules containing uronic acid (proteoglycans). It also decreased ALPase activity with an ED 50 of less than 1 nM. Other vitamin D 3 metabolites, such as 24, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol and 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol, {{had little effect on}} these biochemical parameters. In rachitic <b>growth</b> <b>plates,</b> the uronic acid content was half that in normal <b>growth</b> <b>plates,</b> whereas ALPase activity was 2. 5 times that in normal <b>growth</b> <b>plates.</b> Administration of 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol at a low dose (0. 1 micrograms per kg of body weight) to rachitic rats increased the uronic acid content 1. 4 -fold and decreased ALPase activity by 40 %. This compound, like 24, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol (10 micrograms per kg of body weight), increased the calcium level of the blood. However, administration of 24, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol had little effect on the uronic acid and ALPase contents in <b>growth</b> <b>plates.</b> These observations suggest that 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol is a bioactive form of vitamin D that {{plays an important role in}} the control of chondrocyte terminal differentiation...|$|R

25|$|The Jak-STAT pathway is {{instrumental}} {{in the development of}} limbs, specifically in its ability to regulate bone growth through paracrine signaling of cytokines. However, mutations in this pathway have been implicated in severe forms of dwarfism: thanatophoric dysplasia (lethal) and achondroplasic dwarfism (viable). This is due to a mutation in a Fgf gene, causing a premature and constitutive activation of the Stat1 transcription factor. Chondrocyte cell division is prematurely terminated, resulting in lethal dwarfism. Rib and limb bone <b>growth</b> <b>plate</b> cells are not transcribed. Thus, the inability of the rib cage to expand prevents the newborn's breathing.|$|E

BL open and closed adolescents had greater levels of the cartilage degradation-based biomarkers 45 mer collagenase peptide of type II collagen (C 2 C-HUSA) and C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II) than adults. BL open adolescents showed decreases in C 2 CHUSA, collagen synthesis marker C-propeptide of type II procollagen (CPII), and CTXII, and adults showed increases in cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP- 2) and C 2 C-HUSA.

500|$|Residual {{complications}} of paralytic polio often occur following the initial recovery process. Muscle paresis and paralysis can sometimes result in skeletal deformities, tightening of the joints and movement disability. Once {{the muscles in}} the limb become flaccid, they may interfere with the function of other muscles. A typical manifestation of this problem is equinus foot (similar to club foot). This deformity develops when the muscles that pull the toes downward are working, but those that pull it upward are not, and the foot naturally tends to drop toward the ground. If the problem is left untreated, the Achilles tendons {{at the back of}} the foot retract and the foot cannot take on a normal position. Polio victims that develop equinus foot cannot walk properly because they cannot put their heel on the ground. A similar situation can develop if the arms become paralyzed. In some cases the growth of an affected leg is slowed by polio, while the other leg continues to grow normally. The result is that one leg is shorter than the other and the person limps and leans to one side, in turn leading to deformities of the spine (such as scoliosis). Osteoporosis and increased likelihood of bone fractures may occur. An intervention to prevent or lessen length disparity can be to perform an epiphysiodesis on the distal femoral and proximal tibial/fibular condyles, so that limb's growth is artificially stunted, and by the time of epiphyseal (<b>growth)</b> <b>plate</b> closure, the legs are more equal in length. Alternatively, a person can be fitted with custom made footwear which corrects the difference in leg lengths. Other surgery to re-balance muscular agonist/antagonist imbalances may also be helpful. [...] Extended use of braces or wheelchairs may cause compression neuropathy, as well as a loss of proper function of the veins in the legs, due to pooling of blood in paralyzed lower limbs. Complications from prolonged immobility involving the lungs, kidneys and heart include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, paralytic ileus, myocarditis and cor pulmonale.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Tibial {{dyschondroplasia}} (TD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} prevalent skeletal abnormalities in avian species; it causes economic losses and is an animal welfare problem. It has been hypothesized that the absence of vasculature in the lesion of the TD <b>growth</b> <b>plates</b> at the ends of the long bones is involved in the etiology of the disease. We evaluated the hypoxia status of normal and thiram-induced TD <b>growth</b> <b>plates</b> by immunostaining the protein adducts after pimonidazole hydrochloride administra-tion. In addition, we evaluated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α), the major regulator of the hypoxic response that is essential for chondrogenesis, and that of heat-shock proteins (Hsp) downstream from HIF- 1 α. We demonstrated that, in contrast to the normal <b>growth</b> <b>plates,</b> those afflicted by TD were hypoxic. A major increase in hypoxia was observed in the prolifera-tive, hypertrophic, and calcified zones. In the norma...|$|R
