5000|$|The Ion {{extraction}} efficiency (β) can be optimized {{by increasing the}} voltage of both repeller and acceleration. Since the <b>ionization</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> depends on the chemical nature of the sample and the energy of ionizing electrons a standard value of 70 eV is used. At low energies (around 20 eV), the interactions between the electrons and the analyte molecules do not transfer enough energy to cause ionization. At around 70 eV, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons matches the length of typical bonds in organic molecules (about 0.14 nm) and energy transfer to organic analyte molecules is maximized, leading to the strongest possible ionization and fragmentation. Under these conditions, about 1 in 1000 analyte molecules in the source are ionized. At higher energies, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons becomes smaller than the bond lengths in typical analytes; the molecules then become [...] "transparent" [...] to the electrons and ionization efficiency decreases. The effective ionizing path length (L) can be increased by using a weak magnetic field. But the most practical way to increase the sample current is to operate the ion source at higher ionizing current (Ie).|$|E

The simulations in our work are performed using the two-dimensional kinetic plasma simulation code XOOPIC.

The time-dependent configuration-interaction singles (TDCIS) method is used to quantitatively describe nonlinear ionization of Ne^ 8 + induced by coherent intense ultrashort x-ray laser pulses. The impact of the bandwidth of a chaotic ensemble of x-ray pulses on the effective two-photon <b>ionization</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> is studied within the lowest nonvanishing order of perturbation theory.
