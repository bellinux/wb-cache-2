In parts of this region the land is intensively cultivated.

25|$|The {{ridges of}} <b>end</b> <b>moraine</b> on the Luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the Elbe Valley. The heath is deeply incised {{by all the}} rivers that drain northwards to the Elbe; rivers such as the Seeve, Aue, Luhe (Ilmenau). The ridges between them are wooded and sparsely populated. Settlements are crowded {{together}} in the valleys. There is hardly any heathland left in this area, it has been largely reforested by pines.|$|E

2500|$|The Wisconsin Glacier {{covered all}} of the {{township}} from 21,000 BC to 13,000 BC. The glacier covered the top of Kittatinny Mountain. [...] End moraines exist in Stokes State Forest as well as just off County Route 565 north of the Skylands Park. Also about a mile south of Ross's Corner is an <b>end</b> <b>moraine.</b> An esker was created when the glacier retreated due to climate warming. Many ponds and lakes created. [...] Culver Lake was created at this time, as the drainage became blocked. The township is drained by two river systems. [...] The Paulinskill and the Wallkill. The Paulinskill travels in a northwesterly direction throughout the township before turning southwest. [...] Papakatkin Creek starts east of Branchville Reservoir and drains into the Wallkill River north {{of the town of}} Sussex. [...] Another creek starts near the base of Sunrise Mountain and empties into the Papakatkin Creek near Pellettown. Dry Creek starts at the Branchville Reservoir, travels south and enters into Culver's Creek in Branchville; eventually empties into the Paulinskill. There is a chain of [...] hills between Dry Creek and Papakatin Creek. [...] These hills are what separate the two river drainage systems. The drainage divide is just north of Route 206 and the goes northwest toward Branchville Reservoir. [...] Water near Route 206 or south of Route 206 drains into the Paulinskill. Water north of Route 206 drains into the Wallkill River.|$|E

Alternatively, <b>end</b> <b>moraines</b> could be recessional [...] a result of incremental back-wasting of the glacier margin and unrelated to surging.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the Mazury Lake District (north-eastern Poland) {{dates from}} 24 - 19 ka (main stadial {{of the youngest}} Vistulian glaciation). During this last glacial maximum (MIS 2) a belt with lacustrine basins was formed when the ice sheet retreated {{at the end of}} the Pomeranian phase. The ice-sheet retreat is morphologically also expressed by the occurrence of <b>end</b> <b>moraines.</b> The study area is situated in the Skaliska Basin, in the northern part of the Lake District (near the Polish/ Russian border), at the periphery of zone with <b>end</b> <b>moraines.</b> Originally the basin was an ice-dammed depression filled with melt water; the water flowed out into the developing Pregoła valley when the ice retreated and did no longer dam off the depression. The basin, which is surrounded by hill-shaped moraines, is filled now with Late Glacial and Holocene glaciolacustrine sediments.

40|$|A major {{difficulty}} in assimilating geomorphological information with ice-sheet models {{is the lack}} of a consistent methodology to systematically compare model output and field data. As an initial step in establishing a quantitative comparison methodology, automated proximity and conformity analysis (APCA) and automated flow direction analysis (AFDA) have been developed to assess the level of correspondence between modelled ice extent and ice-marginal features such as <b>end</b> <b>moraines,</b> as well as between modelled basal flow directions and palaeo-flow direction indicators, such as glacial lineations. To illustrate the potential of such an approach, an ensemble suite of 40 numerical simulations of the Fennoscandian ice sheet were compared to <b>end</b> <b>moraines</b> of the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas and to glacial lineations in northern Sweden using APCA and AFDA. Model experiments evaluated in this manner were ranked according to level of correspondence. Such an approach holds considerable promise for optimizing the parameter space and coherence of ice-flow models by automated, quantitative assessment of multiple ensemble experiments against a database of geological or glaciological evidence.
