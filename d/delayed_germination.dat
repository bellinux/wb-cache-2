50|$|One {{important}} function of most seeds is <b>delayed</b> <b>germination,</b> which allows time for dispersal and prevents germination {{of all the}} seeds at the same time. The staggering of germination safeguards some seeds and seedlings from suffering damage or death from short periods of bad weather or from transient herbivores; it also allows some seeds to germinate when competition from other plants for light and water might be less intense. Another form of delayed seed germination is seed quiescence, which is different from true seed dormancy and occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are too dry or warm or cold for germination. Many species of plants have seeds that delay germination for many months or years, and some seeds can remain in the soil seed bank for more than 50 years before germination. Some seeds have a very long viability period, and the oldest documented germinating seed was nearly 2000 years old based on radiocarbon dating.|$|E

50|$|The aerial {{flowers are}} pollinated {{by a wide}} variety of insects, but {{self-fertilisation}} occurs, and is probably the only type of fertilisation in the horizontal flowerheads. Catananche lutea has both flower heads on long erect stems (aerial) and flower heads on very short stems between or under the leaves of the basal rosette (subterranean). The subterranean flower heads contain two types of cypsela, while in the aerial flower heads three different types can be found, which are located next to the involucre, encircling the centre and at the centre of the receptacle respectively. The subterranean cypselas occur between February and April, are fewer in number, but much larger and heavier than aerial cypselas. A high proportion of the first type of subterranean cypselas germinates quickly, while in the second type germination is spread over time due to inhibition by hormones from the fruit skin. The cypselas in the aerial flower heads form from April to May and neither shows <b>delayed</b> <b>germination,</b> but the three types differ in the way they disperse. Those bordering the involucre have short and scaly pappus and are subtended by a bract, to be released with the flower head when it breaks free from the dead mother plant, resulting in dispersal over a short distance. The cypselas at the centre of the flower head however carry much longer pappus and dislodge much sooner to be carried off by the wind over larger distances. The third type of aerial cypsela has intermediate pappus and may remain in the flower head or be carried off by the wind. The subterranean cypselas spread germination over time, with one type evolved to extend the presence of this annual into the next growing season at a location of proven suitability, while the other type contributes to the soil seed bank, and so hatches against unfavorable years. The aerial cypselas on the other hand spread the progeny into new areas. Hence, Catananche lutea through its fruits shows different survival strategies by having quick and <b>delayed</b> <b>germination,</b> in situ, short distance and long distance seed dispersal, self- and cross-fertilization, as well as having some ripe seeds already early on in the growing season.|$|E

Cypselas from the aerial flowerheads germinate quickly under favorable conditions, are smaller (about 3 mm long), lighter (about 3⅓ mg), with diverging pappus scales, and come in three distinct types. The periferous cypselas are about ovate, glabrous, whitish in color and having about 3 mm long pappus scales, subtended by an involucral bract and remain in the flowerhead until it disintegrates. The central cypselas are brown, conical with the narrow end at the base, heavily wrinkled and hairy, with about 1 cm long pappus scales that end in a long bristle.

40|$|Abstract Background Imbibed seeds {{integrate}} {{environmental and}} endogenous signals to break dormancy and initiate growth under optimal conditions. Seed maturation {{plays an important}} role in determining the survival of germinating seeds, for example one of the roles of dormancy is to stagger germination to prevent mass growth under suboptimal conditions. The B 3 -domain transcription factor FUSCA 3 (FUS 3) is a master regulator of seed development and an important node in hormonal interaction networks in Arabidopsis thaliana. Its function has been mainly characterized during embryonic development, where FUS 3 is highly expressed to promote seed maturation and dormancy by regulating ABA/GA levels. Results In this study, we present evidence for a role of FUS 3 in <b>delaying</b> seed <b>germination</b> at supraoptimal temperatures that would be lethal for the developing seedlings. During seed imbibition at supraoptimal temperature, the FUS 3 promoter is reactivated and induces de novo synthesis of FUS 3 mRNA, followed by FUS 3 protein accumulation. Genetic analysis shows that FUS 3 contributes to the <b>delay</b> of seed <b>germination</b> at high temperature. Unlike WT, seeds overexpressing FUS 3 (ML 1 :FUS 3 -GFP) during imbibition are hypersensitive to high temperature and do not germinate, however, they can fully germinate after recovery at control temperature reaching 90 % seedling survival. ML 1 :FUS 3 -GFP hypersensitivity to high temperature can be partly recovered in the presence of fluridone, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, suggesting this hypersensitivity is due in part to higher ABA level in this mutant. Transcriptomic analysis shows that WT seeds imbibed at supraoptimal temperature activate seed-specific genes and ABA biosynthetic and signaling genes, while inhibiting genes that promote germination and growth, such as GA biosynthetic and signaling genes. Conclusion In this study, we have uncovered a novel function for the master regulator of seed maturation, FUS 3, in <b>delaying</b> <b>germination</b> at supraoptimal temperature. Physiologically, this is important since <b>delaying</b> <b>germination</b> has a protective role at high temperature. Transcriptomic analysis of seeds imbibed at supraoptimal temperature reveal that a complex program is in place, which involves not only the regulation of heat and dehydration response genes to adjust cellular functions, but also the activation of seed-specific programs and the inhibition of germination-promoting programs to <b>delay</b> <b>germination.</b> </p...|$|R

The trehalose content of A. fumigatus hyphae also increased after heat shock but not in response to other stressors. This increase in trehalose directly correlated {{with an increase in}} expression of tpsB but not tpsA.

40|$|Mustard seed meal is the {{material}} that remains after oil is extracted from the seeds of plants in the mustard (Brassica) family. When {{in the presence of}} water, this seed meal releases compounds that can suppress plant diseases and weeds. As a result, mustard seed meal was investigated as an alternative method for disease and weed control, in an effort to reduce synthetic pesticide usage. Further, few studies examined the use of mustard seed meal for application in the commercial greenhouse industry, which is a large consumer of synthetic chemicals. Instead, many researchers assessed the seed meal in an outdoor setting. This project bridged the gap in literature and evaluated mustard seed meal as an additive to the soilless potting medium commonly used in the greenhouse industry. In a laboratory setting, the seed meal was successful in killing two species of the plant pathogen Pythium, which commonly causes root-rotting diseases. In a greenhouse setting, the mustard seed meal prohibited Pythium from killing tomato and cucumber seedlings but also damaged the seedlings at higher application rates. These observations were investigated in another series of experiments to identify a maximum seed meal application rate.

Actinomycin-D (Act-D; 20 and 100 mu M) and alpha-amanitin (alpha-Am 20 mu M), both inhibitors of transcription, did not reduce P. pratensis germination, demonstrating that for this species, transcription is not essential for radicle protrusion and that long-lived mRNA are used for initial protein synthesis. In contrast, incised white clover seeds showed <b>delayed</b> <b>germination</b> in presence of alpha-Am, suggesting that expression of some specific genes may help in the first germination steps. Osmopriming (PEG 8, 000 60 %) improved germination of seeds exposed to 100 mu M Cd but the positive effect of this pretreatment was suppressed (T. repens) or drastically mitigated (P. pratensis) when Act-D or Cx were added to the priming medium. Cadmium reduced alpha- and beta-amylase activities in germinating seeds but osmoprimed seeds exhibited higher activities than unprimed seeds.

40|$|Summary. A {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to consider the}} interplay between dispersibility and <b>delayed</b> <b>germination</b> i desert annuals. The mod-el explores the effect of low levels of dispersal, considered realistic for annual plants, on optimal germination fraction. The model also demonstrates {{the effect of the}} amount and accuracy of "pre-dictive " (responsive to the environment) dormancy on the optimal innate germination fraction (not responsive to environmental con-ditions). Optimal germination fraction is found to be very sensitive to changes in despersibility especially at the limited dispersibilities that are realistic for annual plants. As dispersibility increases, optimal germination fraction increases. If plants make two kinds of seeds with differing despersibility, reproduction is maximized if the low dispersal seeds have <b>delayed</b> <b>germination</b> and the high dispersal seeds have quick germination. If dormancy mechanisms permit seeds to germinate when environmental conditions allow successful maturation, and remain dormant when environmental conditions do not permit successful maturation, what fraction of seeds hould remain dormant under predicted good conditions as a hedge against inaccurate prediction of the environment? If environmental cues that break dormancy are uncorrelated with enviromnental conditions that permit successful maturation, pre-dictive dormancy has little or no effect on the optimal innate germination fraction. When predictive dormancy lowers the proba-bility of germinating when environmental conditions preclude suc-cessful maturation, the optimal innate germination fraction in-creases with increasing ermination control by predictive dor-mancy. With a moderate degree of germination control by predic-tive dormancy, the optimal innate dormancy is still sensitive to changes in dispersal in the low dispersal ranges characteristic of annual plants. Evidence is presented from plant species that have both disper-sal and germination dimorphisms to support he predicted correla-tion of high germination fractions with high dispersal...|$|E
