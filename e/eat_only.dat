5|$|In Korean mythology, a tiger and a bear {{prayed to}} Hwanung, {{the son of}} the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, {{ordering}} them to <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.|$|E
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E

50|$|Hart {{directed}} the experiment, Babcock provided ideas, and George C. Humphrey oversaw {{the welfare of}} the cattle during the experiment. Elmer Verner McCollum, an organic chemist from Connecticut, was hired by Hart to analyze the grain rations and the cow feces. The experiment called for four groups of four heifer calves each, of which three groups were raised and two pregnancies were carried through. The first group <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> wheat, the second group <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> bran, the third group <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> corn, and the last group ate a mixture of the three.|$|R
5|$|The addax live {{in desert}} terrain where they eat grasses and leaves of what shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes are available. Primarily grazers, their staple foods include Aristida, Panicum, and Stipagrostis, {{and they will}} only consume browse, such as leaves of Acacia trees {{in the absence of}} these grasses. Perennials which turn green and sprout at the {{slightest}} bit of humidity or rain. The addax <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> certain parts of the plant and tend to crop the Aristida grasses neatly to the same height. By contrast, when feeding on Panicum grass, the drier outer leaves are left alone while they eat the tender, inner shoots and seeds. These seeds are important part of the addax diet, being their main source of protein.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

25|$|Ethiopian Jews were {{forbidden}} to eat the food of non-Jews. A Kahən <b>eats</b> <b>only</b> meat he has slaughtered himself, which his hosts prepare both for him and themselves.

Purification included fasting for one or more days, <b>eating</b> <b>only</b> uncooked chickpeas provided by the Kahən, and ritual purification before entering the village.|$|R

50|$|While {{dwelling}} in {{the cave}} Theodosius performed great feats of asceticism. He prayed at all times and he even suspended a rope that it might prop him up in case sleep overcame him, and thus he stood through the night in prayer. He remembered never to satisfy his hunger, but <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> enough {{so that he would}} not fall ill from extreme fasting. He <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> dates, carob, wild vegetables and legumes soaked in water. If the land was unproductive and arid he soaked the hearts of palms and <b>ate</b> them <b>only</b> from excessive need. He never tasted bread for thirty years.|$|R

25|$|Soil: Snails dig in {{soil and}} ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and {{provides}} some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have well-balanced feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> one or the other.|$|E
25|$|Haliplids live in {{the aquatic}} {{vegetation}} {{around the edges of}} small ponds, lakes, and quiet streams. Adults are omnivorous, eating insect eggs, small crustaceans, hydrozoan polyps, and algae, while the larvae <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> algae. The species of Peltodytes deposit eggs on the surface of aquatic plants, while Haliplus chews out a cavity in the plants for their eggs. There are three instars, and pupation takes place on land in a chamber constructed by the larva.|$|E
25|$|Up to 1888 it was believed, {{on account}} of the {{testimony}} of one of Elizabeth's servants during the canonization process, that Elizabeth was driven from the Wartburg in the winter of 1227 by her brother-in-law, Heinrich Raspe, who acted as regent for her son, then only five years old. About 1888 various investigators (Börner, Mielke, Wenck, E. Michael, etc.) asserted that Elizabeth left the Wartburg voluntarily. She was not able at the castle to follow Konrad's command to <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> food obtained {{in a way that was}} certainly right and proper.|$|E
50|$|In an {{experiment}} by Cohen and colleagues {{they found that}} the larva of the brown-banded cockroach when given a choice will choose a casein:glucose ratio of 15.5:84.5. The larvae that <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> casein died early in the experiment, a few larvae that <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> glucose survived past the larval stage but did not make it to adulthood. A decline in consumption of carbohydrates was seen at the time of first and second moults.|$|R

She <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> fruits, then {{she gave up}} fruits and <b>ate</b> <b>only</b> leaves, and eventually she gave up all food. The Queen fasted and prayed {{for about a month}} but Lord Ram did not appear, so eventually in despair, she jumped into the river at midnight. Just then something magical happened and Lord Ram appeared in child form in the Queen’s lap.|$|R

25|$|A {{symbol of}} the Passover holiday is matzo, an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is {{continually}} worked from mixing through baking, {{so that it is}} not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand. The Torah contains an instruction to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover. Consequently, the eating of matzo figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.|$|E
25|$|Some people <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> {{the flesh}} of animals that they believe have not been mistreated, and abstain from {{the flesh of}} animals raised in factory farms or else abstain from {{particular}} products, such as foie gras and veal. Some people also abstain from milk and its derivatives for ethical reasons, because the production of veal is a byproduct of the dairy industry. The ethical issues with intensive agriculture {{have to do with}} the concentration of animals, animal waste, and the potential for dead animals in a small space.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, <b>eat</b> <b>only</b> small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E
