Kahn in Divine Discontent: The Religious Imagination of Du Bois {{shows how}} Du Bois, in his The Souls of Black Folk, {{represents}} an exemplary text of pragmatic religious naturalism. On page 12 Kahn writes: [...] "Du Bois {{needs to be}} understood as an African American pragmatic religious naturalist. By this <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that,</b> like Du Bois the American traditional pragmatic religious naturalism, which runs through William James, George Santayana and John Dewey, seeks religion without metaphysical foundations." [...] Kahn's interpretation of religious naturalism is very broad but he relates it to specific thinkers. Du Bois's anti-metaphysical viewpoint places him in the sphere of religious naturalism as typified by William James and others.|$|E

500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{considered}} the Jim and Dwight scenes {{to be one}} of the only highlights of the episode, especially due to them being the core element to the series. She criticized Robert's role in the episode and series, calling his character [...] "a tool ... <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> in both senses", and also wrote that he was too much of an inconsistent character. She concluded that while the episode was not [...] "terrible", it was a mediocre conclusion to the Florida storyline and wrote that [...] "I've got a suspicion that the best part of Season 8 is behind us". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, writing that the only drawback for the episode was the Scranton subplot, because it [...] "turned really old, really fast", although he did compliment Lieberstein's performance in the episode.|$|E

The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>that</b> is so far from the truth that {{it makes me want to}} throw up. ...I adapted to survive my circumstance."

This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E

He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>that</b> record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. I think when you hear Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour.

It’s gonna be a fucking bomb. It’s very, very explosive! It’s a club banger. It’s a lot broader than what people would expect her to come with. The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>that</b> the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough to find yourself. There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point.
