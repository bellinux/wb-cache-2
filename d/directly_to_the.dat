5|$|In {{recreational}} diving terminology, in a {{bounce dive}} the diver descends <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maximum depth, spends {{very little time}} at maximum depth and ascends <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface, preferably at an ascent rate recommended by the decompression model used, and making any necessary decompression stops. In commercial diving a bounce dive is any surface oriented dive, in which the diver is decompressed to surface pressure {{at the end of}} the dive and does not transfer to a hyperbaric habitat where the diver lives at pressure between dives and only decompresses at the end of a tour of duty. The duration of bottom time is not relevant in this usage.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers project <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deep nuclei, {{but also}} {{give rise to}} the {{following}} pathway: mossy fibers → granule cells → parallel fibers → Purkinje cells → deep nuclei. Climbing fibers project to Purkinje cells and also send collaterals <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deep nuclei. The mossy fiber and climbing fiber inputs each carry fiber-specific information; the cerebellum also receives dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic inputs that presumably perform global modulation.|$|E

5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also}} be accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same vertical plane. This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood <b>directly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart.|$|E
