25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and <b>inbound</b> <b>calls,</b> but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|E
50|$|The calls {{managed by}} a number of Philippine call centers can be {{categorized}} into one of two types: outbound calls and <b>inbound</b> <b>calls.</b> Outbound calls include advisories, sales verification, customer services, surveys, collections and telemarketing. <b>Inbound</b> <b>calls</b> include account inquiries, verification, technical support, sales and various customer services.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{operational}} management of an <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center and planning necessary work capacities. Company BEZREKLAMKY Ltd. established its own <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center, {{as a reaction}} to the dissatisfaction with the services of an external service provider and it is necessary to properly optimize operational capacities and human resources necessary to serve 5 to 7 thousand customer callers per month. Practical part of the thesis - planning of the workforce capacity, scheduling the shifts and planning the opening hours of the <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center - works with a rather extensive theoretical platform, which brings new views of operations management <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> centre and also works with the internal and external surveys related to the functionality of newly established <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> centre. Conclusions {{made on the basis of}} the theoretical part were applied directly to the planning and operational management of the <b>inbound</b> customer <b>call</b> centre. This thesis helped applied over 25 conclusions for the studied <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> centers. The goals, which the company set out to fulfill, while planning the new department, are then partly validated via models of system dynamics and in the last section of the thesis reflects on the extent to which these goals are feasible...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{developing a}} conceptual framework and valid prepositions on the impacts of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) dimensions on call center performance. The researchers primarily used qualitative approach that involves initial qualitative interview and detailed literature reviews of academic literatures and industry reports on CRM and customer contact centers. Evidence from the extant literatures and the call center managers interviewed suggested that there exist positive relationship between CRM dimensions, perceived service quality, <b>inbound</b> first <b>call</b> resolution and caller satisfaction. Based on these findings, this study proposed {{a conceptual framework}} through which the impact of CRM on <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center performance can be measured. Given that this paper is based on qualitative approach, there is need to embark on empirical data gathering to validate the conceptual model presented. Very important in this research is that it avails academics {{the knowledge of the}} theoretical linkages that exist between CRM dimensions and <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center operations. It equally provides opportunity to the contact center management on the benefits that are inherent in measuring the impact of CRM dimensions on perceived service quality, <b>inbound</b> first <b>call</b> resolution and caller satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inbound</b> <b>call</b> center {{operations}} are challenging to manage, {{in large part}} because there is considerable uncertainty in estimates of arrival rates, which vary over time. We have developed a general purpose simulation model for <b>inbound</b> <b>call</b> center operations which supports time varying and uncertain arrival rates along with variable staffing. We outline the conceptual and technical design of the simulation model. We then define and conduct an initial experiment that uses the model to evaluate the impact of arrival rate uncertainty on call center performance. We find that arrival rate uncertainty creates significant planning challenges for managers attempting to satisfy tight performance targets, particularly one-sided performance measures. We also find that abandonment rate has a major impact on call center performance. ...|$|R
50|$|In WAS z/OS V7 the WOLA {{support for}} SMF {{was limited to}} <b>inbound</b> <b>calls</b> only.

The normal WAS z/OS SMF 120 subtype 9 record (or 120.9 in shorthand notation) was used to capture the inbound call information.|$|E
5000|$|Calls may be inbound or {{outbound}}. <b>Inbound</b> <b>calls</b> {{are made}} by consumers, for example to obtain information, report a malfunction, or ask for help.
