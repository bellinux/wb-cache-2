50|$|The {{idea that}} the coronal heating problem is solely down to some coronal heating {{mechanism}} is misleading. Firstly, the plasma filling over-dense loops is drained directly from the chromosphere. There is no coronal mechanism known that can compress coronal plasma and feed it into coronal loops at coronal altitudes. Secondly, observations of coronal upflows point to a chromospheric source of plasma. The plasma is therefore chromospheric in origin; there must be consideration of this when looking into coronal heating mechanisms. This is a chromospheric <b>energization</b> and coronal heating phenomenon possibly linked through a common mechanism.|$|E

50|$|Ananda Yoga uses asana and pranayama to awaken, experience, {{and control}} the subtle {{energies}} (prana) within oneself, especially the energies of the chakras. Its object is to use those energies to harmonize the body, uplift the mind, and above all to attune oneself {{with higher levels of}} awareness. One unique feature of this system is the use of silent affirmations while in the asanas, as a means of working more consciously with the subtle energies to achieve this attunement. Ananda Yoga is a relatively inward experience, not an athletic practice. A main goal is to prepare for deep meditation, as Hatha Yoga is considered the physical branch of Raja Yoga.Ananda Yoga also includes Paramahansa Yogananda's SRF <b>Energization</b> Exercises, which direct cosmic life force (prana) through the medulla oblongata to all parts of the body.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the solar}} system, space weather is {{influenced}} by the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind plasma. A variety of physical phenomena are associated with space weather, including geomagnetic storms and substorms, <b>energization</b> of the Van Allen radiation belts, ionospheric disturbances and scintillation of satellite-to-ground radio signals and long-range radar signals, aurora and geomagnetically induced currents at Earth's surface. Coronal mass ejections and their associated shock waves are also important drivers of space weather as they can compress the magnetosphere and trigger geomagnetic storms. Solar energetic particles (SEP), accelerated by coronal mass ejections or solar flares, are also an important driver of space weather as they can damage electronics onboard spacecraft (e.g. Galaxy 15 failure), and threaten the lives of astronauts.|$|E
40|$|After {{completing}} {{analysis on}} available literature sources {{it was found}} that for electrical energy transmission in long distances cables with polymeric extruded insulation and VSC type converters {{are becoming more and more}} popular. Also there was noticed that VSC type converters have better working principles regarding polymeric cables, but space charge trapping on insulation layer still deeply impacts values of electric field in insulation layer on steady or changing working regimes. In order to analyze main aspects of high voltage direct current cables working modes there was created a high voltage direct cable and converter station system model in MATLAB environment using parameters from NordBalt link. 12 main working modes form literature sources were simulated. Working modes consisted of: cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission, polarity reversal with energy transmission, cable <b>energization</b> without energy transmission, energy transmission turn-on after cable <b>energization,</b> cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission with 100 % greater current, cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission with 50 % higher voltage, fast cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission, cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission when cooling properties of cable are worsen, positive polarity overvoltage peak on cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission working mode, negative polarity overvoltage peak on cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission working mode, negative pole <b>energization</b> with energy transmission, warm cable <b>energization</b> with energy transmission. After completing simulations results showed the main aspects (characteristics of insulation) influencing cable insulation aging.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a study on}} effect of {{different}} <b>energization</b> on removal of NOX in diesel engine exhaust has been presented. Here we made a detailed qualitative study of effect of pulsed/ac/dc voltage energizations on the NOX treatment of using conventional wire-cylinder reactor configuration. It was observed that amongst different energizations, pulse <b>energization</b> exhibits maximum NOX removal efficiency when compared to ac and dc energizations. For a given specific energy density, wire-cylinder reactor filled with BaTiO 3 pellet gives higher NOX removal efficiency when compared to reactor without pellets under both pulse and ac <b>energization.</b> The dc <b>energization</b> does not have much impact on the removal processes.

An {{analysis of the}} dominant cross-tail current systems in this event (Mitchell et al., 1990) {{has made it possible}} to uniquely associate particle <b>energization</b> processes with the development and/or disruption of the cross-tail currents. It is found that significant ion acceleration occurs as the ions participate in serpentine cross-tail motion (Speiser, 1965), establishing the dominant plasma sheet current system just prior to onset. As this current disrupts, the magnetic field configuration dipolarizes and further ion <b>energization</b> and the bulk of the electron <b>energization</b> occurs. During dipolarization <b>energization</b> is due primarily to the inductive electric field, including betatron and Fermi acceleration processes...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} case study of {{significant}} heating (up to 8 keV) perpendicular to the geomagnetic field of outflowing oxygen ions at high altitude (12 RE) above the polar cap. The shape of the distribution functions indicates that most of the heating occurs locally (within 0. 2 – 0. 4 RE in altitude). This is a clear example of local ion <b>energization</b> at much higher altitude than usually reported. In contrast to many events at lower altitudes, it is not likely that the locally observed wave fields can cause the observed ion <b>energization.</b> Also, it is not likely that the ions have drifted from some nearby <b>energization</b> region to the point of observation. This suggests that additional fundamentally different ion <b>energization</b> mechanisms are present at high altitudes. One possibility is that the magnetic moment of the ions is not conserved, resulting in slower outflow velocities and longer time for ion <b>energization...</b>|$|E
40|$|The light {{dependent}} <b>energization</b> of the thylakoid membrane {{was analyzed}} in isolated intact spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts incubated with different concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi). Two independent methods were used: (a) {{the accumulation of}} [14 C] 5, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4 -oxazolidinedione and [14 C] methylamine; (b) the energy dependent chlorophyll fluorescence quenching. The inhibition of CO 2 fixation by superoptimal medium Pi or by adding glyceraldehyde—an inhibitor of the Calvin cycle—leads to an increased <b>energization</b> of the thylakoid membrane; however, the membrane <b>energization</b> decreases when chloroplasts are inhibited by suboptimal Pi. This specific `low phosphate' effect could be partially reversed by adding oxaloacetate, which regenerates the electron acceptor NADP+ and stimulates linear electron transport. The <b>energization</b> seen in low Pi is, however, always lower than in superoptimal Pi, even {{in the presence of}} oxaloacetate. <b>Energization</b> recovers in the presence of low amounts of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which reacts with proton channels including the coupling factor 1 ATP synthase. N,N′-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide has no effect on <b>energization</b> of chloroplasts in superoptimal Pi. These results suggest there is a specific `low phosphate' proton leak in the thylakoids, and its origin is discussed...|$|E
