Upon physical examination he was normal {{with the exception of}} a ruddy cyanosis. The morphology of his erythrocytes was also normal and there was no evidence of hemolysis. The erythrocyte 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate level was below 3 % of normal values and, as a consequence, the affinity of the cells for oxygen was increased. <b>Diphosphoglycerate</b> mutase activity was undetectable in erythrocytes as was that of <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> phosphatase. The activities of all the other erythrocyte enzymes that were tested were normal except for nomophosphoglycerate mutase which was diminished to 50 % of the normal value. The levels of reduced glutathione, ATP, fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate, and of triose phosphates were elevated, whereas those of glucose 6 -phosphate and fructose 6 -phosphate were decreased.

40|$|The {{number of}} protons {{released}} from several mammalian hemoglobins {{as a consequence}} of oxygenation is greater in the presence of low concentrations of 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate than in its absence. A mechanism for this enhancement of proton release is proposed. The basis of this mechanism is that 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate binds primarily between the protonated α-NH 2 terminal groups of the two β chains in deoxyhemoglobin. This binding will shift the ionization equilibria in favor of the protonation of the deoxyhemoglobin. Partial release of 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate upon oxygenation of the hemoglobin is then accompanied by a release of protons. The apparent enthalpy of <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> binding appears to be close to zero. The previously reported temperature dependence appears to be due entirely to the associated protonation reaction. If only a single <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> binding site is assumed, the intrinsic association constant is estimated to be 3. 9 × 105 M- 1 for deoxyhemoglobin and 1. 05 × 104 M- 1 for oxyhemoglobin at 20 °C in 0. 1 M NaCl...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the effects of Ca 2 + on AMP deaminase from human red cells. At variance with the other known modulators, Ca 2 + increased the apparent affinity for AMP without modifying the characteristic positive cooperativity of the enzyme towards the substrate. Ca 2 + sensitivity was not modified by dialysis, but dilution of the haemolysate produced an activation of the enzyme similar to that induced by Ca 2 +. Simultaneously, the Ca 2 + dependence was lost. The sensitivity to other modulators, such as ATP, <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> or phosphate, was not modified by dilution. Partial purification of the enzyme produced the same effects as haemolysate dilution.

40|$|Phosphate {{depletion}} occurring during total {{parenteral nutrition}} has been frequently reported during the part 4 years. Hypophosphatemia {{may be associated}} with confusion, hyperventilation, and neuromuscular irritability, suggesting a total body phosphate deficiency. If inorganic phosphate levels fall below 1. 0 mg %, diminished red cell glycolysis occurs with low erythrocyte levels of 2, 3 <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> and adenosine triphosphate. Lowered red cell organic phosphates are associated with increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity. If severe hypophosphatemia occurs, hemolytic anemia, which is correctible by phosphate infusion, may result. In addition, leucocyte function is impaired by low levels of serum inorganic phosphate. While recognized as a needed additive, recommended phosphate supplements vary. Different infusion regimens have been suggested over the past 4 years, based primarily on assumed daily requirements. In the 19 trauma patients described who received hyperalimentation as part of their treatment, phosphate administration was calculated retrospectively and prospectively as a function of non-protein calories infused. Four different groups were studied. Group A received no phosphate additive and quickly became severely hypophosphatemic. Group B received from one to 15 meg of potassium acid phosphate per 1, 000 K cal and developed a more gradual lowering of serum inorganic phosphate levels. Group C received 15 to 25 meg of potassium acid phosphate per 1, 000 K cal and maintained normal phosphate levels throughout the course of treatment. Group D received greater than 25 meq of potassium acid phosphate per 1, 000 K cal and gradually increased their serum inorganic phosphate levels.

While the role of leukocytes {{has been the focus}} of many studies in sepsis, the role of erythrocyte rheological alterations in this syndrome has only recently been investigated.

40|$|Anemia is a {{frequent}} complication of renal failure. As in anemias of other origin, the resulting tissular hypoxia is partially compensated by an increased production of 2, 3 <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> in red cells, and a shift {{to the right of}} the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve. Two mechanisms are implicated in this anemia: increased hemolysis, and depressed production of red cells. Decreased production of erythropoietin is probably the cause of reduced erythropoiesis, but the role of uremic intoxication has not been unequivocally excluded. In the course of chronic hemodialysis, iron deficiency anemia, and occasionally hypersplenism, develop. It is noteworthy that blood requirements in anephric patients are 2 to 3 times greater than those of nonanephric hemodialyzed patients. Accordingly, bilateral nephrectomy should be restricted to carefully selected cases. At the present time, androgens seem to be the best treatment of renal anemia.

For this reason, the general model can explain systems which previous models cannot-eg. the model of Monod, Wyman & Ghangeux cannot explain negative co-operativity, the model of Koshland cannot treat situations where quaternary conformation is observed to be coupled to ligand binding, and the model of Briehl cannot explain co-operativity when {{no change in the}} level of subunit aggregation occurs.

40|$|AbstractA {{fluorescent}} analogue of <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> (DPG), hydroxy-pyrenetrisulfonate (HPT), {{was used}} as a probe of the allosteric equilibrium of methemoglobin. Like DPG, HPT binds, one per tetramer, with a higher affinity to deoxyHb than to oxyHb. Once bound, the HPT fluorescence is quenched by energy transfer to the hemes. HPT can thus serve as a probe of the conformational state of the hemoglobin tetramer: a higher quenching indicates a stronger binding and therefore, more of the deoxy conformation. Since HPT binds to the same site as DPG, it can be displaced by DPG {{in order to determine the}} fluorescence intensity of the free HPT under the same conditions, to correct for the inner filter effect. The high spin ferric ligands, such as water and F, showed less fluorescence (more of the deoxy state) than low spin cyano-metHb. The aquo-metHb samples showed a reversion to the oxyHb conformation above pH 7, as expected due to the acid–alkaline transition forming hydroxy-metHb.

40|$|Oxyhemoglobin {{dissociation}} curves {{measure the}} most important function of red blood cells - the affinity for oxygen and its delivery to the tissues. This function may be deranged in sickle cell anemia and some other hemoglobinopathies. An automated oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve analyzer constructed dissociation curves in 55 patients with hemoglobinopathies and in 24 control subjects while maintaining constant temperature and pH. Sigmoid curves were converted to rectilinear ones using the Hill equation. Oxygen affinity of red cells was assessed by calculation of P 50 (the PO 2 at which hemoglobin is half saturated). Results revealed separation of oxyhemoglobin dissociation Hill plots according to phenotype but with wide variability. Mean oxygen affinity of fetal hemoglobin was greatest, whereas that of sickle hemoglobin was least. Other hemoglobins were intermediate. A positive correlation between decreased oxygen affinity and carboxyhemoglobin confirmed the decreased oxygen affinity of sickle hemoglobin and decreased oxygen affinity and increased <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> in red cells. Hill plots are less sensitive discriminators of oxygen affinity than traditional sigmoid dissociation curves and offer no particular advantage. Serial studies in a subset of three sickle cell anemia patients treated conservatively suggest automated oxyhemoglobin dissociation curves {{may be useful in}} assessment of effectiveness of newer therapies of sickle cell anemia after refinement of the method and studies of larger populations...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus- 31 nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy can determine the status of high energy phosphates in vivo. However, its application to human cardiac studies requires precise spatial localization without significant contamination from other tissues. Using image-selected in-vivo spectroscopy (ISIS), a technique that allows three-dimensional localization {{of the volume of}} interest, 12 subjects were studied to determine the feasibility and reproducibility of phosphorus- 31 spectroscopy of the human heart. Nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} imaging was performed using a commercial 1. 5 tesla system to define the volume of interest. Phosphorus- 31 spectra were obtained from the septum and anteroapical region of the left ventricle in 10 studies. Relative peak heights and areas were determined for high energy phosphates. The mean phosphocreatine to adenosine triphosphate ratio was 1. 33 ± 0. 19 by height analysis and 1. 23 ± 0. 27 by area analysis. Duplicate measurements in four subjects showed a reproducibility of ≤ 10 % in three of the subjects. All spectra showed significant signal contribution from the 2, 3 <b>diphosphoglycerate</b> in chamber red cells without evidence of skeletal muscle contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of imageguided phosphorus- 31 spectroscopy for human cardiac studies and indicate the potential of this technique to study metabolic disturbances in human myocardial disease...|$|E
