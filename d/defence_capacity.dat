40|$|The acanthocephalan {{parasite}} Polymorphus minutus is a manipulator of its {{intermediate host}} Gammarus roeseli, which favours its transmission {{to the final}} host, a water bird. In contaminated environments, G. roeseli {{have to cope with}} two stresses, i. e. P. minutus infection and pollutants. As P. minutus survival relies on its host’s survival, we investigated the influence of P. minutus on the antitoxic <b>defence</b> <b>capacities</b> and the energy reserves of G. roeseli females after cadmium exposure. In parallel, malondialdehyde, a toxic effect biomarker, was measured in G. roeseli females and in P. minutus. The results revealed that infected females displayed higher cell damage than uninfected ones, despite an apparent increase in reduced glutathione and metallothionein production. In fact, the increase of these antitoxic systems could be counterbalanced by carotenoid intake by the parasite, so that the overall defence system seemed less efficient in infected females than in uninfected ones. In addition, we demonstrated that cadmium induced cell damage in P. minutus, probably linked with cadmium accumulation in the parasite. Altogether, we observed a paradoxical pattern of responses suggesting that P. minutus increases cadmium toxicity in G. roeseli females although (i) it tends to increase several host antitoxic <b>defence</b> <b>capacities</b> and (ii) it bears part of the pollutant, as reflected by cell damage in the parasite...|$|R

In male-biased Populus, males often display stronger physiological adaptation than females. Interestingly, Populus and Salix, belonging to Salicaceae, display an opposite biased sex ratio, especially in nutrient-poor environmental conditions. Do female willows have a greater tolerance to nutrient deficiency than males? In this study, we investigated the growth and defensive strategies of Salix paraplesia cuttings, which were grown with high and low soil fertility for about 140 days over one growing season. Results suggest that different strategies for biomass allocation may result in sexually different <b>defence</b> <b>capacities</b> and trade-offs between growth and defence. Females are likely to adopt radical strategies, overdrawing on available resources to satisfy both growth and defence, which seems to be more like a gamble compared with males. It is also suggested that females may have an extra mechanism to compensate for the investment in growth under nutrient-poor conditions. In summary, the results may help focus restoration efforts on sex selection such that a moderate increase in female willow quantity could increase the resistance and resilience of willow populations to early sporadic desertification...|$|R

40|$|Australian Defence workers {{interact}} {{within a}} complex Defence Community that {{is predicted to}} evolve further over the near future. This chapter considers the potential of cyber capability within the Defence Community workplace evolution, {{with a view to}} how this may influence <b>Defence</b> worker <b>capacity</b> over the next few decades. In order to contextualise the future Defence Community, the first section of this chapter introduces the 'CUSSLASHEPT architecture', to account for the various Defence domains, namely the Cyber, Under Sea, Sea, Land, Air, Space, Human, Economic, Political and Temporal (time) Domains. This CUSSLASHEPT architecture forms the conceptual foreground of this chapter and, whilst this acronym and architecture may still appear complicated, it strives to simplify the complex context that future Defence workers will require the capacity to operate within. It is necessary to appreciate this CUSSLASHEPT perspective of the Defence Community in order to contemplate the two subsequent sections. The second section of the chapter highlights the potential centrality of Cyber Domain capability within the CUSSLASHEPT architecture context. The impact of Cyber Domain capability on the <b>capacity</b> of Australian <b>Defence</b> workers has increased over the past decade, documented in a suite of publications (Table 10 - 1), implemented through a network of technologies and refined through the learning by doing experiences of operations. It is contended that, as cyber capability develops further, the Cyber Domain will gain recognition as the central domain within the CUSSLASHEPT architecture. The final section outlines how these future Cyber Domain centrality developments may influence <b>Defence</b> worker <b>capacity</b> over the next few decades. In particular, it is considered that all Defence workers will require ‘cyber savvy skills’ to operate within the future CUSSLASHEPT Defence Community architecture. Also, the concept of ‘orchestration’ is considered, whereby each individual’s capacity with the various Defence Community domain instruments can be conducted for combined effects greater than the sum of the parts. Overall, the chapter concludes that cyber centrality within the CUSSLASHEPT architecture of the future Defence Community will continue to evolve, and that future <b>Defence</b> worker <b>capacity</b> must also continue to evolve to match it. ...|$|R
40|$|Coastal mangroves, {{dwelling}} at {{the interface}} between land and sea, provide {{an important contribution to}} reducing risk from coastal hazards by attenuating incident waves and by trapping and stabilizing sediments. This paper focusses on relations between vegetation densities, wave attenuation rates, sediment characteristics and sedimentation rates in mangroves. These processes were studied along two cross-shore transects through mangroves fringing estuaries in the southern Andaman region of Thailand. Volumetric vegetation densities in these mangroves were ranging up to 32 ‰, depending on the water depth. Generalized total wave attenuation rates increased from 0. 002 m− 1 in the sparsely vegetated forest fringes with Avicennia and Sonneratia species, up to 0. 012 m− 1 in the dense Rhizophora vegetation {{in the back of the}} forests. The total wave attenuation rates integrate effects of shoaling and energy losses due to various bio-physical interactions within the mangrove ecosystem. Wave attenuation in the mangroves is presumably dominated by energy losses due to vegetation drag, since wave attenuation due to bottom friction and viscous dissipation on the bare mudflats is significantly lower than those inside the mangrove vegetation. Additionally, wave attenuation in the mangroves was found to facilitate enhanced net sediment deposition and a gradual fining of the bed material. These findings corroborate the coastal defence function of mangroves by quantifying their contribution to wave attenuation and sediment trapping. The explicit linking of these properties to vegetation composition and structure facilitates modelling studies investigating the mechanisms determining the coastal <b>defence</b> <b>capacities</b> of mangrove...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the study of the {{enhanced}} cooperation mechanism in the framework of the Lisbon Treaty as it applies to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of the EU. The concept of enhanced cooperation was introduced into the EU Treaty structure by the Treaty of Amsterdam, although initially the CFSP was excluded. The Treaty of Nice extended a limited possibility of enhanced cooperation to the CFSP, while still excluding from its scope all ‘matters having military or defence implications’. The Treaty of Lisbon, {{at the same time as}} emphasising solidarity and the building of a common policy, accepts the extension of enhanced cooperation and flexibility into the defence sphere. The object of this paper, as well as outlining the ways in which enhanced cooperation has applied to the CFSP and the ways in which this will be affected by the Treaty of Lisbon, is to examine the extent to which foreign policy, security and defence lend themselves to enhanced cooperation and other forms of flexibility. The conclusion is that there is a need to distinguish between foreign policy and defence; the development of an active and credible EU foreign policy cannot readily accommodate differentiated integration as it depends for its force not primarily on either legally binding instruments or coercion but on political weight. On the other hand, military and <b>defence</b> <b>capacities</b> and initiatives are perhaps inherently differentiated.

Little splenic virus derived from SSM, arguing that they mainly induce an anti-viral state in the otherwise susceptible FRC. NK cells also limited infection, killing infected FRC and causing tissue damage.

He established close contacts with Bagrat III of Imereti, king of Imereti (western Georgia) and married in 1526 his daughter. A year later, he was crowned king of Kartli and launched a series of measures to strengthen the kingdom’s <b>defence</b> <b>capacity</b> amid the ongoing war between Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey (1514-1555). In alliance with Bagrat of Imereti, Luarsab fought both empires trying to preserve his independence and reestablish close cooperation between various Georgian polities. In 1535, Bagrat conquered a pro-Ottoman southern Georgian principality of Samtskhe, granting its province Javakheti to Kartli. The Kartlian-Imeretian alliance was soon joined by another Georgian monarch, Levan I of Kakheti. However, the 1541 invasion by the Persian shah Tahmasp I forced Levan out of a Georgian coalition, it left most of Kartli in ruins, and the capital Tbilisi garrisoned by a Persian force. The year 1545 brought another misfortune: a combined army of the Imeretian and Kartlian kings were crushed by the Ottomans at the Battle of Sokhoista and expelled from Samtskhe. From 1547 to 1554, Kartli suffered three more invasions by Tahmasp of Persia, who overran the country, but failed to force the king into submission. The Treaty of Amasya, 1555, between the Safavids and Ottomans left Georgia divided between these empires, with the east under Persian domination and the west under Turkish control. Luarsab, however, did not recognise the treaty, and continued desperate guerilla war against the Persian occupation forces virtually holding them under siege. In order to subdue the stubborn Georgian monarch, Shah Tahmasp sent Shahverdi Sultan, beglarbeg of Ganja and Karabakh, with a large army. Luarsab and his son, Simon, met the invaders at the Battle of Garisi. A heavy fight resulted in a Georgian victory, but Luarsab was mortally wounded.|$|E
