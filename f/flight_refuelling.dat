5|$|The {{original}} {{scheduled date}} {{of entry into}} service for the MRA4 was April 2003; however, development proved far more protracted than anticipated. Early on, an independent company, <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd., had been contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed, {{which resulted in the}} project being put on hold while another wing design was developed.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

25|$|The Harrow {{also served}} in a novel {{operational}} role {{at the height of}} the German night Blitz against Britain in the winter of 1940–1941. Six Harrows equipped No. 420 Flight RAF (later No. 93 Squadron RAF) which used lone Harrows to tow Long Aerial Mines (LAM) into the path of enemy bombers. The LAM had an explosive charge on the end of a long cable and the unorthodox tactic was credited with the destruction of 4–6 German bombers. The experiment was judged of poor value and the planned deployment of Douglas Havocs in the LAM role was cancelled. Nine Harrows were also used by 782 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm as transports. After <b>flight</b> <b>refuelling</b> trials, three Harrows were operated by <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Limited and refuelled Short Empire Flying Boats on transatlantic services, two from Gander, Newfoundland and one based in Foynes, Ireland. In 1940, the two aircraft based at Gander were impressed into service with the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 1949, the Meteor III, EE397, on {{loan from}} the RAF and flown by <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd (FRL) test pilot Patrick Hornidge, took off from Tarrant Rushton and, refuelled 10 times by the Lancaster tanker, {{remained}} airborne for 12 hours and 3 minutes, receiving 2,352 gallons of fuel from the tanker in ten tanker contacts and flying an overall distance of , achieving a new jet endurance record.|$|E
25|$|A prototype, K3585, {{was built}} first flying on 4 June 1935. Owing to its {{unreliable}} Tiger engines, its delivery to the RAF for testing was delayed, with the Bombay being declared {{the winner of}} the specification. The prototype was given the civil registration G-AFRX in May 1939 being used for inflight refuelling development by <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd who used it with the Short Empire flying boat. It was used in February 1940 for the world's first night refuelling experiments. It was destroyed in a German bombing raid on Ford airfield in June 1940.|$|E
50|$|The Vulcan {{was over}} its normal maximum {{take-off}} weight—each carried, {{as well as}} extra equipment like the DASH 10 and a chemical toilet, a highly experienced Air to Air Refuelling Instructor (AARI) from the Victor tanker force who would fly the Vulcan during refuelling—and fuel usage, was higher than expected. As {{a result of the}} fuel demand and problems in <b>flight</b> with <b>refuelling,</b> two of the Victors had to fly further south than planned, eating into their own reserves. At the Victor's final refuelling bracket, the sortie flew into a violent thunderstorm, during which the receiver aircraft's refuelling probe failed, forcing the provider aircraft to swap places and take back the fuel. XL189 the last Victor to refuel the Vulcan was past the last refuelling bracket before turning home. Tankers had to be sent south to refuel these Victors so they could reach Ascension. A total of 11 Victors were used to support Black Buck One: XH669, XH672, XL162, XL163, XL188, XL189, XL192, XL232, XL511, XL512 and XM717.|$|R
5000|$|The organising {{committee}} {{decided at}} the outset that transport would be a major issue and ultimately reflect on the success of the Games. The decision to locate most of the events and accommodation at the showgrounds reduced many of the issues. Car companies in Perth made cars available and volunteer drivers assisted in taking athletes and officials around Perth, particularly to Beatty Park. The biggest issue was encountered by teams from the United Kingdom that had to travel 20000 mi. A total of 57 athletes and 23 escorts travelled from the United Kingdom in a chartered Caledonian Airways plane at the cost of 18,500 pounds. [...] The long <b>flight</b> required <b>refuelling</b> in Bahrain and a stop over in Colombo, Ceylon. Health checks such as measuring legs and ankles for swelling were undertaken during the flight to Perth and back home.A major logistical effort was required to transport the 80 member team to the Showgrounds on arrival at Perth airport. Royal Perth Hospital's special coach, a Red Cross bus, private cars and a truck to carry wheelchairs were used.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 the Ministry of Defence {{signed the}} Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) {{contract}} with AirTanker {{to provide the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) with an air transport and air-to-air refuelling capability. As well as supporting the RAF, AirTanker holds a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.Following the granting of an operating licence the airline flew its first charter flight to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus for the UK Ministry of Defence in January 2013. After delays in certification, its first operational <b>refuelling</b> <b>flight</b> took place on 20 May 2013.|$|R
25|$|Born in 1961, Alan Alford {{was educated}} at King Edward VI School in Southampton, England and gained {{a degree in}} Commerce from the University of Birmingham in 1982. He became a {{qualified}} chartered accountant in 1985, while training with Arthur Young Chartered Accountants in Southampton. He pursued a career in industry, working for McCarthy & Stone plc, <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> plc, and South Staffordshire Water plc (during this time he gained an MBA from the University of Coventry). He left the latter company in 1995, and began a new career as a writer.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Cobham {{had founded}} <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd and by 1938 had used FRL's looped-hose system to refuel {{aircraft}} {{as large as}} the Short Empire flying boat Cambria from an Armstrong Whitworth AW.23. Handley Page Harrows were used in the 1939 trials to perform aerial refueling of the Empire flying boats for regular transatlantic crossings. From August 5 to October 1, 1939, sixteen crossings of the Atlantic were made by Empire flying boats, with fifteen crossings using FRL's aerial refueling system. After the sixteen crossings further trials were suspended due to the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, the jet engine consumes more fuel than its piston-engine counterparts; the fuel-hungry Welland engines imposed {{considerable}} {{limitations on the}} Meteor F.1, leading to the type being used for local interception duties only. In the post-war environment, there was considerable pressure to increase the range of interceptors {{to counter the threat}} of bombers armed with nuclear weapons. The long-term answer to this question was the in-flight refuelling; several Meteors were provided to <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Limited for trials of the newly developed probe-and-drogue refuelling techniques. This capability was not rolled out to service Meteors however, having already been supplanted by more modern interceptor aircraft at this point.|$|E
50|$|Another {{technology}} {{developed for}} the purpose of transatlantic commercial <b>flight,</b> was aerial <b>refuelling.</b> Sir Alan Cobham developed the Grappled-line looped-hose system to stimulate the possibility for long-range transoceanic commercial aircraft flights, and publicly demonstrated {{it for the first time}} in 1935. In the system the receiver aircraft trailed a steel cable which was then grappled by a line shot from the tanker. The line was then drawn back into the tanker where the receivers cable was connected to the refueling hose. The receiver could then haul back in its cable bringing the hose to it. Once the hose was connected, the tanker climbed sufficiently above the receiver aircraft to allow the fuel to flow under gravity.|$|R
50|$|On 6 June 2007, it was {{announced}} that Mokbel had been arrested in a café in Athens. At the time of his arrest, his appearance had changed significantly from when he went missing. Wearing a brown stuff wig and having grown a beard, Mokbel was found carrying a fake Australian passport and driver's licence in the name of Stephen Papas. Tony Mokbel was finally extradited back to Melbourne (and Barwon Prison) on 17 May 2008, from Athens via a heavily guarded, private charter plane. His <b>flight</b> path included <b>refuelling</b> in the Maldives and Port Hedland, before landing at Tullamarine. He was then flown in a police helicopter to Barwon Prison. He appeared via video link to the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 20 May 2008.|$|R
50|$|More routine {{strategic}} airlift transport tasks {{are carried out}} by the Airbus A330 MRTT, known as the Voyager in RAF service. The first Voyager arrived in the UK for testing at MoD Boscombe Down in April 2011, and entered service in April 2012. The Voyager received approval from the MoD on 16 May 2013 to begin air-to-air <b>refuelling</b> <b>flights</b> and made its first operational tanker flight on 20 May 2013 as part of a training sortie with Tornado GR4s. By 21 May 2013, the Voyager fleet had carried over 50,000 passengers and carried over 3,000 tons of cargo. A total of 14 Voyagers are due to form the fleet, with 9 allocated to sole RAF use. As the Voyagers lack a refueling boom, the RAF has requested a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the USAF allowing the UK access to tankers equipped with refueling booms for its Boeing RC-135W Airseeker SIGINT aircraft.|$|R
25|$|In October 1996, a {{contract}} {{had been placed}} with FBS, a company formed between <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Aviation, Bristows Helicopters Ltd and SERCo. This 15-year contract not only covered the engineering and supply aspects already in place, but also included the provision of the 35 Squirrel and Griffin helicopters for the Defence Helicopter Flying School at Shawbury. In practice, FBS now sub-contracts {{the support of the}} DHFS and RAF Shawbury to FB Heli Services (formerly FR Aviation Services) thus maintaining the partnership between the company and RAF Shawbury forged over the 5 years previous to that contract. Also included in the contract was the provision of 40% of the helicopter instructors, operations-support staff and flight-systems operators in the Central Air Traffic Control School.|$|E
25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck handling systems to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
25|$|Royal Air Force officer Richard Atcherley had {{observed}} the dangerous aerial-refueling techniques in use at barnstorming {{events in the}} US and determined to create a workable system. While posted to the Middle East he developed and patented his 'crossover' system in 1934, in which the tanker trailed a large hooked line that would reel in a similar dropped line from the receiver, allowing the refueling to commence. In 1934, Cobham sold off the airline Cobham Air Routes Ltd to Olley Air Service {{and turned to the}} development of inflight refueling, founding the company <b>Flight</b> <b>Refuelling</b> Ltd. Atcherly's system was bought up by Cobham's company, and with some refinement and continuous improvement through the late '30s, it became the first practical refueling system.|$|E
50|$|The world's first {{duty-free}} shop was established at Shannon Airport in Ireland by Brendan O'Regan in 1947 {{and is still}} open to this day. Designed to provide a service for Trans-Atlantic airline passengers typically travelling between Europe and North America whose <b>flights</b> stopped for <b>refuelling</b> on both outbound and inbound legs of their journeys, it was an immediate success and has been copied worldwide. Duty-free shopping was in its infancy when two American entrepreneurs, Charles Feeney and Robert Warren Miller, created what is now Duty Free Shoppers (DFS) on 7 November 1960. DFS started operations in Hong Kong and spread to Europe and other places around the globe. Securing the exclusive concession for duty-free sales in Hawaii in the early-1960s created a business breakthrough for DFS, and the company was positioned to focus on emerging Japanese travellers. DFS continued to innovate, expanding into off-airport duty-free stores and large downtown Galleria stores and grew to become the world’s largest travel retailer. In 1996, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired the interests of Feeney and two other shareholders and today jointly owns DFS with Miller.|$|R
