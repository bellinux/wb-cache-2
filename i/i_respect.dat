5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E
5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E

25|$|But {{the reality}} is, <b>I</b> <b>respect,</b> you know, {{the opinion of}} Catholic — (off mike) — {{religious}} leaders of all kinds. Religion {{is very important to}} me, it's {{a very important part of}} my life. But ultimately, as a — (off mike) — I’ve been in public life most of my life and taken oaths of office to enforce the law, I’ve got to make the decisions that I think are the right ones in a country like ours.|$|E

[...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> her power and <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> her.

500|$|Wenger's {{relations}} {{with his fellow}} football managers and officials {{have not always been}} genial. In a joint-interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, he explained that his reluctance to trust other managers had been mistaken for discourtesy: [...] "There are managers <b>I</b> <b>respect,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> what they do, but you cannot be completely friendly and open up". He is well known for his rivalry with former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson; beginning in 1997, the dispute reached its culmination in the [...] "Pizzagate" [...] incident at Old Trafford in October 2004. After Manchester United ended Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten Premier League run after being awarded a dubious penalty, a member of the Arsenal squad allegedly threw a pizza at the opposition in the tunnel. Wenger accused United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of being [...] "a cheat" [...] in a post-match television interview, and was reprimanded with a £15,000 fine by the Football Association. Both managers later agreed to tone down their words, in an attempt to defuse the rivalry. In his autobiography, Ferguson wrote that the events of [...] "Pizzagate" [...] had [...] "scrambled Arsène's brain" [...] and caused their relationship to break down for almost five years. By 2009, Wenger noted his rivalry with Ferguson had become [...] "respectful" [...] as Arsenal had ceased competing with Manchester United for major honours.|$|E

[...] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance, to Country and Western; there's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front, beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and pennywhistles. Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's a hard worker and she expects everybody else to work as hard or harder. <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> that." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Cosmopolitan, Larter [...] "mused" [...] {{on the state of}} her life, [...] "I work on a TV show I love, I have the opportunity to do movies with actors <b>I</b> <b>respect,</b> and I'm in love with the man I want {{to spend the rest of}} my life with, who pushes me and excites me.... There's this fighter in me that kind of needs to be put to rest a little bit. I don't need to be so tough to protect myself." [...] While speaking to Vanity Fair at the premiere of her film Obsessed, Larter spoke about her own obsessions, [...] "I love to cook. I spend weekends reading cookbooks—it's really my relaxation." [...] She has ranked Scarface, The Bourne Identity, Best in Show, Blue Sky and Grey Gardens as her favorite films.|$|E

500|$|Before its release, the Catholic League's {{president}} William Anthony Donohue {{criticized the}} music video for its portrayal of Gaga as Mary Magdalene. He spoke exclusively to HollywoodLife.com about Gaga's focus on Judas and Mary Magdalene, calling her [...] "increasingly irrelevant" [...] compared {{to people with}} [...] "real talent", and attacked her for seemingly purposefully debuting the song and video close to Holy Week and Easter. Gaga noted {{in an interview with}} E! that the video was not meant to cause controversy in any way, jokingly adding [...] "the only controversial thing about this video is that I'm wearing Christian Lacroix and Chanel in the same frame. This video is not meant to be an attack on religion. <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> and love everyone's beliefs. I'm a religious and spiritual person who's obsessed with religious art. I'm obsessed with it." [...] After its release, the Catholic League released a further statement stating: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M. When asked why the song paid {{a tribute to}} R.E.M.'s lead singer, Michael Stipe, Chris Martin said: [...] "I've lost all respect for fame, but I haven't lost all respect for respect. So the one great thing about being famous is that I get to meet people who <b>I</b> <b>respect.</b> Our relationship is akin to a dog and its master. I'll always look up to him." [...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E
500|$|Actor Gabriel Luna {{said that}} Robbie Reyes chose {{to work with}} Daisy Johnson after the last episode because [...] "I respect her power and <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> her. I {{understand}} that she’s going {{in the same direction}} I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." [...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else. Now ... Gabe voices her very fear".|$|E

500|$|Martin {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fifth win of the season, and his first at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, in front of 101,000 who attended the race. Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he just stopped {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ... We still have the lotto at Talladega , and [...] think we'll run OK at Martinsville.

[...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, you need to make sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack. I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E
500|$|Following her announcement, Rice's {{critique}} of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: [...] "I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> that {{there are all kinds of}} denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now." [...] In response to the question, [...] "how do you follow Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a Facebook post that she was a secular humanist. [...] On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a Facebook post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.|$|E

When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who <b>I</b> <b>respect</b> like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
