25|$|The {{external}} appearance and equipment of the VAM Pacer {{consisted of a}} full bright molding package (wheel lips, top edges of the hood and fenders, window surrounds, rocker panels), bright rear panel between the taillights and the rear licence plate housing, protective side moldings, front and rear bumper guards, bumper nerfing strips, five-mile-per-hour bumpers with recovering shocks (only VAM car with this characteristic along with the Matador-based Classic line), five-spoke in-house VAM wheels, trim rings and full cover volcano center caps on the wheels, ER78x14 radial tires, driver's side manual remote mirror, radio antenna on the passenger's side fender, squared VAM logo emblems on the fenders, Pacer emblems on the fenders and bright rear panel and a two-step <b>hood</b> <b>latch.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 1972 {{model year}} VAM models {{incorporated}} the same engineering revisions and upgrades of the U.S. market AMC-built counterparts. Engines {{were the same}} as the year before with a one-barrel 145hp 232 as standard on the sedans and automatic wagon and the two-barrel 155hp version for the manual wagon. All featured a front sway bar as standard equipment. The 1972 models also included a new plastic grille with a revised <b>hood</b> <b>latch,</b> along with a new tail light design with larger backup lights, a new optional wheel cover design, a third AM radio model (shared with the VAM Javelin), and new interior door panels with a wood imitation rectangular portion. This was also {{the first year of the}} seatbelt warning buzzer located above the light and wiper knobs. The Camioneta Rambler American featured the Chrysler-built TorqueFlite A904 automatic transmission, replacing the previous Borg-Warner [...] "Shift-Command" [...] units.|$|E
2500|$|The rising {{commercial}} {{success of the}} Rally package made VAM ascend it to a trim level for 1972 and with that several improvements followed. The safety mechanism connecting the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued, which meant the incorporation of a small safety lever {{on the side of}} the column to keep the ignition switch from accidentally turning into lock position with the vehicle in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC's new three-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central cylindrical button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the transmission tunnel. The round floor shift base shared with 1968-1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger backup light and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> appeared. Mechanically, the front sway bar was passed on to the standard equipment list, but the biggest change of the year was present under the hood. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM 252 six producing [...] at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio, with a high-flow Carter RBS-PV1 single-barrel carburetor and the 266 degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969-1970 VAM Javelins. Due to this, the [...] "232 SIX" [...] emblems were removed in favor of new [...] "252" [...] units.|$|E

5000|$|The early Tuxedo Park {{models were}} trim lines {{designed}} to make the CJ [...] "more comfortable and appealing to the general public." [...] However, the Tuxedo Park Mark IV was claimed as a separate model than the other CJ series (marked in 1965 as the [...] "Universal"), with more differences than past models. The Tuxedo Park Mark IV {{was an attempt to}} crack the mass market; it was, according to Jeep, “a new idea in sports cars ... the sportiest, most FUNctional car on the automotive scene." [...] It added to the standard CJ chrome plated bumpers, <b>hood</b> <b>latches,</b> gas cap, mirror, and tail lamp trim. Two wheelbases, 81 in and 101 in, were available, with a variety of convertible top and seat colors, and front bucket seats upholstered in [...] "pleated British calf grain vinyl". Sales of this model, introduced in 1965, were low.|$|R
5000|$|Over Booth's {{objections}} that a {{move from}} light car production would weaken the {{market share of}} the Scripps-Booth Company, company directors began to approve the additions of larger and larger models to its product lines. Angered by this turn of events, Booth tendered his resignation to the company {{in the autumn of}} 1916, just as Scripps-Booth began to experience a severe drop in sales. At the end of 1917, the company was absorbed by Chevrolet and in the following year, when Chevrolet was acquired by General Motors, Scripps-Booth became a part of the General Motors family. The line was discontinued altogether in 1922. In 1923, Booth began to design his ultimate driving machine, the [...] "Da Vinci". This compact car featured an underslung worm drive axle which allowed for a flat nineteen inch floor (much lower than any other car on the market), cable-controlled <b>hood</b> <b>latches,</b> hanging brake and clutch pedals, and a parking brake in the transmission. Having no interest in manufacturing the car on his own, Booth attempted to sell his novel design to established automakers. He was understandably horrified, then, when Stutz produced a car with a similar underslung drive a year after he had shown the firm the [...] "Da Vinci" [...] plans. A costly patent infringement suit ensued, which Booth eventually won in 1935. By then, however, Stutz was ailing financially and the judgement that Booth received barely covered his own legal expenses. After this disconcerting ordeal, Booth produced just one other vehicle—the [...] "Da Vinci Pup", a small, sleek cyclecar—and that solely for his own pleasure.|$|R
50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a hood may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden hood opening on the road. The hood release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> handle, hood release cable and <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> assembly. The <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> handle the hood panel pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. A hood may sometimes contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. Hoods are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|E

Up to this point, the engine {{incorporated}} a 'dogbone' upper front engine mount secured to the cowling of the vehicle's <b>hood</b> <b>latch,</b> aiding in controlling the vibration. Further improvements in later years included new pistons, rods, crankshaft, and an in-pan oiling system.

2500|$|The Torino Cobra {{remained}} the no-nonsense pure performance model, {{and had a}} lower level of trim than the Torino GT.

5000|$|In 1991, a [...] 4.9-liter V8—the {{largest of}} this type—became the new {{standard}} powerplant. Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last years egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings. The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself—a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to Mercedes-Benz). The secondary <b>hood</b> release <b>latch</b> {{was at the bottom}} of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, twilight sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first [...] "Deville Touring Sedan" [...] became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year, it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature [...] "TOURING SEDAN" [...] lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe. Approximately 75 of these 1991 models remain roadworthy as of December 31, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} safety {{improvements}} {{were made in}} order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front <b>hood</b> <b>latch,</b> collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with pictographs. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat.
