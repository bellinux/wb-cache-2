5|$|On March 12, Ashbrook {{submitted}} {{a report on}} behalf of his committee recommending passage of the bill once it had been amended to reduce the authorized mintage from 200,000 to 100,000 and to add a statement that the United States <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be responsible for the cost of the dies.|$|E
50|$|It {{is argued}} that a fixed tax can save on tax {{compliance}} costs and improves privacy. Unlike proportional taxes, a fixed tax does not necessitate public insight, i.e. <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> need to know individual income, wealth, or consumption.|$|R

The investigation was closed {{on the grounds that the}} perpetrators of the atrocity were already dead, and since the Russian <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> classify the dead as victims of the Great Purge, formal posthumous rehabilitation was deemed inapplicable.|$|E
5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{plan was}} drafted in 2002 by Dr Barbara Vernon Dr Tracy Reibel, and Dr Sally Tracy {{as representatives of}} the Maternity Coalition.

5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British <b>Government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise of communal violence and communist movements.|$|E
50|$|Arriaga deplored the circumstances, {{going so}} far as to announcing his intent to resign unless a {{coalition}} or non-party government could be installed that resolved the outstanding issues of amnesty and separation of church and state. But, subsequent <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> resolve the issue immediately; on February 22, 1914 an amnesty was conceded for those not accused of violent actions, and eleven leaders of subversive groups were released, but the Law of Separation remained unrevised.|$|R

5|$|Smith said he {{understood}} this would irk the British, but {{insisted that he}} and his government were no longer willing to wait. He had repeatedly offered to respect the judgement of an impartial arbitration team, he reminded Johnston, but the British had shot this idea down each time. He therefore felt compelled to follow the advice given by his own legal team, which was that the appointment was legitimate. His <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accept a lesser appointment in Lisbon than in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques. He dismissed Johnston's threat to expel the Rhodesian representatives in West Germany, Japan and America; relations with Portugal and South Africa were far more important, he said, as they were Rhodesia's two closest neighbours geographically.|$|E
5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of pure copper and were {{about the size of}} a half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were legal tender there, but copper coins were not; the federal <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> redeem them or take them in payment of taxes.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa {{held his}} {{position}} until 13 December 1981, when General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law in Poland. Wałęsa {{and many other}} Solidarity leaders and activists were arrested; he was incarcerated for 11 months until 14 November 1982 at Chylice, Otwock, and Arłamów; eastern towns near the Soviet border. On 8 October 1982 Solidarity was outlawed. In 1983 Wałęsa applied {{to return to the}} Gdańsk Shipyard as an electrician. The same year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He was unable to accept it himself, fearing Poland's <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> let him back into the country. His wife Danuta accepted the prize on his behalf.|$|E
25|$|He led DESTO's {{project in}} {{classified}} black projects {{to compete with}} missile gap with India, after the country test firing the short-range missile.

In 1990, he completed his tenure and eventually retired from the military, ending his 40-year long military service.|$|R

5|$|Without the {{enactment}} of an appropriations bill, the state <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have funds to operate, and the Democrats assumed that Morton {{would be forced to}} call a special session and recall the Republicans. The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor, but Morton was aware of their plans. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans. Morton's move to subvert the state legislature was successful; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow, Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state's debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts.|$|E
5|$|Zahir's {{father and}} {{grandfather}} had both served as the multazim (chief tax collector) of Tiberias, having been appointed by the Druze emirs (princes) of the Ma'an dynasty which governed the region from their headquarters in Mount Lebanon. In 1698, Umar az-Zaydani was appointed multazim of the Safad region by Bashir Shihab I, the Sunni Qaisi emir who succeeded the Ma'ans as governor of the Mount Lebanon Emirate. The Zaydani family maintained commercial trade relations extending from Galilee to Aleppo and controlled tax farms in Galilee; Zahir's uncle Ali, for instance, held the tax farm of al-Damun. Zahir's elder brother Sa'd became {{the head of the}} family when their father died in 1706, but the family's tax farms were transferred to Zahir, who was still a teenager. This was done as a precautionary measure, so that {{in the event of a}} default in tax payments, the Ottoman <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to hold the practical owners of the tax farms accountable. Nonetheless, legal ownership of the Zaydani tax farms gave Zahir considerable power within his clan.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, a tax {{was placed}} on land owned by the proprietors. In {{exchange}} for collecting the tax, the government promised to abandon its attempts to enforce the payment of quitrents. In 1836, a bill was passed to place a penal tax on unoccupied land. Although the Colonial Office initially refused to recommend Royal Assent, comments by Lord Durham led the Privy Council to give Royal Assent to the bill in 1838. Despite the change in property arrangements in Prince Edward Island {{with the introduction of}} these taxes, tenants were still unable to take possession of their land. In 1830, Roman Catholics were given the vote, and in 1838 the Escheat Party won a large majority in the General Assembly. Another bill to implement escheat passed the lower house, but was rejected by the Legislative Council. The leader of the Escheat Party, William Cooper, travelled to London to meet the Colonial Secretary, but he was turned away without a meeting. Instead, the Secretary advised the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island that the <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> recommend assent to any bill advocating escheat. The Escheat Movement disintegrated.|$|E

5000|$|In {{some states}} where land owned by colleges and {{universities}} {{is not subject to}} local property taxes, the state government reimburses the local governments for part of the tax revenue that the local <b>government</b> <b>would</b> otherwise have collected.

5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal <b>government</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E

The Dawes Act of 1887 authorized the dismantling of collectively held tribal lands into individual allotments and signaled an intention to open {{the whole of the}} Unassigned Lands to parcelization and allocation to private landholders. Whereas commonly held tribal lands were unlikely to be leased out to white settlers, the Dawes Act with its individually owned parcels ranging from 60 to 320 acres created a situation in which individuals could be persuaded to make transactions that tribal <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b>|$|R
