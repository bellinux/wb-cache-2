40|$|Abstract. Reform offers {{economic}} <b>gains</b> for <b>society</b> at large, but {{can represent}} {{a threat to}} the interests of public employees. Public sector reform faces opposition from voters employed in public sector. Norwegian data allow for an analysis this interpretation. Survey data show that public employees prefer less reform {{than the rest of the}} population. The voting behavior of public employees is more sensitive to reform than is that of other voters (the swing voter hypothesis), and hence: shares of public employees in a local jurisdiction have a negative impact on the probability of reform. 1...|$|R

Over the period of analysis, 1980 - 2003, the loss in consumer surplus exceeded the gain in producer surplus plus the gain in government revenue. Therefore, the interventions resulted in a deadweight welfare loss for society. In contrast, in the policy of liberalization, the gain in consumer surplus and in government revenue {{is larger than the}} loss in producer surplus, producing a net welfare <b>gain</b> to <b>society...</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{economic}} theory typically points to social gains from competition as {{a rationale for}} the use of markets. Thus, Smith described the “invisible hand,” whereby the mechanism of the market converts individuals’ self-interested activity into <b>gains</b> for <b>society.</b> This insight is formalized in the First Theorem of Welfare Economics. However, economic theory also points to market failures, including the underprovision of public goods by markets and the failure of self-interested individuals to internalize externalities. Because of these factors, purely self-interested behaviour often detracts from the common good.|$|R

Competitive capitalism to Lippmann is inefficient and wasteful, an outdated system in the modern world.

For Lippmann, the trend towards conglomeration and trusts is a rational and scientific step towards greater efficiency. Where private excess in trusts failed, he asserts that management and government control of [...] "large-scale" [...] industries can yield huge <b>gains</b> for <b>society.</b>|$|R
