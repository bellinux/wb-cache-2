40|$|This paper {{develops}} a cross-market version of <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> models. It is shown that exact <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> holds across two submarkets {{with respect to}} their "common factors" if and only if the unique pricing operator for the first submarket is equal to that for the other submarket with probability 1. We define an APT measure as the squared distance between the two pricing operators. Then, testing whether this measure is zero is equivalent to testing exact <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> across the two submarkets. Since the estimation of this measure does not require parameterizing and extracting the underlying factors, one can test <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> models without knowing any factors. In addition, we present a randomization procedure so that one can use it to conduct a more comprehensive investigation on the empirical robustness of <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> models.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two simple questions {{relating to}} the Heckscher–Ohlin model: (i) How does factor growth affect the terms of trade between the North and the South? (ii) If <b>factor</b> <b>prices</b> are equalized by trade, at what levels are they equalized? Regardless of where it occurs, labor growth improves the terms of trade of the capital-abundant region, whereas capital growth has the opposite effect.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the factor content of trade {{can be used as}} an {{indicator}} of the effects of trade on the relative <b>prices</b> of <b>factors.</b> The argument notes first that, under fairly general conditions, a trading equilibrium has the same <b>factor</b> <b>prices</b> as an equivalent autarky equilibrium that can be constructed by changing factor endowments by the amounts of the factor content of trade. Thus <b>factor</b> <b>prices</b> in two trading equilibria can be compared by comparing instead their two equivalent autarky equilibria. Since <b>factor</b> <b>prices</b> in autarky are related to factor endowments, it follows that <b>factor</b> <b>prices</b> with trade are related to its factor content.

40|$|These notes discuss {{three aspects}} of dynamic <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> (i. e., APT) models. The {{first one is}} that diversifiable {{idiosyncratic}} risk is unpredictable in a no-arbitrage world.

The third topic concerns the estimation of dynamic <b>factor</b> <b>pricing</b> models in large cross-sections when returns follow an unconditional factor structure.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{argues that}} {{technical}} {{change in the}} East Asian countries was sector-specific, {{took the form of}} learning-by-doing and was induced by relative <b>factor</b> <b>prices.</b> Usual growth accounting exercises do not account for this {{in the structure of the}} assumed aggregate production function and therefore miss these technical gains. Assumed or estimated elasticities of substitution are too high in these studies. Calculations of elasticities using <b>factor</b> <b>prices</b> are more consistent with localized technical gains in Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. I find evidence that the technical change may have been induced by policy and macroeconomic shocks affecting relative <b>factor</b> <b>prices.</b> Plant-level TFP growth calculations using the Korean Industrial Census further support the hypothesis offered here...|$|R

50|$|<b>Factor</b> <b>price</b> {{equalization}} is {{an economic}} theory, by Paul A. Samuelson (1948), which states that the prices of identical factors of production, such as the wage rate, or the rent of capital, will be equalized across countries {{as a result of}} international trade in commodities. The theorem assumes that there are two goods and two factors of production, for example capital and labour. Other key assumptions of the theorem are that each country faces the same commodity prices, because of free trade in commodities, uses the same technology for production, and produces both goods. Crucially these assumptions result in factor prices being equalized across countries without the need for factor mobility, such as migration of labor or capital flows.|$|E
50|$|Another {{corollary}} of the H-O theorem is Samuelson's <b>factor</b> <b>price</b> equalisation theorem {{which states}} that as trade between countries tends to equalise their product prices, it tends also to equalise the prices paid to their factors of production. Those theories have sometimes been taken to mean that trade between an industrialised country and a developing country would lower the wages of the unskilled in the industrialised country. (But, as noted below, that conclusion depends upon the unlikely assumption that productivity is {{the same in the}} two countries). Large numbers of learned papers have been produced in attempts to elaborate on the H-O and Stolper-Samuelson theorems, and while many of them are considered to provide valuable insights, they have seldom proved to be directly applicable to the task of explaining trade patterns.|$|E

An empirical application of the proposed model, {{to the evolution of}} the distribution of incomes for 186 countries, recorded from 1993 up to 2007, illustrates the applicability of the proposed method and suggests that diffusion may be a preferable technique for the analysis of the spatial dynamics in <b>factor</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R
