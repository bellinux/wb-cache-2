In 1907, Dungan also built a cottage home in Laguna Beach where he lived for several years. He also bought 12 acres <b>in</b> <b>Lemon</b> Heights (now known as North Tustin) in 1912.

25|$|In January 2011, about 411 Venezuelan {{citizens}} {{attended a}} wedding in the Dominican Republic, where they ate ceviche (raw fish cooked <b>in</b> <b>lemon</b> juice) at the celebration. By {{the time they}} returned to Caracas and other Venezuelan cities, some of these travelers were suffering from symptoms of cholera. By January 28, almost 111 cases had been confirmed by the Venezuelan Health Authorities, who quickly set up an 800 number for people to call who wondered whether they were infected. Internationally, Colombia secured its eastern border against immigrants and probable transmission of the disease. Dominican officials started a nationwide study to {{determine the cause of}} the outbreak, and warned residents of the imminent danger associated with the consumption of raw fish and shellfish. As of January 29, 2011, none of the cases in Venezuela proved fatal, but two patients were hospitalized. Since the victims had quickly sought help, the outbreak was detected and contained.|$|E
25|$|From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian {{research}} team of Albert Szent-Györgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely, {{as well as}} the American team led by Charles Glen King in Pittsburgh, first identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Györgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid (actually, L-hexuronic acid, although he did not know the stereochemistry at that time) from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor, but could not prove this without a biological assay. At the same time, for five years King's laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh had been trying to isolate the antiscorbutic factor <b>in</b> <b>lemon</b> juice using the original 1907 model of scorbutic guinea pigs which developed scurvy when not fed fresh foods, but were cured by lemon juice. They had also considered hexuronic acid as being the vitamin, but had been put off the trail when a coworker made the explicit (and mistaken) experimental claim that this substance was not the antiscorbutic substance.|$|E

500|$|Beginning with Everson, which {{permitted}} New Jersey {{school boards}} {{to pay for}} transportation to parochial schools, the Court has used various tests to determine when the wall of separation has been breached. Everson laid down the test that establishment existed when aid was given to religion, but that the transportation was justifiable because the benefit to the children was more important. In the school prayer cases of the early 1960s, (Engel v. Vitale and Abington School District v. Schempp), aid seemed irrelevant; the Court ruled {{on the basis that}} a legitimate action both served a secular purpose and did not primarily assist religion. In Walz v. Tax Commission (1970), the Court ruled that a legitimate action could not entangle government with religion; <b>in</b> <b>Lemon</b> v.
