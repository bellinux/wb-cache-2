5|$|The Anglican Church of Melanesia, a {{province}} of the Anglican Communion, was established in 1849 by George Augustus Selwyn of New Zealand. Initially, it was the Church of the Province of New Zealand, but in 1975 it became part of an ecclesiastical Province covering Solomon Islands, the Republic of Vanuatu and the French Territory of New Caledonia in the South Western Pacific. The Church of Melanesia in Honiara operates three missions, the Melanesian Board of Mission, the Melanesian Brotherhood and the Mission to Seafarers Society from Honiara. The Melanesian Board of Mission oversees the <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> and the mission in other regional countries. The Most Reverend. David Vunagi has been archbishop of Melanesia since May 2009, when he formally took over the post at the Cathedral Church of St Barnabas, Honiara.|$|E

25|$|The Southern Baptist Convention was {{organized}} in 1845 {{primarily for the}} purpose of creating a mission board to support the sending of Baptist missionaries. The North American Mission Board, or NAMB, (founded as the Domestic Mission Board, and later the <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Board) in Alpharetta, Georgia serves missionaries involved in evangelism and church planting in the U.S. and Canada, while the International Mission Board, or IMB, (originally the Foreign Mission Board) in Richmond, Virginia, sponsors missionaries {{to the rest of the}} world.|$|E
25|$|In 1906 John Hope {{became the}} first African-American {{president}} and led the institution's growth in enrollment and academic stature. He envisioned an academically rigorous college {{that would be the}} antithesis to Booker T. Washington's view of agricultural and trade-focused education for African-Americans. In 1913, the college was renamed Morehouse College, in honor of Henry L. Morehouse, corresponding secretary of the American Baptist <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society (who had long organized Rockefeller and the Society's support for the College). Morehouse entered into a cooperative agreement with Clark College and Spelman College in 1929 and later expanded the association to form the Atlanta University Center.|$|E

25|$|In 1814, {{leaders such}} as Luther Rice were able to help Baptists unify nationally under what became known informally as the Triennial Convention (because it met every three years) based in Philadelphia. It allowed them to join their {{resources}} to support missions abroad. The <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society, affiliated with the Triennial Convention, was established in 1832 to support missions in frontier territories of the United States. By the mid-19th century, numerous social, cultural, economic, and political differences existed among business owners of the North, farmers of the West, and planters of the South. The most divisive conflict was primarily over the deep sectional issue of slavery and secondarily over missions.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Friends {{became more}} evangelical during the 19th century and were {{influenced}} by the Second Great Awakening. This movement was led by British Quaker Joseph John Gurney. Christian Friends held Revival meetings in America and {{became involved in the}} Holiness movement of churches. Quakers such as Hannah Whitall Smith and Robert Pearsall Smith became speakers in the religious movement and introduced Quaker phrases and practices to it. British Friends became involved with the Higher Life movement, with Robert Wilson from Cockermouth meeting founding the Keswick Convention. From the 1870s it became commonplace in Great Britain to have <b>home</b> <b>mission</b> meetings on a Sunday evening with Christian hymns and a Bible-based sermon alongside the silent meetings for worship on Sunday morning.|$|E
25|$|The suburb {{was also}} home to several homes for {{children}} operated by the Anglican Diocese of Sydney since the 1920s: The Church of England Boys' Home, Church of England Girls' Home, and the Havilah Children's Home, Tress Manning Temporary Care, and Field Cottage. Land owned by the homes has since been developed for housing, with street names such as Trigg, Marella, Carramar, Buckland and Lisgar reflecting the names of individual houses or Anglican <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society services. Boys' Home buildings and grounds are now the regional base and Sydney Australia Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

25|$|It {{was also}} a city of extreme social {{inequality}} between the so-called 'millocracy' and the workers; Elizabeth Gaskell once described an acquaintance attending a ball wearing £400 of lace and £10,000 in diamonds. The Gaskell family moved between the two worlds, allowing Gaskell not only to collect charitable subscriptions from their wide circle and promote longer-lasting changes from within the local bureaucracy, but also to understand the real concerns of those living in poverty, with whom he was probably more at ease. In 1833 he helped to found the non-denominational Manchester Domestic <b>Home</b> <b>Mission,</b> and he acted as its secretary for many years. Inspired by a visit from Boston minister Joseph Tuckerman, the mission gave practical assistance such as food and blankets to the poor. He {{was also a}}ctive in the District Provident Society, an organisation founded by James Kay and William Langton with similar pragmatic aims. Gaskell supported public health measures and housing reform, sitting on the committee of the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association, as well as another committee formed to regulate beer halls in the area.|$|E
25|$|Just {{two years}} after the American Civil War, the Augusta Institute was founded by Rev. William Jefferson White, an Atlanta Baptist {{minister}} and cabinetmaker (William Jefferson White's half brother James E. Tate, was {{one of the founders of}} Atlanta University, now known as Clark Atlanta University), with the support of the Rev. Richard C. Coulter, a former slave from Atlanta, Georgia, and the Rev. Edmund Turney, organizer of the National Theological Institute for educating freedmen in Washington, D.C. The institution was founded to educate African American men in theology and education and was located in Springfield Baptist Church,(Augusta, Georgia), the oldest independent black church in the United States. The institution moved from Augusta, Georgia, to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1879. The school received sponsorship from the American Baptist <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society, an organization that helped establish several historically black colleges. The Institute's first president was Rev. Joseph T. Robert (1871-1884) (father of Brigadier General Henry Martyn Robert, author of Robert's Rules of Order). An anti-slavery Baptist minister from South Carolina and 1828 graduate of Brown University, Robert raised funds, taught the classes, and stabilized the institution.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} on August 15, 1879 at Hayesville, Ohio to Franklin Diffendorfer and Addie Leora Arnold. He was educated at Ohio Wesleyan University, Drew Theological Seminary, and Union Theological Seminary. He was {{assistant}} secretary of the Epworth League from 1902 to 1904, and from 1904 to 1916 was secretary of the Missionary Education Movement in the United States and Canada. The following year (1916-1917) he was educational secretary of the Board of <b>Home</b> <b>Missions</b> and Church Extension and the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was associate secretary of the Centenary Commission of the Board of <b>Home</b> <b>Missions</b> and Church Extension in 1918, and in 1919-1920 served {{as director of the}} <b>Home</b> <b>Missions</b> Survey of the Inter-church world movement.

500|$|During the church's early years, no Protestant {{denomination}} was {{the exclusive}} owner or occupant of Capon Chapel, {{which indicates that}} the church was probably utilized as a [...] "union church" [...] for worship by any Christian denomination. Since no single denomination oversaw the church during this early period, few records of its early activities and construction exist. Later records suggest that Capon Chapel {{was used as a}} place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. While it remains unclear why or how the church became associated with the Baptists, its use by the denomination is possibly associated with the Second Great Awakening, a Protestant revival movement during the early-to-mid 19th century that gained momentum throughout the United States. According to the December 1904 issue of The Baptist <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Monthly, the Baptist Little Cacapon Church contributed one dollar to the general fund of Capon Chapel, demonstrating that the Baptist community still continued to operate from or associate with the church in 1904.|$|E

5000|$|When {{missions}} {{activity was}} no longer viewed as an exporting of Christian civilization, but rather seen {{as a mode of}} worldwide ecumenical cooperation, the distinction between foreign <b>missions</b> and <b>home</b> <b>missions</b> became blurred. Throughout the post-World War I era, the Student Volunteer Movement constantly had to justify its continuing specific concentration on foreign missions. The [...] "revolutionaries" [...] of Des Moines in 1920 questioned the appropriateness of sending missionaries abroad when conditions in American were so much in need of Christianization. In a meeting in February 1920, the Standing Committee discussed at length {{the pros and cons of}} Student Volunteer Movement involvement in <b>home</b> <b>missions</b> work, but decided to continue the status quo focus on recruiting for foreign fields only. In 1922, a new <b>home</b> <b>missions</b> movement, the Student Fellowship for Christian Life Service, approached the SVM seeking cooperation; for over a year it used a room in the Movement offices as its headquarters.|$|R

2500|$|In 1844, Basil Manly Sr., {{president}} of the University of Alabama, a prominent preacher and a major planter who owned 40 slaves, drafted the [...] "Alabama Resolutions" [...] and presented them to the Triennial Convention. These included the demand that slaveholders be eligible for denominational offices to which the Southern associations contributed financially. [...] These resolutions failed to be adopted. Georgia Baptists decided to test the claimed neutrality by recommending a slaveholder to the <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society as a missionary. The <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society's board refused to appoint him, noting that missionaries {{were not allowed to}} take servants with them (so he clearly could not take slaves) and that they would not make a decision that appeared to endorse slavery. Southern Baptists considered this an infringement of their right to determine their own candidates. From the Southern perspective, the Northern position that [...] "slaveholding brethren were less than followers of Jesus" [...] effectively obliged slaveholding Southerners to leave the fellowship.|$|E
2500|$|A {{secondary}} {{issue that}} disturbed the Southerners was {{the perception that}} the American Baptist <b>Home</b> <b>Mission</b> Society did not appoint a proportionate number of missionaries to the southern region of the US. [...] This was likely a result of the Society's not appointing slave owners as missionaries. [...] Baptists in the North preferred a loosely structured society composed of individuals who paid annual dues, with each society usually focused on a single ministry.|$|E
