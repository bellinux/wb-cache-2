Weisman was upset that it was removed and called it [...] "just hilarious".|$|E
500|$|Common became {{interested}} in the role due to both the script and the prospect of working with McAvoy, Jolie, and Morgan Freeman. Common learned a great deal about firearms as preparation for the role, but said he is not a strong supporter of guns in real life. Konstantin Khabensky, who starred in Bekmambetov's Night Watch, was cast so that the director would have a familiar face around. British television veteran Marc Warren agreed to work in the film because he always wanted to be in a Hollywood blockbuster. Thomas Kretschmann originally intended to pick up the comic series after being cast, but Bekmambetov convinced him not to. He said that he [...] "did excessive gun training" [...] to [...] "make sure I look good and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> I know what I'm doing". Kristen Hager originally auditioned for Fox, but accepted the role of Cathy, considering it [...] "fun to play".|$|E

500|$|... "Iconic" [...] {{was chosen}} to be the opening song from the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). It begins with a video {{featuring}} Madonna in a glamorous dress cavorting with bare-bodied males juxtaposed with Mike Tyson talking inside of a cage. Tyson commented about the shooting, saying: [...] "Riveting is not [...] It's just intense... I'm in a cage. I'm a hostage. I'm chained. I'm naked. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a savage. When I [...] it, it didn't seem that intense. But then you watch it and go, 'Whoa'. It was like [...] National Geographic. I need to be tamed, man." [...] Madonna performed wearing an [...] "ornate kimono-like robe with wide sequin-lined sleeves" [...] inside a medieval-looking cage surrounded by religious iconography that she later breaks out of as she sings the first lines, while guards dressed {{similar to the ones}} who guarded the Wicked Witch of the West's castle marched onstage. During the performance, she also hung upside down on a cross.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} {{his work on}} Trouble in Mind, Divine again became involved with a John Waters project, the film Hairspray (1988). Set in Baltimore during the 1960s, Hairspray revolved around self-proclaimed [...] "pleasantly plump" [...] teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television show and rallies against racial segregation. As he had in Waters's earlier film Female Trouble, Divine took on two roles in the film, {{one of which was}} female and the other male. The first of these, Edna Turnblad, was Tracy's loving mother; Divine would later note that with this character he could not be accurately described as a drag queen, proclaiming [...] "What drag queen would allow herself to look like this? <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> half the women from Baltimore." [...] His second character in the film was that of the racist television station owner Arvin Hodgepile. In one interview, Divine admitted that he had hoped to play both the role of mother and daughter in Hairspray, but that the producers had been [...] "a bit leery" [...] and chose Ricki Lake for the latter role instead. Divine went on to state his opinion on Lake, jokingly telling the interviewer that [...] "She is nineteen and delightful. I hate her." [...] In reality they had become good friends while working together on set. Reviews of the film were predominantly positive, with Divine in particular being singled out for praise; several commentators expressed their opinion that the film marked Divine's breakthrough into mainstream cinema. He subsequently took his mother to the film's premier in the Miami Film Festival before she once more accompanied him to the Baltimore premier, this time also with several of his other relatives. After the screening, a party was held at the Baltimore Museum of Art, where Frances Milstead granted an impromptu interview to the English film critic Jonathan Ross, a friend and fan of Divine's.|$|E
500|$|Upon AJ's arrival, Ally Ross of The Sun said: [...] "New arrivals have {{included}} [...] Masood's supposedly funny and long-lost brother AJ, {{who made the}} fatal mistake of arriving with the line: 'Do <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a comedian?' No. You look like David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E

Smith said that the two first met during the premiere of the film The Ladies Man. He said, [...] "I'm looking at Will and thinking, 'People really think <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> him?

2500|$|When Troughton {{left the}} series in 1969, the Doctor was renewed again, {{but this time}} the change was forced on him by the Time Lords at the {{conclusion}} of The War Games, where it is referred to as a [...] "change of appearance". As with the first change, this language suggested only a superficial physical change, not one of personality, although Jon Pertwee's portrayal of the Third Doctor also differed quite substantially from Troughton's. Unlike the previous change, this one is treated as a punishment rather than a natural process: in The War Games the Doctor protests, [...] "You can't just change what <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> without consulting me!" ...|$|E

Occasionally, however, Harrison wishes she could stop the music. [...] "In the middle of a conversation, I'll start humming or moving my feet, and my friends will say, 'You can't be serious, she says. [...] "It's such a reflex that I'm totally unaware <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an idiot."

2500|$|Douglas was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for the role, with his costar Anthony Quinn winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Paul Gauguin, van Gogh's friend. Douglas won a Golden Globe award, although Minnelli said Douglas should have won an Oscar: [...] "He achieved a moving and memorable portrait of the artist—a man of massive creative power, triggered by severe emotional stress, the fear and horror of madness." [...] Douglas himself called his acting role as Van Gogh a painful experience: [...] "Not only did <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Van Gogh, I was the same age {{he was when he}} committed suicide." [...] His wife said he often remained in character in his personal life: [...] "When he was doing Lust for Life, he came home in that red beard of Van Gogh's, wearing those big boots, stomping around the house — it was frightening." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ji {{accepted}} {{a position in}} the wartime government in Chongqing, where he lived in the same rooming-house as Adler. One senior Nationalist Party official, Chen Lifu, later complained that the intelligence agencies knew of Ji's communist connections but that Finance Minister H.H. Kung trusted Ji because they were from the same province and Kung respected Ji's father. The next Finance Minister, T. V. Soong, Chen continued, was American trained and could not speak Chinese well. Soong and Ji got along because they both had a better command of English than Chinese, Chen charged, and that Ji fed damaging policies to both Kung and Soong, but Chiang Kai-shek trusted and defended them because they were married to his wife's sisters. Ji Chaozhu, Ji's brother, recalled that Kung had once demanded" [...] "Chaoding, tell the truth. Are you a Communist?"

Cole's father later abandoned the family during his youth, prompting his mother to relocate Cole and his brother, Zach Cole to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Cole grew up in a multi-ethnic environment, and when asked about how closely his ethnicity impacts him, Cole commented, [...] "I can identify with white people, because I know my mother, her side of the family, who I love. But {{at the end of the}} day, [...] never felt white. I can identify [...] but never have I felt like I'm one of them.
