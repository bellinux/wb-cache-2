5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism</b> or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
25|$|To this end, the H {{class had}} a {{significantly}} different arrangement for its third cylinder. A German Henschel & Son conjugated valve <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism,</b> driven from the combination levers of the Walschaert valve gear for the outside cylinders, was utilised in favour of the Gresley mechanism. The inside cylinder was also positioned further forward of the outside cylinders and drove the leading coupled axle, with the outside cylinders driving the second coupled axle.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism,</b> allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E

500|$|While Archimedes did not {{invent the}} lever, he gave an {{explanation}} of the principle involved in his work On the Equilibrium of Planes. Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the Peripatetic school of the followers of Aristotle, and are sometimes attributed to Archytas. According to Pappus of Alexandria, Archimedes' work on levers caused him to remark: [...] "Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth." [...] (...) Plutarch describes how Archimedes designed block-and-tackle pulley systems, allowing sailors to use the principle of leverage to lift objects that would otherwise have been too heavy to move. Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the catapult, and with inventing the odometer during the First Punic War.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the rotation of the}} camshaft and the rotation of the crankshaft is of critical importance. Since the valves control the flow of the air/fuel mixture intake and exhaust gases, they must be opened and closed at the appropriate time during the stroke of the piston. For this reason, the camshaft is connected to the crankshaft either directly, via a <b>gear</b> <b>mechanism,</b> or indirectly via a belt or chain called a timing belt or timing chain. [...] Direct drive using gears is unusual because of the cost. The frequently reversing torque caused by the slope of the cams tends to cause gear rattle which for an all-metal gear train requires further expense of a cam damper. Rolls-Royce V8 (1954) used gear drive as, unlike chain, it could be made silent and to last the life of the engine. Where gears are used in cheaper cars, they tend to be made from resilient fibre rather than metal, except in racing engines that have a high maintenance routine. Fibre gears have a short life span and must be replaced regularly, much like a timing belt. In some designs the camshaft also drives the distributor and the oil and fuel pumps. [...] Some vehicles may have the power steering pump driven by the camshaft. [...] With some early fuel injection systems, cams on the camshaft would operate the fuel injectors. Honda redesigned the VF750 motorcycle from chain drive to the gear drive VFR750 due to insurmountable problems with the VF750 Hi-Vo inverted chain drive.|$|E
