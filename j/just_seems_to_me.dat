[...] "When I was a child I heard an old {{minister}} say that a house was not a real home until it had been consecrated by a birth, a wedding and a death. We've had deaths here--my father and mother died here as well as Matthew; and we've even had a birth here. Long ago, just after we moved into this house, we had a married hired man for a little while, {{and his wife had}} a baby here. But there's {{never been a}} wedding before. It does seem so strange to think of Anne being married. In a way she <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the little girl Matthew brought home here fourteen years ago. I can't realize that she's grown up. I shall never forget what I felt when I saw Matthew bringing in a GIRL. I wonder what became of the boy we would have got if there hadn't been a mistake. I wonder what HIS fate was." ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2004, {{stories were}} {{published}} implying {{that he had}} suggested that alleged dumbing down of the BBC was partly the consequence of the corporation's growing number of female executives: [...] "Too many dumb, dumb, dumb cookery and gardening shows [...] [...] [...] I have nothing against women. I've worked with them all my life. It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the television service has largely been run by women {{for the last four}} to five years and they don't seem to have done a great job of work." [...] Milne later clarified his position: “What I actually said was that the three people who had run the television service for the past four or five years had not, it seemed to me, done a marvellous job. I would have said the same if they had been mice or men. They happened to be women and then I was stitched up by The Times.” ...|$|E

I wrote 'Give Ireland Back to the Irish', we recorded it and I was promptly 'phoned by the Chairman of EMI, Sir Joseph Lockwood, explaining that they wouldn't release it. He thought it was too inflammatory. I told him that I felt strongly about it and they had to release it. He said, 'Well it'll be banned', and of course it was. I knew 'Give Ireland Back to the Irish' wasn't an easy route, but it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the time. All of us in Wings felt the same about it. But Henry McCullough's brother who lived in Northern Ireland was beaten up because of it. The thugs found out that Henry was in Wings." ...|$|R

5000|$|William Goldman {{first came}} across the story of Butch Cassidy in the late 1950s and {{researched}} it {{on and off for}} eight years before sitting down to write the screenplay. Goldman says he wrote the story as an original screenplay because {{he did not want to}} do the research to make it authentic as a novel. Goldman later stated:The whole reason I wrote the ... thing, there is that famous line that Scott Fitzgerald wrote, who was one of my heroes, [...] "There are no second acts in American lives." [...] When I read about Cassidy and Longbaugh and the superposse coming after them—that's phenomenal material. They ran to South America and lived there for eight years and that was what thrilled me: they had a second act. They were more legendary in South America than they had been in the old West ... It's a great story. Those two guys and that pretty girl going down to South America and all that stuff. It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it's a wonderful piece of material.|$|E
5000|$|The Sandman {{served as}} the villain of {{the first issue of}} the Spider-Man {{spin-off}} series Marvel Team-Up (March 1972), which gave him a more morally ambiguous depiction. Writer Roy Thomas later commented, [...] "I've been pleased to see Sandman's gradual redemption, whose seeds perhaps I helped plant in that story. He <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a character who might have that in him ..." [...] Subsequent stories stuck with the character's original depiction, but a decade later the more sympathetic portrayal of the Sandman returned, starting with Marvel Two-in-One #86 (April 1982), in which the Sandman is given co-star billing with his nemesis the Thing. The Sandman was later an ally of Spider-Man, as well {{as a member of the}} Avengers and Silver Sable's [...] "Wild Pack" [...] team of mercenaries.|$|R
5000|$|This {{variation}} is another two-part virtuosic toccata. Peter Williams sees echoes of Antonio Vivaldi and Domenico Scarlatti here. Specified for two manuals, the piece features hand-crossing. It is in [...] time and usually played at a moderately fast tempo. Rosalyn Tureck {{is one of}} the very few performers who recorded slow interpretations of the piece. In making his 1981 re-recording of the Goldberg Variations, Glenn Gould considered playing this variation at a slower tempo, in keeping with the tempo of the preceding variation (Variation 16), but ultimately decided not to because [...] "Variation 17 is one of those rather skittish, slightly empty-headed collections of scales and arpeggios which Bach indulged when he wasn’t writing sober and proper things like fugues and canons, and it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that there wasn't enough substance to it to warrant such a methodical, deliberate, Germanic tempo." ...|$|R

As for my garden, it hurts me every time I go into it. I suppose I shouldn't complain about a garden when the farmers' crops are suffering so.

[...] He made his voice very low and full, and looked closely into her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I felt vexed {{with her}} <b>just</b> then. She <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be obstinate; and when I found {{that you were}} nothing in her mind I vowed {{that she should be}} nothing in yours.

5000|$|Brides: In 1949, Hartigan {{rented a}} studio on Grand Street in lower Manhattan. Inspired by the display {{windows of the}} {{numerous}} bridal shops concentrated on the street, Hartigan (with two unsuccessful marriages behind her) began to paint groups of mannequins dressed in bridal gowns. Grand Streets Brides (1954; Whitney Museum of American Art), based on Goya's Carlos IV of Spain and His Family (1800), {{was one of several}} works that drew the attention of critics and collectors and established her reputation. Later in her career, Hartigan said, [...] "The bridal theme is one of my empty ritual ideas ... it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> ludicrous <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go through all that fuss." [...] Additionally, she stated, [...] "I paint things that I'm against to try to make them wonderful ... very often." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reaction}} to the story was extremely warm, but several reviewers expressed their dissatisfaction with its finale.

It certainly looks is if something in it is missing."==Notes== ...|$|R
6000|$|DEAR MR. ARCHER, - I {{have read}} your paper with my {{customary}} admiration; {{it is very}} witty, very adroit; it contains a great deal that is excellently true (particularly the parts about my stories and the description of me as an artist in life); but {{you will not be}} surprised if I do not think it altogether <b>just.</b> It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> in particular, that you have wilfully read all my works in terms of my earliest; my aim, even in style, has quite changed in the last six or seven years; and this I should have thought you would have noticed. Again, your first remark upon the affectation of the italic names; a practice only followed in my two affected little books of travel, where a typographical MINAUDERIE of the sort appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in character; and what you say of it, then, is quite just.

I remember my mother pulling it on a kennel once, and explaining it in that way, but didn't say what agriculture was, {{except that it was}} synonymous with intramural incandescence; and a dozen times a day Mrs. Gray and Sadie would tell the tale to new-comers, and say I risked my life to say the baby's, and both of us had burns to prove it, and then the company would pass me around and pet me and exclaim about me, and you could see the pride in the eyes of Sadie and her mother; and when the people wanted to know what made me limp, they looked ashamed and changed the subject, and sometimes when people hunted them this way and that way with questions about it, it looked <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as {{if they were going to}} cry.|$|R
5000|$|Despite his {{encouragement}} {{in regard}} to writing [...] "Black Water" [...] and his meticulous arranging of the track, Ted Templeman would recall: [...] "We {{never thought of it}} as a hit single" [...] - [...] "I put 'Black Water' on a B-side because I figured was an acoustic thing." [...] "Black Water" [...] was in fact utilized as the B-side for the lead single from the Doobie Brothers' 1974 album release What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits, the A-side being [...] "Another Park, Another Sunday" [...] whose June 1974 Billboard Hot 100 peak would be #32: regular group lead vocalist Tom Johnston who would recall that [...] "Another Park..." [...] "was doing real well single release, and then it got yanked off the radio for the line 'And the radio <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>me</b> down'". [...] After the second single off What Were Once Vices...: [...] "Eyes of Silver", was a Top 40 shortfall, Warner Bros. resorted to a re-release of the Doobie Brothers inaugural single [...] "Nobody" [...] a 1971 non-charter which in the autumn of 1974 rose into the Top 60 before being phased out by the re-release of [...] "Black Water" [...] as an A-side single.|$|R

[...] In January 1966, he testified to that effect before the state Senate reapportionment Committee and said that by 1970, Delaware County would have enough population to support two congressmen. In February, Watkins again attacked the pending redistricting plans: If it is done now, large portions of Delaware County will be cut off from the balance of the county, attached to either Chester or Montgomery Counties and our people will be virtually without representation in Washington {{for at least the next}} four years. It will mean that Montgomery and Chester Counties will control those districts. It will mean that congressmen from those districts will not be working solely for Delaware County municipalities.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; it {{had much}} of the {{appearance}} of paper, and at first I supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once, to {{be a piece of}} very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember. Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-head <b>just</b> where, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I had made the drawing of the beetle. For a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my design was very different in detail from this--although there was a certain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a candle, and seating myself {{at the other end of}} the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline--at the singular coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus, and that this skull, not only in outline, but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time. This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to establish a connexion--a sequence of cause and effect--and, being unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabæus. I became perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early moment, there <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration.
