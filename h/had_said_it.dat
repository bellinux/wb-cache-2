25|$|Justice Souter {{noted that}} {{the ability of a}} U.S. citizen to get a trial may {{necessarily}} imply that the court has jurisdiction in that geographic area, since jurisdiction is largely a geographic and sovereignty matter. Since the government <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would not challenge 'habeas corpus' by a U.S. citizen in Guantanamo Bay, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004), this could establish jurisdiction at the base.|$|E

25|$|Barry Horne (17 March 1952 – 5 November 2001) was an English {{animal rights}} activist. He became known {{around the world}} in December 1998, when he engaged in a 68-day hunger strike in an effort to persuade the British {{government}} to hold a public inquiry into animal testing, something the Labour Party <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would do before it came to power in 1997. The hunger strike took place while Horne was serving an 18-year sentence for planting incendiary devices in stores that sold fur coats and leather products, the longest sentence handed down to any animal rights activist by a British court.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010 Pan American Airways, Incorporated, was resurrected for {{the fifth}} time by a company named World-Wide Consolidated Logistics, Inc. The reincarnated {{operator}} is based at Brownsville/South Padre Island International Airport in Brownsville, Texas. The airline's inaugural flight was to Monterrey, Mexico, on November 12, 2010. The airline <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would carry cargo only at first but intended to announce passenger service by 2011. However, due to serious legal charges that were laid against the company's CEO Robert L. Hedrick in 2012, including child pornography charges for which he was eventually convicted, the company lost its bid with the FAA to pursue passenger or cargo flights of any kind.|$|E

Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him. She reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She advised the aide to send Jackson to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|The army convicted seven soldiers, {{including}} two officers, and sentenced them to life imprisonment for a staged killing of three Kashmiri civilians and passing {{it off as}} an anti-militancy operation for rewards and remunerations in J in 2010. The court martial proceedings began in January this year and ended in September. In April 2010, army <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> had killed three infiltrators in the Machil sector and claimed they were Pakistani militants. The men were later identified as Shahzad Ahmad Khan, Riyaz Ahmad Lone and Muhammad Shafi Lone, all residents of Baramulla district. They were lured to work as porters for the Army in Kupwara district. Instead, the Army killed them in a fake encounter, applied black paint on the clean-shaven faces of the slain, placed weapons on them and said they had killed foreign militants.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006 it was {{announced}} that instead of Eden Park, the Government and Auckland City Council were assessing the possibility of a new stadium on Auckland's waterfront to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup. This assessment was part of the Government's formal due diligence process on the decision to redevelop Eden Park. The Government <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would assist with the funding if a new stadium was built. The Government announced in a report in November 2006 that it would favour a new stadium on the Auckland waterfront, which would have meant that the Eden Park redevelopment would not have gone ahead, and that options for its use or redevelopment would have to be developed. After the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council differed in their support for the new stadium, the Government changed to supporting the redevelopment of Eden Park, subject to suitable resolution of the design, funding and governance issues.|$|E

25|$|Haig was in England from 12 March. On 14 March, at {{a meeting}} at Downing Street, warning of serious {{manpower}} problems by June “if (sic) the Germans attacked”. Bonar Law and Lloyd George, by Haig’s account, {{tried to get him}} to say that the Germans would not attack. They accused Haig of having said that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually what he had said – he <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be “a gambler’s throw”) but agreed to shelve the General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived. On the same day Haig attended two long sessions of the Supreme War Council (at one of which, to his amusement, Clemenceau told Foch to shut up). On 15 Haig took part in a long discussion about the bombing of German cities, which he regarded as a waste of effort. That night Doris gave birth to his son Dawyck. He returned to France the next day.|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. They went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E

[...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost.

500|$|During [...] "Off The Wall", {{the first}} episode of the fourth season, Natalie Nunn told Annie Andersen that Chris Brown was at a night club {{that she wanted to}} attend, and asked Anderson if she was a fan. Anderson said not, because of the {{domestic}} violence case that Brown was involved in. Nunn defended Brown, saying [...] "Who cares, Rihanna was a punk bitch, and she got her ass beat for a reason". Nunn called Rihanna a [...] "crazy bitch" [...] and claimed to know her, unlike Anderson. After the episode aired, Brown reportedly stated {{that he did not know}} who Nunn was. Nunn questioned this during the reunion show, claiming that Brown <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> because the cast of the show had not yet been revealed. Perez Hilton, the host of the reunion, asked Nunn if Rihanna had confronted her about her comments. Nunn answered yes, stating that the two had argued during a dinner party in New York City. During the reunion, Nunn claimed to have had a [...] "fling" [...] with Brown before the show. Shortly before the end of the reunion, Nunn said that she did not condone domestic violence and apologized if her comment had enraged fans and people who had been victims of it.|$|E
500|$|Several James Turner Street {{residents}} have claimed they were tricked into {{appearing in the}} series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the Birmingham Mail, [...] "They {{told me it was}} about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us." [...] Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: [...] "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them." [...] Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's This Morning that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents [...] "went into the show naively". Gareth Price of The Guardian suggested the show's producers [...] "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".|$|E
