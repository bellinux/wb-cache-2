5|$|One day, {{after trying}} to make the troublemaker Zhang {{apologize}} for bothering another student, Wei discovers that Zhang has left to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> work in the nearby city of Zhangjiakou. The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E

25|$|By November 2006, Kip and B.G. {{began to}} show displeasure in TNA and {{threatened}} to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> work elsewhere {{if they did not}} receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE's DX. On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and tried to say something to the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer's headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA's website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the fight, a single Comanche woman was {{released}} {{to return to her}} camp and report that the Comanche prisoners would be released if the Comanche released the 15Americans and several Mexicans who were known to be captives. They were given 12days to return the captives. On March 26, a white woman, Mrs. John Webster, came into town with her three-year-old. She had been a Comanche captive for 19months and had just escaped, leaving her 12-year-old son with the Indians. Two days later, a band of Indians returned to San Antonio. Leaving the bulk of the warriors outside the city, Chief Isanaica (Howling Wolf) and one other man rode into San Antonio and yelled insults. The citizens told him to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> the soldiers if he wanted a fight, but the garrison commander, Captain Redd, declared that he had to observe the 12-day truce. Redd invited the Indians to come back in threedays, but, fearing a trap, Isanaica and his men left the area. Another officer accused Redd of cowardice for refusing to fight, and they both died following a duel over the insult.|$|E

[...] "We {{have to make sure that}} we open up these avenues so that our best and our brightest can <b>go</b> <b>find</b> these cures that they believe they will find," [...] he said.

[...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her.

[...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing whatever she has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else.

500|$|Newton {{takes the}} box to a crowded subway station, and entices a {{homeless}} man (Eric Lynch) to watch the box for a short while, expecting the person to steal it after he leaves. The Fringe team is soon on the scene having discovered the ultrasound signal, and find all of the passengers at the station are dead. They find no evidence of the box, and fear that someone took it into the tunnels and may still be active; the ultrasound would kill everyone on any train that passed. Peter offers to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> the box, and Walter has the idea to make Peter momentarily deaf by having Fauxlivia fire her gun next to Peter's ears. He finds the box, its lid cracked, in the dead hands of the homeless man. Without a way to seal the lid, Peter is forced to try to defuse the box. He does so in time before his hearing returns, but cannot hear the warning of an errant train bearing down on him; Fauxlivia enters the tunnels to save Peter. After recovering, Peter and Walter surmise the box {{is part of the}} machine, and Peter begins studying it. On her own, Fauxlivia contacts the parallel world through the typewriter shop, informing them that Peter [...] "has the first piece" [...] and is now [...] "engaged".|$|E
500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them <b>go</b> <b>find</b> out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E

500|$|According to {{the book}} Heroism and Gender in War Films (2014), the lyrics of [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "outline the perfect woman". The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what you give me to work with", the performers then offer an extensive list of examples and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as it fast unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they would much rather remain single: [...] "the kind of girl who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons. You’ve got other plans".|$|E

2500|$|Berlusconi managed, in a {{surprise}} move, to ally himself {{to both the}} National Alliance and the Northern League, without these being allied with each other. Forza Italia teamed up with the League in the North, where they competed against National Alliance, and with National Alliance {{in the rest of}} Italy, where the League was not present. This unusual coalition configuration was caused by the deep hate between the League, which had many supporters who wanted to separate from the rest of Italy and held Rome in deep contempt, and the nationalist post-fascists; on one occasion, Bossi encouraged his supporters to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> National Alliance supporters [...] "house by house," [...] seemingly suggesting a lynching (which however did not actually take place).|$|E
2500|$|A lot of high-concept gimmick episodes {{were done}} {{in the early years}} of the show, such as a 1994 episode {{literally}} done in a giant hole, a 1994 show done entirely on a boat of the circle line or [...] "Time Travel Week", four episodes from early 1996, where Conan and Andy (and the rest of the crew) [...] "time-traveled" [...] to a different point in time each night. Times and locations included The Civil War, Ancient Greece, The future, and The early '80s (featuring a cameo by David Letterman in the cold open, who occupied Conan's studio in 1983, cruelly brushing off Conan and Andy's attempt at explaining their presence in Letterman's dressing room by saying, [...] "Why don't you two fellas <b>go</b> <b>find</b> a nice, warm place to screw yourselves?

The two songs would eventually lead into the Temple of the Dog project. Bassist Jason Everman was fired immediately after Soundgarden completed its promotional tour for Louder Than Love in mid-1990. Thayil said that [...] "Jason just didn't work out", and that the band [...] "didn't need to <b>go</b> <b>find</b> someone better than him; we needed to find a kindred spirit that we'd hang out with anyway".
