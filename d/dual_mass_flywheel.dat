40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis highlights {{one of the most}} significant concerns that has preoccupied drivetrain engineers in recent times, namely drivetrain clonk. Clonk is an unacceptable audible sound, which is accompanied by a tactile drivetrain response. This may occur under several different driving conditions. Many drivetrain NVH concerns are related to impact loading of subsystems down-line of engine. These concerns are induced by power torque surge through engagement and disengagement processes, which may propagate through various transmission paths as structural waves. The coincidence of these waves with the acoustic modes of sub-system components leads to audible responses, referred to as clonk. The approach usually undertaken and reported in literature is either purely theoretical or constitutes experimental observation of vehicle conditions. A few research workers have reported rig-based investigations, but not under fully dynamic conditions with controlled and reproducible impulsive action. The research reported in this thesis combines experimental and numerical investigation of high frequency behaviour of light truck drivetrain systems, when subjected to sudden impulsive action, due to driver behaviour. The problem is treated as a multi-physics interactive phenomenon under transient conditions. The devised numerical method combines multi-body dynamics, structural modal analysis, impact dynamics in lash zones and acoustic analysis within an overall investigation framework. A representative drivetrain system rig is designed and implemented, and controlled tests simulating driver behaviour undertaken. The combined numerical predictions and experimental noise and vibration monitoring has highlighted the fundamental aspects of drivetrain behaviour. Good agreement is' also found between the detailed numerical approach and the experimental findings. Novel methods of measurement such as Laser Doppler Vibrometery have been employed. Simultaneous measurements of vibration and noise radiation confirm significant elasto-acoustic coupling at high impact energy levels. One of the major finds of the thesis is the complex nature of the clonk signal, being a combination of accelerative and ringing noise, with the latter also comprising of many other lower energy content as observed in the case of transmission rattle and bearing-induced responses. Therefore, the link between rattle and clonk, long suspected, but not hitherto shown has been confirmed in the thesis. Another major find of particular commercial interest is the insignificant contribution of torsional damping devices such as <b>dual</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flywheels</b> upon the accelerative component of the clonk response...|$|R

40|$|Heavy duty {{trucks are}} faced with strict {{requirements}} regarding exhaust emissions and fuel efficiency. The demands are achieved through downsizing and downspeeding. This introduces torsional vibrations in the powertrain which, if not dealt with, will decrease life and comfort. One solution that deals with these vibrations is the <b>Dual</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel</b> that absorbs the vibrations. The goal of this thesis is to develop and verify different computational models of a <b>Dual</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel</b> and in particular study how the friction between the arc-spring and the primary ywheel affects the system. Modelling is done in Python using the Newmark- method combined with Newton's method for numerical simulations. The same model is also created in AVL Excite for verification. The friction between the arc-spring and the primary flywheel channel is modelled using the Coulomb friction model or an inverse tangent function. It has been verified that the two computational models give similar results. A method to approximate Coulomb friction has been developed {{in order to make}} the computational model more stable. The friction depends on both spring compression and centripetal force due to the rotation of the <b>Dual</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Flywheel.</b> For a truck's operating speed the spring compression is the largest factor to frictional losses with current selection of geometrical and structural parameters. The results show that with low friction and low viscous damping resonance is not a significant problem even if it occurs at low engine speed. A study about the number of masses needed to solve the friction model have been performed. It is concluded that the friction moment has not converged using five spring masses. A method of achieving accurate results with few masses is presented.

In standard operating conditions, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transferred to the gearbox, leading {{to a number of}} comfort problems.

In order to prevent rattle, dual mass flywheels may be used to reduce torsional oscillations in automotive powertrains.

40|$|The damping {{characteristics}} of the traditional <b>dual</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> (DMF) cannot be changed and can only meet one of the damping requirements. Given that the traditional DMF cannot avoid the resonance interval in start/stop conditions, it tends to generate high-resonance amplitude, which reduces the lifetime of a vehicle’s parts and leads to vehicle vibration and noise. The {{problems associated with the}} traditional DMF can be solved through the magnetorheological fluid <b>dual</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> (MRF-DMF), which was designed in this study with adjustable damping performance under different conditions. The MRF-DMF is designed based on the rheological behavior of the magnetorheological fluid (MRF), which can be changed by magnetic field strength. The damping torque of the MRF-DMF, which is generated by the MRF effect, is derived in detail. Thus, the cosimulation between the drivetrain model built in AMESim and the control system model developed in Simulink is conducted. The controller of MRF-DMF is developed, after which the torsional vibration control test of drivetrain is carried out. The cosimulation and test results indicate that MRF-DMF with the controller effectively isolates torque fluctuation of the engine in the driving condition and exhibits high performance in suppressing the resonance amplitude in the start/stop conditions...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a conference paper. Torsional {{oscillations}} {{generated by the}} internal combustion engine induce various NVH phenomena in the drivetrain system, one being transmission rattle. Palliatives devices such as the clutch predampers or <b>dual</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> have been used to mitigate these NVH phenomena. However, usually these devices are effective over a limited range of frequencies, and not so for broadband transient phenomenon, such as any impulsive actions. This paper considers the Targeted Energy Transfer (TET) method to mitigate torsional vibrations in automotive powertrains. TET is a concept which attempts to direct the mechanical (vibration) energy (in a nearly irreversible manner) from a source (primary system) to a strongly nonlinear attachment (Nonlinear Energy Sink – NES), where it is absorbed, redistributed and/or dissipated. In contrast to the classical powertrain palliative methods, NES should be capable of operating over a broader band of frequencies (with the additional aim of being lightweight and compact). Although the TET concept has been extensively studied for translational systems, there is a dearth of studies for rotational (torsional) ones. In the present work, preliminary parametric studies are performed on a reduced automotive powertrain model, incorporating a NES attachment. The NES parameters, including nonlinear stiffness, viscous linear damping and inertia are varied in order to determine NES effects on engine order (EO) vibration...|$|E
40|$|The term {{driveability}} {{describes the}} driver's complex subjective {{perception of the}} interactions with the vehicle. One of them is associated to longitudinal acceleration aspects. A relevant contribution to the driveability optimization process is, nowadays, realized by means of track tests during which {{a considerable amount of}} driveline parameters are tuned in order to obtain a good compromise of longitudinal acceleration response. Unfortunately, this process is carried out at a development stage when a design iteration becomes too expensive. In addition, the actual trend of downsizing and supercharging the engines leads to higher vibrations that are transmitted to the vehicle. A large effort is therefore dedicated to develop, test and implement ignition strategies addressed to minimize the torque irregularities. Such strategies could penalize the engine maximum performance, efficiency and emissions. The introduction of the <b>dual</b> <b>mass</b> <b>flywheel</b> is beneficial to this end. Nevertheless, its role on the vehicle driveability, {{as well as that of}} other driveline components, is not yet so clear.
