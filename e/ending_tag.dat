5000|$|Love's {{contributions}} are disputed by some. He has {{claimed that he}} revised or added other lyrics beyond the <b>ending</b> <b>tag,</b> while Asher asserted {{it was not possible}} due to Love's absence during songwriting sessions. Since he was touring with the group in Japan while the Pet Sounds album was being composed, Love's attorney proposed that it may have been possible that Brian consulted Love by telephone during occasional bathroom breaks. Asher, believing the argument was [...] "so absurd," [...] responded with incredulity. Love did not receive an official co-writing credit on the song until after 1994.|$|E

5000|$|Possibly {{due to his}} {{conservatory}} training, David uses {{pieces of}} classical piano works as intros or settings for many of his songs. For example, in the song [...] "This Time" [...] from the album Learning to Trust, the opening section of the song (as well as the bridge and <b>ending</b> <b>tag)</b> is from Frédéric Chopin's [...] "Revolutionary Etude" [...] (Op. 10, No. 12) in C minor. The introductory melody for [...] "You Can Go", from the album 7, is taken from the Two-Part Invention No. 13 in A Minor (BWV 784) by Johann Sebastian Bach. (Because of the prevalent use of synthesizers, [...] "You Can Go" [...] is sometimes incorrectly connected to an advertisement in the early 1980s for Commodore 64 which used the Bach Invention played by a synthesizer.) Also, the song [...] "Falling Down" [...] from his album Count the Cost {{is based on a}} sonata by Mozart.|$|E

5000|$|In the HTML syntax, most {{elements}} are written {{with a start}} <b>tag</b> and an <b>end</b> <b>tag,</b> with the content in between. An HTML tag is composed {{of the name of}} the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An <b>end</b> <b>tag</b> also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the [...] element, would be written asHowever, not all of these elements require the <b>end</b> <b>tag,</b> or even the start tag, to be present. [...] Some elements, the so-called void elements or [...] empty elements, do not have an <b>end</b> <b>tag.</b> A typical example is the [...] element, which represents a significant line break, such as in a poem or an address. A void element's behaviour is predefined, and it cannot contain any content or other elements. For example, an address would be written asWhen using an XHTML DTD, it is required to open and close the element with a single tag. To specify that it is a void element, a [...] "/" [...] is included at the <b>end</b> of the <b>tag</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} [...] "/" [...] at the beginning of a closing tag).|$|R
