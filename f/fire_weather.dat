5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} of wind, precipitations {{and humidity}} {{is essential for}} preventing and controlling wildfires. Different indices, like the Forest <b>fire</b> <b>weather</b> index and the Haines Index, {{have been developed to}} predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.|$|E
5|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), {{was created}} in 1965 {{as a way for}} the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the U.S. Weather Bureau to work together, reduce the {{duplication}} of services, and coordinate national fire planning and operations. The U.S. Weather Bureau office was moved to {{the second floor of the}} old administration building on June 5, 1969. The U.S. Weather Bureau made the Boise office its “hub of <b>fire</b> <b>weather</b> activities” in the west where <b>fire</b> <b>weather</b> specialists are able to make face to face contact with the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management fire dispatchers. U.S. Congress approved the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) requested for $316,000 in additional funds in the fiscal year 1970 budget in July 1969 for the Boise, Idaho, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and for bringing Oklahoma City, Oklahoma up to full Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO) status. On June 22, 1970, the Boise Forecast Office began issuing official weather forecasts for Idaho south of the Salmon River. The U.S. Weather Bureau changed their name to the National Weather Service on October 1, 1970.|$|E

30|$|Within the {{historical}} context of the region, the 2017 Knysna Fires were thus not unprecedented in extent or {{in terms of the}} weather conditions on the days of the <b>fires.</b> These <b>weather</b> conditions, although rare, arguably cannot be attributed to global changes in climate. However, the likelihood of extreme fire danger conditions (and extreme fires) is expected to increase given that average <b>fire</b> danger <b>weather</b> has increased significantly in severity (due to increasing temperature and decreasing humidity) over the past 70 years in the region (Kraaij et al. 2013 b). Unlike the short-term weather conditions, the prolonged drought preceding the 2017 Knysna Fires was unprecedented in the 70 -year climatic record for the region and is deemed to have contributed greatly to the spread and severity of the fires. Extreme fire events (high-impact mega-fires) or anomalous areas burned {{in other parts of the}} world have similarly been associated with extreme drought and <b>fire</b> danger <b>weather</b> conditions (Dimitrakopoulos et al. 2011, Williams 2013, Keeley and Syphard 2017).|$|R
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center also is {{responsible}} for issuing <b>fire</b> <b>weather</b> outlooks (FWD) for the continental United States. These outlooks are a guidance product for local, state and federal government agencies, including local National Weather Service offices, in forecasting the potential for wildfires. The outlooks issued are for Day 1, Day 2, and Days 3–8. The Day 1 product is issued at 4:00 a.m. Central Time and is updated at 1700Z, and is valid from 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 2 outlook is issued at 1000Z and is updated at 2000Z for the forecast period of 1200Z to 1200Z the following day. The Day 3–8 outlook is issued at 2200Z, and is valid from 1200Z {{two days after the}} current calendar date to 1200Z seven days after the current calendar date.|$|E
5|$|WFO Boise {{operates}} 24 hours a day, 365 days a {{year and}} provides weather forecasts, warnings, aviation forecast and local statements for Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. There is one WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar upgraded to dual polarization on August 30, 2012 improving the accuracy and identification of precipitation types and precipitation estimates. The office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS II) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. The office also maintains eight Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) around the area. NWS Boise employs 18 meteorologist of which two are dedicated <b>Fire</b> <b>Weather</b> Forecasters and Incident Meteorologists and one hydrologist. There are also 7 support staff member that provide technical, administrative and IT support.|$|E
5|$|In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center {{relocated}} {{its operations}} to Norman, Oklahoma, and was rechristened the Storm Prediction Center. At that time, the guidance center was housed at Max Westheimer Airport (now the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport), co-located {{in the same}} building as the National Severe Storms Laboratory and the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office (the latter of which, in addition to disseminating forecasts, oversees the issuance of weather warnings and advisories for the western two-thirds of Oklahoma and western portions of North Texas, and issues outline and status updates for SPC-issued severe thunderstorm and tornado watches that include areas served by the Norman office). In 1998, the Center began issuing the National <b>Fire</b> <b>Weather</b> Outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to the development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors. The Day 3 Convective Outlook (which is similar in format to the Day 2 forecast) was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000, and was made an official product in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Service Boise, Idaho is {{a weather}} {{forecast}} office responsible for weather forecasts, warnings and local statements {{as well as}} aviation weather forecasts and <b>fire</b> <b>weather</b> forecasts for 3 counties in Southeast Oregon and 14 counties in Southwest and South central Idaho. The U.S. Weather Bureau established {{an office in the}} Sonna Building on December 1, 1898. Since then, the U.S Weather Bureau office, now known as the National Weather Service forecast office gained forecast responsibility of Southern Idaho on June 22, 1970 which was expanded to the entire state of Idaho in 1973. After modernization in 1993, the forecast responsibility was changed to Southeast Oregon and Southwest Idaho. The current office in Boise maintains a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar system, 8 Automated airport weather station (ASOS) systems and Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly improve forecasting in the region. Continuous weather observations have been maintained for the city of Boise since February 1, 1964 about 5 months after the U.S. Army established Fort Boise. The post surgeon for the U.S. Army took observations until July 1, 1877 when the U.S. Signal Service, established an office downtown. The Signal Office was discontinued on July 1, 1890.|$|E

50|$|A {{scoreless}} {{first half}} {{was marked by}} a defensive effort for the All-Stars. The Los Angeles Galaxy's Kevin Hartman made several key saves, while a backline led by Carlos Bocanegra of the Chicago <b>Fire</b> <b>weathered</b> a persistent Chivas attack. The Fire's Ante Razov scored the first goal {{in the second half}} thanks in part to a feed by the San Jose Earthquakes' Landon Donovan past a beaten Oswaldo Sánchez. Jair Garcia broke away from the defense and beat Hartman to tie the game, but the All-Stars responded shortly thereafter with the eventual-game winner by the Galaxy's Carlos Ruiz. The Fire's DaMarcus Beasley tipped in the All-Stars' third goal, which Chivas contested because of an assistant referee's offside call, which was waved off by Kevin Terry. A sellout crowd at The Home Depot Center celebrated the win, as well as the awarding of MVP to local favorite Carlos Ruiz.|$|R
25|$|As the day progressed, {{all-time record}} {{temperatures}} were being reached. Melbourne hit , the hottest temperature ever recorded {{for the city}} and humidity levels dropped to as low as two percent. The McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index reached unprecedented levels, ranging from 160 to over 200.

The 2009 Black Saturday bushfire disaster has since surpassed Ash Wednesday on the list of disasters in Australia by death toll, with 173 confirmed fatalities as of 30 March 2009—although the 1983 fires still remain the worst in Australian history in terms of property loss.|$|E
25|$|Wednesday 16 February— Ash Wednesday on the Christian calendar—dawned {{as another}} unrelentingly hot, dry day.

Ahead of the front were hot, turbulent, gale force northerly winds. Temperatures around Melbourne and Adelaide quickly rose above 43°C, with winds gusting up to 100km/h and relative humidity plunging to as low as 6 per cent. From mid-morning, McArthur's fire danger index was in excess of 100 in several places in Victoria and South Australia.

30|$|Wood {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{materials}} in the humanity history, deeply rooted in the consciousness of society through its material values and processing properties for tools or furniture objects [1]. It is an organic material which supports a continuous degradation and deterioration processes by action of <b>fire,</b> <b>weathering,</b> and various organisms [2]. Therefore, people are trying different methods of improving its durability. For stopping the degradation processes, the wood artifacts could undergo some conservation treatments with different compatible materials, to stabilize the wooden structure and avoid shrinkage and collapse and for a longer integrity of the object. A preservation material should obey the following rules: to remain stable over long periods of time; to be reversible; to penetrate and distribute evenly throughout the wood; to prevent dimensional changes and maintain the original appearance of the artefact; to be compatible with wood, or with other materials from the wooden system; to present reduced/no toxicity; to prevent biological degradation and acidification of the wood.|$|R

25|$|In 2003, {{southern}} California witnessed powerful chaparral wildfires. Hundreds {{of homes}} {{and hundreds of thousands}} of acres of land went up in flames. Extreme <b>fire</b> <b>weather</b> (low humidity, low fuel moisture and high winds) and the accumulation of dead plant material from 8 years of drought, contributed to a catastrophic outcome. Although some have maintained that fire suppression contributed to an unnatural buildup of fuel loads, a detailed analysis of historical fire data has showed that this may not have been the case. Fire suppression activities had failed to exclude fire from the southern California chaparral. Research showing differences in fire size and frequency between southern California and Baja has been used to imply that the larger fires north of the border are the result of fire suppression, but this opinion has been challenged by numerous investigators and is no longer supported by the majority of fire ecologists.|$|E

However, the data organization used in past research can not satisfy the requirements of models well. Our aims are to determine the regression model that best fits the forest fire data set and provides a new model theory for research on forest fire and its influencing factors in order to forecast lighting fire occurrence. Methods We used negative binomial (NB) and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models to describe the relationship between lighting <b>fire</b> occurrence and <b>weather</b> factors in the Daxing’an Mountains for 1980 – 2005 using SAS 9. 1 version and R-Project statistic software and comparing results from these models by use of AIC and Vuong methods. Important findings Both NB and ZINB models produced results with high significance for each weather factor. Comparison of the two models according to AIC, Vuong and other methods showed that the fitting ability and predictive power of ZINB model are better than those of the NB model. The advantage was also found when we compared the modeling results with Ordinary Least Squares. Then we obtained the best model for the relationship between lighting <b>fire</b> and <b>weather</b> factors...|$|R
