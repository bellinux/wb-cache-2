It is thought that negative ions from the electrolytic solution collect on each sliding surface, repel each other and prevent the close approach of two sliding surfaces.

50|$|Steel {{reinforced}} v-belts {{are sufficient}} for low-mass low-torque applications like utility vehicles and snowmobiles but higher mass and torque {{applications such as}} automobiles require a chain. Each element of the chain must have conical sides that fit the pulley when the belt is running on the outermost radius. As the chain moves into the pulleys the contact area gets smaller. As the contact area {{is proportional to the}} number of elements, chain belts require lots of very small elements. The shape of the elements is governed by the static of a column. The pulley-radial thickness of the belt is a compromise between maximum gear ratio and torque. For the same reason the axis between the pulleys is as thin as possible. In a chain-based CVT a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> is applied to the pulleys. It needs to be thick enough so that the pulley and the chain never touch and it must be thin in order not to waste power when each element dives into the lubrication film. Additionally, the chain elements stabilize about 12 steel bands. Each band is thin enough so that it bends easily. If bending, it has a perfect conical surface on its side. In the stack of bands each band corresponds to a slightly different gear ratio, and thus they slide over each other and need oil between them. Also the outer bands slide through the stabilizing chain, while the center band can be used as the chain linkage.|$|E

40|$|The elastohydrodynamic (EHD) {{lubrication}} regime occurs in many machine elements where {{a combination of}} hydrodynamic effect, elastic deformation of the loaded surfaces and increase of the viscosity of the lubricant with pressure ensure {{the formation of a}} very thin, but continuous <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> separating the contacting surfaces.

This dissertation {{is an attempt to}} rectify the current situation by considering four more advanced friction models, and coding them in FORTRAN for use with the finite element program ABAQUS. The new models are: a quasi-steady-state sliding model proposed by Zhang, Moslehy and Rice; a nonlinear pressure-dependent model proposed by Wriggers, vu Van and Stein; and a model that includes a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> proposed by Wilson, Hsu and Huang.

The authors have examined the frictional behavior of this lubricant as a function of oxidation, in support of efforts to quantify the impact of changes in the material on the dynamic behavior of the MC 2969 strong link. Their results show that the friction response of oxidized lubricant is strongly influenced by the amount of burnishing performed on the lubricant after deposition. Low levels of burnish leave a thick film, of which only the near surface degrades during oxidation. Rapid wear of the oxidized material leaves a surface whose properties are the same as non-oxidized material. Higher levels of burnish leave a thinner <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> such that the entire film may be oxidized. The friction coefficient on this surface reaches a steady state value greater than that of non oxidized material. In addition to these fundamental differences in steady state behavior, they have shown that the initial friction coefficient on oxidized surfaces is related to the amount of sulfide converted to sulfate, regardless of the oxidation conditions used.

The thin <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> between {{cylinder block}} and valve plate has to fulfill simultaneously a bearing and a sealing function under dynamic load conditions; on the other hand, it represents an important source of power losses due to viscous friction and leakage flow. ^ An accurate prediction of the time changing characteristics of the interface, in terms of fluid film thickness, dynamic pressure field, load carrying ability and energy dissipation is necessary to generate more efficient and reliable designs. However, the complexity of the physical phenomena involved in the interface 2 ̆ 7 s operation made the trial end error practice the main design methodology in the last fifty years. ^ The aim of this work is to deepen the understanding of the main physical phenomena affecting the cylinder block / valve plate interface performance. For this purpose, a unique fully coupled multi-body dynamics model has been proposed to capture the complex fluid-structure interaction phenomena affecting the non-isothermal fluid film conditions. ^ The model is able of determining the fluid film thickness as a function of the interface 2 ̆ 7 s load condition, accounting for the squeeze film effect due to the cylinder block 2 ̆ 7 s micro-motion and the change in fluid film thickness due to the elastic deformations of the solid parts, caused by the fluid film pressure and by the thermal strains. ^ In addition, the impact of micro-surface shaping introduced by design or resulting from wear process can be investigated and combined with the modification of the clearance due to the normal machine operation. ^ The model was validated by comparing the predicted surface temperature of the valve plate with measurements for two different machines, a 100 cc and a 130 cc units of commercial production.

Uploaded {{in accordance with the}} publisher's self-archiving policy. The definitive version is available at: [URL] constitutes nearly one fifth of all engine losses. The main contributory source of frictional losses in most engines is the piston-cylinder system, accounting for nearly half of all the parasitic losses. Minimisation of this is essential for improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, which are the main driving forces in engine development. The tribology of piston-cylinder conjunctions is, however, transient in nature. This means that various palliative actions need to be undertaken to suit certain instances during the engine cycle. In general, formation of a coherent <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> of suitable viscosity reduces the chance of boundary interactions for most of the piston cycle. Plateau honing of the cylinder bore surface reduces the 'peakiness' of the surface topography. Furthermore, if regularly spaced grooves are provided on the contacting surface, these grooves can act as reservoirs of lubricant. However, at low sliding speeds, which are typically found during piston motion reversals, lubricant entrainment into the contact either ceases or is significantly reduced. Therefore, {{at the end of the}} piston strokes, there is a greater chance of boundary interactions, resulting in increased friction. There is a need to engineer the surface topography in these low-relative-speed regions in a manner conducive to the retention of a lubricant film. Surface texturing by means of laser processing or mechanical indentation at the dead centres are used to produce local reservoirs of lubricant as well as to encourage and direct the flow of lubricant into the contact conjunction. The paper shows that such surface-modifying features improve the engine's output power by as much as 4 % over that of the standard cylinder bore surface. To reduce wear and scuffing, particularly at the top dead centre, hard coatings can also be used. However, smooth surfaces and the generally oleophobic nature of hard coatings can increase the chance of adhesion, particularly at low sliding speeds. This means that prevention of wear does not necessarily lead to improved fuel efficiency. Furthermore, it is necessary to determine the geometry of the textured patterns in order to avoid the leakage of oil from the ring-pack conjunctions, which can result in increased emissions as well as lubricant degradation and depletion. © IMechE 2014...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. The piston {{compression}} ring-cylinder liner contact experiences a transient regime of lubrication. This comprises hydrodynamic, mixed (partial) or boundary interactions. The regime of lubrication {{is influenced by}} contact kinematics, loading, mechanical and topographical properties of the bounding solid surfaces, as well as lubricant rheology and its supply to feed the conjunction. Ideally, a sufficient volume of lubricant would exist at the conjunctional inlet, which acts as a meniscus, from which a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> is entrained into the contact area. However, often there is an insufficient volume at the inlet to the contact or unfavourable kinematic conditions exist, such as at the dead centre reversals in the piston system. Such conditions are generally regarded as the underlying reasons for mixed or boundary regimes of lubrication. Whilst, these are {{the main reasons for}} failure to form a coherent lubricant film at dead centre reversals, poor hydrodynamic lubrication can also occur elsewhere in the piston cycle {{due to the lack of}} an inlet meniscus. This may be as the result of poor ring-bore conformability, where a meniscus cannot be formed in an increasing clearance space. Numerical analyses reported in open literature often assume an idealised fully flooded or drowned inlet. Other analyses assume starved inlet boundaries, usually based on a lubricant availability model, which itself is based on an assumed supply of lubricant on free surfaces ahead of the contact. It is, however, important to establish the limiting clearance space which would allow the lubricant to adhere to the adjacent boundary solids and, thus form a meniscus bridge. The current study is aimed at establishing inlet meniscus conditions. This would depend on the lubricant surface tension, affected by the free surface energy of liquid-vapour interface and the contact angle made between the lubricant and the bounding solids. It also depends on the solid surfaces, any coatings and their topography. In general, the results indicate the dependence of the meniscus force on surface material and topography, through measurement of contact angles made by the various compression rings against the various cylinder liner surfaces, using an especially developed rig and in conjunction with a goniometer. Obviously, the measurements do not exactly replicate those existing in a fired engine. Nonetheless, this initial study provides a good insight into oil-surface combination in separating gaps, which is far more representative than the usually assumed idealised inlet conditions...|$|E

Wear in this region of the cylinder liner surface is controlled primarily by the protective film forming anti-wear additives in the lubricant which limit the direct surface contact between the piston rings and cylinder liner. The condition of zinc dialkyldithiophosphates anti-wear additives was analysed using the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tribology analysis was conducted to evaluate the tribological and boundary <b>film</b> forming performance <b>of</b> zinc dialkyldithiophosphates additives by simulating cylinder liner–piston ring contact near the top dead centre. To further understand the wear mechanisms of the cylinder liner, wear debris analysis (Analytical Ferrography) <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> samples was performed. Results revealed the depletion of phosphorus containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphates anti-wear additives as a function <b>of</b> the <b>lubricant’s</b> duty cycle within the marine engines {{and its effect on}} the tribological and boundary <b>film</b> forming performance <b>of</b> <b>lubricants.</b> Wear debris analysis showed the generation of ferrous debris potentially from the cylinder liners as a result of reduced anti-wear protection from the depleted zinc dialkyldithiophosphates additives during the tribological contact with piston rings and piston skirt region. These findings are useful to understand the lubricant degradation mechanisms which affect the functionality of cylinder liners, therefore allowing to plan the engine maintenance strategies...|$|R
