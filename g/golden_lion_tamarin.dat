25|$|Dublin Zoo {{manages the}} EEP for the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> and the Moluccan cockatoo. It also houses {{members of the}} species Goeldi's monkey and the white-faced saki which are part of EEPs coordinated by other zoos. The focus is on conservation, which {{includes}} breeding and protecting endangered species, as well as research, study and education.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{has been}} {{involved}} in reintroducing wild horse, <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin,</b> roan antelope and scimitar oryx to the wild. The oryx was extinct in the wild, but more than 200 calves have been born and reared at the zoo since 1972 and many of these have been released back to the Sahara with animals from Whipsnade Zoo and Edinburgh Zoo.|$|E
25|$|Jewels of the Emerald Forest {{pavilion}} {{is situated}} {{near the entrance}} to Primate Panorama and features a meandering trail through diorama replicas showing four primate environments: Malagasy, South American forest floor and forest canopy, and primates of the night. Animals housed here include the aye-aye, titi and <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin.</b> Connecting to the building is an island exhibit that rotates several different lemur species.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|R

25|$|The zoo sees {{its primary}} goal as the {{conservation}} of endangered species. These include animals mentioned in the Bible which are now extinct in Israel, such as the Asian lion, the Syrian brown bear, the Asiatic cheetah, the Nile crocodile, and the Persian fallow deer. It also includes endangered species worldwide, such as the Asian elephant, rare species of macaw, the cockatiel, the ibis, and the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thanks to its {{remarkable}} birth rate, the zoo is able {{to adhere}} to many programmes of safeguard of species {{in the process of}} extinction. In 2006 for example, the zoo took part in 36 European breeding programs, thus, a quarter of the 130 species which it shelters is the subject of an international program of breeding. Among these list, one finds the gorilla of the plains, the orangutan of Borneo, the scimitar oryx, or the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> of South America.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The {{following is a}} list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with: addax, Chinese alligator, mandrill, bongo, kori bustard, fishing cat, cheetah, chimpanzee, Lake Victoria cichlids, Andean condor, wattled crane, African elephant, addra gazelle, white-cheeked gibbon, gorilla, great hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, spectacled langur, ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemur, mona monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Bali mynah, ocelot, okapi, Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, Oriental small-clawed otter, thick-billed parrot, African penguin, Mauritius pink pigeon, Aruba Island rattlesnake, black rhinoceros, Louisiana pine snake, black-handed spider monkey, cottontop tamarin, <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin,</b> Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger, Puerto Rican crested toad, radiated tortoise, Swainson's toucan, and Grevy's zebra.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{challenge}} of illness, the forty-two translocated <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> tamarins' population grew to over 200 in União Biological Reserve. The number of wild <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> is now up in the thousands in all reserves and ranches combined in Brazil. These numbers were once down in the 200s in 1991. By 2025, the number of <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> that are protected is projected to be greater than 2000.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, estrous {{synchrony}} {{was reported}} in female <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> by French and Stribley. Their subjects consisted of five adult female <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> that were housed in two groups. Two females were housed with adult males and three females (a mother and two daughters) were housed with an adult male and infant male. They reported a 2.11 day difference in peak cycle estrogen for the two groups, which was less than the 4.5 day difference that they calculated would be the difference based on <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> having a 19-day estrous cycle. Schank reanalyzed their study {{with the help of}} computer simulation and reported that a 2.11 day difference was not likely statistically significant. Monfort and colleagues conducted a study with eight females housed in pairs and found no evidence of synchrony.|$|R

500|$|With {{each new}} publication, species are both added and {{removed from the}} list. [...] In some cases, {{removal from the list}} signifies {{improvement}} for the species. [...] With the publication of the 2006–2008 list, four species were removed because of increased conservation efforts: the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus), <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia), mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei), and Perrier's sifaka (Propithecus perrieri). [...] In 2008, the black lion tamarin went from critically endangered to endangered and the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> was similarly promoted in 2003 after three decades of collaborative conservation efforts by zoos and other institutions. [...] Well-protected species such as these still have very small populations, and due to deforestation, new habitat is still needed for their long-term survival. [...] The Hainan black crested gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), which was removed from the 2008–2010 list, still has fewer than 20 individuals left, but significant efforts to protect it are now being made. [...] Mittermeier claimed in 2007 that all 25 species could be elevated off the list within five to ten years if conservation organizations had the necessary resources.|$|E
500|$|... is a blonde-haired {{girl who}} is the fourth Mew Mew {{introduced}} to the readers and {{the youngest of the}} bunch. Infused with the DNA of a <b>Golden</b> <b>Lion</b> <b>Tamarin,</b> Bu-Ling grows a monkey tail and ears while transformed, and fights with a pair of rings. Bu-Ling is introduced as being a busker due to her acrobatic skills to earn money for her family. The other Mew Mews agree that her monkey DNA is a perfect match for her personality as she is full of energy and loves having fun, to the point Minto considers her very immature or childish. A running gag when it comes to referencing the Mew Mews' DNA had Bu-Ling thinking that her DNA is a lion where she is always corrected that she has the DNA of a <b>Golden</b> <b>Lion</b> <b>Tamarin.</b> Despite her age, Bu-Ling is raising her five younger siblings and managing the family finances while their father is training in the mountains. The manga never mentions Bu-Ling's mother while the anime adaptation states that she died. Midway through the series, Bu-Ling befriends Tart when he captures her and holds her hostage. She is reluctant to fight Tart during the final battle until he affirms they have no choice, and cries over him after he is defeated. Bu-Ling kisses Tart {{at the end of the}} series and tells him she does not want it [...] "to be goodbye." [...] He replies by saying that he may return to see her. In the anime adaptation, the relationship between Bu-Ling and Tart is expanded and the circumstances of their initial friendship changes– instead of being saved by the Mew Mews, Tart himself saves Bu-Ling from an underground cavern when he realizes that she is suffocating from a lack of oxygen.|$|E
500|$|In {{its first}} years, the zoo hosted a captive {{breeding}} program ("Operation Oryx") {{with the specific}} goal of reintroducing the almost extinct Arabian oryx to the wild. By the early 1990s this program was still {{one of only two}} programs (the other being the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin)</b> to have gone through the full wilderness-zoo-wilderness sequence. Nine oryx had been caught or donated for the breeding program. However, two pairs were delayed, so the [...] "World Herd" [...] was started in Phoenix in 1963 with only five animals shipped to the zoo and two born quickly after. The two delayed pairs arrived in 1964 to increase the herd to 11 individuals. The program was very successful, and the zoo celebrated its 225th Arabian oryx birth in 2002. The Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in 1972, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1982 when oryx were released to the wild in the Omani Central Desert and Coastal Hills. Additional captive herds have been discovered and used as the basis for reintroductions, for instance in Saudi Arabia, but there has been some interbreeding even with these herds and most of the Arabian oryx in the wild today have ancestors from the Phoenix Zoo.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests that}} <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>{{tamarins}}</b> {{need in order}} to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches, farms and urbanization. Sometimes very small areas or 'pockets' of forest are left but these are too small for the tamarins to survive in. In the past, tamarins were collected for sale to the pet trade or for use in research laboratories. The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> are located in the South American house.|$|R

Their {{original}} habitat was located from {{the southern part of}} the state of Rio de Janeiro to {{the southern part of the}} state of Espirito Santo. However, deforestation of Atlantic Forest for commercial purposes, predation, and capture of the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarins</b> for animal trade and sale as pets has limited their population to about five municipalities across Rio de Janeiro. Most of the population is now found in the Poco des Antas Biological Reserve in Rio de Janeiro.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Leontopithecus rosalia, mico-leão-dourado [...] ), {{also known}} as the golden marmoset, is a small New World monkey of the family Callitrichidae. Native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil, the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> is an {{endangered}} species with an estimated wild population of about 3,500 individuals spread between four places along southeastern Brazil, and a captive population maintained at about 490 individuals among 150 zoos.|$|E
50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> has a diverse, {{omnivorous}} diet {{consisting of}} fruits, flowers, nectar, bird eggs, insects and small vertebrates. They rely on microhabitats for foraging and other daily activities and tamarins will use bromeliads, palm crowns, palm leaf sheaths, woody crevices, lianas, vine tangles, tree bark, rotten logs, and leaf litters. The <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> uses its fingers to extract prey from crevices, under leaves, and in dense growth; a behavior known as micromanipulation. It {{is made possible}} by elongated hands and fingers. Insects make up to 10-15% of its diet. Much of the rest is made of small, sweet, pulpy fruits. During the rainy season, the <b>golden</b> <b>lion</b> <b>tamarin</b> mainly eats fruit, however during drier times, it must eat more of other foods like nectar and gums. Small vertebrates are also consumed more at these times as insects become less abundant.|$|E
