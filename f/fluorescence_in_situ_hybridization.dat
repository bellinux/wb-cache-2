40|$|International audienceThe gill {{chamber of}} deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata hosts a dense community of epibiotic bacteria dominated by filamentous Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Using metagenomics on shrimp from the Rainbow hydrothermal vent field, {{we showed that}} both epibiont groups {{have the potential to}} grow autotrophically and oxidize reduced sulfur compounds or hydrogen with oxygen or nitrate. For carbon fixation, the Epsilonproteobacteria use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas the Gammaproteobacteria use the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Only the epsilonproteobacterial epibionts had the genes necessary for producing ammonium. This ability likely minimizes direct competition between epibionts and also broadens the spectrum of environmental conditions that the shrimp may successfully inhabit. We identified genes likely to be involved in shrimp-epibiont interactions, as well as genes for nutritional and detoxification processes that might benefit the host. Shrimp epibionts at Rainbow are often coated with iron oxyhydroxides, whose origin is intensely debated. We identified 16 S rRNA sequences and functional genes affiliated with iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria, which indicates that biological iron oxidation might play a role in forming these deposits. <b>Fluorescence</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> confirmed the presence of active Zetaproteobacteria in the R. exoculata gill chamber, thus providing the first evidence for a Zetaproteobacteria-invertebrate association...|$|R

40|$|The conserved {{family of}} NXF {{proteins}} has {{been implicated in}} the export of messenger RNAs from the nucleus. In metazoans, NXFs heterodimerize with p 15. The yeast genome encodes a single NXF protein (Mex 67 p), but there are multiple nxf genes in metazoans. Whether metazoan NXFs are functionally redundant, or their multiplication reflects an adaptation to a greater substrate complexity or to tissue-specific requirements has not been established. The Drosophila genome encodes one p 15 homolog and four putative NXF proteins (NXF 1 to NXF 4). Here we show that depletion of the endogenous pools of NXF 1 or p 15 from Drosophila cells inhibits growth and results in a rapid and robust accumulation of polyadenylated RNAs within the nucleus. <b>Fluorescence</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations</b> show that export of both heat-shock and non-heat-shock mRNAs, as well as intron-containing and intronless mRNAs is inhibited.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of nitrifying bacteria to acidic conditions {{is a well-known}} phenomenon and generally attributed to the lack and/or toxicity of substrates (NH 3 and HNO 2) with decreasing pHs. In contrast, we observed strong nitrification at a pH around 4 in biofilms grown on chalk particles and investigated the following hypotheses: the presence of less acidic microenvironments and/or the existence of acid-tolerant nitrifiers. Microelectrode measurements (<b>in</b> <b>situ</b> and under various experimental conditions) showed {{no evidence of a}} neutral microenvironment, either within the highly active biofilm colonizing the chalk surface or within a control biofilm grown on a nonbuffering (i. e., sintered glass) surface under acidic pH. A 16 S rRNA approach (clone libraries and <b>fluorescence</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>hybridizations)</b> did not reveal uncommon nitrifying (potentially acid-tolerant) strains. Instead, we found a strongly acidic microenvironment, evidence for a clear adaptation to the low pH <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> and the presence of nitrifying populations related to subgroups with low K ms for ammonia (Nitrosopira spp., Nitrosomonas oligotropha, and Nitrospira spp.). Acid-consuming (chalk dissolution) and acid-producing (ammonia oxidation) processes are equilibrated on a low-pH steady state that is controlled by mass transfer limitation through the biofilm. Strong affinity to ammonia and possibly the expression of additional functions, e. g., ammonium transporters, are adaptations that allow nitrifiers to cope with acidic conditions in biofilms and other habitats...|$|R

A FISH analysis of B. tabaci eggs, nymphs, and adults revealed a unique concentration of Rickettsia around the gut and follicle cells, as well as a random distribution in the hemolymph. We postulate that the Rickettsia enters the oocyte together with the bacteriocytes, leaves these symbiont-housing cells when the egg is laid, multiplies and spreads throughout the egg during embryogenesis and, subsequently, disperses throughout the body of the hatching nymph, excluding the bacteriomes. Although the role Rickettsia plays in the biology of the whitefly is currently unknown, the vertical transmission on the one hand and the partial within-population infection on the other suggest a phenotype that is advantageous under certain conditions but may be deleterious enough to prevent fixation under others...|$|R

Consistent with its morphological characteristics, 18 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) phylogenies indicate that P. sphagnophila is specifically related to Petalomonas cantuscygni, the only other Petalomonas species sequenced to date. One of the peculiar characteristics of P. sphagnophila {{is the presence of}} several green-pigmented particles ~ 5 [*]μm in diameter in its cytoplasm, which a previously published study suggested to be cyanobacterial endosymbionts.

TEM, 16 S rDNA library sequencing and a battery of PCR experiments show that the presence of the five P. sphagnophila endobionts varies markedly among the four geographic collections and even among individuals collected from the same location but at different time points.

Bacterial populations were in the highest proportion (> 95 %) in January. Conversely, archaeal populations were in the highest proportion in July and September (∼ 50 %) and were virtually absent in the winter. Bacterial and archaeal populations correlated with conductivity and rainfall. High concentrations of dissolved solids, as reflected by high conductivity values (up to 125 mS/cm), occurred in the summer and correlated with high archaeal populations and proportionally lower bacterial populations. Eukaryotes were not detected in January, when total microbial cell numbers were lowest (30 %) at moderate pHs and temperatures (∼ 2. 5 and 20 °C) in sites that were peripheral to primary acid-generating sites and lowest (0 to 5 %) at low-pH sites (pH ∼ 0. 5) that were in contact with the ore body.

Techniques like self-organizing maps (SOMs) have been applied to cluster metagenomes into taxon-specific bins in order to link biodiversity with functions, but have not been applied to broad-scale NGS-based metagenomics yet. Here, we provide a novel implementation, demonstrate its potential and practicability, and provide a web-based service for public usage. Evaluation with published data sets mimicking varyingly complex habitats resulted into classification specificities and sensitivities of close to 100 % to above 90 % from phylum to genus level for assemblies exceeding 8 [*]kb for low and medium complexity data.
