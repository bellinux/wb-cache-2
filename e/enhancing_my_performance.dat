The play would be produced here at BSC but acted and directed by theatre professionals. I have chosen this role as it challenges theatre artists in ways beyond that of most contemporary roles; performing the role of Martha is often considered akin to performing the role of Hamlet. This artistic project would serve mainly to <b>enhance</b> <b>my</b> teaching here at BSC. At this stage in my career and as the primary performance teacher in the Theatre Arts program, I feel {{it is imperative that}} I perform a role of this magnitude to achieve a higher and even new standard in my classroom teaching...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of my approach {{to the role of}} Iago in William Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Othello. The thesis explores my training as an actor and the struggles that have challenged me in the past. I then discuss my acting process for Iago in which specific imagery, sounds, and energies in Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s text influence my employment of Michael Chekhov 2 ̆ 7 s acting technique. By using this technique, I am able to make specific psychological and physical choices that authenticate <b>my</b> <b>performance</b> as a character who is not a racist villain, but a victim who suffers from multiple personality disorders. Through this approach, I hope to draw empathy for Iago and reflect modern society 2 ̆ 7 s view of mental illness and its role in violence. This approach also challenges me to overcome my struggle with the Michael Chekhov technique to continue <b>enhancing</b> <b>my</b> classical training. My use of these techniques has helped me blend psychological and physical choices on stage in order to create an engaging performance...|$|R

Cruz Gonz??lez,, Meredith Greenburg, James A Hatfield, Suzanna ReganActing, Drama, Pedagogy, Performing, Rehearsal, TheatreIn {{this report}} I {{look back on}} the process of {{pursuing}} a double option in dramatic writing and performance. Focusing on the performance option for this thesis, I highlight the central lessons I have learned in my coursework regarding collaboration, auditioning skills, and acting approach for stage and film work. I also track the administrative process necessary to pursue the double emphasis. The report proceeds to focus on <b>my</b> <b>performance</b> project acting in Steve Yockey's play [every little thing]. I chronicle the rehearsal process paying special attention to the collaboration between the director and actor. I then relate the performance to larger themes in my work focusing on the performance of memory. I conclude by considering the importance of this performance option in context of my pedagogical approach. The report includes the ways this journey has both stretched me as a performer and <b>enhanced</b> <b>my</b> teaching qualifications. Television, Film and Media Studie...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{embodied by}} this performance {{was designed to}} explore and develop the role of wordless singing in my music practice, in both improvised and composed contexts. I have defined wordless singing as any musical vocalisation using non-lexical (not pertaining to language) vocables and utterances, including some extended vocal techniques. By exploring various applications of wordless singing, this research has <b>enhanced</b> <b>my</b> understanding and use of this essential component of <b>my</b> <b>performance</b> practice. As an integral yet discrete element of vocal improvising, singing without words presents unique challenges to vocalists, as well as opportunities, and merits dedicated study and practice in its own right. Singers will often have established relationships between lyrics, their sounds and meanings, and aspects of their performance such as tone, affect, phrasing, contour, dynamics, rhythm and inflections. When making moment-tomoment vocable choices as in improvisation, a singer is often a position of unprecedented autonomy, which in many ways requires redefining of their creative process. This {{research has focused on}} promoting musically considered, informed and nuanced vocable choices in my improvisations, that support and work in conjunction with harmonic language. Whether singing, improvising or composing, through my music practice, I primarily aim to create external realisations and expressions of my emotions, thoughts and ideas, many of which transcend the verbal. Composing for wordless voice often <b>enhances</b> <b>my</b> creative and expressive freedom, for uniquely sonic and non-representational explorations of such concepts. In this research, composition has allowed me to focus, control, revise and manipulate my application and examination of specific vocables, as distinct from my improvisatory explorations, which by their nature incorporate significant indeterminacy of vocable use. As a singer and composer of jazz and contemporary improvised music, my original works also provide the most relevant and appropriate vehicles through which to explore and develop an individual approach to wordless singing and improvisation in my practice. I have composed and performed in a live recital, nine works for this purpose, which incorporate wordless singing to varying extents and in a range of musical contexts...|$|R
