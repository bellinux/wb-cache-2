50|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 {{miles north of the}} University. DuPont wanted {{to address the problem of}} precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an electrical method similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with electrostatic precipitation as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell’s work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, acid mists and fogs that spewed from turn-of-the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high-voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chamber</b> from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric acid mist, and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for pollutant removal from industrial waste flows to this day.|$|E
40|$|Glass {{resistive}} plate chambers (GRPCs) {{have been}} proposed as the basic element for the JUNO top tracker detector. With good uniform performance and low cost, GRPCs are well suited for large area experiments. Glass RPCs used in underground experiments require specially designed cassette and gas flow systems, since the glass is fragile and easily corroded by acid generated by water entering the <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chamber.</b> High-strength and chemical-resistant glasses {{have been proposed}} for underground experiments. We present here the test results of four GRPC chambers made of different glasses: normal thin glass, two high-strength glasses, and a chemical-resistant glass. The chemical-resistant and high-strength glasses have good surface quality, but their volume resistivities are higher. Higher resistivities lead to a higher required voltage to reach plateau operation, meaning that these glasses can only work in a very low rate experiment...|$|E

50|$|The basic {{principle}} of GASMAS {{is shown in}} figure 1. Laser light is sent into a sample with gas cavities, which could either be small pores (left) or larger <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chambers.</b> The heterogeneous nature of the porous material often give rise to strong light scattering, and pathlengths are often surprisingly long (10 or 100 times the sample dimension are not uncommon). In addition, light will experience absorption related to the solid material. When travelling through the material, light will travel partly through the pores, and will thus experience the spectrally sharp gas absorption. Light leaving the material will carry this information, and can be collected by a detector either in a transmission mode (left) or in a reflection mode (right).|$|R
50|$|The argonauts (genus Argonauta, {{the only}} extant genus {{in the family}} Argonautidae) are a group of pelagic octopuses.

This structure lacks the <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chambers</b> present in chambered nautilus shells {{and is not a}} true cephalopod shell, but rather an evolutionary innovation unique to the genus Argonauta. It is used as a brood chamber and for trapped surface air to maintain buoyancy. It was once speculated that the argonauts did not manufacture their own eggcases but instead borrowed them from other organisms, in the manner of hermit crabs. Experiments by pioneering marine biologist Jeanne Villepreux-Power in the early 19th century disproved this hypothesis, as Villepreux-Power was able to successfully rear argonaut young and observe the development of their shells.|$|R

40|$|The teleost {{swim bladder}} is a <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chamber</b> {{located in the}} {{abdominal}} cavity just below the vertebral column. It consists {{of one or more}} inter-connected chambers which may be partially divided into ' subchambers ' by septa that are extensions of the inner lining of the swim-bladder wall (Demski, Gerald & Popper, 1973; Greene, 1924; Tavolga, 1962 and others). The swim bladder appears to have multiple roles in fish behaviour. One major function is as a hydrostatic organ involved in control of the density of the fish through changes in the amount of gas within the bladder (Steen, 1970). A second role in many species is in the production and detection of sounds (see reviews by Demski et al. 1973; Lowenstein, 1971; Popper & Fay, 1973; Tavolga, 1971). During the production of certain types of sound the swim bladder acts as an acoustic transformer between the water and vibrating body structure (e. g. muscles) (Demski et al. 1973; Harris, 1964; Tavolga, 1962; Skoglund, 1959, 1961). While the role in sound detection is not as clear as the role in sound production, the gas-filled bladder is of considerably different density from sea water and so it presents an impedance discontinuity that woul...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{presentation}} of Mike Davies' idea of the polyvalent façade [1], {{the vision of a}} multifunctional building skin has produced a number of technological developments taking first steps in this direction. Switchable façades with electrochromic or gasochromic glazing have been investigated for many years. Research has mainly concentrated on material and device development [2]. Large-area chromogenic devices are in the discussion for building applications. Recently a large European project has treated the architectural and technical integration of switchable devices into buildings as well as durability and lifecycle aspects [3]. Glazing companies still balk at the risk of a market introduction of glazings which can change its colour dynamically and thus change characteristic properties like total solar energy transmittance and visual transmittance. In this situation it might seem hazardous to try and incorporate even more functions into a glazing unit than the mentioned technologies. In spite of these considerations, it has been the goal of this research to develop a glass façade system that actively controls not only visual light transmission and the solar energy transmission but may even incorporate further processes in the building envelope The extraction and provision of heat within the transparent façade, i. e. at the interface between the artificial interior and natural exterior environments, offers the possibility to completely control the energy flows and comfort conditions at the façade. For this purpose, a four-layer glazing element with two fluid-filled cavities and one gas-filled cavity between the panes was designed (see Figure 1). The outer liquid layer in cavity I reduces the solar irradiation by absorption even in the clear state. Excess solar heat gains are kept outside. During periods of very high solar radiation, the clear fluid in the outer cavity I is replaced by a coloured one thus increasing absorption. In cavity III the liquid layer holds the surface temperature constant at room temperature - in summer it can be cooled down whereas in winter heat can be added to the room. A heat pump could be used for providing the temperature levels needed for these purposes. These large-area, transparent heating and cooling elements show uniform temperatures over their entire surface, which leads to an increased interior comfort range since convection is reduced due to large areas with uniform temperatures. The <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chamber</b> II in the middle, along with the Low-E coating of the third glass pane, further reduces energy transmission in winter (heat losses) and during the summer (solar gains). Shading, heating and cooling therefore {{become an integral part of}} the glazed transparent building envelope which is adaptable to the requirements of the different seasons (Figure 2) Of course this vision is not without risk. It has to be transformed from an idea to a reliable technological system before it can be used by designers and engineers to produce completely different buildings...|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} {{improved}} spatial resolution in nuclear medicine {{has long been}} recognized. Notable attempts {{to achieve this goal}} are the <b>gas-filled</b> wire <b>chambers</b> and solid-state detectors. (1) However, at energies above 100 keV, <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chambers</b> suffer from poor detection efficiency and a long recoil electron range in the gas. While it is advantageous to pressurize these chambers to 10 or more atmospheres, structural design of the thin window presents a formidable task. High-resolution optimal collimators do not appear to have sufficient strength {{to be used as a}} pressure support window. Solid-state detectors, while having the potential of a gamma camera with a superb energy resolution, are presently studied on a very small scale due to technological and cost limitations. Aside from the detector, the parallel-hole collimator presents a real limit to the resolution of the camera. A factor of two improvement in the resolution results in a factor of four loss in the collimator's transmission. A careful analysis of optimal collimators and the application of collimators designed for a specific depth range and resoluation are part of our overall program. Our goal has been the development of a liquid-xenon multiwire gamma camera with 2 - to 3 -mm spatial resolution, high counting-rate performance, high sensitivity, and the potential for scaling-up in size. Important ingredients for successful imaging in the prototype chamber discussed in this paper were the discovery of electron multiplication in liquid xenon, (2) the development of reliable purification techniques, (3) and the ability to extract electrons from the liquid into the gaseous phase. This paper is specifically addressed to the subject of detector development with liquid-xenon totally-filled chambers and recent work with dual-phase chambers in which the {gamma} rays are converted in the liquid phase and are electronically detected in the gaseous phase...|$|R

40|$|Cephalopods may {{be divided}} into five types {{according}} to their buoyancy. Members of several families such as the Octopodidae, Loliginidae and Ommastrephidae are negatively buoyant and must swim to stay in midwater and are therefore highly muscular animals. Others have mechanisms to make them neutrally buoyant so they can remain suspended in midwater without effort. Nautilus, Spirula and cuttlefishes have low pressure <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chambers</b> and their flesh is muscular and non-buoyant (Denton & Gilpin-Brown, 1973). Squids of one family, the Gonatidae, have a low density oil in their livers to give buoyancy but most of their body is muscular. Some oceanic octopods have very watery tissues in which lighter chloride ions replace sulphate ions (Denton & Shaw, 1961). In 12 of the 26 teuthoid families the buoyancy is provided by low-density ammonia-rich solution in their body and head tissues or in an expanded coelomic cavity (Clarke, Denton & Gilpin-Brown, 1979). These ammoniacal squids are extremely abundant in the oceans {{of the world and}} form {{a large part of the}} diet of birds, cetaceans, seals and fish (Clarke, 1977). When their biomass is estimated from their utilization by predators it is important to know their properties as food and, in particular, their calorific values. As pointed out by Croxall & Prince in a review of the calorific values of cephalopods (1982), all the known values are of muscular, negatively buoyant species because they are of value as food for humans but no measurements have been made on the ammoniacal or oily species which are probably as important, or even more important, in the economy of the ocean (Clarke, 1983) ...|$|R

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} the inertial fusion energy (IFE) approach to commercial energy production is that the fusion driver is well separated from the fusion confinement chamber. This ''standoff'' feature means the driver is largely isolated from fusion reaction products. Further, inertial confinement fusion (ICF) target ignition (with modest gain) is now scheduled to be demonstrated at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) using a laser driver system. The NIF program will, to a considerable extent, validate indirectly-driven heavy-ion fusion (HIF) target designs for IFE. However, it remains that HIF standoff between the final focus system and the fusion target needs to be seriously addressed. In fact, there now exists a timely opportunity for the Office of Fusion Energy Science (OFES) to experimentally explore the feasibility {{of one of the}} attractive final transport options in the fusion chamber: the self-pinched transport mode. Presently, there are several mainline approaches for HIF beam transport and neutralization in the fusion chamber. These range from the (conservative) vacuum ballistic focus, for which there is much experience from high energy research accelerators, to highly neutralized ballistic focus, which matches well to lower voltage acceleration with resulting lower driver costs. Alternatively, Z-discharge channel transport and self-pinched transport in <b>gas-filled</b> <b>chambers</b> may relax requirements on beam quality and final focusing systems, leading to even lower driver cost. In any case, these alternative methods of transport, especially self-pinched transport, are unusually attractive from the standpoint of chamber design and neutronics. There is no requirement for low chamber pressure. Moreover, only a minuscule fraction of the fusion neutrons can escape from the chamber. Therefore, it is relatively easy to shield sensitive components, e-g., superconducting magnets from any significant neutron flux. Indeed, self-pinched transport and liquid wall protection endow DT fusion with many of the advantages of aneutronic fusion. The question is: will self-pinched transport work? Early theoretical studies indicated that self-pinched transport was not an option because net currents established in gas during beam injection were too small to cause beam pinching. However, recent numerical simulations using the 3 D hybrid code IPROP 3, including the effects of non-local ionization, indicate that self-pinched transport may be possible. The capability to test the concept exists today in scaled experiments using a high-current focused proton beam produced by the Gamble II pulsed-power accelerator at the Naval Research Laboratory. This White Paper describes the implications of the self-pinched transport approach to HIF power plant design and the relevance of proton experiments designed to test the concept. Near-term experiments and analysis are also suggested...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} cancer {{treatment}} with protons critically depends on an accurate prediction of the proton stopping powers for the tissues traversed by the protons. Today, treatment planning in proton radiotherapy {{is based on}} stopping power calculations from densities of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) images. This causes systematic uncertainties in the calculated proton range in a patient of typically 3 - 4 %, but can become even 10 % in bone regions [1 - 8]. This may lead to no dose {{in parts of the}} tumor and too high dose in healthy tissues [9]. A direct measurement of proton stopping powers with high-energy protons will allow reducing these uncertainties and will improve the quality of the treatment. Several studies have shown that a sufficiently accurate radiograph can be obtained by tracking individual protons traversing a phantom (patient) [4, 6, 10]. Our studies benefit from the <b>gas-filled</b> time projection <b>chambers</b> based on GridPix technology [11], developed at Nikhef, capable of tracking a single proton.

Measurements were simulated with the Geant 4 toolkit. First experimental and simulated energy radiographs are in very good agreement [12].

Astronom-ical evidence suggests that there is about five times more cold dark matter than baryonic matter in the universe [1]. A favored scenario is that cold dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). The race is now on to directly detect WIMPs by measuring their collisions with target nuclei in the lab-oratory. In recent years, impressive progress has been made with cryogenic solid-and liquid-phase targets. Spin-independent, elastic WIMP/nucleon scattering has been excluded down to cross sections of order 10 − 8 pb for WIMP masses from 30 to 100 GeV/c 2 [2]. For smaller WIMP-masses, however, the status is much less clear. At least three experiments have observed signals that appear com-patible with WIMPs of order 10 GeV/c 2. DAMA/LIBRA has claimed positive observation [5], the CoGeNT collaboration has reported an ”irreducible excess of bulk-like events ” [7], and most recently CRESST-II has observed an excess with significance larger than 4 σ [10]. When interpreted as spin-independent, elastic WIMP/nucleon scattering of 10 -GeV WIMPs, these results are inconsistent with limits set by XENON 100 [9] and CDMS [8].

40|$|Nanocomposite scintillators, {{consisting}} of nanoscale (< 50 nm diameter) particles suspended in a matrix material, may extend both {{the number of}} scintillating materials that can be practically employed in radiation measurements {{and the range of}} scintillator applications. Current neutron capture cross-section experiments are unable to measure the cross-sections of isotopes with half-lives shorter than a few hundred days due to the slow signal decay times of the scintillators used. Cerium fluoride (CeF 3) has been identified as a possible substitute, but CeF 3 crystals are not currently available in large sizes or quantities. CeF 3 nanoparticles with sizes < 20 nm were fabricated and suspended in a liquid scintillator as a nanocomposite detector. The structural properties of the nanoparticles and the optical properties and radiation response of the suspensions were characterized and used to optimize the mass loading of CeF 3 in the nanocomposite detectors. An optimized detector was tested in a neutron beam line; compared with a BaF 2 detector module, the CeF 3 nanocomposite scintillator was able to detect neutron capture resonances from neutrons with energies one order of magnitude higher. Neutron flux measurements for beam line experiments are commonly performed using fission <b>chambers,</b> <b>gas-filled</b> detectors containing one or more foils that are thinly coated with a fissionable material. The design requirements of the fission chamber result in low efficiency and long signal rise times. A faster and more efficient neutron flux monitor could be created by loading fissionable nanoparticles into a scintillating matrix. As a proof of principle, a fissionable molecular complex was created and loaded into a liquid scintillator. Optical characterization techniques were used to verify that the scintillator luminescence was unaffected by the presence of the fissionable complex. Characterization in a neutron beam line determined that a liquid scintillator loaded with fissionable material showed a ~ 400 % higher count rate due to fission, compared with an unloaded liquid scintillator, across the energy range of detected neutrons.

40|$|An {{alternative}} approach to energy integrating systems is photon counting which provides higher dose efficiency through efficient noise rejection and optimal energy weighting, and, moreover, is not susceptible to memory artifacts such as image lag and ghosting. The first large-area photon counting imager was Charpak's Nobel Prize winning {{invention of the}} <b>gas-filled</b> multiwire proportional <b>chamber</b> (MWPC), which revolutionized the field of radiation detection in 1968. In most applications, however, {{the use of a}} solid detection medium is preferable because solid densities are about three orders-of-magnitude greater than gas, and thus, they can yield much smaller detector dimensions with unsurpassed spatial and temporal resolution. Thus far, crystalline Cadmium Zinc Telluride is the only room-temperature solid-state detector that meets the requirements for photon counting imaging. However, the material is grown in small ingots and production costs are high for large-area imaging applications. The problem is that disordered (or non-crystalline) solids, which are easier and less expensive to develop over large-area than single crystalline solids, have been ruled out as viable photon counting detectors because of their poor temporal resolution, or more specifically, extremely low carrier mobilities and transit-time-limited photoresponse. To circumvent the problem of poor charge transport in disordered solids with a conventional planar detector structure, we propose unipolar charge sensing by establishing a strong near-field effect using an electrostatic shield within the material. We introduce the concept of time-differential photoresponse in unipolar solids and show that their temporal resolution can be improved substantially to reach the intrinsic physical limit set by spatial dispersion. Inspired by Charpak's MWPC and its variants, and for the first time, we have implemented an electrostatic shield inside evaporated amorphous selenium (a-Se) using the proposed lithography-based microstrip solid-state detector (MSSD). The fabricated devices are characterized with optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray impulse-like excitations. Using optical time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, we show {{for the first time a}} unipolar Gaussian TOF transient from the new MSSD structure, instead of a rectangular response with a Gaussian-integral at the tail which is a typical response of a conventional planar device. The measured optical and x-ray TOF results verify the time-differential property of the electrostatic shield and the practicality of the dispersion-limited photoresponse. Furthermore, we use single gamma-ray photon excitations to probe detector's temporal resolution in pulse mode for photon counting. For the MSSD, we show a depth-independent signal for photon absorption across the bulk and a reduction in signal risetime by a factor of 350, comparing performance limiting factors being hole-dispersion for the MSSD and electron-transit-time for the conventional planar device. The time-differential response obtained from the proposed unipolar detector structure enables disordered photoconductive films to become viable candidates for large-area photon counting applications...|$|R
