50|$|In all decaffeination processes, {{coffee is}} always {{decaffeinated}} in its green, unroasted state. The greatest {{challenge to the}} decaffeination process {{is to try to}} separate only the caffeine from the coffee beans while leaving the other chemicals such as sucrose, cellulose, proteins, citric acid, tartaric acid, and formic acid at their original concentrations. This is not an easy task considering coffee contains somewhere around 1,000 chemicals that contribute to the taste and aroma. Since caffeine is a polar, water-soluble substance, water is used in all forms of decaffeination. However, water alone is not the best solution for decaffeination because it is not a selective solvent and therefore removes other soluble substances, including sugars and proteins, as well as caffeine. Therefore, most decaffeination processes use a <b>decaffeinating</b> agent such as methylene chloride, activated charcoal, , or ethyl acetate. These agents help speed up the process and minimize the “washed-out” effects that water alone might have on the taste of decaffeinated coffee.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{epidemiological}} {{association between}} coffee drinking and decreased risk of {{type 2 diabetes}} is strong. However, caffeinated coffee acutely impairs glucose metabolism. We assessed acute effects of <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee on glucose and insulin levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This was a randomized, cross-over, placebocontrolled trial {{of the effects of}} <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine on glucose, insulin, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels during a 2 -h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 11 young men. RESULTS — Within the first hour of the OGTT, glucose and insulin were higher for <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee than for placebo (P � 0. 05). During the whole OGTT, <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee yielded higher insulin than placebo and lower glucose and a higher insulin sensitivity index than caffeine. Changes in GIP could not explain any beverage effects on glucose and insulin. CONCLUSIONS — Some types of <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee may acutely impair glucose metabolism but less than caffeine. Nineteen of 22 epidemiological studies concluded that long-term consumption of coffee, both caffeinated and <b>decaffeinated,</b> can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes (1 – 3), but several investigators have warned that the caffeine in caffeinated coffee can impair glucose metabolism (e. g., 4, 5).

The application at industrial scale (<b>decaffeinating</b> of tea and coffee, hop extraction or removal of pesticides from rice), activity in supercritical extraction producing total extract from the raw material or different fractions by using the fractionated separation of beverages (rum, cognac, whisky, wine, beer cider), of citrus oils and of lipids (fish oils, tall oil) were also discussed. The main interest is still for the extraction of natural raw materials producing food ingredients, nutraceuticals and phytopharmaceuticals but also cleaning purposes were tested such as the decontamination of soils the removal of residual solvents from pharmaceutical products, the extraction of flame retardants from electronic waste or precision degreasing and cleaning of mechanical and electronic parts.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2). In addition, the feasibility of building a small-scale low cost system will be explained. A supercritical fluid is a fluid which exhibits properties between liquid and gas with liquid like densities and viscosities similar to a gas. Since the discovery of supercritical fluids in 1822, the use of supercritical fluids, specifically supercritical CO 2, has grown in popularity. The application of supercritical CO 2 has continued to grow in industrial applications since the 1970 ’s. Supercritical CO 2 ’s has many beneficial properties as a “green” solvent. Supercritical CO 2 as a solvent is able to be implemented {{in a wide range}} of applications from aerospace, microchip manufacturing, food production, biomedical, pharmaceutical, dry-cleaning, and many more. This thesis project included designing, building and testing a supercritical CO 2 extraction apparatus that examines the use of supercritical CO 2 as a solvent in the extraction process of <b>decaffeinating</b> coffee. Due to the fact that supercritical CO 2 requires high pressure operating conditions, the apparatus design is important not only for function but also for safety. In the description portion of this paper, design considerations related to each component’s function and their specific roles in the overall system are clearly stated. Furthermore, the build process is outlined along with the overall step-by-step operation of the apparatus. Different methods of data measurements are taken while the system is running, in order to interpret the apparatus’ overall functionality. Through the exploration of this experimental data, the results were compared between different operating parameters. In order to determine the feasibility of the supercritical apparatus, the devise was tested by applying the supercritical CO 2 as a solvent for the extraction of caffeine from coffee beans. Analysis of the analytical data recorded from experimental testing confirms that the apparatus produced supercritical CO 2. After testing specific operating conditions, it is proven that the supercritical CO 2 is able to function as a “green” solvent in this small-scale system. The experimental results from these analytical runs are compared with theoretical maximums in order to determine the efficiency of the devise. Lastly, the paper presents an overview including lessons learned from the design process and from the information gathered. Data from experimental testing is interpreted and the system design is reevaluated with suggestions for future improvements...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background: Green tea is a {{rich source}} of the strong {{antioxidant}} compounds, the catechins, and the unique amino acid, theanine, which have been linked with health benefits such as prevention of certain types of cancers and cardiovascular diseases, decrease in obesity and improvement of the immune system. However, epidemiological studies suggest that the volume of green tea required to obtain health benefits is rather large, ranging from 5 - 10 cups a day. Therefore, it is questionable whether individuals, especially in western countries where they are not used to drinking green tea, can consume a large enough quantity of green tea to obtain the levels of the green tea bioactive compounds needed for health benefits. Therefore, extraction of the catechins and theanine from green tea to provide concentrated preparations for use as food supplements or as additives for functional foods has been considered as a way to increase the consumption of these green tea bioactive compounds. In addition, green tea extracts and powders can be utilised in various foods to prolong their shelf-life. Green tea also contains a high level of caffeine, which can work as a mild central nervous stimulant. However, caffeine can cause some negative effects in some people and therefore, its removal from green tea products needs to be addressed. Furthermore, {{as a consequence of the}} concerns relative to the use of organic solvents, which are usually used for extractions of plant materials in the food industry, water is the only solvent which should be used. Another way of increasing the intake of the beneficial green tea components is to ensure that they are well extracted when people prepare their green tea themselves. A low extraction of the compounds could be one of the reasons why large amounts of the beverage appear to be needed to obtain the health benefits. Hypothesis and Aims: The current study hypothesised that the aqueous extraction of the three bioactive components, the catechins, theanine and caffeine, from loose leaf green tea or green tea in tea bags, could be improved and that aqueous extractions could be used to prepare decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea catechin powders. The overall aims were to 1) improve the aqueous extraction of the three main bioactive components, catechins, theanine and caffeine from loose leaf green tea, 2) to prepare decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea catechin powders from freshly harvested young and old green tea leaves using water as the only solvent for the extractions and freeze drying and spray drying to dry the aqueous extracts, and 3) to improve the extraction of the three green tea bioactive components form green tea in teabags using water and the microwave oven. Results: The results showed that the extraction of the catechins from loose leaf green tea could be improved by brewing ground green tea (≤ 1 mm) twice: once at 80 °C for 30 min with a water-to-tea ratio of 12 : 1 mL/g and once at 80 °C for 30 min with a water-to-tea ratio of 8 : 1 mL/g. The extraction of the theanine from loose leaf green tea could be also improved by brewing ground green tea (0. 5 - 1 mm) at 80 °C for 30 min with a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g. Water was also found to be effective for <b>decaffeinating</b> freshly harvested young (apical bud to fourth leaf on the growing shoot) and old tea leaves (the fifth to tenth leaves down the stem). Blanching the young tea leaves at 100 °C for 4 min at a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g removed 83 % of the caffeine while retaining 94 % of the catechins whereas blanching the old tea leaves at 100 °C for 10 min at a water-to-tea ratio of 20 : 1 mL/g removed 80 % of the caffeine while retaining 83 % of the catechins. Three types of green tea powders: decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea powders were also prepared by brewing, filtering, concentrating extracts and then either freeze drying or spray drying them into powders. Both freeze drying and spray drying were found to be suitable for drying the green tea aqueous extracts. However, in terms of cost-effectiveness, spray drying was considered as a method of choice and its optimal conditions were found to be 180 °C for the inlet temperature and 115 °C for the outlet temperature. These green tea powders had catechin levels of 174 - 197 mg/g and theanine levels of 7 - 22 mg/g. The caffeine levels were 6. 1 - 7. 3 mg/g for decaffeinated powder, 21. 3 - 21. 8 mg/g for normal caffein powder and 94. 8 mg/g for caffeine-enriched powder. In addition, these green tea powders had excellent physical properties such as high water solubility (≥ 96 %) and low moisture content (< 2. 5 %). Finally, the results indicated that brewing teabags for 3 min at room temperature in 200 mL of boiled water, as suggested by the manufacturers, was not efficient as only 62 % of the catechins, 76 % of the caffeine and 80 % of the theanine were extracted from the teabags. However, the extraction of these three bioactive components could be improved by first brewing the teabags in freshly boiled water for 0. 5 min at room temperature followed by irradiation for 1 min in a microwave oven. This method improved the extraction of the catechins, caffeine and theanine by 34 %, 29 % and 14 %, respectively, in comparison with the common brewing method of 3 min in 200 mL of boiled water. Conclusions: In conclusion, the hypothesis was supported and the aims were achieved. The aqueous extraction of the three main bioactive components, the catechins, theanine and caffeine from green tea was optimised and improved. In addition, using water as the only solvent, this study developed methods to prepare decaffeinated dried green tea and decaffeinated, normal caffeine and caffeine-enriched green tea catechin powders from freshly harvested young and old green tea leaves.

The present pilot study examined the acute effects of <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee with regular chlorogenic acid content and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee with high chlorogenic acid content on mood and cognitive processes, as measured by behavioral tasks and event-related potentials (ERPs). Performance and ERP responses to a battery of cognitive tasks were recorded at baseline and following the equivalent of three cups of coffee in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 39 healthy older participants. Compared with the <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee with regular chlorogenic acid and placebo, caffeinated coffee showed a robust positive effect on higher-level mood and attention processes. To a lesser extent, the <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee high in chlorogenic acid also improved some mood and behavioral measures, relative to regular <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee. Our pilot results suggest that non-caffeine compounds in coffee such as the chlorogenic acids may be capable of exerting some acute behavioral effects, thus warranting further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Findings from epidemiology, {{preclinical}} {{and clinical}} {{studies indicate that}} consumption of coffee could have beneficial effects against dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The benefits appear to come from caffeinated coffee, but not <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee or pure caffeine itself. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to use metabolomics approach to delineate the discriminant metabolites between caffeinated and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee, which could have contributed to the observed therapeutic benefits. Gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) -based metabolomics approach was employed to characterize the metabolic differences between caffeinated and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed distinct separation between the two types of coffee (cumulative Q 2 = 0. 998). A total of 69 discriminant metabolites were identified based on the OPLS-DA model, with 37 and 32 metabolites detected to be higher in caffeinated and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee, respectively. These metabolites include several benzoate and cinnamate-derived phenolic compounds, organic acids, sugar, fatty acids, and amino acids. Our study successfully established GC-TOF-MS based metabolomics approach as a highly robust tool in discriminant analysis between caffeinated and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee samples. Discriminant metabolites identified in this study are biologically relevant and provide valuable insights into therapeutic research of coffee against AD. Our data also hint at possible involvement of gut microbial metabolism to enhance therapeutic potential of coffee components, which represents an interesting area fo...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that coffee drinking is associated with reduced mortality of cardiovascular disease. However, its precise mechanisms remain to be clarified. In this study, we examined whether single ingestion of caffeine contained in a cup of coffee improves microvascular function in healthy subjects. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in 27 healthy volunteers. A cup of either caffeinated or <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee was drunk by the subjects, and reactive hyperemia of finger blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. In an interval of more than 2 days, the same experimental protocol was repeated with another coffee in a crossover manner. Caffeinated coffee intake slightly but significantly elevated blood pressure and decreased finger blood flow as compared with <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee intake. There {{was no significant difference in}} heart rate between caffeinated and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee intake. Importantly, caffeinated coffee intake significantly enhanced post-occlusive reactive hyperemia of finger blood flow, an index of microvascular endothelial function, compared with <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee intake. These results provide the first evidence that caffeine contained in a cup of coffee enhances microvascular function in healthy individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background : Coffee {{consumption}} {{has been}} reported to be inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similar associations have also been reported for <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee and tea. We report herein the findings of meta-analyses for the association between coffee, <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee, and tea consumption with risk of diabetes. Methods : Relevant studies were identified through search engines using a combined text word and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) search strategy. Prospective studies that reported an estimate of the association between coffee, <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee, or tea with incident diabetes between 1966 and July 2009. Results : Data from 18 studies with information on 457 922 participants reported on the association between coffee consumption and diabetes. Six (N = 225 516) and 7 studies (N = 286 701) also reported estimates of the association between <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee and tea with diabetes, respectively. We found an inverse log-linear relationship between coffee consumption and subsequent risk of diabetes such that every additional cup of coffee consumed in a day was associated with a 7...|$|R
40|$|Caffeine induces {{modifications}} of {{activity of the}} autonomic nervous system. This study analyzed {{the effect of a}} cup of espresso coffee on the heart rate variability (HRV) power spectral analysis, which is a method providing evaluation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic discharge. In young, healthy sedentary subjects (10 male, 10 female; aged 25 – 30 years), the HRV-power spectrum was evaluated over a period of 150 min after the administration of espresso coffee (caffeine, 75 mg) or <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee (caffeine, < 18 mg) in supine and seated position. Absolute values of the spectrum were summed in low (LF) and high frequencies (HF). The LF and HF spectra were used to estimate the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively. In the supine position, coffee increases HF, while <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee causes little {{modifications of}} HF. In the seated position, HF is not modified by coffee or <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee. Coffee and <b>decaffeinated</b> coffee do not induce any modification of LF in both positions. This experiment indicates that espresso coffee influences parasympathetic activity in the supine positio...|$|R
