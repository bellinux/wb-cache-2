40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a methodological approach to traffic condition recognition, based on driving segment clustering. Traffic condition recognition has many applications to various areas, such as <b>intelligent</b> transportation, adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control,</b> pollutant emissions dispersion, safety, and intelligent control strategies in hybrid electric vehicles. This study {{focuses on the}} application of driving condition recognition to the intelligent control of hybrid electric vehicles. For this purpose, driving features are identified and used for driving segment clustering, using the k-means clustering algorithm. Many combinations of driving features and different numbers of clusters are evaluated, {{in order to achieve}} the best traffic condition recognition results. The results demonstrate that traffic conditions can be correctly recognized in 87 percent of situations using the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a minimalist, {{completely}} distributed freeway {{traffic information}} system is introduced. It involves an autonomous, vehicle-based jam front detection, the information transmission via inter-vehicle communication, and the forecast of the spatial position of jam fronts by reconstructing the spatiotemporal traffic situation based on the transmitted information. The whole system is simulated with an integrated traffic simulator, {{that is based on}} a realistic microscopic traffic model for longitudinal movements and lane changes. The function of its communication module has been explicitly validated by comparing the simulation results with analytical calculations. By means of simulations, we show that the algorithms for a congestion-front recognition, message transmission, and processing predict reliably the existence and position of jam fronts for vehicle equipment rates as low as 3 %. A reliable mode of operation already for small market penetrations is crucial for the successful introduction of inter-vehicle communication. The short-term prediction of jam fronts is not only useful for the driver, but is essential for enhancing road safety and road capacity by <b>intelligent</b> adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> systems.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how a single data record (rather than several time-histories) {{may be used}} to characterize an impending two-car, rear-end collision in which a lead-vehicle and following-vehicle are initially separated by a range of Ro. The characterization process assumes an idealized deceleration profile: a vehicle initially traveling at velocity Vo decelerates instantaneously from zero to a constant level, do, at some brake application time, tb. Therefore, a set of seven single-valued covariates (VFo, dFo, tFb, VLo, dLo, tLb, and Ro) {{may be used to}} describe the actions of both vehicles. In driving simulator tests, the unit may be programmed to meet the ideal deceleration assumption. In naturalistic driving, however, the assumption rarely holds true. Nonetheless, many naturalistic braking events may be accurately represented by a carefully chosen set of covariates. The data reduction procedure described herein shows how the covariates are determined from just two measurements: following-vehicle velocity and inter-vehicle range. The validity of the process is demonstrated using data from the Iowa Driving Simulator, where the actual deceleration profiles of both vehicles are shown for comparison. The process is then applied to naturalistic driving data from a field operational test of an <b>Intelligent</b> (Adaptive) <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> system.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to design an <b>intelligent</b> <b>cruise</b> controller for the motion control of a vehicle platoon and discuss the relationship between following distance and signal sampling frequency. For safe vehicle following, an Adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> (ACC) law is considered in an impedance model based approach. The impedance model is developed to guide the dynamic behavior of the following vehicles. In order to assure {{the safety of the}} vehicle platoon, it is necessary to regulate the distance between vehicles at an appropriate value. The proposed control law uses relative speed and spacing as well as preceding acceleration information to choose a proper control action for maintaining a desired following distance.

40|$|Driving {{a vehicle}} {{may seem to}} be a fairly simple task. After some initial {{training}} many people are able to handle a car safely. Nevertheless, accidents do occur and the majority of these accidents can be attributed to human failure. At present there are factors that may even lead to increased human failure in traffic. Firstly, owing in part to increased welfare, the number of vehicles on the road is increasing. Increased road intensity leads to higher demands on the human information processing system and an increased likelihood of vehicles colliding. Secondly, people continue to drive well into old age. Elderly people suffer from specific problems in terms of divided attention performance, a task that is more and more required in traffic. One of the causes of these increased demands is the introduction of new technology into the vehicle. It began with a car radio, was followed by car-phones and route guidance systems, and will soon be followed by collision avoidance systems, <b>intelligent</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>controls</b> and so on. All these systems require driversâ attention to be divided between the system and the primary task of longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. Thirdly, drivers in a diminished state endanger safety on the road. Longer journeys are planned and night time driving increases for economic purposes and/or to avoid congestions. Driver fatigue is currently an important factor in accident causation. But not only lengthy driving affects driver state, a diminished driver state can also be the result of the use of alcohol or (medicinal) sedative drugs. The above-mentioned examples have in common that in all cases driver workload is affected. An increase in traffic density increases the complexity of the driving task. Additional systems in the vehicle add to task complexity. A reduced driver state affects the ability to deal with these demands. How to assess this, i. e. how to assess driver mental workload is the main theme of this thesis. In chapter 1, the theoretical aspects of mental workload are introduced. The difference between task demand, i. e. the external demand, the goals that have to be reached, and (work) load, i. e. the individual reaction to these demands, receive attention in this chapter. Mental workload is defined as a relative concept; it is the ratio of demand to allocated resources. Task difficulty is explicitly separated from task complexity. Task complexity would have been an objective property of the task that is related to demand on computational processes, were it not dependent upon individual goal setting. Task difficulty is very much dependent upon the context and the individual. Applied strategies may affect resource allocation or task complexity and thus difficulty and mental workload. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a general framework for safety evaluation of autonomous <b>intelligent</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> in rear-end collisions. Using data and specifications from prototype devices, two collision models are developed. One model considers a train of four cars, {{one of which}} is equipped with autonomous <b>intelligent</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> This model considers the car in front and two cars following the equipped car. In the second model, none of the cars is equipped with the device. Each model can predict the possibility of rear-end collision between cars under various conditions by calculating the remaining distance between cars after the front car brakes. Comparing the two collision models allows one {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} autonomous <b>intelligent</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> in preventing collisions. The models are then subjected to Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the probability of collision. Based on crash probabilities, an expected value is calculated for the number of cars involved in any collision. It is found that given the model assumptions, while equipping a car with autonomous <b>intelligent</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> can significantly reduce the probability of the collision with the car ahead, it may adversely affect the situation for the following cars. <br/...|$|E
