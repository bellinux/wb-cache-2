25|$|Colonel Sir Arthur Edwin Young KPM (15 February 1907 – 20 January 1979) was a British police officer. He was Commissioner of Police of the City of London from 1950 to 1971 and {{was also}} the first head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be styled Chief Constable. Young was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} post of Chief Inspector of Constabulary. In the early 1950s, he played a crucial role in policing decolonisation in the British Empire. During the 1960s, <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in modernising British police recruitment and in improving the training of senior officers.|$|E
25|$|With the reopening of the theatres in 1660 {{after the}} Puritan ban, Dryden began writing plays. His first play The Wild Gallant {{appeared}} in 1663, {{and was not}} successful, but was still promising, and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays {{a year for the}} King's Company in which he became a shareholder. During the 1660s and 1670s, theatrical writing was his main source of income. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in Restoration comedy, his best-known work being Marriage à la Mode (1673), as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy, in which his greatest success was All for Love (1678). Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were wasted on unworthy audiences. He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage. In 1667, around the same time his dramatic career began, he published Annus Mirabilis, a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666. It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation, and was crucial in his attaining the posts of Poet Laureate (1668) and historiographer royal (1670).|$|E
2500|$|On 10 April Beaulieu {{attacked}} {{and won a}} minor skirmish in the Battle of Voltri. Ordered to attack Savona from the northwest, Argenteau was unable to assemble a large force but directed his available troops to assemble at dawn on the 11th at Cascina Garbazzo near Montenotte Superiore. Rukavina left Dego with one battalion of Infantry Regiment Stein Nr. 50 and picked up one battalion of Pellegrini Nr. 49 and three companies of the Gyulai Freikorps en route. Rukavina arrived at the rendezvous first and {{had to wait for}} Argenteau with the remaining three battalions. The entire force numbered only about 3,700. When the advance started, <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> Historian Martin Boycott-Brown wrote, [...] "It was also Rukavina who engaged the enemy first, and it seems to have been entirely in character for him to do so. Mathias Rukavina was one of those fighting generals from the Borders who seem to have been happiest leading from the front".|$|E

2500|$|The idea to make Cook Forest {{a public}} park {{originated}} with McCreight on {{his first visit to}} the “Forest Cathedral” near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania. [...] “It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered. [...] Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment. [...] It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them. The writer said to him: ‘Cook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity’s sake.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Major Israel McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was {{author and}} steward of Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park {{acquired}} {{to preserve a}} natural landmark, and {{a founder of the}} Pennsylvania Conservation Association. Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies. [...] Once called the “Black Forest,” the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks. The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated on McCreight's first visit to the “Forest Cathedral” near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania. [...] “It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland.

Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them, The writer said to him: ‘Cook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity’s sake.” McCreight was determined to save the forest and began a campaign to conserve the natural landmark. In 1910, McCreight and others formed the Pennsylvania Conservation Association and successfully lobbied the legislature to consider Cook Forest for state park purposes. For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the [...] was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock. Early pioneers with the Cook Forest Association were Major Israel McCreight, Theo Wilson and John Nicholson. The Association, endorsed by national natural resource groups and Governor Gifford Pinchot, raised $200,000.|$|E
