40|$|The {{maturation}} of antibody affinity {{during the}} immune response, discovered as a <b>serological</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in 1964, {{is critical to}} the development of high affinity humoral immunity. This process takes place in germinal centers (GCs), which are microanatomical structures composed of antigen-specific B lymphocytes that form in secondary lymphoid organs upon infection or immunization. High affinity B cells are selectively expanded in the GC by iterative rounds of migration between a zone of hypermutation and proliferation (the dark zone, or DZ) and a zone of selection (the light zone, or LZ). The mechanism whereby somatic antibody mutants are {{selected on the basis of}} affinity has been elusive. In the first part of this thesis, I demonstrate that affinity-based selection in the GC operates through regulation of proliferation and hypermutation. B cells with affinity-enhancing mutations capture more antigen through their BCRs for presentation as peptide-MHCII to CD 4 + T cells. In turn, enhanced T cell help induces selected B cells to return to the DZ, where they spend a prolonged period of time proliferating in between rounds of competition in the LZ. By dividing a greater number of times during each passage through the DZ, high affinity cells can expand within the population and are provided more opportunities to hypermutate their antibody genes. In the second part of this thesis, I examine the regulation of cell cycles in the DZ during GC selection. Transcriptional profiling revealed that T cell help enhanced signaling through the E 2 F and c-Myc pathways within selected GC B cells in the DZ. Moreover, T cell help increased the speed with which selected GC B cells progressed through both the S and G 2 /M phases. Genome sequencing and single-molecule analyses revealed that S phase is regulated by increasing the speed of DNA replication forks, while maintaining the dynamics of replication origin activation throughout the genome. Thus, T cells mediate affinity-based selection in the GC by inducing selected cells to reside longer in the DZ where they undergo accelerated cell cycles...|$|R

On the other hand, in certain virus diseases, e. g., papillomatosis of rabbits (7) and tobacco mosaic of plants (8), all the in vitro <b>serological</b> <b>phenomena</b> appear {{to be the result of}} reactions between immune sera and the viruses. The occurrerlce of a complement-fixing substance in extracts prepared from brains of guinea pigs and mice infected with the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis has been reported by Howitt (9). However, she did not mention any attempts to determine whether complement fixation was due to the presence of virus or to a soluble material separable from the virus. Separation of a complement-fixing antigen from the virus has been reported by us in a preliminary publication (10). The purpose of this paper is to present in detail the evidence for the existence of a specific soluble antigen associated with the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and to record its distribution in organs of infected animals. For experiments of this type, it is essential to have materials rich both in virus and in complement-fixing antigen. The virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis is not only neurotropic, but is also highly viscerotropic, since it is found in relatively large amounts in organs other than the brain and occurs even in the blood of acutely ill animals (11, 12). Preliminary experiments indicated that spleens from infected guinea pigs were suitable for our needs; hence, material from this source has been extensively used.

40|$|H 9 N 2 avian {{influenza}} viruses have circulated widely in domestic poultry around the world, and their outbreaks {{have resulted in}} heavy morbidity and mortality. In addition, H 9 N 2 {{avian influenza}} viruses were transmitted directly from birds to humans in Hong Kong and mainland China during 1998 and 2003, which prompted the public health authorities to seek protective strategies to control H 9 N 2 influenza viruses. In this study, we attempted to develop a DIVA (differentiating infected and vaccinated animals) strategy for H 9 N 2 avian influenza viruses. This strategy does not <b>interfere</b> with <b>serological</b> monitoring and allows effective control of H 9 N 2 avian influenza. We generated a reassortant H 9 N 1 influenza vaccine strain by reverse genetics and employed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a truncated N 1 antigen expressed in E. coli to differentiate between vaccinated and naturally infected animals. Immunization of BALB/c mice with the inactivated reassortant H 9 N 1 vaccine conferred protection against lethal challenge with H 9 N 2 viruses. Meanwhile, the ELISA {{can be used to}} distinguish between vaccination and natural infection quickly and easily.

40|$|Continued {{serological}} {{investigations of}} the sedimentable constituents of normal and neoplastic tissues {{have shown that the}} blood serum of normal rabbits will fix complement in mixture with saline extracts of normal rabbit tissues. The phenomenon has proved referable, not to anticomplementary effects of serum or antigen nor to so called non-specific complement fixation, but to a naturally occurring serum principle, hitherto unrecognized, which reacts specifically in vitro with a sedimentable constituent of normal tissue cells. The principle exists in the blood of nearly all adult rabbits but is absent from that of rabbits less than 1 month old. It can be salted out from serum with ammonium sulfate and is destroyed when heated at 65 °C. for 20 to 30 minutes. Its titer was found to run parallel in general with that of two natural antibodies also present in normal rabbit's blood (natural Wassermann reagin, natural anti-sheep hemolysin); but absorption tests showed it to be distinct from these. Because of its properties, the serum principle has been termed the natural tissue antibody. The substance with which the natural tissue antibody reacts is regularly present in saline extracts of many normal tissues,—those of rabbits and of other species as well. Kidney and liver tissues always yield it in abundance, while spleen, brain, and testicle provide somewhat less; heart and voluntary muscle extracts contain relatively little, and non-nucleated erythrocytes and skin are practically devoid of it. The results of affinity and absorption tests indicate that it is nearly or quite the same from whatever tissue or species derived. It is readily sedimentable in the high-speed centrifuge, little or none remaining in the supernatant liquid of potent suspensions spun at 25, 000 R. P. M. (45, 400 g) for 1 hour. It either does not come away into alcohol or is inactivated thereby, is readily destroyed by heat (56 – 70 °C. for 30 minutes), and diminishes notably in antigenic potency upon standing overnight in saline suspension or when the tissues containing it are kept in glycerol. Its properties suggest that it may be a protein. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the formation of the natural antibody and its place amongst <b>serological</b> <b>phenomena,</b> to so called "non-specific" fixation of complement and other serological complexities, and with particular reference to the character of the sedimentable constituents of normal and neoplastic tissue cells...|$|R

Brucellosis free rams were vaccinated subcutaneously with a single dose of particles containing 3 mg of HS, and challenged 6 months thereafter. Protection was evaluated by clinical, bacteriological and serological examinations, in comparison with non-vaccinated control rams. HS-PEC vaccine induced protection (7 out of 13 animals were infected) equivalent to that induced by the reference Rev 1 vaccine (8 / 14).

A total of 697 Australian and 40 Indonesian sugarcane fields were screened by leaf sheath biopsy (LSB) PCR using primers specific for L. xyli subsp. xyli, in addition to primers designed to amplify DNA from other members of the genus Leifsonia. While L. xyli subsp. xyli was detected in 126 fields, a total of 37 distinct and novel Leifsonia and non-Leifsonia strains were detected in 116 fields.

40|$|Aim: The role {{of metal}} {{exposure}} {{in the development}} of autoimmune disease (AID) is still controversial. Here, we studied the relationship between oral metal exposure, metal allergy and autoimmunity. Methods: A mixed population (n[*]=[*] 78) of non-allergic volunteers, metal-allergic patients and patients with oral problems putatively due to metal alloys was evaluated for oral Ni, Pd, Au and Hg exposure and skin hypersensitivity. Clinical autoimmune parameters were based on medical histories; additionally, serum levels of the four most common autoantibodies were measured. Results: Skin hypersensitivity, as seen mainly for Ni and/or Pd, was not positively associated with autoimmune parameters. In contrast, metal hypersensitive individuals showed an extremely low frequency of thyroid autoantibodies (3 % vs 20 % in non-hypersensitive controls). Next, the relation between metal exposure and autoimmunity was evaluated in individuals > 35 years (n[*]=[*] 58), since from that age on metal exposure had plateaued and was not correlated with age. In this subgroup, oral Ni exposure was associated (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) with self-reported AID, irrespective of autoantibody levels.

40|$|AbstractAt {{the age of}} 7 – 8 years {{a booster}} of diphtheria, tetanus, {{acellular}} pertussis and polio vaccine is recommended for children in Norway. In this cross-sectional study we have analysed the antibody levels against pertussis vaccine antigens in sera from 498 children aged 6 – 12 years. The {{purposes of this study}} were to investigate the duration of the booster response against the pertussis vaccine antigens pertussis toxin (PT) and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA); to determine the presence of high levels of pertussis antibodies in absence of recent vaccination; and to analyse how booster immunisation may <b>interfere</b> with the <b>serological</b> pertussis diagnostics. Prior to the booster the IgG antibody levels against PT revealed a geometric mean of 7. 3 IU/ml. After the booster the geometric mean peak anti-PT IgG response reached to 45. 6 IU/ml, followed by a steady decline in antibody levels over the next few years. The IgG anti-FHA levels followed the anti-PT IgG profiles. Three years after the booster the geometric mean IgG levels were only slightly above pre-booster levels. Prior to the booster 44 % of the sera contained ≤ 5 IU/ml of anti-PT IgG compared to 18 % 3 years after and 30 % 4 years after the booster. When recently vaccinated children were excluded, 6. 2 % of the children had anti-PT IgG levels above 50 IU/ml which may indicate pertussis infection within the last 2 years. This study indicates that the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines induce moderate immune responses to the pertussis antigens and that the antibodies wane within few years after the booster. This lack of sustained immune response may partly be responsible for the increased number of pertussis cases observed in this age group during the last years...|$|R

Based on the fundamental facts that the long term fluctuations in antibody titers generally show the tendencies of linear character, as observed in the previous report, two indices, namely, infectivity index (Xp) and susceptibility index (a) were mathematically introduced from the regression lines fitted to the tendencies of titer fluctuations. The `Xp' represents the infectivity of virus and this value increases with {{the rise in the}} infectivity of virus, independent of the antibody levels of the groups before infection. The 'a' represents the group susceptibility against the virus infection and means simultaneously the ability of antibody production, irrespective to the infectivity of virus. According to this theory, therefore, each value of both index can be determined independently by each other. Several sets of antibody titrations were analysed by this method, and the same sets were concurrently examined on the significances of the increases of the mean antibody titers between before and after infection. Both results did not always coincide in. each case, and the causes which brought such disagreements in the results were theoretically considered. It was found that the values of the mean fold increase differed with the antibody levels of the group possessed before infection, but based on this theory, both index indicated above must be constant, irrespective {{to the level of the}} antibody before infection. Therefore, this would be a more reasonable method to analyse the <b>serological</b> and epidemiological <b>phenomena</b> of influenza...|$|R
40|$|Brucellosis, {{caused by}} {{bacteria}} {{of the genus}} Brucella, is a contagious disease that causes economic loss to owners of domestic animals due to loss of progeny and milk yield. Because cattle, sheep, goats, {{and to a lesser}} extent pigs are considered to be the source of human brucellosis, serological tests have been used to screen domestic animals for antibodies against Brucella. Although the serological tests helped to eradicate brucellosis in many countries, serological tests are not always adequate to detect latent carriers of Brucella. Therefore, the use of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity (SDTH) test, which is independent of circulating antibodies, might improve the diagnosis of brucellosis. In the literature, however, there are conflicting reports as to the value of the SDTH test for the diagnosis of brucellosis. Some studies consider the test unreliable, whereas others advocate its use because it detects brucellosis earlier than serological tests. The objectives of this study were therefore to assess the characteristics of the SDTH test, to select a Brucella strain that will yield a suitable brucellin for use in the field, and to determine whether the use of serological tests in combination with the SDTH test improves the detection of brucellosis. The results of this study clearly show that the SDTH test detects latent carriers of Brucella and confirms brucellosis in cattle with ambiguous serological test results. Brucellins prepared from smooth or mucoid strains of Brucella are better suited for use in the field than brucellins prepared from rough strains because they detect brucellosis in cattle with acute as well as chronic infection. The SDTH test is highly specific (99. 3 % specificity), and repeated testing of naive cattle or cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with Brucella does not sensitize cattle to subsequent SDTH tests. However, it is possible that some naive cattle may serologically react to the injection of brucellin. The effect of these serological reactions on the sero-diagnosis of brucellosis is limited, because cattle may only now and then react serologically either with the serum agglutination test (SAT) or the complement fixation test (CFT). Nevertheless, cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with Brucella may test seropositive for brucellosis 4 to 7 weeks after injection of brucellin, depending on the cross-reacting microorganism. The value of the SDTH test for the diagnosis of brucellosis was demonstrated after an outbreak of brucellosis. When the SDTH test was used in combination with SAT and CFT at diagnostic threshold ≥ 2 mm or ≥ 1 mm (increase in skinfold thickness), respectively, 39 / 44 (88 %) or 42 / 44 (95 %) of the infected cattle were detected compared with only 27 / 44 (61 %) when SAT and CFT were used. When cattle in areas of low prevalence or in areas free from brucellosis are tested with the SDTH test an increase ≥ 2 mm in skinfold thickness should be considered indicative of infection. When the control and eradication of brucellosis is based on test-and-slaughter, an increase of ≥ 1 mm in skinfold thickness should be considered indicative of infection. Repeated serological testing complemented with the SDTH test in this programme will shorten the quarantine (movement control) period of a suspect herd, limiting the financial loss incurred during outbreaks of the disease. Consequently, since the SDTH test usually does not <b>interfere</b> with the <b>serological</b> diagnosis and can safely be used to establish the infection status of cattle in a suspect herd, it is opportune to consider adding the SDTH test to the procedure currently used to diagnose brucellosis in individual animals...|$|R
