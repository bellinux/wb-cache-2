40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe programme was concerned {{with the effects of}} processing variables on the structure and properties of coolant reservoir tanks. The work was concentrated on the <b>extrusion</b> <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process and on propylene polymers, following an earlier similar research in the Institute on high density polyethylene. We have worked with a company which specialises in technical blow mouldings; the work has dealt with coolant tanks which are required for high temperature, high pressure service in the presence of antifreeze. It soon became apparent that the application made severe demands on polypropylene in that failure was possible by a variety of mechanisms, including environmental stress cracking and ductile blow-out failure. Additionally, the shaping process by <b>extrusion</b> <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> was not being carried out in the optimum way, either with respect to process economics or to product properties. Investigation of the surface texture of corn mercial tanks revealed that shrinkage from the mould occurred frequently due to inadequate holdon pressure; this loss of contact gives poor surface finish and retarded cooling. This phase of the research was supported by a programme carried out on the Bradford University equipment and by providing appropriate thermal data for the Bradford mathematical model for cooling. To reduce the cooling cycle time, the efficacy of internal cooling techniques, including forced air cooling and liquid carbon dioxide, was studied. Further, the possibility of shaping polypropylene in the supercooled region was investigated and a double extruder system was developed to examine the shear viscosity of supercooled polymers. The main concern has been failure caused by stress cracking and environmental stress cracking, especially of development grades of propylene polymers. The structures of various ethylene-modified polypropylenes have been elucidated, as have the relationship of structure' to processing history and its relevance to the severe stress cracking encountered. A new method for determining ethylene content of ethylene- propylene systems has been developed, as {{this is one of the}} important characteristics of ethylene modified polypropylene. The available processes of manufacturing the coolant reservoir tanks have been considered; in particular, competing methods of manufacture of <b>extrusion</b> <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> and injection moulding/welding have been compared. The design of coolant tanks, in particular the wall thickness required, has been examined. Stress analysis, supported by tensile failure and relaxation data, has been carried out to provide background to the failures encountered in practice. Finally, possible new candidate material for the coolant tank application, polypropylene-linear low density polyethylene (ethylene-octene copolymer) blends have been investigated...|$|E

This paper focuses on the plastics forming processes with a focus on moulding processes. An overview of some basic plastics forming processes, their products and production capacities, is presented.

Some leading CAD/CAM packages are reviewed in light of their capabilities and applicability. The paper also lays an emphasis on the status of the New Zealand situation in the plastics forming industry. A survey showed that the New Zealand plastics industry involves over 400 enterprises, mostly small. The majority of them only operate a single moulding process, with injection moulding being the principal process. While some companies have their own CAD/CAM facilities in-house, others still contract out their jobs for product development, although many companies are already in the process of computerising the processes of their product design, mould design, and manufacturing...|$|E

A high density polyethylene (HDPE) extrusion blow moulded tamper evident container was studied using a finite element based analysis (FEA) {{in order to determine the}} optimized thickness distribution required for the blown part, considering its mechanical specifications. Several tests corresponding to the requirements for UN homologation for dangerous substances transportation were performed using a commercial software.

40|$|In the <b>extrusion</b> <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process, the {{strength}} and weight of a hollow article, such as a bottle, is controlled by an open loop control process called parison programming. The article thickness is increased and decreased by opening and closing the gap of the annular die from which the parison is extruded. The die gap is regulated according to a gap-time profile which an operator determines during start up by trial and error. An optical sensor has been developed which can measure the thickness profile of the parison on-line just prior to its enclosure in the mould. The device will help operators to program the gap-time profile for optimum use of plastic by providing rapid feedback on {{the formation of the}} parison. It also represents an important step toward the development of closed loop control for container thickness distribution. The device determines thickness by striking the parison at an angle with a laser beam and measuring the separation between the beams that reflect from the outer and inner surfaces of the parison wall. A prototype was built and tested. The prototype uses three lasers at different angles and can make up to 250 point measurements during a one second scan.

A wide variety of products are manufactured by using these two technologies, which vary greatly in their size, complexity, and application.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Plastics fuel tanks have been used successfully abroad; metal counterparts are still predominant in this country plastics tanks have to satisfy stringent performance regulations : low temperature impact tests; permeability; and fire resistance. <b>Blow</b> <b>moulded</b> high density polyethylene (HDPE) fuel tanks have superior strength to mass ratio compared with metal equivalents (the density of steel is about 8000 kg/m 3 compared with HDPE, which has a density of under 1000 kg/m 3). HDPE will tend to drip in a fire situation, thus reducing explosion risk. HDPE is the chosen material because it possesses inherent properties suitable for the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process : it has a high viscosity at low stresses; and is highly inert. Rotational moulded HDPE fuel tanks can also be considered. However, these are shown to have inferior properties when compared with <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> tanks; attraction of rotational moulding is the cheapness of equipment. Petrol immersion was found to enhance impact properties of HDPE, although yield stresses were lowered slightly. The thickness distributions of <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> fuel tanks were found to vary; {{this is because of}} the present difficulty of predicting parison behaviour with respect to time. Thickness is important because of impact strength and permeation considerations. Impact properties of fuel tanks were assessed; peak force of impact was found to be heavily dependent on thickness (raised to the power 1. 1) and temperature of <b>mould</b> in the <b>blow</b> <b>moulding</b> process (a low mould temperature led to inferior properties). Pinch-offs were found to be particularly detrimental to impact properties. Cooling behaviour was investigated. With the aid of a cooling model for blow mouldings, it was found that a warm mould (40 ·C) could be used with internal air circulation to obtain a cooling time the same as that with a cold mould and no air circulation. Thus optimising mechanical strength and maintaining economic viability. Welding of injection moulded fittings to the main <b>blow</b> <b>moulded</b> body of the fuel tank was found to be faulty, in all of the tanks examined; many weld failures have been reported in use.
