40|$|Wetland {{restoration}} success {{depends on}} understanding ecohydrological complexities <b>in</b> addition to <b>the</b> historical extent and legacies of past modifications. Restoration effectiveness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Florida <b>Everglades</b> {{has been studied}} for several decades. We focused this special issue {{on the effects of}} hydrologic restoration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern <b>Everglades,</b> as this region provides a model for understanding wetland and estuarine response to management and restoration along an urban-agricultural-wetland boundary. We synthesize several decades of interdisciplinary wetland ecosystem restoration studies examining the influence of hydrologic and biogeochemical changes on spatial and temporal patterns of ecosystem structure and function. Our goal is to improve restoration effectiveness by revealing connections between water management activities and ecosystem changes. Synthesis of these long-term data suggests restoration success is contingent on quantifying the influences hydrologic restoration on landscape connectivity within and outside of <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> boundaries, <b>in</b> addition to its interactions with organisms and their complex food webs. Rehabilitating habitat structure and connectivity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeastern <b>Everglades</b> can be accomplished through increasing delivery of clean freshwater to its primary flow-way, Taylor Slough. This compendium indicates that reversal of water quality impacts of rehydration is possible given timely and informed approaches that improve the flow clean freshwater to <b>the</b> <b>Everglades...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{group of}} animals most {{integral}} to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> stay submerged {{from one year to}} the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also {{play an important role in}} the food chain. Tadpoles spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.|$|E
500|$|In 1948 Congress {{approved}} the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C) and consolidated <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Drainage District and the Okeechobee Flood Control District under this. The C used four methods in flood management: levees, water storage areas, canal improvements, and large pumps to assist gravity. Between 1952 and 1954 <b>in</b> cooperation with <b>the</b> state of Florida it built a levee [...] long between <b>the</b> eastern <b>Everglades</b> and suburbs from Palm Beach to Homestead, and blocked {{the flow of}} water into populated areas. Between 1954 and 1963 it divided <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> into basins. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>Everglades</b> were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to the south of Lake Okeechobee. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Everglades</b> was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, which released water in drier times and removed it and pumped it to the ocean or Gulf of Mexico in times of flood. The WCAs took up about 37percent of <b>the</b> original <b>Everglades.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{same year}} {{the park was}} dedicated, two hurricanes and the wet season caused [...] to fall on South Florida. Though there were no human casualties, {{agricultural}} interests lost approximately $59million. In 1948 Congress approved the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C), which divided <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> into basins. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>Everglades</b> were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering {{to the south of}} Lake Okeechobee. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>Everglades</b> was Everglades National Park.

The WCAs took up approximately 37percent of <b>the</b> original <b>Everglades.</b> <b>The</b> C constructed over [...] of canals, and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades. During the 1950s and 1960s the Miami metropolitan area grew four times as fast {{as the rest of the}} nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to South Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Developed areas between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> was sent to newly developed areas.|$|R
25|$|The Black Seminoles {{are black}} Indians {{associated}} with <b>the</b> Seminole people <b>in</b> Florida and Oklahoma. They are {{the descendants of}} free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South and by other Native American tribes, {{including the right to}} bear arms.The black seminoles also fought <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglade</b> swamp, located <b>in</b> Southern Florida.

5|$|The {{intrusion}} of urban areas into wilderness {{has had a}} substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator hunting allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 {{and is no longer}} an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses {{have been found to be}} generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.|$|E
5|$|Under {{both the}} Miami Limestone {{formation}} and the Fort Thompson limestone lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a surface aquifer {{that serves as}} the Miami metropolitan area's fresh water source.

5|$|American {{involvement}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> began {{during the}} Second Seminole War (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30million and $40million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and {{were charged with}} the task of finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma Indian territory. Almost 4,000Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades.</b> They tore their clothes on sawgrass, ruined their boots on the uneven limestone floor, and were plagued by mosquitoes. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and gangrene infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General Thomas Jesup admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the Secretary of War in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.|$|E

50|$|He {{also wrote}} what is {{referred}} to as “The Marshall Plan” - a blueprint for Everglades restoration that is still viable today.

5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of Burmese pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial American alligator populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north.

5|$|The Everglades hosts 1,392 exotic {{plant species}} {{actively}} reproducing in the region, outnumbering the 1,301 species considered native to South Florida. The melaleuca tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) takes water in greater amounts than other trees. Melaleucas grow taller and more densely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> than {{in their native}} Australia, making them unsuitable as nesting areas for birds with wide wingspans. They also choke out native vegetation. More than $2million has been spent on keeping them out of Everglades National Park.|$|E
5|$|The Seminole Wars {{increased}} the U.S. military presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> {{which resulted in}} the exploration and mapping of many regions that had not previously been recorded.

30|$|Since Kinmen Island has {{a similar}} {{latitude}} and climatic factors as <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> National Park <b>in</b> southern Florida (USA), where the Burmese python has become established, ecological and physiological research on the Kinmen population has potential value for comparative studies of habitat selection and niche modeling.

5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades</b> favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As {{a center}} for trade and travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Everglades,</b> allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E

40|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} (Tursiops truncatus) are large-bodied predators {{that are}} locally abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal <b>Everglades.</b> Because {{of their potential}} to exert strong top-down effects on their communities, {{it is important to}} understand how spatiotemporal variation in biotic and abiotic factors affects the abundance and behavior of dolphins.
