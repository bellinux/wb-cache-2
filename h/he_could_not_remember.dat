5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the original five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's original tracing of the drawing was missing, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's original drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These original sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the original, Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion {{as to why the}} centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié had poured boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's {{insistence that}} the Claimant was her son, {{the rest of the}} Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember.</b> The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E
5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason for the decision was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Investigators said Gelhaus {{feared for}} his safety after Lopez {{turned around and}} {{allegedly}} raised the pellet gun in his direction (a replica of an AK-47 that was an air-soft gun that fired plastic pellets). Gelhaus told investigators that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> if he verbally identified himself as a deputy sheriff, although {{he was in a}} deputy sheriff's uniform and marked sheriff's patrol car before firing at Lopez; however, Lopez would not have seen the uniform or patrol car since the officers approached him from behind.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January 1587, Perkins preached {{a sermon}} denouncing the {{practice}} of kneeling to receive Communion, and was ultimately called before the Vice-Chancellor as a result. During the final set of trials against Puritan ministers in 1590–91, Perkins confirmed that he had discussed the Book of Discipline with Puritan ministers, but claimed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> whom he had talked to. Perkins married Timothye Cradocke of Grantchester on 2 July 1595. (He had previously resigned his fellowship at Christ's College, since only unmarried men could be fellows.) Eventually, the couple would have seven children, three of whom would die from various causes, and one being born after Perkins's death.|$|E
25|$|By 1958, Nilsson was {{intrigued}} by emerging forms of popular music, especially rhythm and blues artists like Ray Charles. He had made early attempts at performing while he {{was working at the}} Paramount, forming a vocal duo with his friend Jerry Smith and singing close harmonies {{in the style of the}} Everly Brothers. The manager at a favorite hangout gave Nilsson a plastic ukulele, which he learned to play, and he later learned to play the guitar and piano. In the 2006 documentary Who Is Harry Nilsson (And Why Is Everybody Talkin' About Him)?, Nilsson recalled that when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> lyrics or parts of the melodies to popular songs, he created his own, which led to writing original songs.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, a West Point cadet filed a {{civil suit}} against LaBelle after he was {{allegedly}} assaulted by her bodyguards. LaBelle and her entourage {{were on their way}} to a gig in Louisiana when Richard King, a 23-year-old cadet on spring break, approached her limousine. Having been drinking, he then verbally assailed LaBelle and exchanged heated words with her son Zuri Edwards, working as her driver at the time. King punched Edwards, and Holmes stepped in, striking King several times. According to court documents, King's intoxication level was almost 3.5 times the Texas legal limit that day. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> what happened and authorities reported him as the aggressor, but no one from LaBelle's team pressed charges.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} after the attack on Mody, another Indian was beaten into a coma; this time on a busy street corner in Jersey City Heights. The victim, Kaushal Saran, was found {{unconscious}} at Central and Ferry Avenues, near a city park and firehouse, according to police reports. Saran, a licensed physician in India who was awaiting licensing in the United States, was discharged later from University Hospital in Newark. The unprovoked attack left Saran in a partial coma for over a week with severe damage to his skull and brain. In September 1992, Thomas Kozak, Martin Ricciardi, and Mark Evangelista were brought to trial on federal civil rights charges in connection with the attack on Saran. However, the three were acquitted of the charges in two separate trials in 1993. Saran testified at both trials that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the incident.|$|E
25|$|In January 1855 Wagner {{proceeded}} to compose the full score {{without bothering to}} write an intermediate instrumentation draft {{as he had done}} for Das Rheingold. This was a decision he was soon to regret, as numerous interruptions made the task of orchestrating the Gesamtentwurf an exceedingly difficult one. If he allowed too much time to elapse between the initial drafting of a passage and its later elaboration, he found that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> how he had intended to orchestrate the draft. Consequently, some passages had to be composed again from scratch. Wagner, nevertheless, persevered with the task and the full score was finally completed on 20 March 1856. The fair copy was begun on 14 July 1855 in the Swiss resort of Seelisberg, where Wagner and his wife spent a month. It was completed in Zürich on 23 March 1856, just three days after the completion of the full score.|$|E

[...] Harry's mistake came about because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> her surname (which he knew was a colour), but White decided to keep it as a stage name. Two years later Harry arranged for her to sing for Epstein at the Blue Angel club, leading to a management contract.|$|E
60|$|I {{asked him}} {{if this was the}} same young lady I saw a day or two before I went to town? <b>He</b> really <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember.</b> Was she a girl with dark hair and blue eyes?

60|$|He {{looked at}} her with unwilling respect, the respect of the novice for the veteran. She was nothing to him now, of course. She had passed out of his life. But <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> help <b>remembering</b> that long ago--eighteen months ago--what he had admired most in her had been this same spirit, this game refusal to be {{disturbed}} by Fate's blows.

6000|$|Helen leaned forward, {{a strange}} fear stamped upon her face.

500|$|As both {{a play on}} {{his last}} name, and the {{pronunciation}} of his first and last names together, [...] "Wacha Wacha" [...] became a phenomenon in 2013 following the favorite catch phrase of Fozzie Bear of The Muppets, and for its similarity to the sound effects from the Pac-Man arcade game.

[...] The milkshake's ingredients included vanilla with chocolate chips and Cracker Jacks.

Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over-analyzing art. He also praised the vomiting jokes, and said <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the last time he laughed so hard during a South Park episode. Entertainment Weekly television columnist Ken Tucker said it was better than the season premiere, which he also praised. Tucker particularly enjoyed the satire of pop culture criticism, and wrote, [...] "I'd compare the Scrotie episode to the work of Rabelais, Henry Miller, and Dennis Cooper, but then I'd be part of the boys' satire, wouldn't I?" ...|$|E
500|$|A biographer {{states that}} in 1993, the {{entertainer}} admitted taking Valium, Xanax, and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the child sexual abuse allegations made against him. While Jackson himself does not mention sedatives, he stated that painkillers were prescribed to soothe excruciating pain that he was suffering after recent reconstructive surgery on his scalp resulting from his accident in 1984. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson had lost approximately [...] in weight and had stopped eating. In a court deposition unrelated to alleged child abuse, Jackson was visibly drowsy, lacked concentration, and repeatedly slurred while speaking. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>remember</b> the dates of his prior album releases or names of people he had worked with.
