5|$|The NZ ETS {{created a}} {{specific}} domestic emission unit {{for use in}} New Zealand, the New Zealand Unit (NZU). The NZUs are not a <b>Kyoto</b> <b>unit</b> in terms of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, and can only be surrendered or traded within New Zealand. Assigned amount units (AAUs) issued by New Zealand under the Kyoto Protocol can be also used by emitters to meet their surrender obligations, but assigned amount units issued by other Annex B countries may not be used.|$|E
5000|$|An {{account holder}} can {{therefore}} hold, transfer, cancel or acquire EU Allowances (EUAs) and <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> (e.g. CERs, ERUs, AAUs, RMUs, tCERs and lCERs). Further details regarding {{each of these}} unit types {{can be found in}} A Guide to Using <b>Kyoto</b> <b>Units</b> in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme, available on the [...] Environment Agency’s website. In addition, regulators and nominated competent authorities can manage regulated industries (those with legal emissions reduction targets), and monitor national compliance and performance against international emissions reductions obligations.|$|R
5|$|In {{combination}} with the unlimited use of internationally sourced <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units,</b> the allocation of New Zealand units to eligible emitters in proportion to their production {{means that there is}} no cap on total emissions within New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{decisions}} made at COP 18 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) imposes considerable {{restrictions on use}} of the Kyoto mecha-nisms by countries that do not submit greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets for the sec-ond commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, including Japan. As a result, a substantive decrease {{in the amount of}} <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> 1 that can be acquired by these countries post- 2012 seems to be unavoidable. Taking into account the impact of these COP 18 decisions on Japan, the following points have been found...|$|R
50|$|For {{emissions}} trading where greenhouse gases are regulated, one emissions permit is considered equivalent to one metric ton {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO2) emissions. Other names for emissions permits are carbon credits, <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units,</b> assigned amount units, and Certified Emission Reduction units (CER). These permits can be sold privately or in the international market at the prevailing market price. These trade and settle internationally, and hence allow permits to be transferred between countries. Each international transfer is validated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Each transfer of ownership within the European Union is additionally validated by the European Commission.|$|R
500|$|Participants in the NZ ETS {{are also}} able to {{purchase}} and surrender international <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> such as Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) and Removal Units (RMUs) issued in other countries. Unlike most other emissions trading schemes the NZ ETS has no limit on the volume of international units (CERs and ERUs) that may be imported. [...] Consequently, the NZ ETS is highly linked to the international market for greenhouse gas emission units. This degree of linkage {{and the lack of}} a national cap on emissions makes New Zealand a price-taker where control of the price of emissions to firms is relinquished to the international markets.|$|R
25|$|Almost all European {{countries}} are {{on track to}} achieve their first-round Kyoto targets. Spain plans to meet its target by purchasing a large quantity of <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> through the flexibility mechanisms. Australia, Canada (Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in 2012), and Italy are not on course to meet their first-round Kyoto targets. In order to meet their targets, these countries would need to purchase emissions credits from other Kyoto countries. As noted in the section on Intergovernmental Emissions Trading, purchasing surplus credits from the EIT countries would not actually result in total emissions being reduced. An alternative would be the purchase of CDM credits {{or the use of}} the voluntary Green Investment Scheme.|$|R
5|$|On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units {{in terms of the}} Kyoto Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record <b>Kyoto</b> emission <b>units</b> allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects to Reduce Emissions and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|R
2500|$|Under the GIS a Party to the Protocol {{expecting that}} the {{development}} of its economy will not exhaust its Kyoto quota, can sell the excess of its <b>Kyoto</b> quota <b>units</b> (AAUs) to another Party. The proceeds from the AAU sales should be [...] "greened", i.e. channeled to {{the development and implementation of}} the projects either acquiring the greenhouse gases emission reductions (hard greening) or building up the necessary framework for this process (soft greening).|$|R

5000|$|Individual {{sectors of}} the economy have {{different}} entry dates when their obligations to report emissions and surrender emission units take effect. Forestry, which contributed net removals of 17.5 Mts of CO2e in 2010 (19% of NZ's 2008 emissions,) entered the NZ ETS on 1 January 2008. The stationary energy, industrial processes and liquid fossil fuel sectors entered the NZ ETS on 1 July 2010. The waste sector (landfill operators) entered on 1 January 2013. [...] Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from pastoral agriculture are not included in the NZ ETS. (From November 2009, agriculture was to enter the NZ ETS on 1 January 2015) The NZ ETS is highly linked to international carbon markets as it allows the importing of most of the <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol emission <b>units.</b> However, as of June 2015, the scheme will effectively transition into a domestic scheme, with restricted access to international <b>Kyoto</b> <b>units</b> (CERs, ERUs and RMUs). The NZ ETS has a domestic unit; the 'New Zealand Unit' (NZU), which is issued by free allocation to emitters, with no auctions intended in the short term. Free allocation of NZUs varies between sectors. The commercial fishery sector (who are not participants) have a free allocation of units on a historic basis. Owners of pre-1990 forests have received a fixed free allocation of units. [...] Free allocation to emissions-intensive industry, is provided on an output-intensity basis. For this sector, there is no set limit on the number of units that may be allocated. The number of units allocated to eligible emitters is based on the average emissions per unit of output within a defined 'activity'. [...] Bertram and Terry (2010, p 16) state that as the NZ ETS does not 'cap' emissions, the NZ ETS is not a cap and trade scheme as understood in the economics literature.|$|R
30|$|In New Zealand, an {{emissions}} trading scheme {{was introduced in}} 2009 and forestry was the first sector to be included, generating an initial stimulus of forest plantings for sequestration. In 2011, for example, new forest plantings were almost double the previous year at 12 000 ha (New Zealand Forest Owners Association 2013). However, scheme design issues have since eroded the incentives for planted forests through low domestic carbon prices and high volatility and risk brought about {{by a series of}} amendments to the scheme. The depressed New Zealand carbon prices are attributed to the partial sectoral coverage of the scheme and strong linkage to uncapped international carbon trading of <b>Kyoto</b> compliant <b>units,</b> which have also fallen significantly in recent years. Under the New Zealand scheme, any credits are also balanced against any liability from the net release of carbon at harvest.|$|R
30|$|The assay system {{consisted}} of 100 μL of PPO solution, 600 μL of 15 mM L-DOPA in deionised water, 400 μL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 and 100 μL of deionised water (Nirmal and Benjakul [2009 a]). The PPO activity was determined for 3 min at 45 °C by monitoring {{the formation of}} dopachrome at 475 nm using a UV- 1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, <b>Kyoto,</b> Japan). One <b>unit</b> of PPO activity was defined as {{an increase in the}} absorbance at 475 nm by 0.001 /min/mL. Enzyme and substrate blanks were prepared by excluding the substrate and enzyme, respectively, from the reaction mixture and using the deionised water instead.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, New Zealand Windfarms were {{assisted}} by the New Zealand government under the Projects to Reduce Emissions program and were issued with <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol emission <b>units</b> for the proposal {{on the grounds}} that it would reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The first stage was officially opened in September 2006 by RT Hon Helen Clark and it consisted of five 500 kW turbines. Stage 2 (28 turbines) and Stage 3 (32 turbines) were completed in 2009. The final Stage 4 (32 turbines) was completed in 2011. [...] In total Te Rere Hau has 97 wind turbines with a generating capacity of 48.5 MW, which is enough to power approximately 18,000 local households. The turbines generated a total of 123 GWh in the year up to June 2015.|$|R
30|$|PPO {{activity}} {{was determined by}} monitoring the rate of dopachrome formation using L-DOPA as a substrate according to the method of Nirmal and Benjakul (2010) with a slight modification. Crude PPO extract (100 μL) was mixed with 100 μL of distilled water and 400 μL of 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) pre-incubated at 45 °C. To initiate the reaction, 600 μL of 15 mM L-DOPA was added into the assay mixture. The reaction was run for 3 min at 45 °C, {{and the formation of}} dopachrome was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 475 nm (A 475) using a UV- 160 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, <b>Kyoto,</b> Japan). One <b>unit</b> of PPO {{activity was}} defined as the enzyme causing an increase in A 475 by 0.001 per min. Enzyme and substrate blanks were prepared by excluding the substrate and enzyme, respectively, from the reaction mixture, and the distilled water was used instead. Remaining activity was expressed relative to that of the raw sample.|$|R

30|$|Activities for β-xylosidase and β-mannosidase were {{measured}} using 100 μl of 10 mM 4 -nitrophenyl-β-D-xyloopyranoside (PNP-Xyl, Sigma, MO USA) or 4 -nitrophenyl-β-D-mannopyranoside (PNP-Man, Sigma) as the substrates (final concentration is 1 mM), respectively. Fifty μl of enzymes were incubated with 1 mM PNP-Xyl or PNP-Man at 45 °C for 10 minutes in 850 μl of 50 mM acetic acid buffer (pH. 5). After 10 minutes, 500 μl of 1 M NaCO 3 was added. Because 4 -nitrophenol {{which will be}} generated from substrates by enzymatic hydrolysis is a chromogenic substance, enzyme activities were assayed by measuring absorbance at 420 nm by UV- 2550 Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, <b>Kyoto,</b> Japan). One <b>unit</b> of the enzyme activity {{is defined as the}} amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol per minute. For analysis of saccharification efficiency, culture medium was centrifuged at 9, 000 g for 10 min to collect the supernatant containing the secreted enzyme. Enzyme solutions were incubated at 45 °C in 50 mM acetic acid buffer with 4 % xylooligosaccharides (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka JAPAN). The xylose concentration was measured using a high performance liquid chromatography system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan), under the conditions described previously (Buaban et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|The {{use of an}} anatomically shaped cranial {{collimator}} (ACC) {{to reduce}} patient dose in orthodontic lateral cephalography was investigated in this study. The aim was to evaluate the potential interference of the ACC on landmark identification for orthodontic cephalometry. Consecutive orthodontic patients underwent a total of 100 cephalograms using an ACC mounted on a Veraviewepocs® 3 D X 550 (J. Morita Co., <b>Kyoto,</b> Japan) X-ray <b>unit.</b> 10 observers were asked whether the identification of 5 landmarks close to the collimated area was hindered or rendered impossible {{by the presence of}} the collimator. Of the 500 landmarks that were judged by the 10 observers, 496 (99. 2 %) were reported to lack hindrance. In three landmarks, a minority of the observers reported hindrance. In 1 landmark, 8 of the 10 observers reported hindrance by the collimator. In no instance did the observers state that the identification of landmarks was impossible {{as a result of the}} collimation. Application of the ACC on the cephalostat of the X-ray unit is a viable way of reducing patient dose, as it only marginally interferes with the diagnostic yield of the exposure. The need to retake images when the ACC is applied was found to be extremely low...|$|R

Use of electronic health records (EHRs) for this purpose could reduce costs and improve data quality in clinical studies. Kyoto University Hospital launched an EHR system in January 2005. At the same time, a replicate of that database was established for other purposes. At the Outpatient Oncology <b>Unit</b> of <b>Kyoto</b> University Hospital we developed a data-capture system that includes a cancer clinical database system and a data warehouse for outcomes studies. This system allows us to accumulate data at low cost and apply it to various uses in clinical or outcomes studies. Here we report on the application of this system to the post-marketing surveillance of drugs. Methods: We evaluated the availability of this system and identified problems for future development. With this system investigators can register cases for post-marketing surveillance, and the registered cases are listed on a screen. When CRFs for a particular case are required, data can be extracted from the list and CRFs are produced in PDF format. Results and conclusion: In this study we confirmed the applicability of our new system to post-marketing surveillance in providing prompt and efficient data exchange. We expect it to reduce {{the cost of}} data management and analysis and {{to improve the quality of}} data in post-marketing surveillance of drugs.
