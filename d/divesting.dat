40|$|We use {{a mental}} {{accounting}} framework {{to study the}} conditions in which CEOs de-commit to poorly performing acquisitions and so become more likely to <b>divest</b> them. We test this framework by contrasting the experiences of 68 firms that <b>divested</b> acquisitions with a control sample of 68 firms that did not <b>divest</b> their acquisitions. Consistent with the theory that we use to explain and predict de-commitment, our results suggest that poorly performing acquired units tend to be <b>divested</b> when executives can place them within attributional accounts (i. e., accounts for the cause of the performance that do not incriminate them) and comprehensive accounts (i. e., within the context of overall firm performance).

40|$|This paper studies {{a sample}} of large {{acquisitions}} completed between 1971 and 1982. By the end of 1989, acquirers have <b>divested</b> almost 44 percent of the target companies.

Acquirer returns and total (acquirer and target) returns at the acquisition announcement are significantly lower for unsuccessful divestitures than for successful divestitures and acquisitions not <b>divested.</b> Although diversifying acquisitions are almost {{four times more likely}} to be <b>divested</b> than related acquisitions, they do not find strong evidence that diversifying acquisitions are less successful than related ones.

25|$|The airline has {{invested}} in other airlines {{in a bid to}} expand beyond its Singapore base, although the results are often financially negative. In 1989, it went into a tripartite alliance with Delta Air Lines and Swissair, but terminated their partnership in 1999 after <b>divesting</b> their 5% equity stake in each other's company. The airline purchased 25% of Air New Zealand in 2000. However following the near collapse of Air New Zealand, the New Zealand government bought into the airline to rescue it from bankruptcy, reducing Singapore Airlines' stake to 4.5%. This was subsequently sold in October 2004 at a substantial loss.|$|E
