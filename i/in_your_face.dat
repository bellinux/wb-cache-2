25|$|Aside from {{competing}} in Pro Wrestling Noah, Kenta {{has been able}} to compete abroad in the United States with other participating members of the GPWA. His first appearance in the country was with Ring of Honor at Final Battle 2005, as a fan favorite, defending the GHC Junior Heavyweight title against Low Ki. He returned to the company the following year for Best in the World in New York City on March 25 where he and Naomichi Marufuji defeated the team of Samoa Joe and ROH World champion Bryan Danielson after Kenta connected with his finishing strike, the Go 2 Sleep, on Danielson.

25|$|The {{good news}} is, I'm finally {{working on my}} debut retail album. It sounds amazing so far. Everyone is excited about it. The bad news is, no more free music. Odds are, ever. No loopholes. Which means, Vampire Sunlight {{might be the last}} free release, and The Evil Microchip will not drop. Not even on YouTube. Sorry, Markus. But a major thank you is in order for {{everyone}} who's helped me this far. Everyone from Boe and Dre to Jimmy Iovine. All the graphic designers who have made covers, all the fans who uploaded my music, everyone. Thank you. My digital revolution has taken the Galaxy by storm, and I'm proud of it. It's just time to take things to a higher level. Hopefully, yall will support me. I'm not gonna throw the fact you've heard all my secrets for free <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>face.</b> But honestly, I would personally appreciate it if you went out and supported whatever I put in stores. More news to come, but once again, no free music indefinitely. Hold your head, kids...|$|E

25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principlesâ€”seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question...

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair {{depicted}} the album as [...] "Chilly keyboard motifs gliding across gut-punching bass lines, strings and synths swooping {{in and out}} of the mix, naggingly familiar guitar licks providing visceral punctuation".

PopMatters praised the production, stating that [...] "the hip-hop rhythms are catchy, sometimes <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>face,</b> sometimes subtle, but always a fine backdrop for the power of Dre's voice." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times mentioned that the beats were [...] "lean and immaculate, each one a pithy combination of beat, rap, melody and strategic silences".|$|E

500|$|The term brostep {{has been}} used by some as a slight pejorative {{descriptor}} for a style of popular Americanised dubstep.

While mostly an album which mixes pop, rock and R, the record was still described by Dave Simpson of The Guardian as a pop punk record, but also noted influences from Heart in the album's ballads. In American Beauty/American Psycho, the band felt influences from playing with different artists and expanded on boundaries further than Save Rock and Roll did. In an interview with Rolling Stone, guitarist Joe Trohman said the album has [...] "hip hop grooves with guitars on it," [...] with [...] "more <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>face</b> guitar than Save Rock and Roll".
