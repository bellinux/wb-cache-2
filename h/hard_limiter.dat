40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes {{the use of}} a variable-gain {{amplifier}} {{instead of}} a <b>hard</b> <b>limiter</b> for amplitude modulation (AM) suppression with low AM-PM (phase modulation) conversion. A <b>hard</b> <b>limiter</b> shows phase shift variations through inputamplitude dependent changes in output waveform, combined with bandwidth limitations. It is shown that these can be kept small only for limiter bandwidths much larger than the input frequency. A linear amplifier with variable gain used for AM suppression does not suffer from this problem. A CMOS variablegain amplifier with gain-insensitive phase shift has been designed for this purpose. The benefits and limitations of the technique are explored with reference to an experimental 2. 5 m BICMOS chip for a television IF demodulator. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the AM-PM conversion can be kept below 0 : 5 at 40 MHz over an input amplitude range of 20 dB, where typical hard limiters show 3 – 5 : This is achieved with an amplifier bandwidth of 80 MHz, while a <b>hard</b> <b>limiter</b> would need a bandwidth of more than 600 MHz to obtain similar results.

This new spreading technique {{is based on}} generalized optical orthogonal codes (OOC) with large cardinality and minimal degradation in performance when compared with a more optimum system, namely, an optical CDMA system using OOC with autocorrelation and cross-correlation value bounded by one, i. e., OOC (= 1). To obtain the performance of such systems, we use a recently introduced communication scheme, namely, frame time-hopping (FTH) -CDMA with random coding. It is discussed that systems with generalized OOC patterns and random time-hopping coding are close in structure and performance. Furthermore, the perfor-mance of such systems is near the performance of optical CDMA with optimum but low cardinality OOC (= 1), which further renders the practicality of the proposed technique with very large cardinality. Two new receiver structures for FO-CDMA, namely, chip-level detector with optimum comparator threshold and cor-relation receiver with an electrical <b>hard</b> <b>limiter,</b> are also proposed. Performance analysis for a binary pulse position FTH-FO-CDMA network is considered for the correlation receiver, chip-level detector, correlation receiver with an optical <b>hard</b> <b>limiter,</b> op-timum receiver, and the two newly proposed receiver structures.

40|$|Abstract—A network {{consisting}} of transparent optical nodes (TONs) can provide high speed end-to-end communication paths with very low bit-error rates (BERs). However, owing to component crosstalk and other degradations at TONs, the BER {{of a particular}} communication path traversing several TONs can be degraded by a few orders of magnitude {{even in the absence}} of component failure. Monitoring the quality-of-service (QoS) of a communication path has typically relied on sporadic BER testing and operation monitoring by the nodes using probe signals. Intermittent BER testing cannot provide continuous monitoring of the network QoS. On the other hand, the use of probe signals is not sensitive enough to detect the BER degradation. This work investigates a novel approach of monitoring service degradation at individual nodes using a wrap-around device which taps and compares signals from the input and the output at each TON along the lightpath. We propose a modification using <b>hard</b> <b>limiters</b> at TON inputs and derive the BER value that this modified method can guarantee in the presence of signal degradation due to coherent crosstalk at TONs.

40|$|A polarity-coincidence {{detector}} with biased polarity indicators (biased <b>hard</b> <b>limiters)</b> is {{studied to}} determine the effects of the bias on the detector output mean value, output variance, and output signal-to-noise power ratio. The mean value of the detector output is derived for the case of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with arbitrary spectra for the signal and noise. The mean value is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise power ratio, and as a function of the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output mean value. The variance of the defector output is derived for the cage of Gaussian input signal and Gaussian input noise, with RC low-pass spectra for signal and noise, for small input signal-to-noise power ratios only. The variance is expressed as a function of the biases in the input channel and reference channel polarity indicators, and as a function of the input signal-to-noise band-width radio. It is shown that the effect of bias is to introduce a spurious component in the output variance. The output signal-to-noise power ratio (the square of the output mean divided by the output variance) is derived for both an ideal polarity-coincidence detector (no bias) and for a biased polarity-coincidence detector. The output signal-to-noise power ratio is expressed as a function of the input signal-to-noise power ratio, the biases in the input channel and the reference channel polarity indicators, and input signal-to-noise band-width ratio, for small input signal-to-noise power ratios only. It is shown that the output signal-to-noise power ratio of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of a correlation detector. When the input signal-to-noise band-width ratio is unity, the degradation is about 1. 4 db. The degradation increases to about 2. 2 db. when the input signal-to noise band-width ratio becomes either very small or very large. It is also shown that the output signal-to-noise power ratio of a biased polarity-coincidence detector is degraded from that of an ideal polarity-coincidence detector.
