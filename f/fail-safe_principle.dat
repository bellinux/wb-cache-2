50|$|A {{principle}} behind {{transport category}} design standards {{is that any}} element in an airplane or helicopter can fail, but the risk of such a failure causing an accident should be extremely low. Consequently transport category airplanes and helicopters have duplicated elements wherever failure of one element is likely to cause an accident. For example, transport category airplanes must {{have at least two}} engines and be flown by at least two pilots. The loads on the wings and tailplanes are usually carried by multiple load paths. If one element of the primary structure fails due to metal fatigue or corrosion the remaining sound elements of the structure must carry the loads until the failed structural element is discovered in routine maintenance. This <b>fail-safe</b> <b>principle</b> is not necessary in airplanes and helicopters that are not certificated in the transport category.|$|E

40|$|After enomous energy {{produced}} due to {{an extraordinary}} natural phenomenon propagates tothe domain of human living，various kinds of things on the earth and social systems are destroyedby such a destructive energy. Against such natural disasters，We have two kinds of measures:structural and non-structural measures. Analyzing these two measures by the method of fault-tree,the characteristics of prevention systems of measures are disclosed. Because the prevention system of structural measures is characterised by series formation andthe upper limits of natural destructive forces can not be defined，it is proposed that the structuralmeasures should be designed by the safe-fail priniciple. On the contrary，because the preventionsystem of non-structural measures is characterised by parallel fomation，it is also proposed that thenon-structural measures should be designed by the <b>fail-safe</b> <b>principle.</b> Finally，the several researches available {{for the design of}} such a system，for example，on thecomparison between magnitudes of design floods at upstream reach and downstream reach in ariver and on the use of runoff model in flood forecasting，are presented from viewpoint that theseare related to some elements of the prevention system...|$|E

Introduction "Our Latin teachers were apparently right", Martin Kay (1989) remarks. "You should start [parsing] with the main verb. This {{will tell you what}} kinds of subjects and objects to look for and what cases they will be in. When you come to look for these, you should also start by trying to find the main word, because this will tell you most about what else to look for".

40|$|So far „risk‟ {{has been}} mostly {{defined as the}} {{expected}} value of a loss, mathematically PL, being P the probability of an adverse event and L the loss incurred {{as a consequence of}} the event. The so called risk matrix is based on this definition. Also for favorable events one usually refers to the expected gain PG, being G the gain incurred {{as a consequence of the}} positive event. These “measures” are generally violated in practice. The case of insurances (on the side of losses, negative risk) and the case of lotteries (on the side of gains, positive risk) are the most obvious. In these cases a single person is available to pay a higher price than that stated by the mathematical expected value, according to (more or less theoretically justified) measures. The higher the risk, the higher the unfair accepted price. The definition of risk as expected value is justified in a long term “manager‟s” perspective, in which it is conceivable to distribute the effects of an adverse event on a large number of subjects or a large number of recurrences.

40|$|In {{contemporary}} buildings, {{the architectural}} {{demand for a}} complete dematerialisation of load bearing structures can be satisfied only in limited cases with the exclusive structural use of glass. Otherwise, for challenging applications such as long spanned or high-rise structures, the use of hybrid glass-steel systems is mandatory. Glass, fragile but highly compressive resistant, is associated with steel, ductile and tensile resistant. The present research shows the feasibility study for a fully glazed pavilion made of six TVT (Travi Vitree Tensegrity) portal frames longitudinally braced by pre-stressed hybrid glass panels. The frames are about 20 m in span and 8 m in height. Appropriate multiscalar FEM numerical analyses, calibrated on the collapse tests performed on previous TVT large-scale prototypes, stated that the structural performance {{would be able to}} withstand heavy static and dynamic loads and stated the observance of the <b>Fail-Safe</b> Design <b>principles...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Il-62 is a {{conventional}} all-metal low-wing monoplane of riveted sectional semi-monocoque construction to <b>fail-safe</b> design <b>principles</b> (a structure {{designed so that}} failure of one major member does not cause immediate failure of the whole). Its service life was initially set at 30,000 flight hours and subject to extensions and curtailments according {{to the quality of}} service procedures, inspection and manufacturer's bulletins. The aircraft features pressurised cabin and freight holds (with fuselage dimensions of 3.8 m width x 4.1 m height), duplex all-mechanical flight controls, though with twin electric motors for tailplane incidence control; hydraulic nosewheel steering, landing gear and tail strut actuation, and wheel brakes. The Il-62M has spoilers and lift dumpers which extend automatically upon landing and are hydraulically operated. Control surfaces include a variable-incidence tailplane with dynamically and weight-compensated elevators with trim tabs, triple-section tabbed ailerons (outermost for low speed and innermost for high speed) which are interlinked with a torsion bar, spoilerons (Il-62M), spoilers and lift dumpers, and pneumatically actuated thrust reversers on the two outboard engines (the reversers are flight-rated on the Il-62M).|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} half of the eighties the {{development}} of new kinds of structural systems, called smart, intelligent, or adaptive, was initiated first in the USA and soon after in Japan. Apart from suitable sensors and controllers, emphasis was placed on actuator systems of thermally, electrically or magnetically activaitable materials (piezo-electrics, electrostrictives, magnetostrictives, electro- and magnetorheological fluids, etc.) capable of being inte-grated into appropriate structural components, thus enabling the structure to adapt automatically to changing environmental and operational conditions. Approximately five years later similar efforts were also started in Europe, especially in Germany, leading to the development of so-called adaptronic structures. These structures are characterized by their multifunctionality, i. e. adaptronic actuator systems are structurally integrated such that they serve not only as actuators but also as loadcarrying members of the structure itself. With respect to the <b>fail-safe</b> <b>principle</b> prevalent in aircraft design, this implies that the actuator elements ought to be operated parallel to passive load-carrying structural elements, allowing not only a sensible distribution of operationally induced loads on active and passive structural elements, but sufficient residual strength after a failure of the actuation function as well. The Institute of Structural Mechanics (ISM) at the German Aerospace Center is working on several projects, concerning adaptive structures. This paper focuses on some aeronautical applications, that are subject of current investigations. The following applications have the objective to increase the efficiency of cruise and high lift flight of transport airplanes by deforming the wing trailing edge and building up a bump at the upper surface of the wing. Since the actuation is relatively slow, a so called quasi static actuator concept can be applied. Wings of modern transport airplanes have a fixed geometry, optimized for a certain design point in cruise flight, described by the parameters altitude, mach number and aircraft weight. Since these parameters vary constantly, the airplane normally flies outside the design point, leading to a decreased performance. Changing the geometry of the airfoil during cruise flight by deforming the wings trailing edge leads to a much higher efficiency. The ISM has developed two variable chamber concepts to realize an adaptation of the airfoil, the finger concept and the belt rib concept. Both concepts are even capable of a spanwise differential deformation, enabling them to change the spanwise lift distribution in order to decrease the bending moment at the wing root, allowing a lighter construction of the wing itself. A bump on the upper wing surface decreases the wave drag significantly. The bump is extended in that area of the profile, where an expansion shock due to local supersonic flow speed oc-curs. The position of the bump can be adapted to the position of the expansion shock, thus providing a configura-tion with the lowest possible drag. During high lift flight with flaps extended, these are deformed in spanwise direction due to the applied airload. With a structurally integrated actuator system it is possible to re-deform the flap in order to provide an optimal gap size between wing and flap, leading to a much better high lift behavior. There are also projects, where the dynamic behavior of aerospace structures is increased by means of adaptron-ics. One example is concerned with vibrations of the vertical stabilizer on fighter aircraft due to vortexes, gener-ated by the wings leading edge. They are reduced by means of an active interface, made of piecoceramic stack actuators, thus resulting in reduced structural loading. Adaptronic solutions can also be applied to the suppression of vibrations in propeller-driven airplanes. If some elements of the passive strut/truss structure between power plant and airframe are substituted by active parts, it is possible to reduce propeller induced vibrations, leading to a higher passenger comfort and reduced dynamic loading of the airframe. Present helicopter research mainly focuses on the improvement of the aerodynamic efficiency and on the reduc-tion of vibrations and acoustic emission. Adaptronics have a high potential to efficiently achieve this goal. The Adaptive Blade Twist concept, developed by ISM, allows to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements and through this to positively influence the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibrations. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the current state of the art of adaptronic applications in the field of aero-nautics with some examples, to point out existing deficits, and to identify new application areas, in order to pre-pare the ground for a rapid transfer of adaptronic concepts into industrial practic...|$|E
50|$|Avro was not {{the only}} company to see the {{potential}} for a DC-3 replacement, and by this point work on the 748's direct competitor, the Fokker F27 Friendship turboprop, was well advanced. Avro therefore decided to compete by producing a more rugged design with better short-field performance, allowing it to operate from smaller airports and those with rough surfaces. This was accomplished with a long, high lift wing and a unique single slot flap with a hinged flap tab at the trailing edge. The wing was mounted low on the fuselage with dihedral from the root, allowing good overall ground clearance and easy mounting of strong durable landing gear. Other features of the 748 included an internal engine starting system, and systems and structures that were designed to be easy to inspect and repair in the field with limited equipment. The 748 {{was one of the first}} medium-sized aircraft to use <b>fail-safe</b> design <b>principles</b> in the structure, instead of the then common safe-life principles. Because of these features, the 748 quickly became popular (and still is today) with a variety of airlines operating in remote areas thanks to its ability to haul payloads of over 10,000 lbs in and out of short rough fields with little to no ground service equipment.|$|R

In them, the resisting cross-section consists of four adhesively bonded laminated glass panes. Adhesive joints are also used for the connection between glass columns and top/bottom restraints. As a result, careful consideration in the analysis and design of these innovative systems is required, to guarantee appropriate <b>fail-safe</b> design <b>principles</b> for a typically tensile brittle material, {{as well as to}} account for possible accidental or exceptional loading conditions. Simplified but computationally efficient FE models are validated in the paper towards the available full-scale test results.

40|$|The Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient Unitized Structure (PRSEUS) is a {{structural}} concept {{developed by the}} Boeing Company to address the complex structural design aspects associated with a pressurized hybrid wing body (HWB) aircraft configuration. The HWB {{has long been a}} focus of NASA's environmentally responsible aviation (ERA) project, following a building block approach to structures development, culminating with the testing of a nearly full-scale multi-bay box (MBB), representing a segment of the pressurized, non-circular fuselage portion of the HWB. PRSEUS is an integral structural concept wherein skins, frames, stringers and tear straps made of variable number of layers of dry warp-knit carbon-fiber stacks are stitched together, then resin-infused and cured in an out-of-autoclave process. The PRSEUS concept has the potential for reducing the weight and cost and increasing the structural efficiency of transport aircraft structures. A key feature of PRSEUS is the damage-arresting nature of the stitches, which enables the use of <b>fail-safe</b> design <b>principles.</b> During the load testing of the MBB, ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) was used to monitor several sites of intentional barely-visible impact damage (BVID) as well as to survey the areas surrounding the failure cracks after final loading to catastrophic failure.
