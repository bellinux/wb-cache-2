5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> in the middle.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{labor law}} sets {{standards}} {{in the areas of}} health, safety, and hours. The maximum workday is eight hours, and the maximum workweek is 48 hours.

Sundays are holidays, and those required to work on Sundays are paid double. However, laws governing acceptable conditions of work were not enforced universally, particularly for workers in the informal sector.|$|E

Also, clean and appropriate clothes, and sufficient food (Article 8). The right to medical care when needed, including dental and eye care, the costs of which should be met by the employer. The workers are covered by health insurance in the case of emergency (Article 9). The right to work for ten non-consecutive hours every day with frequent short breaks, and at least eight continuous <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> at night (Article 11).

2500|$|Since the {{fortress}} of Alessandria commanded the only {{crossing of the}} Bormida, the Austro-Russian main body waited on a pontoon train which finally arrived on 15 June.

Allowing for the possibility of defeat, the Russian army commander ordered the Po to be bridged at Mezzana Corti for the main army and Valenza for Bellegarde's corps. By this time, Bellegarde and 14,500 troops arrived to maintain the siege of Alessandria and contain Moreau. To keep MacDonald from raising the siege of Mantua, Kray manned the north bank of the Po with several thousand troops.|$|E
2500|$|Medical residencies {{traditionally}} require lengthy {{hours of}} their trainees. Early residents literally resided at the hospitals, often working in unpaid positions during their education. During this time, a resident might always be [...] "on call" [...] or share that duty {{with just one}} other practitioner. More recently, 36-hour shifts were separated by 12 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest,</b> during 100+ hour weeks. [...] The American public, and the medical education establishment, recognized that such long hours were counter-productive, since sleep deprivation increases rates of medical errors. [...] This was noted in a landmark study {{on the effects of}} sleep deprivation and error rate in an Intensive-care unit. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has limited the number of work-hours to 80 hours weekly (averaged over 4 weeks), overnight call frequency to no more than one overnight every third day, and 10 hours off between shifts. Still, a review committee may grant exceptions for up to 10%, or a maximum of 88 hours, to individual programs. Until early 2017, duty periods for postgraduate year 1 could not exceed 16 hours per day, while postgraduate year 2 residents and in those in subsequent years can have duty periods up to a maximum of 24 hours of continuous duty. After early 2017, all years of residents may work up to 24 hour shifts. While these limits are voluntary, adherence has been mandated for the purposes of accreditation, though lack of adherence to hour restrictions is not uncommon.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{majority}} of scallops are free-living and can swim with brief bursts of speed to escape predators (mostly starfish) by rapidly opening and closing their valves. [...] Indeed, everything about their characteristic shell shape – its symmetry, narrowness, smooth and/ or grooved surface, small flexible hinge, powerful adductor muscle, and continuous and uniformly curved edge – facilitates such activity. They often do this in spurts of several seconds before closing the shell entirely and sinking back {{to the bottom of}} their environment. Scallops are able to move through the water column either forward/ ventrally (termed swimming) by sucking water in through the space between their valves, an area called the gape, and ejecting it through small holes near the hinge line called exhalant apertures, or backward/ dorsally (termed jumping) by ejecting the water out the same way it came in (i.e., ventrally). [...] A jumping scallop will usually land on the sea floor between each contraction of its valves, whereas a swimming scallop will stay in the water column for most or all of its contractions and will travel a much greater distance (though seldom at a height of more than one meter off the sea bed and seldom for a distance of greater than five meters). [...] Both jumping and swimming movements are very energy-intensive and most scallops cannot perform more than four or five in a row before becoming completely exhausted and requiring several <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest.</b> Should a swimming scallop land on its left side, it is capable of flipping itself over to its right side via a similar shell-clapping movement called the righting reflex. So-called singing scallops are rumored to make an audible, soft popping sound as they flap their shells underwater (though whether or not this happens is open to some debate). [...] Other scallops can extend their foot from between their valves, and by contracting the muscles in their foot, they can burrow into sand.|$|E

2500|$|Where {{a person}} works at night, {{he or she}} may only do 8 hours in any 24-hour period on average, or simply 8 hours at most if the work is {{classified}} as [...] "hazardous". Moreover, every worker must receive at least 11 consecutive <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>rest</b> in a 24-hour period, and in every day workers must have at least a 20-minute break in any 6 hour period. The most controversial provisions in the working time laws concerns the right to a maximum working week. The labour movement has always bargained for a shorter working week as it increased economic productivity: the concept of a two-day [...] "weekend" [...] arose in the earlier 20th century, while France more recently implemented the right to a 35-hour workweek in 2000. Under the Directive, this EU maximum is 48 hours. The maximum does not apply to anyone who is self-employed or who can set their own hours of work. In Pfeiffer v Deutsches Rotes Kreuz the ECJ emphasised that the rules aim to protect workers who possess less bargaining power and autonomy over the way they do their jobs. Nevertheless, the UK government negotiated to let workers [...] "opt out" [...] of the 48-hour maximum by individually signing an opt out form. Theoretically and legally, a worker may always change his or her mind after having opted out, and has a right to sue the employer for suffering any detriment if they so choose. However, the obvious criticism has been made that the opt-out makes the right fictitious, because in jobs with a [...] "long hours culture", people are socially compelled to do what everyone else does. If the worker has not [...] "opted out", then the 48-hour week is not a rigid maximum, but is taken as an average over 17 weeks. Analogous to the minimum wage rules, [...] "on call" [...] time (where people must make themselves available, but are not necessarily active) is regarded as working time if the workers are bound to remain awake and close to their workplace. This created a significant problem for junior doctors, where in all European countries the culture has typically been that very long hours are expected. The European Court of Justice's decision in Landeshauptstadt Kiel v Jaegar that junior doctors' on call time was working time led a number of countries to exercise the same [...] "opt out" [...] derogation as the UK, though limited to medical practice. The Health and Safety Executive is the UK body charged with enforcing the working time laws, though it has taken a [...] "light touch" [...] approach to enforcement.|$|E
