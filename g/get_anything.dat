Idaho State {{was never able to}} <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> going on offense and only crossed midfield once, to make it to Oklahoma's 49-yard line. They finished the game with 44 total yards, including negative 22 rushing yards. Oklahoma finished with 564 total yards which included 286 passing yards by Jones. Running back DeMarco Murray also finished the game with 101 rushing yards.|$|E
25|$|In one instance, Shaw and Edwards {{were asked}} to move small objects in a sealed {{transparent}} globe, normally small bits of paper balanced on an edge. At first {{they were unable to}} <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> to happen, but later noticed that the container was being removed to replace the object within. During one such event they took the opportunity to roll up a small ball of metal foil and drop it into the circular ring cut into the surface of the table that held the globe. This introduced a small gap under one edge, which they could blow into to cause the paper to move.|$|E

25|$|He {{wanted to}} be an artist or illustrator, but he was often {{discouraged}} by societal norms of Japan which favored finding safe, well-paying jobs. He was discouraged because his uncle was an artist who suffered from financial difficulties. Another reason was his father's death which left his family more financially tight. He eventually started writing short stories and began to send them to Japanese magazines but was not able to <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> published. He cites that his stories were often 400 pages long while most magazines wanted their short stories to be around 100 pages. Eventually, he shifted his focus to making films with his friend who had an 8mm camera.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest was very disappointed, especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, {{made it difficult to}} <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> done. In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia was sent back to the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|March {{started with}} the newly crowned League Cup winners visiting St Andrew's. It {{was not to be}} Tottenham's day, however, as the Blues emphatically won 4–1. A Forssell hat-trick and a free kick from Larsson saw the Blues lead 4–0 before a late Jermaine Jenas goal in second half injury time saw Maik Taylor fail to get his clean sheet. Next up for the Blues was a tricky away tie to another team going well in a {{domestic}} cup. Portsmouth, who had just qualified for the semi-final of the FA Cup, went into an early two-goal lead thanks to Jermain Defoe, before goals from Fabrice Muamba and another Larsson free kick saw Blues complete a first-half comeback. Second-half goals from Hermann Hreiðarsson and Nwankwo Kanu saw the Blues fail to <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> from the south coast.|$|E

25|$|After racing both NASCAR Sprint Cup and Speedcar Series, Villeneuve {{was invited}} by the Top Race V6 {{chairman}} Alejandro Urtubey {{to join the}} series in its major event of the 2008 season, called La Carrera del Año (The Race of the Year), held at the Buenos Aires circuit. Villeneuve raced the No. 27 car (Volkswagen Passat silhouette) of the Oro Racing team and finishing the race in the 16th place. In 2009 he was invited again to run in two out {{of the three major}} races in the season: one at Interlagos on July 19 (did not finish after contact with Leonel Pernía and spun) and the other being the second edition of La Carrera del Año at the Buenos Aires circuit on September 20, the last mentioned race being its better results in the series, finishing 13th. During a press conference held during the previous week before La Carrera del Año, Villeneuve stated that he would race the whole 2010 season if he did not <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> in Formula One or NASCAR.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles offense {{took the}} field for the first time, with the ball spotted at their own 29-yard line. After an {{incomplete}} pass, QB Michael Vick threw a pass intended for WR DeSean Jackson, but it was picked off by CB Corey Webster who returned it to the Philadelphia 42-yard line. The Giants were unable to capitalize on the turnover, as LB Moise Fokou sacked QB Eli Manning putting them out of field goal range and forcing them to punt. After the Eagles failed to <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> going on the ensuing drive, the Giants put together a 71-yard scoring drive that ended with Manning finding WR Mario Manningham for a 35-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants on the board, leading 7–0. Near the end of the quarter S Quintin Mikell picked off Manning's pass to WR Derek Hagan and ran it back to the Giants 45-yard line. The final play of the first quarter resulted in a run by Vick for 11 yards and a personal foul called on T Jonathan Goff which moved the ball to the Giants' 19-yard line.|$|E
25|$|Bristol {{races are}} often {{the scene of the}} highest number of yellow-flag caution laps in the NASCAR season; with so many cars in such a small space, contact is almost inevitable. Until the Beneficiary Rule was instituted in 2004 (the rule was instituted after the races at Bristol in 2003), the short lap length and the {{unpredictable}} nature of the racing meant that {{this was one of the}} few remaining NASCAR tracks at which it was feasible for a driver to come back to win a race from several laps down; at most modern tracks, especially superspeedways, that was almost impossible. The short lap length also cuts the other way; any unscheduled pit stop for reasons such as a cut tire will result in the driver going two or more laps down as it is almost impossible to <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> done to a car during the time taken to complete one circuit, especially under green-flag conditions (approximately 15seconds). Thus, the disadvantage of losing laps means the chances of earning a free pass under the Beneficiary Rule is harder, since a driver losing two laps under a green-flag pit stop would have to race their way past the leader before the caution waved to regain one of their laps back, unless there are no cars one lap behind.|$|E

25|$|On September 22, they {{returned}} home to play a series with the Giants. Cody Bellinger hit his 39th homer, a three-run blast, to set a new NL rookie record, Rich Hill struck out nine in six innings, Kenley Jansen picked up his 40th save and the Dodgers beat the Giants 4–2. The win clinched the Dodgers fifth straight National League West title, a run only surpassed by the New York Yankees (who won nine from 1998–2006) and the Atlanta Braves (who won 11 from 1995–2005). The Dodgers offense couldn't <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> going against Madison Bumgarner in the next game and they lost 2–1. The Dodgers finished off the series with a 3–1 victory over the Giants. Kershaw struck out six while allowing only one run in eight innings and Yasmani Grandal hit a two-run homer in the win. The Dodgers began a three-game series with the San Diego Padres on September 25. Yu Darvish struck out nine with only two hits in seven innings as the Dodgers won 9–3 for their 100th win of the season. It {{was the first time}} the Dodgers had reached 100 victories since the 1974 season and it was their 55th home win, tying a Dodger Stadium record previously set in 1980 and 2015. The Dodgers hit three home runs en route to a 9–2 win the next game as they clinched home field throughout the National League playoffs and broke the LA record for home wins with their 56th. They added one more win the next night, when they finished off their last home series of the regular season with a 10–0 win over the Padres. Rich Hill struck out 10 in seven innings and the Dodgers won their 102nd game, setting a new record for the Los Angeles franchise.|$|E

500|$|Northern {{and central}} Sudan had been {{nominally}} under Egyptian suzerainty since an Ottoman force had conquered and occupied {{the region in}} 1821. The primary motive was not territorial conquest but to secure a source of slaves {{to serve in the}} Egyptian army. The slaves, paid in lieu of taxes, were brought from the formerly inaccessible regions of south Sudan. When the British explorer Samuel Baker visited Khartoum in 1862, he found that everyone in the town was involved in the slave trade, including the Governor-General. The Egyptian and Nubian garrison lived on the land like an army of occupation. Bribery {{was the only way to}} <b>get</b> <b>anything</b> done. Torture and floggings were routine in the prisons. Baker said of Khartoum [...] "a more miserable and unhealthy place can hardly be imagined".

500|$|Sunderland lost 1–0 away to Manchester City on 5 November after a goal from Stephen Ireland.

Danny Higginbotham put Sunderland into the lead shortly after half time, but James Milner drew Newcastle level on the 68th minute after his cross beat goalkeeper Craig Gordon into the far post. Sunderland {{had a chance to}} win the game when ex-Newcastle forward Michael Chopra headed against the bar minutes from full-time. Sunderland ended the month on a low as they were beaten 7–1 away to Everton on 24 November. Dwight Yorke scored Sunderland's only goal just before half time.

Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation.

Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said the [...] "double feature continued the recent hot streak" [...] of episodes, and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode's [...] "script that winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors".

Thus prevented from leaving, Rudd vigorously tried to persuade Lobengula to enter direct negotiations with him over a concession, but was repeatedly rebuffed. The king only agreed to look at the draft document, mostly written by Rudd, just before Shippard was due to leave in late October. At this meeting, Lobengula discussed the terms with Rudd for over an hour. Charles Helm, a missionary based in the vicinity, was summoned by the king to act as an interpreter. According to Helm, Rudd made a number of oral promises to Lobengula that were not in the written document, including [...] "that they would not bring more than 10 white men to work in his country, that they would not dig anywhere near towns, etc., and that they and their people would abide by the laws of his country and in fact be his people." ...|$|E
