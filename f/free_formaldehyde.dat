40|$|This thesis aims at {{developing}} {{a method of}} chemical aftertreatment for reduction of <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> release of a tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) urea precondensate, ammonia cured durable flame retardant finished cotton fabric, by preventing the formation of <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde.</b> Formaldehyde is toxic and carcinogenic. According to the worldwide standards, acceptable limit of <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> release, for the fabrics that have skin contact, is only 75 ppm (measured by water extraction method). In this research, a cotton fabric flame retardant finished in an industrial plant in Pakistan is used. Fabric is finished by the application of THPC urea precondensate and ammonia cured, oxidized and washed. After finishing, it is not aftertreated with sodium metabisulfite that is a commonly used aftertreatment method for the reduction of <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> release. Aftertreatment with sodium metabisulfite has various problems that include large number of hot washings {{and there is an}} increase in the formaldehyde release during fabric storage. If the fabric has 75 ppm of <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde,</b> there is often an increase in <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> release during fabric storage. There is a very limited research on the aftertreatment methods and few reports of application of these aftertreatments on flame retardant fabrics have been published. In this research, two methods of aftertreatments are developed to reduce the <b>free</b> <b>formaldehyde</b> contents to 75 ppm or less. One is the aftertreatment with a combination of resorcinol 1 % and diethylene glycol 4 %. The other is the combination of resorcinol 1 % and boric acid 6 %. For both these aftertreatments, ammonium acetate 0. 5 % is used as a catalyst. Fabric is padded with the solution and then dried at 130 ̊ C for 8 minutes. After drying, fabric is rinsed with water at 40 ̊ C. The aftertreatment methods developed in this research have shown a long term effect in keeping the formaldehyde release below 75 ppm during fabric storage that is not available with other conventional aftertreatment methods. These aftertreatment methods have no adverse effect on the flame retardancy of the THPC ammonia cured finished fabric and the fabric is soft as compared to the original flame retardant finished fabric and to the fabric after treated with existing methods. These new developed methods have industrial application because there is no use of any solvent and there is no use of any special equipment for the aftertreatment...|$|E

The purpose of the paper is to report a broad study on 85 % kenaf boards using linear thermoplastic polymers as the binder in preparing the boards to determine if these materials have potential in commercial applications by comparing them to other commercial materials. In these materials, linear thermoplastic polymer chains act as an adhesive and the product resembles a typical wood based panel (e. g., phenol formaldehyde fiber board). The process involved the use of small amount of glycerine in the fiber to enhance processibility in a thermo-kinetic mixer followed by hot pressing. In this paper, we report the properties of 85 % by weight kenaf fiber boards using polypropylene as the adhesive. A maleated polypropylene was used to improve the adhesion and stress transfer between the adhesive and kenaf fiber. The addition of 2 % by weight of glycerine based on the dry weight of kenaf fiber resulted in the best properties of the boards. Differential scanning calorimetric studies suggested that the glycerine had a {{little effect on the}} percent crystallinity of the matrix.

This inability arises from the difficulty of reversing formaldehyde-induced protein adducts and cross-links within FFPE tissues. We previously reported the use of elevated hydrostatic pressure as a method for efficient protein recovery from a hen egg-white lysozyme tissue surrogate, a model system developed to study formalin fixation and histochemical processing. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of elevated hydrostatic pressure as a method for efficient protein recovery from FFPE mouse liver tissue and a complex multi-protein FFPE tissue surrogate comprised of hen egg-white lysozyme, bovine carbonic anhydrase, bovine ribonuclease A, bovine serum albumin, and equine myoglobin (55 ∶ 15 ∶ 15 ∶ 10 ∶ 5 wt%). Mass spectrometry of the FFPE tissue surrogates retrieved under elevated pressure showed that both the low and high-abundance proteins were identified with sequence coverage {{comparable to that of}} the surrogate mixture prior to formaldehyde treatment. In contrast, non-pressure-extracted tissue surrogate samples yielded few positive and many false peptide identifications. Studies with soluble formalin-treated bovine ribonuclease A demonstrated that pressure modestly inhibited the rate of reversal (hydrolysis) of formaldehyde-induced protein cross-links. Dynamic light scattering studies suggest that elevated hydrostatic pressure and heat facilitate the recovery of proteins <b>free</b> of <b>formaldehyde</b> adducts and cross-links by promoting protein unfolding and hydration with a concomitant reduction in the average size of the protein aggregates. These studies demonstrate that elevated hydrostatic pressure treatment is a promising approach for improving the recovery of proteins from FFPE tissues in a form suitable for proteomic analysis...|$|R
