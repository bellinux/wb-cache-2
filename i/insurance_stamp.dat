40|$|Transcription begins] April 12, 1944 Dear Bryant Service Club: I had the {{pleasure}} of receiving your Easter package today, for which I am indeed grateful. It {{has been a long time}} since I’ve received a bulletin of information about the school, both past and present and I look forward to them as well as the quaint innuendos which accompany your packages. In the latest I received a woolen snood or what-ever-it-may-be-called which is real swell for some of the weather around these parts. However, the package was slightly the worse for wear and the card mentioned camels so I’m returning the stamped postal slip as well as the <b>insurance</b> <b>stamp</b> in order that you may put in a claim for whatever else may have been in there. At the present time time [sic] I am fairly advanced in the Radio Mechanics course. I am learning about radio equipment used for transmitting and for receiving. Before completion of the course I shall also have had a few weeks of learning aircraft radio equipment. I have met a school chum of mine from Bryant who is also on this post. His name is Leonard Levin, Pvt and he is in the 620 th T. S. S. at this field. I believe he graduated in ’ 42. It was swell seeing a buddy from my own alma mater. Thanks again for the package and I shall be looking forward to your next bulletin. Sincerely,Bob Bergman [Transcription ends...|$|E
50|$|Some {{internal}} revenue stamps, sometimes in special colours, were overprinted {{for use as}} <b>Insurance</b> <b>stamps</b> between 1869 and 1879. Between c.1892 and 1895 some were also overprinted {{for use in the}} Seychelles.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>insurance</b> <b>stamps</b> of Mauritius {{were issued}} on 1 March 1869. They were Queen Victoria postage stamps handstamped INCE in black. From {{later that year}} to 1879, all <b>insurance</b> <b>stamps</b> were {{internal}} revenue stamps handstamped or overprinted INCE, sometimes the stamps were also surcharged. In 1879 {{a new set of}} internal revenue stamps but in new colours was overprinted INSURANCE in black. In 1904 a new type appeared, similar to the design used for high value postage stamps, but with a blank value tablet and in purple. These were then overprinted INSURANCE ONLY and the value.

40|$|The Authority is a {{statutory}} {{body that}} {{was established in}} 2001 as a regulator of private health insurance. (The Financial Regulator also has responsibilities in the health insurance market, including in relation to solvency). The principal functions of the Authority as provided for in the Health Insurance Acts include the following: • To monitor the health insurance market and to advise the Minister for Health and Children (“the Minister”) (either {{at his or her}} request or on its own initiative) on matters relating to health insurance; • To monitor the operation of the Health Insurance Acts and, where appropriate, to issue enforcement notices to enforce compliance with the Acts; • To carry out certain functions in relation to health <b>insurance</b> <b>stamp</b> duty and age related tax credits and in relation to any risk equalisation scheme that may be introduced; • To take such action as it considers appropriate to increase the awareness of members of the public of their rights as consumers of health insurance and of health insurance services available to them; and • To maintain “The Register of Health Benefits Undertakings” and “The Register of Health Insurance Contracts”. The Authority is independent in the performance of its functions. The following are some examples of work undertaken by the Authority in recent times: • In 2007, the Authority issued a comprehensive report on competition in the health insurance market. • Following the 2008 Supreme Court Decision to set aside the Risk Equalisation Scheme then applying, the Authority submitted a Report to the Minister setting out the Authority’s advice in relation to how community rating could be supported in the changed circumstances. Subsequently, the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was introduced, which provided for an interim tax credit / levy system to support community rating as well as other measures, for example pertaining to consumer information and enforcement. • The Authority carries out periodic surveys into consumer attitudes and behaviour in relation to health insurance, most recently in 2008. • In October 2009 the Authority submitted a Report to the Minister under the 2009 Act providing advice in relation to the review of the tax credit / levy arrangements. • The Authority provides assistance to consumers in relation to health insurance and dealt with over 1, 000 cases over the last 12 months. • The Authority recently launched a new website, which includes a product comparison tool that consumers can use to find the products that best suit their needs as to both coverage and price. • In November 2009, the Authority submitted a preliminary report to the Minister outlining considerations {{to be taken into account}} in applying risk equalisation to factors other than age and gender...|$|E

50|$|The first {{unemployment}} <b>insurance</b> <b>stamps</b> of Queensland were undated numeral types.

50|$|In 1956, a small {{design with}} an olive branch was issued {{for use as}} Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>stamps.</b> This was overprinted when Cyprus became a {{republic}} in 1960, and later that year the same design but with bilingual inscriptions was issued.

50|$|Stamps {{used for}} {{training}} postal {{workers in the}} United Kingdom are usually normal postage or other stamps, including television license and national <b>insurance</b> <b>stamps</b> (when they were in use), obliterated with two vertical or horizontal bars to prevent genuine use, though other forms of cancellation have been used such as overprinting or rubber stamps. They have frequently {{found their way into}} the hands of collectors. Early examples were properly printed with bars but more recent examples tend to simply be crossed through with a black marker pen. A range of cancelled or voided paper money, cheques, postal orders, credit cards and horizon labels are also used to train workers which takes place at counter training schools (CTOs). Before decimalisation in 1971, post offices were issued with very simple training stamps in the same colours as the upcoming decimal stamps.|$|R

50|$|A {{temporary}} {{stamp duty}} {{was introduced in}} 1657 to finance the war with Sweden. It was made permanent in 1660 and remains on the statute book {{although it has been}} substantially altered. Most stamp duties were abolished from 1 January 2000 and the present act only provides for <b>stamp</b> duties on <b>insurance</b> policies. <b>Stamp</b> duties on land registration were renamed and transferred to a separate statute but remain essentially the same, i.e. 0.6% on deeds and 1.5% loans secured against real estate.|$|R
40|$|Program {{linkages}} and budgetary spillovers {{can significantly}} complicate efforts {{to project a}} policy change’s effects. I illustrate {{this point in the}} context of recent increases in the federal minimum wage. Previous analysis finds that these particular minimum wage increases had significant effects on employment. Employment declines were sufficiently large that the average earnings of targeted individuals declined. Payroll tax revenues thus also fell. I find that transfers to affected individuals through programs including unemployment <b>insurance,</b> food <b>stamp</b> benefits, and cash welfare assistance changed lit-tle. These programs thus offset relatively little of the earnings declines experienced by individuals who lost employment. I discuss how this broad range of spillovers matters for assessing the relevant minimum wage change’s welfare implications...|$|R
50|$|Third, a persistent, large {{output gap}} can have {{deleterious}} effects on a country’s public finances. This is partially because a struggling economy {{with a weak}} labor market results in forgone tax revenue, as unemployed or underemployed workers are either paying no income taxes, or paying less in income taxes than they would if fully employed. Additionally, {{a higher incidence of}} unemployment increases public spending on safety-net programs (in the United States, these include unemployment <b>insurance,</b> food <b>stamps,</b> Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program). Reduced tax revenue and increased public spending both exacerbate budget deficits. Indeed, research has found that for each dollar U.S. gross domestic product moves away from potential output, U.S. cyclical budget deficits increase 37 cents.|$|R
50|$|Taxpayers' money help {{to pay for}} {{the items}} on the federal budget. The gap between revenue (money {{collected}} via taxes) and spending is known as the budget deficit. The money the federal government borrows to cover the budget deficit is what creates the national debt. The government spends money for a variety of reasons: reduce inequality (“safety net” programs), provide public goods (fire, police, national defence), provide important public services like education and health (merit goods), debt interest payments, transport and military spending. The “safety net” programs are initiatives that give extra financial support to the elderly, unemployed, disabled and the poor. Examples include the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, unemployment <b>insurance,</b> food <b>stamps,</b> subsidized school meals, low-income housing assistance, energy assistance and more. The federal government spends its money in four major ways: direct payments, grants, contracts and insurance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the virtual efforts of several nonprofits to {{preserve}} “safety net” programs in the struggle with groups that view these programs as unnecessary or as dependency forming. E-mail messages received by the third author fell into 20 broad categories, of which four are analyzed here, messages often revolving around such programs as unemployment insurance, medical care and <b>insurance,</b> Food <b>Stamp</b> and other nutrition programs, and the Violence Against Women Act. The tone {{and content of the}} messages often varied with presidential administrations, the structure of Congress, and economic events, such as the crash of 2008. In all areas, attempts were made to frame the issues in broad terms related to economic needs and benefits to the country as a whole, health and welfare, and social justice or fairness. Our data illustrate the tremendous effort being extended by advocacy groups toward preserving the safety net...|$|R
40|$|Working poor {{families}} {{continue to live}} in poverty, despite working full-time jobs. Low-wage earners have found that working full-time hours does not ensure economic stability. Parents who work full-time at a salary well above the minimum wage find that they and their families are still living below 200 % of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL). An individual who earns $ 7. 11 an hour and works full-time is still at only 100 % of the poverty line. Many income support programs are designed to help families until their incomes reach 200 % of the FPL. Income support programs include, {{but are not limited to}} health <b>insurance,</b> Food <b>Stamps,</b> child support, Earned Income Tax Credit, and childcare. Income support programs are designed to help working {{poor families}} cover basic costs of living. The use of these programs often makes the difference in keeping a family out of poverty. Moving children out of poverty is integral to their health and social and emotional development...|$|R
40|$|The National Center for Children in Poverty’s (NCCP) Making Work Supports Work {{project is}} {{designed}} to identify and promote policies that make work pay for low-wage workers and their families. Millions of parents work full-time, year-round and yet struggle to provide even minimum daily necessities for their families. Government “work supports” – such as earned income tax credits, child care subsidies, health <b>insurance,</b> food <b>stamps,</b> and housing assistance – can help. These benefits encourage, support, and reward work, helping families {{close the gap between}} low wages and the cost of basic needs. To assess the effectiveness of existing state and federal work support policies, we examine how much families need to make ends meet and how public benefits impact family budgets. We then work with state partners to identify, model, and promote alternative policies that better support low-wage workers and their families. Our work draws on results from two web-based tools: the Family Resource Simulator and the Basic Needs Budget Calculator...|$|R
5000|$|Taking {{the last}} {{balanced}} [...] "total" [...] budget in 2001 as a standard, spending has risen by 5.6% GDP, from 18.2% GDP in 2001 to 23.8% GDP in 2010, while revenues declined by 4.6% GDP, from 19.5% GDP to 14.9% GDP {{over the same}} interval. By this measure, spending has increased about 1% GDP more than revenues have declined. Using the historical (1971-2008) average spending of 20.6% GDP and revenues of 18.2%, the spending increase of 3.2% GDP is smaller than the revenue decline of 3.3% GDP. In other words, the [...] "spending problem" [...] and [...] "revenue problem" [...] are comparable in size. Recessions typically cause spending to rise on social safety net programs such as unemployment <b>insurance</b> and food <b>stamps,</b> while tax revenues decline due to unemployment and reduced economic activity.|$|R
40|$|This conference {{presentation}} explores current {{patterns of}} public transfer receipt (such as {{earned income tax}} credit, public health <b>insurance</b> coverage, food <b>stamps,</b> and public assistance) among single-father families and provides an update on existing census-based research on characteristics of single-father families. Data {{were obtained from the}} March Current Population Surveys (CPS) for selected years from 1983 through 1995. Demographic characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, and public transfer receipts were compared for three types of fathers: (1) married fathers; (2) single fathers living with a partner; and (3) single fathers living without a partner. Findings indicated that the number of single-father families increased substantially between 1984 and 1994, and by 1995, accounted for 5. 9 percent of all fathers living with their own children. "Cohabiting " fathers were considerably younger than married or "non-cohabiting " single fathers. Single fathers {{were more likely to be}} black...|$|R
