25|$|As {{commercial}} use of electric energy {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a <b>direct</b> <b>reading</b> register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E

Where Jews interpret the Hebrew through Talmud and Midrash, Hovind relies on a <b>direct</b> <b>reading</b> of English. For example, Hovind claims that the word dinosaur, which was introduced to English in 1841, refers to what previously had been called dragon. Dragon is used where tannin (...) appears, but it means serpent or crocodile.|$|E

However, much of previous research only considers k-access reads and many schemes, such as Redundant Scheme, are only shown to reduce delay for k-access reads. We have no idea whether those existing schemes can also work for <b>direct</b> <b>reads.</b> The study regarding {{the characteristics of the}} delay performance ofdirect reads, and the appropriate schemes for <b>direct</b> <b>reads</b> to reduce delay is still lacking. In this paper, we study the delay performance of <b>direct</b> <b>reads</b> and its correlation with degraded reads. We illustrate the relationship between degraded reads and bandwidth cost and answer important questions like when degraded reads can help reduce delay. Then we propose a scheme DRALB to reduce delay for <b>direct</b> <b>reads.</b> DRALB can be easily added to existing schemes and can greatly reduce the delay of hot data. We also conduct trace-driven simulations to verify that DRALB significantly outperforms existing schemes, in terms of delay performance of <b>direct</b> <b>reads.</b> © 2015 IEEE.

40|$|Access latency {{performance}} {{is a key}} metric in distributed storage systems since it greatly impacts user experience while existing codes mainly focus on improving performance such as storage overhead and repair cost. By generating parity nodes from parity nodes, in this work we design new XOR-based erasure codes HTSC and FH HTSC to reduce access latency in distributed storage systems. By comparing with other popular and representative codes, we show that, under the same repair cost, HTSC and FH HTSC codes can reduce access latency while maintaining favorable performance in other metrics. In particular, under the same repair cost, FH HTSC can achieve lower access latency, higher or equal failure tolerance and lower computation cost compared with the representative codes while enjoying similar storage overhead. Accordingly, FH HTSC is a superior choice for applications requiring low access latency and outstanding failure tolerance capability at the same time. Both <b>direct</b> and k-access <b>reads</b> are common in distributed storage systems. However, much of previous research only considers k-access reads and many schemes, such as Redundant Scheme, are only shown to reduce latency for k-access reads. We have no idea whether those existing schemes can also work for <b>direct</b> <b>reads.</b> The study regarding {{the characteristics of the}} latency performance of <b>direct</b> <b>reads,</b> and the appropriate schemes for <b>direct</b> <b>reads</b> to reduce latency is still lacking. In this work, we study the latency performance of <b>direct</b> <b>reads</b> and its correlation with degraded reads.

Then we propose a scheme DRALB to reduce latency for <b>direct</b> <b>reads.</b> DRALB can be easily added to existing schemes and can greatly reduce the latency of hot data. We also conduct trace-driven simulations to verify that DRALB significantly outperforms existing schemes, in terms of latency performance of <b>direct</b> <b>reads.</b> Till now, almost all previous studies analyze access latency when a user is interested in reading all the files in a codeword. Our research extends previous studies and analyzes the access latency in a general case when users require different sizes of files from a codeword. We also characterize the latency-cost tradeoffs for the general case. In addition, we study the latency performance of coding and replication with non-uniform data popularity in practical storage systems. Accounting for practical conditions and through extensive simulations using real service time traces from Amazon S 3, we compare the latency performance of coding and replication and find that, different from previous results, under the same storage cost, we cannot determine easily which one is better, since it depends on many conditions, especially on whether the data popularity is uniform or not. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The field of the instrument is energized by the circuit current flow. The two moving coils, A and B, are connected in parallel with the circuit load. [...] One coil, A, will be connected through a resistor and the second coil, B, through an inductor, so that the current in coil B is delayed with respect to current in A. At unity power factor, the current in A is in phase with the circuit current, and coil A provides maximum torque, driving the instrument pointer toward the 1.0 mark on the scale. At zero power factor, the current in coil B is in phase with circuit current, and coil B provides torque to drive the pointer towards 0. At intermediate values of power factor, the torques provided by the two coils add and the pointer takes up intermediate positions.|$|E

A thesis: English Education of Graduate School, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta 2011. This {{action research}} is carried out to improve the students’ <b>reading</b> comprehension using <b>directed</b> <b>reading</b> and to know what happens when <b>directed</b> <b>reading</b> are used in classroom. The problem highlighted in this action research in the low, poor and different level reading comprehension of En 3 / 2 class at Champasak University in Lao PDR. That caused bythe uninteresting text book that caused students’ low motivation. The action research is conducted in two cycles from June – January 2011 in En 3 / 2 class of Champasak University inLao PDR. The procedure of the action research consists ofidentifying the problems, planning the action, implementing the action, observing the action, and reflecting the result ofthe action research. In collecting the data, the researcher used observation notes, questionnaires, interviews, diaries and test. The tests were {{in the form of}} pre-testand post-test to answer this action research questions. In this research, the researcher acted as a teacher who conducts the action in the classroom and he was assisted by his collaborator. There were two kinds of data such as qualitative and quantitative data. In analyzing quantitative data, the researcher used descriptive statistics. In analyzing qualitative data, the research used constant comparative method. The result of research showed that using <b>directed</b> <b>reading</b> could improve students’ reading comprehension and classroom situation. The improvement of the classroom situation was supported by data which cover the students’ participation, attendance and enthusiasm during the teaching-learning process. The improvement on the students’ reading comprehension reflectedfrom the mean progress of pre-test and post-test. Based on the results of the research, it was concluded that students’ reading comprehension can be improve by using <b>directed</b> <b>reading.</b> It is suggested that the teacher should use other texts beside the text book in teaching language skills, the teacher should be more careful in selecting the texts. The students are encouraged to read more to improve their ability in comprehending the text. Other researcher is encouraged to do the research in using <b>directed</b> <b>reading</b> texts in other areas of language skills...|$|R
