50|$|In 1953 {{a project}} for the {{engineering}} company and bolt manufacturer GKN took the North Bar Tool Company in a new product direction. GKN had designed a bolt called 'Prolong' that had a splined section above the nut. By gripping the splined section of the bolt and counter rotating the nut, the fastener could be tightened {{without the need for}} any external reaction device. In a further development, a shear groove was placed below the spline, so designed that the bolt would fail at the groove when the pre-determined torque had been achieved. This bolting method was known as 'Torshear'. GKN required an air <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> capable of high torque output to sell with their 'Prolong' bolts. Probably Britain's best known gearbox designer of the time was Dr. Henry Edward Merritt and so Dr. Merritt was contracted to design a suitable range of air driven gearboxes for the Torshear application.|$|E

We consider a hybrid electric vehicle equipped with batteries, a thermal engine (or fuel cells), ultracapacitors and an electric engine. The energetic flows are optimized by using a control strategy based on the prediction of short-term and medium-term vehicle states (energy consumption, vehicle load, current route, traffic flow, etc.). The prediction will be performed by a neuro-fuzzy control unit, where the predictive model exploits the robustness of fuzzy logic in managing the said uncertainties and the neural approach as a data <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> for non-linear control modeling...|$|E

40|$|Developing, {{deploying}} {{and operating}} large scale distributed system, {{for example in}} ATC, are difficult tasks. In particular geographical distribution requires special at tention towards the system properties while operating the system. This moves the Quality of Service properties of a system into the focus of system designers and system developers. Model-driven development is becoming the new paradigm for system development, ranging from requirements engineering, over system analysis and design to unit and system tests. Although this paradigm is realised by more and more tools the support for realising Quality of Service like security aspects for such system is not sufficient. This paper presents an approach which allows the handling of Quality of Service aspects in a model <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> environment and describes techniques behind this environment...|$|E

40|$|Model-driven {{development}} {{requires a}} full set of development tools. While approaches and tools for constructing most aspects of model <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> chains are readily available, {{there is a lack of}} tools and well evaluated approaches which compute and/or processes model differences. Difference tools for models must be adapted to different types of models, usecases and application contexts. So the tools and approaches must be realized every time completely anew according different algorithms and functions. As a possible solution, we propose a common difference representation and data exchange format as a foundation to integrate and evaluate individual activities. Thus we propose to analyze common and individual requirements and discuss issues of the state-ofthe-art difference representation. With this we can support future collaborations of researchers, integrate approaches, and enhance interoperability leading to more efficient research. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{report of}} a rule based, knowledge-base <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> to {{automatically}} classify Hindi verbs in syntactic perspective. We also report of developing the largest lexical resource for Hindi verbs along with the information on their class based on valency and some syntactic diagnostic tests {{as well as their}} morphological/inflectional type. We use this resource to develop the tool to automatically classify Hindi verbs in any given input text. In this process we also develop an algorithm based on the analysis of this lexical resource and a large Hindi corpus. In this algorithm we spell out the rules to disambiguate the homophonous/homo-gramphaemic words that become the root cause of ambiguity in this task. The tool developed has been tested against two large annotated corpora of Hindi and achieves close to 100 % result on a qualitative evaluation and more than 99 % on quantitative evaluation if errors from other sources are discounted...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{developing}} Internet of Things IoT) applications requires tremendous {{efforts and}} {{a wide range of}} expertise. This may discourage inexperienced developers entering the IoT development. Filling this gap, we propose a model <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> called IoTLink that allows inexperienced developers to wire physical devices visually, creating the necessary foundation for their IoT applications. Based on the visual model, IoTLink is able to generate a complete Java project including an extendable Java code. When the java code is compiled and executed, it encapsulates the complexity of communicating with devices and services. It abstracts them as virtual objects that can be accessed through different communication means that are commonly used on the internet such as web service and MQTT. IoTLink was evaluated against java development in a controlled experiment. The result shows that IoTLink was able to outperform classical java development in terms of the development time and users satisfactions...|$|E

50|$|According to one source, New Britain Machine {{was founded}} in New Britain, Connecticut in 1887. However, {{according}} to Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, it {{was founded in}} 1895 subsequent to the J.T. Case Engine Company, a manufacturer of steam engines. The first product the new company produced was a chainsaw mortising machine. In 1917, it registered the None Better trademark to sell its line of sockets and tools. Much of New Britain Machine's early tool production was done under the None Better line. Many of the early tools were carbon steel, offering a lower cost alternative to the higher price alloy steels of the day. Early tool sets consisted of hex drive sockets and an ell bar for the <b>drive</b> <b>tool.</b> Beginning in the 1930s, the None Better line consisted {{of a wide variety of}} 1/2 square <b>drive</b> <b>tools</b> with a Cadmium finish. At this time, New Britain Machine was also supplying tools for Sears in their Craftsman line of tools. These tools are easy to distinguish as they either have a BE or an H in a circle stamped into the tools. The New Britain Machine line was also created at this time as a higher priced alloy steel alternative.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a framework for}} modeling and developing temporal information systems. The framework defines a model driven development process which automatically transforms temporal system models into executable systems. Temporal applications have semantics not represented in conventional modeling languages, and the main contribution {{in this case is}} a temporal extension to an existing UML profile. The UML profile is extended with temporal concepts and constructs to provide a temporal conceptual modeling language. Temporal features are introduced by model elements defined with valid time semantics, that is, the information model captures earlier and possible future states as well as the current state of entities. The approach is based on timestamping entities with valid time intervals to represent when states of an entity were valid in the modeled reality. Based on the semantically extended models designed using the temporal profile the framework allows automatic code generation of temporal information systems. Thus, we provide model <b>driven</b> <b>tool</b> support for developing temporal valid time applications...|$|E
40|$|The Anaphe {{project is}} an ongoing effort to provide an Object Oriented {{software}} environ-ment for data analysis in HENP experiments.

In order {{to comply with the}} user requirements for a command-line <b>driven</b> <b>tool,</b> we have chosen to use a scripting language (Python) as the front-end for a data analysis tool. Interfaces for each component in combination with the use of shared libraries for their implementation provides an easy integration of existing libraries into modern scripting languages thus allowing for rapid application development. This integration is simplified even further using a specialised toolkit (SWIG) to create ”shadow classes ” for the Python language, which map the definitions of the Abstract Interfaces almost at a one-to-one level. This paper will give an overview of the architecture and design choices and will present the current status and future developments of the project...|$|E
