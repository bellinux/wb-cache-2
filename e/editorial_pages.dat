25|$|The Journal <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> and columns, run {{separately}} from the news pages, are highly influential in American conservative circles. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958–1971) and Robert L. Bartley (served 1972–2000) were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis. Some of the Journals former reporters claim that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase.|$|E
25|$|At The Boston Globe, as is {{customary}} in {{the news}} industry, the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> are separate from the news operation. Editorials represent the official view of The Boston Globe as a community institution.

Ellen Clegg, a long-time Globe journalist and former top spokeswoman for the newspaper, was named editor of the Editorial Page in 2015.|$|E

Her second editor (and third husband) Ted Thackrey became co-publisher and co-editor with Schiff in 1942. Together, they recast the newspaper into its current tabloid format. In 1948 The Bronx Home News merged with it. In 1949, James Wechsler became {{editor of the}} paper, running both the news and the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages.</b> In 1961, he turned over the news section to Paul Sann and remained as editorial-page editor until 1980.|$|E

25|$|In {{the year}} after the debut of Witches and Stitches, Joe Ekaitis began online {{publishing}} of his weekly furry comic strip T.H.E. Fox in 1986. By the mid-1990s, Ekaitis had pursued monetizing the comic through publishing it in independent comic books and the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> of The San Bernardino Sun newspaper, and through appearances on independent cable television program Rapid T. Rabbit and Friends; however, economic success was elusive. Despite running online for several years, the comic never achieved its goal of newspaper syndication, and Ekaitis stopped updating the comic in 1998.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate on}} the new oil law {{occurred}} in 1925, with U.S. interests opposing all initiatives. By 1926, the new law was enacted. In January 1927 the Mexican government canceled the permits of oil companies that would not comply with the law. Talks of war circulated by the U.S. president and in the <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> of the New York Times. Mexico managed to avoid war {{through a series of}} diplomatic maneuvers. Soon after, a direct telephone link was established between Calles and President Calvin Coolidge, and the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, James R. Sheffield, was replaced with Dwight Morrow. Morrow won the Calles government over to the United States position and helped negotiate an agreement {{between the government and the}} oil companies.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{initially}} formed, Unomásunos reporters were not experienced in investigative journalism as other newspapers in Mexico City. However, as its reporters began {{to specialize in}} certain investigative topics, Unomásuno brought forward elements of readership diversity and professionalism that were not present in the Mexican press of the time. Between the late 1970s and early 1980s, Unomásuno built a reputation among Mexican readers for having an informative and fact-based character. Opinion-based sections, like <b>editorial</b> <b>pages,</b> were reduced while private advertisements grew. Unomásuno was categorized for having a center-left or left-wing orientation. Unomásuno {{was one of the}} leading independent leftist newspapers in Mexico. The newspaper tended to give a closer view of Mexico's daily life. It discussed the issues in rural sector and in unions, topics that were discussed with less frequency in other media outlets. Unomásuno also published articles about feminism, machismo, LBGT movements, and the rights of domestic workers. It did not shy away from using profanity and denouncing the government.|$|E

25|$|The Chattanooga Times Free Press, the area's only daily newspaper, is {{published}} every morning. It {{was formed in}} 1999 from the merger of two papers that had been bitter rivals for half a century, the Times and the News-Free Press. The Times was owned and published by Adolph Ochs, who later bought the New York Times. The Times was the morning paper and had a generally more liberal editorial page. The News-Free Press, whose name {{was the result of}} an earlier merger, was an afternoon daily and its editorials were more conservative than those in the Times. On August 27, 1966, the News-Free Press became the first newspaper in the nation to dissolve a joint operating agreement. In 1999, the Free Press, which had changed its name from News-Free Press in 1993, was bought by an Arkansas company, WEHCO Media, publisher of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, which then bought The Times from the Ochs heirs. The Times Free Press is the only newspaper in the United States to have 2 <b>editorial</b> <b>pages,</b> each reflecting opposite ends of the political spectrum. The Times' editorial page, which is liberal, is on the left page and the Free Press' editorial page, which is conservative, is on the right page.|$|E

500|$|Complaints {{about her}} role as fashion {{eminence}} grise are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. [...] "She's honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no," [...] according to Karl Lagerfeld. [...] "She's not too pushy", agrees François-Henri Pinault, {{chief executive officer of}} PPR, Gucci's parent company. [...] "She lets you know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." [...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's <b>editorial</b> <b>pages,</b> although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time.

500|$|Many major <b>editorial</b> <b>pages</b> and columnists {{have been}} {{sympathetic}} to the supporters of the Jena Six. They have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and {{to call for a}} renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published {{around the time of the}} Jena rally. The New York Post, in a September 23, 2007, editorial, stated [...] "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work." [...] Byron Williams, writing on the Huffington Post, was one of several to cite the Urban League's 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man. The 2005 report also found that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely to go to jail than a white male arrested for the same crime. Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist Clarence Page wrote that [...] "The best legacy for the Jena March 6would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears. I don't care who leads it, but it shouldn't be for blacks only." [...] Writing in the New York Times, Professor Orlando Patterson of Harvard University used the case to highlight the use of the prison system as a means of [...] "controlling young black men", which is one factor in a broader [...] "crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life".|$|E
