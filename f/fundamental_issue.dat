25|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>issue</b> about {{measuring}} spin along different axes is {{that these}} measurements cannot have definite values at the same time―they are incompatible {{in the sense that}} these measurements' maximum simultaneous precision is constrained by the uncertainty principle. This is contrary to what is found in classical physics, where any number of properties can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary accuracy. It has been proven mathematically that compatible measurements cannot show Bell-inequality-violating correlations, and thus entanglement is a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.|$|E

The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|E

[...] Regardless of the particulars of the incident, the larger issue {{would turn out to be}} the sweeping powers granted by the resolution.

2500|$|Less {{than two}} decades after the {{widespread}} introduction of AS to English-speaking audiences, {{there are hundreds of}} books, articles and websites describing it; prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup. However, questions remain concerning many aspects of AS; whether it should be a separate condition from high-functioning autism is a <b>fundamental</b> <b>issue</b> requiring further study. The diagnostic validity of Asperger syndrome is tentative, there is little consensus among clinical researchers about the usage of the term [...] "Asperger's syndrome", and there are questions about the empirical validation of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria. It is likely that the definition of the condition will change as new studies emerge and it will eventually be understood as a multifactorial heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder involving a catalyst that results in prenatal or perinatal changes in brain structures.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>fundamental</b> <b>issue</b> of water-containing-electrolyte systems lies in {{the control}} of {{aggressiveness}} of the water towards metallic aluminum. This issue has dominated the development of electrolytic capacitors over many decades. [...] The first commercially used electrolytes in the mid-twentieth century were mixtures of ethylene glycol and boric acid. But even these glycol electrolytes had an unwanted chemical water-crystal reaction, according to the scheme: [...] "acid + alcohol" [...] → [...] "ester + water". Thus, even in the first apparently water-free electrolytes, esterification reactions could generate a water content of up to 20 percent. These electrolytes had a voltage-dependent life span, because at higher voltages the leakage current based on the aggressiveness of the water would increase exponentially; and the associated increased consumption of electrolyte {{would lead to a}} faster drying out. Otherwise, the electrolyte has to deliver the oxygen for self-healing processes, and water is the best chemical substance to do that.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{understanding}} has it {{that the}} purpose of the Turing Test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could imitate a human. While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing, Sterrett believes that it was and thus conflates the second version with this one, while others, such as Traiger, do not– this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the [...] "standard interpretation." [...] In this version, player A is a computer and player B a person of either sex. The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female, but which is a computer and which is a human. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>issue</b> with the standard interpretation is that the interrogator cannot differentiate which responder is human, and which is machine. [...] There are issues about duration, but the standard interpretation generally considers this limitation as something that should be reasonable.|$|E

2500|$|The {{transformation}} {{was accelerated}} during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying Marxist aesthetics and Marxist literary criticism, advising young literati, {{and his colleague}} Vianu, to do the same. Ralea was going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it {{as an obstacle to}} the proper understanding of Romanian society. In Explicarea omului, Vianu notes, he brought up [...] "a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself obstacles and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [...]" [...] According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as [...] "a mechanism for social self-regulation", which helped to distill the [...] "vital impulse", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality. Overall, Ralea contended that [...] "dialectical materialism has the complete answer to any <b>fundamental</b> <b>issue</b> regarding social structuring". That answer was in [...] "superstructures", and the references were Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, alongside Ludwig Klages and Max Scheler. According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of psychological anthropology, and merely showed [...] "what superstructures become under Marxist materialism." [...] Contrarily, critic Antonio Patraș noted the links between Explicarea omului (a [...] "brilliant study") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.|$|E

60|$|The {{tyranny of}} the {{majority}} {{is a very real}} danger. It is a mistake to suppose that the majority is necessarily right. On every new question the majority is always wrong at first. In matters where the state must act as a whole, such as tariffs, for example, decision by majorities is probably the best method that can be devised. But there are a great many questions {{in which there is no}} need of a uniform decision. Religion is recognized as one of these. Education ought to be one, provided a certain minimum standard is attained. Military service clearly ought to be one. Wherever divergent action by different groups is possible without anarchy, it ought to be permitted. In such cases it will be found by those who consider past history that, whenever any new <b>fundamental</b> <b>issue</b> arises, the majority are in the wrong, because they are guided by prejudice and habit. Progress comes through the gradual effect of a minority in converting opinion and altering custom. At one time--not so very long ago--it was considered monstrous wickedness to maintain that old women ought not to be burnt as witches. If those who held this opinion had been forcibly suppressed, we should still be steeped in medieval superstition. For such reasons, it is of the utmost importance that the majority should refrain from imposing its will as regards matters in which uniformity is not absolutely necessary.|$|E
