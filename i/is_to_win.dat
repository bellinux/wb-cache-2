5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E

25|$|Urs Fischer {{remained}} as manager and the clubs priority {{aim for the}} new season <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the league championship for the eighth consecutive time. The 2016–17 Swiss Super League season started on the weekend 23/24 July, where Basel beat Sion. Basel's clear aim for the 2016–17 Swiss Cup is to regain the title that they last won in 2012. In the first round they have been drawn away against Rapperswil-Jona. Basel entered into this season's Champions League in the Group stage. They were drawn with French champions Paris Saint-Germain, English team Arsenal and Bulgarian champions Ludogorets Razgrad. They finished a disappointing 4th, after losing home and away to Paris Saint-Germain (1-2 and 0-3 respectively) and to Arsenal F.C. (1-4 and 0-2 respectively), in addition to collecting 2 points from bore draws against Ludogorets Razgrad. This {{would be the first}} time in 10 years that the Rot-Blau would not be playing European Football after Christmas.|$|E
25|$|Basel's {{priority}} aim for {{the season}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the league championship for the seventh time in a row. Basel's 2015–16 Swiss Super League season began well with a home victory on 18 July against Vaduz. In fact, they started the season very well, winning each of their first eight games, scoring 22 goals conceding 7. They suffered their first defeat in the Stade de Suisse 3–4 against Young Boys. Four of the next five games were won; the away game against Zürich in Letzigrund ended in a 2–2 draw. Two defeats were followed by two victories. By the winter break, Basel led the league table with 43 points, 10 points ahead of the Grasshoppers and 15 ahead of the Young Boys. They had won 14 and drawing 1 of the first 18 games, scoring 43 goals and conceding just 20. Basel started {{the second half of}} the season with three straight wins, a further 2–2 draw against Zürich and another three straight wins. In round 31, on 30 April, the home win against Sion gave Basel a 16-point lead in the league table with just five games left to play and thus the championship title. Basel ended the season with two defeats in the last three games, but won the championship with 83 points and were 14 points ahead of Young Boys and 29 points ahead of Luzern. Basel had won 26 games drawing five and had suffered five defeats; they had scored 88 goals, conceding 38.|$|E

He claimed that he was never sent off or booked by a referee. In his view, the art of tackling is in the timing and the sole object <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the ball. He wrote that even if the opponent is injured in the tackle, [...] "it's not a foul because you have timed everything right and you've won it".

500|$|With little land {{action in}} the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the [...] "Bore War", later renamed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] by journalists. Chamberlain, in common with most Allied {{officials}} and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament. Chamberlain was reluctant {{to go too far}} in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, [...] "the only thing that matters <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process". However, actual government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940. Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68% and almost 60% in April 1940.|$|E

500|$|In his conclusion, Smith states {{his belief}} that modern {{politicians}} and military leaders use force where it has no utility and commit military forces without fully defined political and strategic objectives. He believes that politicians and generals remain in the mindset of industrial war, which leads them {{to prepare for a}} decisive confrontation that never happens, and he condemns them for failing to recognise the shift in the way wars are fought. Discussing humanitarian interventions, such as those in the Balkans, Smith does not argue against intervention, but believes that the intervention must be based on a full understanding of the conflict and a clear strategy with defined objectives. According to Smith, [...] "no act of force will ever be decisive" [...] because the aim of modern conflicts <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the will of the people, which will not be achieved by battlefield victory alone. He argues that whereas, in the industrial war paradigm, war led to victory and thus to peace, in the modern paradigm confrontation leads to conflict, which then reverts to confrontation. He asserts that force {{is only part of the}} solution to modern conflicts; they require complex political and military solutions, which will subdue but not necessarily permanently end the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E
500|$|Early breaker Denifl {{was alone}} in front and had about two minutes of an {{advantage}} with [...] to go. Behind, Domenico Pozzovivo placed an acceleration that put the lead group in difficulty, but he was brought back. The time gap rapidly decreased, due to dubious time monitoring again. Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources {{to keep up with}} him for a while but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was important for me and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today. I've got a lot of confidence now, that’s important for the Tour de France.

A new WRC rule for 2007 allowed for Remote Service Zones to be set up away from the main Service Park at Rally HQ. For 15 minutes the cars could be refuelled, re-tyred, and have any necessary maintenance carried out, as long as the parts and tools to do so (except fuel and tyres) were already in the vehicle. For Grönholm this was a major relief. On the previous stage his car had developed an issue with the hydraulic flappy-paddle gearchanges on his steering wheel, which meant he had had to resort to shifting gears manually. The technicians were unsure why or how it had occurred and were hoping that their repairs would last until the car got back to Valence.

500|$|Lajoie's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Naps' play worsened. [...] "You can't win {{in the major leagues}} unless you have players who know the game. We don't have time to teach and train youngsters up here. Our job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> pennants, not run schools", he said. Franklin Lewis, sports writer and author, wrote [...] "Lajoie, in spite of his {{marvelous}} fielding and tremendous batting, was not exactly a darling of the grandstand as a manager." [...] Lajoie recommended to Somers on August 17, 1909, he find the team a new manager, although he wanted to remain on the club as a player. Somers responded to Lajoie by giving him more time to finalize his decision but when Lajoie came back days later and announced the same decision, Somers acted quickly to find a replacement. Lajoie later described the decision to take on the added duties as a player-manager as the biggest mistake of his career as he felt it negatively affected his play. The highest-paid player in the league, he also offered a $10,000 ($ in current dollar terms) reduction in salary. Somers promoted Naps coach Deacon [...] "Jim" [...] McGuire to manager. The team finished 7182 while Lajoie's [...]324 average was third in the AL and 33 doubles second. The Naps finished 1910 7181 but Lajoie had one of his better seasons statistically as he led the majors with a [...]384 average and 227 hits, both categories bettered only in Lajoie's 1901 campaign. His 51 doubles, a career-high, and 304 total bases led the majors, the fourth and final time in his career he would lead the majors in the latter category. Lajoie missed significant parts of back-to-back seasons, the first in 1911 when he appeared in just 90 games. Stovall, the former Naps first baseman, replaced McGuire as the club's manager and the Naps finished 8073. Lajoie was forced to sit out six weeks of the 1912 season when he sprained his back in May during a practice session in Chicago. He played in 117 games on the season, an increase of the 90 he played in one season before, but Cleveland, who had hired Joe Birmingham as the team's fifth manager since Lajoie gave up the role in 1909, finished 7578. Lajoie and Joe Jackson tied for the team lead with 90 RBIs. He finished fourth in the AL with a [...]368 batting average. In 1913, Birmingham and Lajoie had arguments in the open, including one incident in June when Lajoie cursed Birmingham openly to reporters after being benched during a batting slump. Lajoie hit [...]335 on the year, the last time he would hit over [...]300 in his career.|$|E
