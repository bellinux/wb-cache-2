The information contained in the deleted tables would be relocated to the HCGS Technical Requirements Manual (TRM). The proposed change is consistent with Generic Letter 91 - 08, "Removal of Component Lists from <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications,</b> " which provides guidance for preparing license amendment requests to remove component lists from the TS. This request meets all conditions outlined in the Generic Letter. Additionally, the revision does not alter the requirements for component operability currently in the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications.</b> The Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) and Surveillance Requirements will be retained in the revised <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> and the proposed change will not affect the meaning, application, and function of the current <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> requirements for the components.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{determine}} the adequacy of the High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR) <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> for 40 MW operation by comparison with the HFBR Final Safety Analysis Report, particularly the accident analyses chapter. Specifically, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> were compared against the Design Basis Accident (DBA) Analyses presented in the Addendum to the HFBR FSAR for 60 MW Operation. The 60 MW DBA analyses was used since it is more current and complete than the analyses presented in the original FSAR which is considered obsolete. A listing of the required systems and equipment was made for each of the accidents analyzed. Additionally, the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> instrument setpoints were compared to the DBA analyses parametric values. Also included in this review was a comparison of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> Bases against the FSAR and the identification of any differences. The HFBR Operations Procedures Manual (OPM) was also reviewed for any inconsistencies between the FSAR or the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications.</b> Upon completion of this review it was determined that the <b>Technical</b> <b>Specifications</b> are well written and the items commented on should not delay the low power restart (40 MW).
