The former {{chose to}} ignore {{the other members of}} the Tuscan Royal Family and reluctantly deigned only speak to her.

50|$|Non-standard poker <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> <b>hands</b> which <b>are</b> not {{recognized}} by official poker rules but {{are made by}} house rules. Non-standard hands usually appear in games using wild cards or bugs. Other terms for nonstandard <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> special <b>hands</b> or freak hands. Because the <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> defined by house rules, the composition and ranking of these <b>hands</b> <b>is</b> subject to variation. Any player participating in a game with non-standard <b>hands</b> should <b>be</b> sure to determine the exact {{rules of the game}} before play begins.|$|R

5|$|On the column's inglorious {{return to}} Bulawayo on 18 December 1893, Forbes was {{received}} in muted disgrace.

5|$|The {{stony-iron}} Pallasite meteorites are {{not connected}} to the Pallas asteroid, being instead named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas.

5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift for the English language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, <b>Hand</b> <b>was</b> viewed as a liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty, sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized the civil-rights activism of the 1950s Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>was</b> also a {{founding}} member of the American Law Institute, where he helped develop the influential Restatements of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review, the magazine of the country's first nationwide homosexual organization, published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, , a {{theatrical}} CGI film, and , a non-canon OVA, were released {{as part of}} the Compilation of Final FantasyVII. Advent Children was animated by Visual Works, which helped the company create CG sequences for the games. The film, unlike The Spirits Within, gained mixed to positive reviews from critics and has become a commercial success. Last Order, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>was</b> released in Japan in a special DVD bundle package with Advent Children. Last Order sold out quickly and was positively received by Western critics, though fan reaction was mixed over changes to established story scenes.|$|E
5|$|Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the {{original}} version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> brought in to test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but this was probably a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E

5|$|Qasim al-Ahmad, head of {{the rebels}} in Jabal Nablus, then {{requested}} a pardon from Ibrahim Pasha {{so that he could}} negotiate an end to the fighting himself. Ibrahim agreed and with guarantees of safety by al-Husayni and Abd al-Hadi, Qasim met with Ibrahim in late June. The latter admonished Qasim for his betrayal of Muhammad Ali, to which Qasim responded with an apology and an explanation that his <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> forced. By the end of the meeting, the two reconciled and Ibrahim reappointed Qasim as mutassalim of both Nablus and Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a 1937 American {{animated}} musical fantasy film {{produced by}} Walt Disney Productions and originally released by RKO Radio Pictures. Based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, {{it is the}} first full-length cel animated feature film and the earliest Disney animated feature film. The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank, Richard Creedon, Merrill De Maris, Otto Englander, Earl Hurd, Dick Rickard, Ted Sears and Webb Smith. David <b>Hand</b> <b>was</b> the supervising director, while William Cottrell, Wilfred Jackson, Larry Morey, Perce Pearce, and Ben Sharpsteen directed the film's individual sequences.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason why}} there are no scores in the 1 han 20 fu cell is that such a <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> impossible. The only 20 fu <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> the no-points <b>hand</b> (pinfu, 平和) where the winning tile is self-drawn. However, since a no-points <b>hand</b> must <b>be</b> closed, it makes winning via a self-drawn tile {{automatically}} add 1 han yaku of self pick to the hand. Therefore, a 1 han 20 fu hand cannot exist. A seven pairs <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> fixed at 25 fu. Since the <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> always closed, it adds 1 han of self pick when won by self-draw.|$|R
5|$|The Persian strategy, on {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry was evidently lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E
5|$|The {{clock was}} first {{installed}} in 1822. A second minute <b>hand</b> <b>was</b> later added {{to show the}} time in London {{as well as the}} local time in Bristol; the red minute hand shows Greenwich Mean Time and the black minute hand shows Bristol time. This became necessary following the arrival of the railways, which required a standardised time for timetabling around the country, known as railway time; Bristol officially adopted railway time on 14 September 1852. The city is 2º 35' west of Greenwich, so when it is noon in Bristol by old local time, it is just after 12:10p.m. in London by standard time.|$|E

The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
