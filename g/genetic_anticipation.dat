50|$|In genetics, {{anticipation}} is {{a phenomenon}} whereby as a genetic disorder is {{passed on to the}} next generation, the symptoms of the genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age with each generation. In most cases, an increase of severity of symptoms is also noted. Anticipation is common in trinucleotide repeat disorders, such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, where a dynamic mutation in DNA occurs. All of these diseases have neurological symptoms. Prior {{to the understanding of the}} <b>genetic</b> mechanism for <b>anticipation,</b> it was debated whether anticipation was a true biological phenomenon or whether the earlier age of diagnosis was related to heightened awareness of disease symptoms within a family.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrinucleotide repeats {{in human}} <b>genetic</b> {{disorders}} showing <b>anticipation</b> follow two inheritance patterns {{as a function}} of length. Inheritance of 35 – 50 repeats show incremental changes, while tracts greater than 80 repeats show large saltatory expansions. We describe a bacterial system that recapitulates this striking bimodal pattern of CTG amplification. Incremental expansions predominate in CTG tracts < Okazaki fragment size, while saltatory expansions increase in repeat tracts ≥ Okazaki fragment size. CTG amplification requires loss of SbcC, a protein that modulates cleavage of single-stranded DNA and degradation of duplex DNA from double-strand breaks. These results suggest that noncanonical single strand–containing secondary structures in Okazaki fragments and/or double-strand breaks in repeat tracts are intermediates in CTG amplification...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{signalling}} gradients in cascades of two-state reaction-diffusion {{systems were}} described {{as a model for}} understanding key biochemical mechanisms that underlie development and differentiation processes in the Drosophila embryo. Diffusion-trapping at the exterior of the cell membrane triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade to relay an appropriate signal from the membrane to the inner part of the cytosol, whereupon another diffusion-trapping mechanism involving the nucleus reads out this signal to trigger appropriate changes in gene expression. Proposed mathematical models exhibit equilibrium distributions consistent with experimental measurements of key spatial gradients in these processes. A significant property of the formulation is that the signal is assumed to be relayed from one system to the next in a linear fashion. However, the MAPK cascade often exhibits nonlinear dose-response properties and the final remark of Berezhkovskii et al. (2009) is that this assumption remains an important property to be tested experimentally, perhaps via a new quantitative assay across multiple <b>genetic</b> backgrounds.

AIMS: In this study, clinical characteristics (disease type, extent, age on onset, need for surgery, and presence of extraintestinal manifestations) have been compared in affected subjects in multiply-affected families, with inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: 54 families in whom one parent and at least one child were affected (a total of 77 parent-child pairs) and 155 families in whom at least two siblings were affected (a total of 190 affected sibling pairs) were involved. RESULTS: In affected parent-child pairs, parent and child were concordant for disease type in 58 of 77 pairs (75. 3 %), for extent in 63. 6 %, extraintestinal manifestations in 70. 1 %, and smoking history in 85 %. The median age of onset in parents was significantly higher than offspring (p < 0. 0001). In 40 pairs, 60. 6 %, the parent was at least 10 years older than child.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—At {{least three}} {{clinically}} indistinguishable but genetically {{different types of}} autosomal dominant pure spastic paraplegia (ADPSP) have been described. In this study the clinical, genetic, neurophysiological, and MRI characteristics of ADPSP were investigated.  METHODS—Sixty three at risk members from five families were clinically evaluated. A diagnostic index was constructed for the study. Microsatellite genotypes were determined for chromosomes 2 p, 14 q, and 15 q markers and multipoint linkage analyses were performed. Central motor conduction time studies (CMCT), somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) measurement, and MRI {{of the brain and}} the total spinal cord were carried out in 16 patients from four families.  RESULTS—The clinical core features of ADPSP were homogeneously expressed in all patients but some features were only found in some families and not in all the patients within the family. In two families non-progressive "congenital" ADPSP was seen in some affected members whereas adult onset progressive ADPSP was present in other affected family members. As a late symptom not previously described low backache was reported by 47 %. Age at onset varied widely and there was a tendency for it to decline in successive generations in the families, suggesting <b>anticipation.</b> <b>Genetic</b> linkage analysis confined the ADPSP locus to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24 in the five families. The lod scores obtained by multipoint linkage analysis were positive with a combined maximum lod score of Z= 8. 60. The neurophysiological studies only showed minor and insignificant prolongation of the central motor conduction time and further that peripheral conduction and integrity of the dorsal columns were mostly normal. Brain and the total spinal cord MRI did not disclose any significant abnormalities compared with controls.  CONCLUSIONS—ADPSP linked to chromosome 2 p 21 -p 24 is a phenotypic heterogeneous disorder characterised by both interfamilial and intrafamilial variation. In some families the disease may be "pure" but the existence of "pure plus" families is suggested in others. The neurophysiological and neuroimaging investigations did not show any major abnormalities. ...|$|R

This is likely {{explained by the}} addition of further CAG repeats in the gene in the progeny of affected individuals.

A parent with 35 repeats would be considered [...] "normal" [...] and never exhibit any symptoms of the disease. [...] That parent's offspring, however, would be at an increased risk compared to the general population of developing Huntington's, as it would take only the addition of one more CAG codon to cause the production of mHTT (mutant HTT), the protein responsible for disease. Huntington's very rarely occurs spontaneously; it is almost always the result of inheriting the defective gene from an affected parent. Sporadic cases of Huntington's do occur, and those individuals with a parent who already has a significant number of CAG repeats in their HTT gene, especially if it approaches the number (36) required for the disease to manifest, are at an increased risk of developing Huntington's despite the lack of any history of the disease in their family. Also, the more repeats, the more severe the disease and the earlier its onset.

In this study, we first review different statistical methods for testing <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> in affected parent-child pairs that address the issue of bias due to right truncation. Using affected parent-child pair data, we compare the paired t -test with the parametric conditional maximum likelihood approach of Huang and Vieland [1997] and the nonparametric approach of Rabinowitz and Yang [1999] in terms of Type I error and power under various simulation settings and departures from the modeling assumptions. We especially investigate the issue of multiplex ascertainment and its effect on the different methods. We then focus on exploring <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> in Lynch syndrome and analyze new data on the age of onset in affected parent-child pairs from families seen at the University of Michigan Cancer Genetics clinic with a mutation in one of the three main mismatch repair (MMR) genes. In contrast to the clinic-based population, we re-analyze data on a population-based Lynch syndrome cohort, derived from the Danish HNPCC-register. Both datasets indicate evidence of <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> in Lynch syndrome. We then expand our review to incorporate recently proposed statistical methods that consider family instead of affected pairs as the sampling unit. These prospective censored regression models offer additional flexibility to incorporate unaffected family members, familial correlation and other covariates into the analysis. An expanded dataset from the Danish HNPCC-register is analyzed by this alternative set of methods. Genet. Epidemiol. 34 : 756 - 768, 2010. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Evidence was {{sought for}} <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> (disease {{occurring}} {{at an earlier}} age in subsequent generations, with increasing severity) in nodal osteoarthritis (NOA).  METHODS—Age at symptom onset and disease severity was compared within 30  parent/offspring pairs with NOA. Correlation between the offspring age of disease onset and the parental age at conception was also assessed.  RESULTS—The age at onset of nodal symptoms was earlier in the offspring (43  years (95 % confidence intervals (CI) 38  to 47) v 61  (CI 58  to 65); mean difference 18  years (CI 13  to 22) : p< 0. 001) as was large joint symptom onset (48  years (CI 41  to 55) v 67  (CI 61  to 73); mean difference 20  years (CI 13  to 27) : p< 0. 01). A negative correlation existed between age of offspring symptom onset and parental age at conception. Fifteen (50 %) offspring had similar or more extensive disease than their parents.  CONCLUSIONS—These results suggest <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> occurs in NOA and if confirmed a search for trinucleotide repeats is warranted.    Keywords: nodal osteoarthritis; genetic anticipation; trinucleotide repeat...|$|E
40|$|Evidence for <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> has {{recently}} {{become an important}} subject of research in clinical psychiatric genetics. Renewed interest in anticipation was evoked by molecular genetic findings of a novel type of mutation termed "unstable DNA. " The unstable DNA model can be construed as the "best fit" for schizophrenia twin and family epidemiological data. We have performed a large-scale Southern blot hybridization, asymmetrical PCR-based, and repeat expansion-detection screening for (CAG) n/(CTG) n and (CCG) n/(CGG) n expansions in eastern Canadian schizophrenia multiplex families demonstrating <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation.</b> There were no differences in (CAG) n/(CTG) n and (CCG) n/(CGG) n pattern distribution either between affected and unaffected individuals or across generations. Our findings {{do not support the}} hypothesis that large (CAG) n/(CTG) n or (CCG) n/(CGG) n expansions are the major etiologic factor in schizophrenia. A separate set of experiments directed to the analysis of small (30 - 130 trinucleotides), Huntington disease-type expansions in individual genes is required in order to fully exclude the presence of (CAG) n/(CTG) n- or (CCG) n/(CGG) n-type unstable mutation...|$|E

Telomere shortening {{has been described as}} a mechanism to explain <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> in dyskeratosis congenita and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Since <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> has been observed in familial breast cancer, we aimed to study telomere length in familial breast cancer patients and hypothesized that genetic defects causing this disease would affect telomere maintenance resulting in shortened telomeres. Here, we first investigated age anticipation in motherdaughter pairs with breast cancer in 623 breast cancer families, classified as BRCA 1, BRCA 2, and BRCAX. Moreover, we analyzed telomere length in DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes by quantitative PCR in a set of 198 hereditary breast cancer patients, and compared them with 267 control samples and 71 sporadic breast cancer patients. Changes in telomere length in mother-daughter pairs from breast cancer families and controls were also evaluated to address differences through generations. We demonstrated that short telomeres characterize hereditary but not sporadic breast cancer. We have defined a group of BRCAX families with short telomeres, suggesting that telomere maintenance genes might be susceptibility genes for breast cancer. Significantly, we described that progressive telomere shortening is associated with earlier onset of breast cancer in successive generations of affected families. Our results provide evidence that telomere shortening is associated with earlier age of cancer onset in successive generations, suggesting that it might be a mechanis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>anticipation</b> {{is defined}} as a {{decrease}} in age of onset or increase in severity as the disorder is transmitted through subsequent generations. Anticipation has been noted in the literature for over a century. Recently, anticipation in several diseases including Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s Disease, Myotonic Dystrophy and Fragile X Syndrome were shown to be caused by expansion of triplet repeats. Anticipation effects have also been observed in numerous mental disorders (e. g. Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder), cancers (Li-Fraumeni Syndrome, Leukemia) and other complex diseases. ^ Several statistical methods have been applied to determine whether anticipation is a true phenomenon in a particular disorder, including standard statistical tests and newly developed affected parent/affected child pair methods. These methods {{have been shown to be}} inappropriate for assessing anticipation for a variety of reasons, including familial correlation and low power. Therefore, we have developed family-based likelihood modeling approaches to model the underlying transmission of the disease gene and penetrance function and hence detect anticipation. These methods can be applied in extended families, thus improving the power to detect anticipation compared with existing methods based only upon parents and children. The first method we have proposed is based on the regressive logistic hazard model. This approach models anticipation by a generational covariate. The second method allows alleles to mutate as they are transmitted from parents to offspring and is appropriate for modeling the known triplet repeat diseases in which the disease alleles can become more deleterious as they are transmitted across generations. ^ To evaluate the new methods, we performed extensive simulation studies for data simulated under different conditions to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms to detect <b>genetic</b> <b>anticipation.</b> Results from analysis by the first method yielded empirical power greater than 87...|$|E
