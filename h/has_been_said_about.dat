A lot of what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> SP is a matter of theory. Several theories have been devised to develop some of the above-mentioned and other unclear issues. Not all of them give satisfactory explanations of all problems, however the research they inspired has yielded a lot of useful data.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away from anybody, I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity. Too much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the number issue. I’m not looking to cause any controversy. In fact, Raúl and I were in the national squad together in the past. I haven’t forced anybody out." [...] When questioned on whether the whole uproar created over Raúl's omission was affecting him personally, he said, [...] "I've never liked it because I think it has been damaging for the both of us. We've always got on well together whenever we've met up for international duty, so I'm not concerned. I just work hard for myself. All I want is to be in the squad for every game, to have the Spain badge on my chest and to score as many goals as I can." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjective}} events {{allow students}} more creativity than the objective events. The speech event {{is divided into}} prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: [...] "It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> our modern times that, 'Invention {{is the mother of}} necessity.' Please discuss.", [...] "Math has been described as the universal language. Discuss." [...] and [...] "Why is light, light and dark, dark?" [...] In the interview, the students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment. Questions range from: [...] "Who is your role model?" [...] to [...] "How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?" [...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.|$|E

500|$|By {{the second}} half of {{communist}} rule, several new approaches in the critical assessment of Creangă's literature were emerging. His work became a main topic of critical interest and the sole subject of many works, to the point where Nicolae Manolescu assessed that [...] "everything <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Creangă". Within this exegetic phenomenon, an original interpretation of his stories from an esoteric perspective was written by philosopher Vasile Lovinescu as Creangă și Creanga de aur ("Creangă and the Golden Bough"). During the final two decades of communism, under Nicolae Ceaușescu, the recovery of nationalist discourse into official dogma also encouraged the birth of Protochronism. In one of its aspects, theorized by cultural historian Edgar Papu, this approach controversially reevaluated various Romanian writers, Creangă included, presenting them as figures who anticipated most developments on the world stage. Papu's own conclusion about [...] "Harap Alb", outlined in a 1983 volume, depicted Creangă as a direct predecessor of Italian semiotician Umberto Eco and his celebrated volume The Open Work—a conclusion which literary historian Florin Mihăilescu has seen as proof of Papu's [...] "exegetic obsession", lacking in [...] "sense of humor, not just sense of reality." [...] One of Papu's disciples, national communist ideologue Dan Zamfirescu, claimed that Creangă was equal to, or even more important than world classics Homer, William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, while asserting that the eponymous protagonist of [...] "Ivan Turbincă" [...] stands as [...] "the character who dominates world history in our century". Left outside the scope of this critical interest, the [...] "corrosives" [...] were left out of new Creangă readers (such as Iorgu Iordan's 1970 edition), being, according to a 1976 essay by scholar George Munteanu, [...] "still unpublishable" [...] for lack of [...] "a general level of aesthetic education" [...] among Romanians.|$|E
500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so glad he will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol." [...] The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment.|$|E

[...] "Future VW models will {{fundamentally}} also be constructed with hybrid concepts," [...] VW head of development Ulrich Hackenberg told Automobilwoche in an interview. Hackenberg mentioned that the car based on the Up! concept seen at Frankfurt Motor Show, {{as well as all}} future models, could be offered with either full or partial hybrid options. The rear-engine up! will go into production in 2011. Nothing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> plug-in hybrid options.|$|E

Certainly no one could in honesty deny the harsh or [...] "squashed" [...] sounds, nor the wobble on the very high notes. These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran, two geniuses of song (as they were then called), sublime, yet imperfect. Both were brought to trial in their day.... Yet few singers have made history {{in the annals of}} opera as these two did." ...|$|E

When I think of these values and see them taught and observed, then I am willing to leave the question of numbers to the man and the woman and the Lord.|$|E
2500|$|Following the collision, {{the press}} vilified Alberta. In {{her first year}} of service, she was {{involved}} in four minor collisions and a fifth major collision that sank the Osborn. [...] The Cleveland News Leader [...] said of the Alberta, [...] "This huge steel monster, during the few months she has been afloat has become the terror of the lakes. [...] Proud of her {{reputation as one of the}} fastest side-wheel steamers on fresh water, she has been run in an extraordinarily reckless manner."

2500|$|At the Democratic National Convention in July, Palmer {{never had}} a chance at winning the nomination. Coolidge, famous for his {{opposition}} to the right of police to strike, won a place on the Republican ticket, but the party's nominee, and the eventual winner of the 1920 election, was the U.S. Senator from Ohio, Warren G. Harding. He sounded a very different note in mid-August. An interviewer wrote that [...] "his jaws fairly snapped" [...] when he said that [...] "too much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Bolshevism in America. It is quite true that there are enemies of Government within our borders. However, I believe their number has been greatly magnified. The American workman is not a Bolshevik; neither is the American employer an autocrat." ...|$|E

He paid special attention the situation of the Church in the western regions of Ukraine, where the world has been broken actions Uniates and [...] "splitters - autocephalists" [...] and condemns the decision of the Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of their institution (parallel ROC) church structures in the USSR.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 June 1893, {{the fleet}} was on {{exercises}} when Tryon's flagship, HMS Victoria, sank following a bizarre order from him which brought it in collision with the flagship {{of his second}} in command, Rear Admiral Sir Albert Markham. Tryon went down with his ship, his last reported words being [...] "It is all my fault". Tryon was considered by many of his contemporaries to be a supremely competent yet radical officer, but with a strong and sometimes overbearing personality. This manner was felt to be a contributory cause to the accident. For instance, an article in Society Journal Talk in July 1893 (following the accident) said, [...] "Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> George Tryon's charm of manner, {{and the rest of}} it, but in truth he was, at any rate when officially engaged, a very brusque and dictatorial man. Unfortunately he was a 'viewy' man too, a man of theories..." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take {{everything}} up {{again from the}} foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'. You can then avoid confusion if, right from the start, you make the distinctions that must, in all honesty, be acknowledged. The history of the 'Bâteau Lavoir' belongs {{to those who were}} part of that particular grouping. Personally, I only know what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> this history; I do not know the details, nor did my comrades of the other group Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger... But what I do know well, because I lived it and remember it perfectly, is the origin of our relations and their development to 1914, passing by the notorious Room 41 of the Indépendants of 1911, which provoked the 'involuntary scandal' out of which Cubism really emerged and spread in Paris, in France and through the world...

2500|$|Positive review {{came from}} Diego Costa of Slant Magazine, {{who gave the}} film {{three out of four}} stars. He {{described}} the film as [...] "a shameless visual pleasure", adding that it is a [...] "perfectly fine piece of oneiric cinema. It puts forth, in fact, a kind of filmic écriture feminine so unabashedly consumed by [...] "the look" [...] and its world of artifices that we'd have to recognise, if we were to be critically fair and put our own hetero-sexist anxieties aside, that W.E. makes a mockery out of 'man's cinema'." [...] Costa complimented Madonna's direction, calling her a [...] "masterful aesthetician". Korzeniowski soundtrack was also commended, with Costa believing that it blended the scenes well. America argued that the film demonstrated Madonna's ambition for artistic gravitas and called it a more mature Blond Ambition Tour. One reviewer stated that [...] "there is a quintessentially Christian, if not Catholic subtext to the film[...] [...] [...] [...] In both instances, the blood of Christ is reflected in the hands and groins of Mary-like figures." [...] Damon Wise from Empire gave the film three out of five stars and commented on the harsh criticism of Madonna stating [...] "A lot <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Madonna and her new film— about how bad and inept it is, as if it's somehow worse than 99 percent of the other movies released on a weekly basis. That's right: up there with Showgirls. Let's give the director a break here." [...] He complimented Riseborough's acting and that [...] "In the short term, this will see W.E. dismissed as a vanity project but, in the long term, history may well find it to be a fascinating comment on 20th-century celebrity from the ultimate insider." ...|$|E
