5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> for a home.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} the liberation {{of the human mind}} from the {{dominion}} of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist who supports a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

25|$|In Latter-day Saint (Mormonism) theology, {{the spirit}} and the body {{constitute}} the human soul. Whereas the human body is subject to death on earth, they believe that the spirit never ceases to exist and that one day the spirits and bodies of all mankind will be reunited again. This doctrine stems from their belief that the resurrection of Jesus Christ grants the universal gift of immortality to <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Rajneesh <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is a Buddha {{with the}} {{capacity}} for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that {{is nothing but a}} barrier of dreams.

25|$|Denouncing {{the concept}} of saviors, spiritual leaders, and any other {{intermediaries}} to reality, Krishnamurti {{stressed the need for}} a revolution in the psyche of <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> He posited that such revolution cannot be brought about by any external entity, be it religious, political, or social. He urged people to directly discover the underlying causes of the problems facing individuals and society, and stated that such discovery is the natural outcome of absolute and unconditional psychological freedom, which he declared as being within everyone's reach.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th- and 18th-century Russian Empire, {{believing in}} God's {{presence}} in <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> these people concluded that clergy and formal rituals were unnecessary.

They {{believed in the}} divinity of Jesus. Their practices and emphasis on individual interpretation as well as opposition {{to the government and}} church, provoked antagonism from the government and the established Russian Orthodox church. In 1734 the government issued an edict against ikonobortsy condemning them as iconoclasts.|$|E

25|$|Followers of the Sikh {{religion}} {{also believe}} that love comes through meditation on the lord's name since meditation only conjures up positive emotions in oneself which are portrayed through our actions.

25|$|In the Islamic conception, <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> has a {{responsibility}} towards oneself. Since human life is sacred and initially created by divine rather than human agency, people are responsible for trying to keep their bodies and souls healthy, and not causing themselves spiritual or physical harm. Consequently, sport has obvious attractions in Islam: traditions record that Muḥammad raced with his wife 'Ā'ishah, and that he encouraged parents to teach their children swimming, riding and archery. Persian miniatures show Muslim women jointly playing polo with men in the same field. In the twenty-first century, some Muslim sociologists even argue {{that it should be}} obligatory for Muslim females to participate in sport of some kind.|$|E

There will be tribulation and distress for <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.

25|$|In drawing {{attention}} {{to a number of}} preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of Guernica, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez. In his chef d'oeuvre, Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, Guernica should be seen as Picasso’s comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the further}} {{explanations}} of Xiong's student Mou Zongsan, Heaven {{is not merely}} sky, and just like the God of the Judaic and Hellenistic-Christian tradition {{is not one of}} the beings in the world. However, unlike the God of these religions, the God of Confucianism is not outside the world either, but is within humans, which is the primary concern of Confucianism, and other beings in the world. Tian is the ontological substance of reality, is immanent in <b>every</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> as the human nature (ren), but the human being on the phenomenal level is not identical with its metaphysical essence. Mencius stated that «the one who can fully realize one's heart/mind can understand one's nature, and the one who can understand one's own nature can know Tian»; Tian is within us, but before we fulfill our heart/mind and know our nature, Heaven still appears transcendent to us. Mou cites Max Muller that «a human being itself is potentially a God, a God one presently ought to become» to reflect th idea of the relationship of God and humanity in Confucianism and other Eastern religions. What is crucial is to transcend the phenomenon to reach Tian.|$|E
