40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the prevalence {{and type of}} Disability in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and associated socio demographic factors. The study design was a cross sectional survey design which covered 22, 732 people, 2939 households and 3194 {{children under the age}} of 15 years. A structured questionnaire was developed for screening of disabilities. For qualitative component, 27 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with various stakeholders and 07 semi-structured Interviews (INTs) with children with disabilities. The prevalence of disability based on screening among children under 15 years was found to be 7. 5 %. Disability was higher among boys than girls, 71 % were screened with single and 29 % with multiple Disabilities. Among the single disabilities, the major types were; epilepsy (21 %), physical impairments (18 %) and visual impairments (15 %). Risk factors for Disability were, increasing age of child, malnutrition, consanguineous marriage among parents, women with more than 04 pregnancies and home as the place of delivery. Knowledge on causes, classification and practices of Children with Disabilities (CWD) was poor and reflective of the experience rather than acquired learning. The knowledge on <b>disabilities</b> <b>prevention,</b> early detection and interventions was limited. CWDs experienced discrimination and negative attitude at all levels of society. CWDs seldom had education beyond the primary school, mainly due to various reasons. School buildings were not adjusted and suitable learning materials were not available. Therapeutic support, counseling, surgical and rehabilitation services were underdeveloped and almost non-existent. Children with disabilities in GB are particularly prone to discrimination and neglect, have reduced access to basic health, education and social services, as well as lack recognition of their equal rights by their families, peers and communities. Much needs to be done to develop supporting policies and increase institutional capacity and inclusiveness forimproving chances to enjoy equal benefits of education and development as their counterparts.

Global costs to address Zika infections among infected infants will exceed hundreds of billions (U. S. dollars). WHO and some U.

Although it doesn't receive any financial assistances from these organisations, it is jointly promoted by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the UNDP.

40|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) is an established treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) with disabling motor complications. However, stimulation {{may be beneficial}} at an earlier stage of PD when motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are only mild and psychosocial competence is still maintained. The EARLYSTIM trial was conducted in patients with recent onset of levodopa-induced motor complications (< 3 years) whose social and occupational functioning remained preserved. This is called 'early' here. The study was a randomized, multicenter, bi-national pivotal trial with a 2 year observation period. Quality of life was the main outcome measure, and a video-based motor score was a blinded secondary outcome of the study. Motor, neuropsychological, psychiatric and psychosocial aspects were captured by established scales and questionnaires. The patient group randomized here is the earliest in the disease course and the youngest recruited in controlled DBS trials so far. The methodological innovation for DBS-studies of this study lies in novel procedures developed and used for monitoring best medical treatment, neurosurgical consistency, best management of stimulation programming, blinded video assessment of motor <b>disability,</b> and <b>prevention</b> of suicidal behaviors...|$|R
