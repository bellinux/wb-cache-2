5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) <b>hearses,</b> as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} fifteen of the sixteen school {{children}} and their two teachers arrived in their home town of Haltern for burial {{two months after the}} crash. Residents held white roses as the <b>hearses</b> passed the children's school, where eighteen trees—one for each victim—had been planted as a memorial. In Düsseldorf on the same day, the remains of forty-four of the seventy-two German victims arrived for burial. Errors on the victims' death certificates had caused a delay. A lawyer representing the families of thirty-four victims said that burying the remains would help many relatives achieve closure.|$|E

5|$|On 22 December {{a public}} {{memorial}} service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading {{for half an hour}} to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the <b>hearses</b> as they passed.|$|E
5|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines, intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and avoid the need for <b>hearses</b> to stop in the public road. The building housed two mortuaries, the LNC's boardroom and funerary workshops, {{and a series of}} separate waiting rooms for those attending first, second and third class funerals. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above. Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel, on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church. On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of Sinn Féin, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the <b>hearses,</b> causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E

500|$|In {{the main}} event, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield faced The Undertaker for the WWE Championship in a Last Ride Match. At the beginning, the Undertaker {{performed}} Old School, a Chokeslam {{and a leg}} drop on the ring apron. JBL hit Undertaker with the steel steps and {{tried to put the}} Undertaker in the <b>hearse</b> but the Undertaker fought back. JBL executed a diving shoulder block but The Undertaker applied a triangle choke hold on JBL, leading JBL to submit to no effect. The Undertaker backdropped out of a piledriver attempt on the steel steps and executed a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel steps, causing JBL to bleed. The Undertaker chokeslammed JBL through a broadcast table. The Undertaker carried JBL to the <b>hearse</b> but Jon Heidenreich came out of the <b>hearse</b> and covered his mouth with a soaked rag filled with chloroform. Heidenreich placed the Undertaker into the <b>hearse</b> and drove off. Inside the <b>hearse,</b> The [...] Undertaker jumped out and attacked Heidenreich. JBL executed a Clothesline from Hell and helped Heidenreich place the Undertaker back into the <b>hearse.</b> Backstage, Paul Heyman drove the <b>hearse</b> to the parking lot, where Heidenreich drove a car into it, causing an inexplicable explosion, meaning JBL retained the title.|$|R

25|$|Desmond Watters – Funeral {{director}} who {{starred in the}} 2004 Northern Irish movie, Mickybo and Me. Having {{one of the only}} original 1970s <b>hearses</b> in the United Kingdom, the movie's production company contacted him for a loan of the hearse. While filming, the director asked Watters for tips on how parts of the scene should be conducted, and later gave him the role of the funeral director in the movie.|$|E
25|$|The first {{volunteer}} rescue squads {{organized around}} 1920 in Roanoke, Virginia, Palmyra, New Jersey, {{and along the}} New Jersey coast. Gradually, especially during and after World War II, hospitals and physicians faded from prehospital practice, yielding in urban areas to centrally coordinated programs. These were often controlled by the municipal hospital or fire department. Sporadically, funeral home <b>hearses,</b> which had been the common mode of transport, were being replaced by fire department, rescue squad and private ambulances.|$|E

On {{one of those}} nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two <b>hearses</b> — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} {{carriages}} for living passengers, the <b>hearse</b> vans {{were designed to}} prevent bodies mixing with those from different backgrounds. Each of the original vans was partitioned into twelve sections in two rows of six, each capable of holding one coffin; later vans were of a slightly different design and probably carried 14 coffins. The vans were fitted with internal partitions to divide first, second and third class coffins. The LNC intended to use half the <b>hearse</b> vans for Anglican and half for Nonconformist coffins, to prevent Anglicans from sharing a carriage with Nonconformists, but in practice this arrangement was little used. Unlike traditional Victorian funerals, in which the <b>hearse</b> invariably led the funeral procession, photographic evidence shows that the LNC sometimes placed the <b>hearse</b> van {{at the rear of}} the train. (Because trains reversed from Necropolis Junction into the cemetery, no matter which arrangement was used the <b>hearse</b> van would inevitably be {{at the rear of the}} train for part of the journey.) ...|$|R

500|$|The LNC ordered six <b>hearse</b> vans in 1854, two {{of which}} were {{operational}} {{at the time the}} cemetery and Necropolis Railway opened. Their origins are not recorded, although they were bought very cheaply suggesting that they were conversions of existing carriages rather than built to order. Many LNC records from this period have been lost and it is not certain how many <b>hearse</b> vans were delivered, and how they were used; records suggest that anything between three and ten <b>hearse</b> vans were bought or leased by the LNC {{in the early years of}} operations. (As each van carried 12–14 coffins and it is known that some funeral trains in the late 19th century carried over 60 coffins, at least six <b>hearse</b> vans must have been in use.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Daimler DS420 Limousine was {{introduced}} in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC's Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a floor pan extended by 21inches behind {{the front seat and}} strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The floor pan with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based <b>hearses.</b> Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss Firefighting Museum (Schweizerisches Feuerwehrmuseum), {{founded in}} 1957 as the Basel Firefighting Museum, is housed on the {{premises}} of the cantonal Fire Brigade but {{does not have the}} status of a public museum and is not administerd by the canton. Its collection, which includes permanent loans from the Historical Museum, features documents that date back to the 13th century. The Hörnli Cemetery Collection (Sammlung Friedhof Hörnli) operates under similar conditions: It has been located on the property of the canton’s Central Cemetery since 1994 but is funded and run by a private association. On display are burial objects such as urns, documents on the history of cremation, <b>hearses,</b> coffins, cemetery regulations, graveyard crosses, glass pearl chains and memorial keepsakes.|$|E
25|$|The only {{significant}} export {{market for the}} Falcon outside of Oceania has been South Africa, but was dropped in the early 2000s. (In the early 1970s, the Falcon XY had been assembled in South Africa as the Fairmont, before being fully imported.) Some limousines and <b>hearses</b> (inc. LPG-only powered Utes) were exported to the UK by Coleman Milne, who used to convert European-made Granadas and Scorpios for the same purposes. Earlier, some XA and XB Fairmonts were shipped to the UK as was the contemporary LTD which was modified with Ford Europe tail lights to add the mandatory rear fog lamps and also had to have new screenwash nozzles as the protruding original items did not meet EU safety rules.|$|E
