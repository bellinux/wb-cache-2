40|$|The {{relationship}} between humanitarian aid and peace prospects, {{and the differences}} between this {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war and <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> war is that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war there is a greater need for a specific case approach because proxy civil wars are much more complicated. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> war <b>a</b> peaceful situation has to been agreed on on the local level and humanitarian aid could contribute to peace prospects, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war humanitarian aid affects peace prospects to a lesser degree because of the multi-layered nature of this type of conflict where on all layers of the proxy civil war peace has to be agreed on. Moreover, aid providers, donors, and other (foreign) involved actors have more influence on <b>a</b> proxy <b>civil</b> war than <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-proxy <b>civil</b> war and therefore humanitarian aid could adversely affect peace prospects...|$|R

5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> war, {{often called the}} Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province.
