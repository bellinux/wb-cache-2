25|$|The geoid, or {{mathematical}} mean sea surface, {{is defined}} {{not only on}} the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an equipotential surface of the true <b>geopotential,</b> chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{accurate}} to approximate the <b>geopotential</b> by a field that has the Earth reference ellipsoid {{as one of its}} equipotential surfaces, however. The most recent Earth reference ellipsoid is GRS80, or Geodetic Reference System 1980, which the Global Positioning system uses as its reference. Its geometric parameters are: semi-major axis a= 6378137.0m, and flattening f= 1/298.257222101.|$|E

The thermal wind equation does not determine {{the wind in}} the tropics. Since [...] is small or zero, such as near the equator, the equation reduces to stating that [...] is small.|$|E
500|$|The {{vertical}} coordinate {{is handled}} in various ways. Lewis Fry Richardson's 1922 model used geometric height (...) as the vertical coordinate. Later models substituted the geometric [...] coordinate with a pressure coordinate system, {{in which the}} <b>geopotential</b> heights of constant-pressure surfaces become dependent variables, greatly simplifying the primitive equations. [...] This correlation between coordinate systems can be made since pressure decreases with height through the Earth's atmosphere. The first model used for operational forecasts, the single-layer barotropic model, used a single pressure coordinate at the 500-millibar (about [...] ) level, and thus was essentially two-dimensional. High-resolution models—also called mesoscale models—such as the Weather Research and Forecasting model tend to use normalized pressure coordinates referred to as sigma coordinates. [...] This coordinate system receives {{its name from the}} independent variable [...] used to scale atmospheric pressures with respect to the pressure at the surface, and in some cases also with the pressure {{at the top of the}} domain.|$|E
500|$|The first {{successful}} numerical prediction was performed using the ENIAC digital computer in 1950 {{by a team}} composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and computer programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. [...] They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the barotropic vorticity equation over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the <b>geopotential</b> height of the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface. [...] This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day. [...] When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an [...] "enormous scientific advance." [...] The first calculations for a 24‑hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24hours to produce, but Charney's group noted that {{most of that time}} was spent in [...] "manual operations", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized.|$|E
500|$|In September 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby {{assembled}} {{an international}} group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) {{based on the}} barotropic equation. Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Weather Bureau. [...] The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer barotropic model, also developed by Charney. [...] It only modeled {{the atmosphere in the}} Northern Hemisphere. [...] In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two-layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates. The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the [...] and [...] <b>geopotential</b> height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them. [...] However, due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model, the JNWPU reverted to the single-layer barotropic model in 1958. [...] The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959. [...] The first real-time forecasts made by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single-layer barotropic model.|$|E

2500|$|A more {{convenient}} unit is the GPU, or <b>geopotential</b> unit: it equals 10 m2·s−2. This means that travelling one metre in the vertical direction, i.e., {{the direction of}} the 9.8 m·s−2 ambient gravity, will approximately change your potential by 1 GPU. Which again means that the difference in <b>geopotential,</b> in GPU, of a point with that of sea level {{can be used as a}} rough measure of height [...] "above sea level" [...] in metres.|$|E
2500|$|Levelling {{instruments}} again {{are used}} to obtain <b>geopotential</b> differences between points on the Earth's surface. These can then be expressed as [...] "height" [...] differences by conversion to metric units.|$|E
2500|$|Once a clean, smooth <b>geopotential</b> field [...] {{has been}} {{constructed}} matching the known GRS80 reference ellipsoid with an equipotential surface (we call such a field a normal potential) we can subtract {{it from the}} true (measured) potential [...] of the real Earth. The result is defined as T, the disturbing potential: ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{assumption}} {{made by the}} {{thermotropic model}} {{is that while the}} magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the [...] and [...] <b>geopotential</b> height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>geopotential</b> field [...] is constructed, {{being the}} sum of a {{gravitational}} potential [...] and the known centrifugal potential , that has the GRS80 reference ellipsoid {{as one of its}} equipotential surfaces. If we also require that the enclosed mass is equal to the known mass of the Earth (including atmosphere) GM = 3986005 [...] 108 m3·s−2, we obtain for the potential at the reference ellipsoid: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{vertical}} coordinate {{is handled}} in various ways. Some models, such as Richardson's 1922 model, use geometric height (...) as the vertical coordinate.

2500|$|Barotropic models {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. [...] In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. [...] It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. [...] In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. [...] Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones). A barotropic model tries to solve a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics {{based on the assumption that}} {{the atmosphere is}} in geostrophic balance; that is, that the Rossby number of the air in the atmosphere is small. If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic vorticity equation. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately [...] is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a <b>geopotential</b> height corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|E
50|$|A plot of <b>geopotential</b> height for {{a single}} {{pressure}} level shows the troughs and ridges, Highs and Lows, which are typically seen on upper air charts. The <b>geopotential</b> thickness between pressure levels — difference of the 850 hPa and 1000 hPa <b>geopotential</b> heights for example — is proportional to mean virtual temperature in that layer. <b>Geopotential</b> height contours {{can be used to}} calculate the geostrophic wind, which is faster where the contours are more closely spaced and tangential to the <b>geopotential</b> height contours.|$|E
5000|$|In {{practical}} terrestrial work, e.g., levelling, {{an alternative}} {{version of the}} <b>geopotential</b> is used called <b>geopotential</b> numbers , which are reckoned from the geoid upward: ...|$|E
5000|$|The normal height [...] of a {{point is}} {{computed}} from <b>geopotential</b> numbers by dividing the point's <b>geopotential</b> number, i.e. its <b>geopotential</b> difference with that of sea level, by the average, normal gravity computed along the plumbline of the point. (More precisely, along the ellipsoidal normal, averaging over the height range from 0 — the ellipsoid — to the procedure is thus recursive.|$|E
50|$|Equation (14) {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the <b>geopotential</b> tendency equation. It relates the local <b>geopotential</b> tendency (term A) to the vorticity advection distribution (term B) and thickness advection (term C).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Geopotential</b> {{height is}} a {{vertical}} coordinate referenced to Earth's {{mean sea level}} — an adjustment to geometric height (elevation above mean sea level) using the variation of gravity with latitude and elevation. Thus it {{can be considered a}} [...] "gravity-adjusted height". One usually speaks of the <b>geopotential</b> height of a certain pressure level, which would correspond to the <b>geopotential</b> height at which that pressure occurs.|$|E
5000|$|At an {{elevation}} of h, the <b>geopotential</b> is defined as:where [...] is the acceleration due to gravity, [...] is latitude, and z is the geometric elevation. Thus <b>geopotential</b> is the gravitational potential energy per unit mass at that elevation h.|$|E
50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{satellite}} orbital mechanics, the <b>geopotential</b> is typically described by a series expansion into spherical harmonics (spectral representation). In this context the <b>geopotential</b> is taken as {{the potential of the}} gravitational field of the Earth, that is, leaving out the centrifugal potential.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{different}} equations for computing density at various height regimes below 86 geometric km (84 852 <b>geopotential</b> meters or 278,385.8 <b>geopotential</b> feet). The first equation is used when the value of standard temperature lapse rate is not equal to zero; the second equation is used when standard temperature lapse rate equals zero.|$|E

50|$|In {{the above}} table, <b>geopotential</b> {{altitude}} is calculated from {{a mathematical model}} that adjusts the altitude to include the variation of gravity with height, while geometric altitude is the standard direct vertical distance above mean sea level. Note that the Lapse Rates cited in the table are given as °C per kilometer of <b>geopotential</b> altitude, not geometric altitude.|$|E
5000|$|For {{geophysical}} applications, {{gravity is}} distinguished from gravitation. Gravity {{is defined as}} the resultant of gravitation and the centrifugal force caused by the Earth's rotation. The global mean sea surface is close to one of the equipotential surfaces of the <b>geopotential</b> of gravity [...] This equipotential surface, or surface of constant <b>geopotential,</b> is called the geoid.|$|E

50|$|Geophysical {{scientists}} {{often use}} <b>geopotential</b> height {{as a function}} of pressure rather than pressure {{as a function of}} geometric height, because doing so in many cases makes analytical calculations more convenient.

Using the former eliminates air density from the equations.|$|E
