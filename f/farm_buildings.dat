5|$|When Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk was {{executed}} for treason in 1554 his property {{was taken over}} by the monarch. In 1671 Thomas Preston, 3rd Baronet Preston bought Aldingham manor which included Gleaston Castle. The property descended through the Prestons to the Cavendish family. The castle is now part of an active farm which dates from the 19th century. The <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> incorporate some of the fabric of the castle. The Prestons owned the castle until 1922 when it was sold to the current family of owners. According to a 1905 document from the Cumbria Archive Centre up to four human skeletons were discovered at the castle in the 19th century when the <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> were built.|$|E

The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> connected to the castle.|$|E

5|$|The Briarcliff Farms office, Walter Law's {{personal}} office, {{was also}} the first dairy building; it burned down in 1901, and was rebuilt the following year. From Briarcliff Manor's 1902 incorporation to the construction of its first municipal building in 1913, the office housed the village government. During the 1960s the building was redesigned, rebuilt and became a local union headquarters for the International Union of Operating Engineers. The farm was enclosed, and its pastures were divided by stone walls from within the farm; the stones were also used for roadbeds, and for walls of the <b>farm</b> <b>buildings,</b> office, and Law's house.|$|E
5|$|The Home <b>Farm</b> <b>buildings</b> {{were built}} in the 1880s, split over two levels. To the south is a two-storey covered yard with a timber roof structure, used for the rearing of farm animals. On the upper level is the main yard, where to the east and west are two wings, one side of which housed the former piggery. The farm offices make up the north wing, to fully enclose the square but gently south-sloping yard.|$|E

5|$|The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1908. Potter composed the book at Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District she bought in 1905. Following the purchase, her works began to focus on country and village life, incorporating large casts of animal characters and sinister villains. Jemima Puddle-Duck was the first of her books set wholly at the farm with background illustrations based on the <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> and yard, and nearby locales.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> {{associated}} with the mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind the house is a flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E
5|$|Early church {{buildings}} may originally {{have been}} wooden, like that excavated at Whithorn, but of those for which evidence survives from this era are basic masonry-built churches, beginning {{on the west}} coast and islands and spreading south and east. Early chapels tended to have square ended converging walls, similar to Irish chapels of this period. Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. In the Highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or <b>farm</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|E

5|$|Guest {{joined up}} again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901. He {{was given the}} rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success. He was {{recommended}} for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, whose Colonel decided that Guest {{was too young to}} lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older than him. Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served {{until the end of the}} war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to round up Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> and crops, and detaining women and children in concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|In 1536 Cleeve {{was closed}} by Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the abbey was {{converted}} into a country house. Subsequently, the status of the site declined and the abbey was used as <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> until the latter half of the nineteenth century when steps were taken to conserve the remains. In the twentieth century Cleeve was taken into state care; the abbey is now looked after by English Heritage and is open to the public. Today Cleeve Abbey is one of the best-preserved medieval Cistercian monastic sites in Britain. While the church is no longer standing, the conventual buildings are still roofed and habitable and contain many features of particular interest including the 'angel' roof in the refectory and the wall paintings in the painted chamber.|$|E
5|$|Stoke sub Hamdon Priory is {{a complex}} of {{buildings}} and ruins which initially formed a 14th-century college for the chantry chapel of St Nicholas, and later {{was the site of}} a farm in Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset, England. The only building remaining from the college is a great hall and attached dwelling, dating from the late 15th century. The hall is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building, while the outbuildings and gateway are Grade II listed. The whole site has been scheduled as an ancient monument. A number of the <b>farm</b> <b>buildings</b> are in poor condition, and {{have been added to the}} Heritage at Risk register.|$|E
