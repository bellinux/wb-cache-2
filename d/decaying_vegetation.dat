5|$|Adult mecopterans {{are mostly}} scavengers, feeding on <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{and the soft}} bodies of dead invertebrates. Panorpa raid spider webs to feed on trapped insects and even the spiders themselves, and hangingflies capture flies and moths with their {{specially}} modified legs. Some groups consume pollen, nectar, midge larvae, carrion and moss fragments. Most mecopterans live in moist environments; in hotter climates, the adults may therefore be active and visible only for short periods of the year.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{wholesale}} destruction of plants at the K–Pg boundary, {{there was a}} proliferation of saprotrophic organisms, such as fungi, {{that do not require}} photosynthesis and use nutrients from <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The dominance of fungal species lasted only a few years while the atmosphere cleared and plenty of organic matter to feed on was present. Once the atmosphere cleared, photosynthetic organisms, such as ferns and other plants, returned.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation,</b> or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Peat is an {{accumulation}} of partially <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation,</b> whose decomposition is slowed by water. Despite its dark brown color, it is infertile, but is useful as a fuel.|$|R

5000|$|Caridina cantonensis, the bee shrimp, is {{a species}} of small {{freshwater}} shrimp in the family Atyidae. It is native to China. [...] These shrimp are filter feeders, and also eat small pieces of <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation</b> and algae. Bee shrimp have a life span of about 18 months.|$|R
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{mangrove}} trees {{exist in the}} region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation</b> is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges.|$|E
25|$|Adult diopsids are {{typically}} found on low-lying vegetation in humid areas, often near streams and rivers, where they feed on fungi and bacteria, which they scavenge from <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation.</b> The larvae are saprophagic or phytophagous, eating decaying and fresh plant matter. Diopsis macrophthalma Dalman, 1817, is a pest {{of rice and}} sorghum in tropical Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the current terrain of the city, dating from the late Pliocene in the Tertiary period, {{is linked to the}} clogging of the Pannonian Sea. Layers of soil were created from deposits of sand, loess and gravel, and generally have a thickness of –. Over this base, <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation</b> gave rise to podsolic soils, which led to favorable conditions for crops (cereals, vegetables, fruit trees).|$|E

The ground was black and wherever turned up gave forth a sickly odor of <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|R
25|$|Syncaris pacifica is a ten-legged {{crustacean}} {{that employs}} a two-pronged approach to camouflage: {{it uses a}} technique of translucency coupled with strategically placed chromatophores, which occur internally {{as well as on}} the surface. As a result, the clustered color-producing cells combined with translucency masks the body outline and blends the organism to its subsurface environment. Consequently, an illusion is presented that S. pacifica are submerged, <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation.</b> California freshwater shrimp move quite torpidly and are practically invisible among water column leaf and twig substrates, and among the slender, exposed, living roots of riparian vegetation along undercut stream banks.|$|E
25|$|Catfishes of {{the genus}} Akysis are small cryptically-coloured species. Akysis are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats. Most species {{typically}} inhabit clear swift-flowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates. Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers. In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris, in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis, or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones. Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation.</b>|$|E
25|$|V. acadica {{normally}} builds its nests in <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation</b> such as logs or leaf piles but, although uncommon, aerial nests {{have been}} reported. The entrance tunnels are normally 15 to 25cm, {{but can be}} as long as 40cm. The deepest subterranean nest found was 15cm under the surface. A nest is composed of one worker-producing comb and one to three reproductive-producing combs. The largest mature colony found had an adult population of 425 workers, 70 males, and 78 queens and had four combs {{with a total of}} 1,791 cells. Many nests play host to the parasitoid Ichneumonid Sphecophaga cocoons, probably S. vesparum burra and a few nests were found to host eggs of Fannia spp. on the exterior.|$|E
5000|$|Changing post-glacial {{sea levels}} will have much altered {{the shape of}} this low-lying island since the last ice age. William Traill {{described}} a gale in 1838 which removed 20 ha of sand in Otterswick Bay. This revealed a dark layer of <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation</b> under fallen trees up to 60 cm in diameter. The trees lay [...] "as if felled by a storm" [...] and were visible under the sea for 6.5 km. A search for these tree remains in the 20th century was unsuccessful.|$|R
30|$|Basically, the subsoil of {{the project}} area {{is made up of}} the so called flood plain sands, which are {{represented}} by sandy clay, peat with clay intercalation, clay and clayey sand. On relatively higher grounds, materials exposed have been leached into lateritic red earth with moderate strength. On the other hands, the low lying areas and old water courses give rise to predominantly stagnant water in which accumulation of <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation</b> would have taken place in geological past resulting in peat and soft organic clay formation at surface and to some depth.|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{accumulation}} of sediment‐associated organic matter in river beds has detrimental impacts on aquatic ecology, including fish. Sediment and source {{samples were collected}} from 3 headwater tributaries of the River Itchen, in southern England. Near infrared spectra and bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were employed as fingerprint properties to quantify the relative contributions from catchment‐based (farmyard manures/slurries, damaged road verges, and septic tanks) and channel‐based (<b>decaying</b> instream <b>vegetation,</b> watercress farms, and fish farms) sources. The findings suggested that over {{the duration of the}} sampling period, the final estimated median relative contributions in the Candover Stream subcatchment were in the order: farmyard measures/slurries 74 % > <b>decaying</b> instream <b>vegetation</b> 15 % > watercress farms 6 % > septic tanks 3 % > damaged road verges 2 %. For the River Arle subcatchment, corresponding estimated median relative contributions were in the order: watercress farms 40 % > farmyard manures/slurries 28 % > <b>decaying</b> instream <b>vegetation</b> 21 % > fish farms 7 % > damaged road verges and septic tanks 2 % each. Similar contributions were estimated for the Tichborne Stream subcatchment: watercress farms 36 % > farmyard manures/slurries 26 % > <b>decaying</b> instream <b>vegetation</b> 26 % and damaged road verges and septic tanks at 6 % each.

25|$|The native {{habitat of}} Aspergillus is in soil, <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation,</b> hay, and grains {{undergoing}} microbiological deterioration, but it invades {{all types of}} organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture content (at least 7%) and high temperature. Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chillies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices intended for human or animal consumption. Aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs, milk products, and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains.|$|E
25|$|Aflatoxins are {{poisonous}} carcinogens {{that are}} produced by certain molds (Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) which grow in soil, <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation,</b> hay, and grains. They are regularly found in improperly stored staple commodities such as cassava, chili peppers, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sesame seeds, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, {{and a variety of}} spices. When contaminated food is processed, aflatoxins enter the general food supply where they have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into eggs, milk products, and meat. For example, contaminated poultry feed is suspected in the findings of high percentages of samples of aflatoxin contaminated chicken meat and eggs in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Zygomycosis is the {{broadest}} term {{to refer to}} infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota {{has been identified as}} polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation.</b> While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection. These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.|$|E

500|$|Incubation, which optimises {{temperature}} for chick development, usually begins {{after the last}} egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as [...] of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation</b> or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).|$|E
500|$|As {{part of a}} study {{measuring}} the impact {{that the practice of}} clearfelling has on biodiversity in the Weld Valley of Tasmania, it was found that A.latipennis {{was one of the few}} species that thrived in regrowth forests that were previously clearfelled. [...] An earlier study, conducted in other regions of southern Tasmania, examined the relationship between the moth and Eucalyptus regnans and E.obliqua and reached the same conclusion. [...] The tunnelling and feeding habit of A.latipennis larvae on the roots of these two eucalypt species is mostly responsible for its abundance in clearfelled forests, as the trees are the typical regrowth of logged areas. [...] This success may also be due in part to the caterpillar's lack of dependence on <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation,</b> a characteristic of the Abantiades genus and dissimilar to other Tasmanian genera—such as Eudonia and Barea—that have not fared as well in clearfelled forest.|$|E
500|$|Severe weather, in {{the form}} of {{tropical}} storms and hurricanes, also affects the structure of the Everglades. Between 1871 and 2003, 40tropical cyclones struck the Everglades, usually every one to three years. These storms alter the coastline, flush <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation</b> from estuaries, strip weakened branches from trees, and disperse seeds, pollen, and plant material. Hurricane Donna in 1960 affected [...] of mangrove forests by depositing marl over the roots and depriving the trees of oxygen. It also eradicated orchids, bromeliads, and other epiphytes that once flourished in the mangroves; their reappearance may take a century or more. Donna also significantly spread buttonwood, saltwort, and glasswort, and epiphytes began to grow in new areas. Although the lasting effects remain to be seen, Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also destroyed mangrove forests and snapped slash pines in half. However, regrowth occurred quickly, and sand deposited by the storm surge improved nesting conditions for crocodiles and sea turtles.|$|E
5000|$|Little {{is known}} of the larval habits, but they are {{probably}} phytophagous or saprophagous in <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation,</b> old manure, or fungi [...] Larvae of certain Mimegralla species {{have been found to}} live in the roots of ginger and other plants, under the bark of dead trees, or in other decaying material. Species of Micropeza have phytophagous larvae feeding in the root nodules of leguminous plants in open habitats. Species of Rainieria develop in rotting wood and are found in old forests. Adults are either predatory on small insects (for example Calobata in Britain) or are attracted to excrement or decaying fruit. Adults are found on low herbage, flowers, leaves, rotting fruit, and excrement.|$|R

The great central upheaval seems to have pushed its way through these older strata, once straight, now inclined. The layers of the more modern formation--lavas and scoriae--are horizontal; sheets of sub-columnar, compact basalt have been spread upon and have crushed down to paper-thickness their beds of bright red tufa, here and there white with a saline effervescence.

2500|$|Peat (...) , {{also called}} turf (...) , is an {{accumulation}} of partially <b>decayed</b> <b>vegetation</b> or organic matter that is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs.

500|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} is solitary, except during {{breeding}} season, {{when they are}} most active and males engage in combat and males and females mate. Gravid females tend to be sedentary, but males will actively search out and court females during the long rainy season, which is between the months of April and June. Males have been observed engaging in agonistic behaviour and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities, or possibly to establish a dominance hierarchy. Typically, a male initiates a fight by moving {{on top of the}} other’s body and tongue-flicking, after which the two snakes “intertwine their necks and bodies, and push against each other” in an attempt to pin each other's head repeatedly to the ground. Male-male combat can last for several hours, but combat between males of this species don't ever include biting {{and the nature of the}} combat is never as aggressive and/or vicious as commonly seen among the eastern green mamba's much larger cousin, the black mamba. Males locate females by following a scent trail. The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female’s while rapidly tongue-flicking. Depending on whether the female is receptive to mating, she will lift her tail and cloacal juxtaposition will follow shortly. Courtship and mating take place in the trees, after which the female lays anywhere between 4-17 eggs (average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid), which occurs in the summer months of October and November. The eggs are white and elongated, usually measuring 65x35 millimetres. The eggs are usually laid in a hollow tree, among <b>decaying</b> <b>vegetation,</b> or leaf litter. The incubation period is 10 to 12 weeks. When the young emerge from the eggs, they are approximately [...] or around an average of [...] in length, and they're highly venomous right at birth.

To this succeeded a barren flat of silt and sand, white with salt and ragged with salsolaceous stubble, reeking with heat, and covered with old vegetation. Here, says local tradition, was the ancient site of Zayla [1], built by Arabs from Yemen. The legend runs that when Saad el Din was besieged and slain by David, King of Ethiopia, the wells dried up and the island sank. Something doubtless occurred which rendered a removal advisable: the sons of the Moslem hero fled to Ahmed bin El Ashraf, Prince of Senaa, offering their allegiance if he would build fortifications for them and aid them against the Christians of Abyssinia. The consequence was a walled circuit upon the present site of Zayla: of its old locality almost may be said [...] "periere ruinae." ...|$|R
