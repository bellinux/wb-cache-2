5|$|In 1995, Binky's cagemate Nuka {{suddenly}} became sick with the parasitic disease sarcocystosis, dying from associated liver failure on July 14, {{a week after}} <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> began. Shortly thereafter, Binky showed signs of the disease. On the morning of July 20, he went into convulsions and died. Zoo visitors left bouquets of flowers outside the bears' empty enclosure, and the zoo's memorial service saw a high turnout despite pouring rain. The bears were buried on zoo grounds.|$|E
25|$|Mary Edison {{died at age}} 29 on August 9, 1884, {{of unknown}} causes: {{possibly}} from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> could have been from morphine poisoning.|$|E

25|$|Perkins-Gilman married Charles Stetson in 1884, {{and less}} than a year later gave birth to their {{daughter}} Katharine.

25|$|Several {{women were}} invited to the suite. During the carousing, a 26-year-old {{aspiring}} actress named Virginia Rappe was found seriously ill in room 1219 and was examined by the hotel doctor, who concluded <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> were mostly caused by intoxication, and gave her morphine to calm her.

25|$|Two years later, Ida {{returned}} to see Freud {{and explained that}} <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> had mostly cleared up; that she had confronted the Ks. who confessed {{that she had been}} right all along; but that she had recently developed pains in her face.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{model as}} to how these rearrangements occur is through the simultaneous fragmentation of distinct chromosomal regions (breakpoints show a non-random distribution) and then subsequent imperfect reassembly by DNA repair pathways or aberrant DNA replication mechanisms. Chromothripsis occurs early in tumour development and leads to cellular transformation by loss of tumour suppressors and oncogene amplifications. In 2015, {{it was found that}} chromothripsis can also be curative: a woman who had WHIM (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis) syndrome, an extremely rare autosomal dominant combined immunodeficiency disease, found <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> disappeared during her 30s after chromothripsis of chromosome 2 deleted the disease allele.|$|E

25|$|By 1968, the Hills {{had begun}} to have {{significant}} conflicts in their marriage. After beginning an extramarital affair with a woman named Ann Kurth {{in the fall of}} 1968, Hill left his wife and began divorce proceedings against her, but withdrew the petition when the couple reconciled shortly before Christmas of that year. John continued to see Kurth after returning to live with his wife. Robinson Hill died on March 19, 1969, at Sharpstown General Hospital after contracting an illness that was initially thought to be influenza. <b>Her</b> <b>symptoms</b> included fever, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. She was first treated at home by her husband, but admitted to hospital when her condition worsened.|$|E
25|$|Boulstred {{eventually}} {{started a}} relationship with Sir Thomas Roe, Sir John Roe’s cousin. This relationship most likely would have led to marriage were it not that Boulstred became very sick in 1609. In 1609, {{in the span of}} a couple of months, Boulstred both fell ill and died. What likely now would have been diagnosed as a brain tumor or gastric cancer was identified by doctors of the College of Medicine at the time as “the mother,” a.k.a. wandering womb – an imprecise medical diagnosis employed…to cover ailments that were thought to attend upon feminine frailty.” <b>Her</b> <b>symptoms</b> included stomach pain, sleeplessness, fever, and vomiting. A cure could not be found, and she wasted away at the countess of Bedford’s house in Twickenham, unable to hold down food or liquids.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} was markedly unhappy, {{in part because}} of Vivienne's health issues. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of <b>her</b> <b>symptoms,</b> which included a habitually high temperature, fatigue, insomnia, migraines, and colitis. This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a lunatic asylum, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play Tom & Viv, which in 1994 was adapted as a film.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} 73 -year-old female with {{advanced}} thyroid papillary carcinoma who complained of gross hematuria. We found a bladder tumor and considered it {{the cause of}} <b>her</b> <b>symptom.</b> Cystoscopic findings of the tumor were unusual, with peri-tumor vessel formation. Pathological examination of the bladder tumor was consistent with metastasis of thyroid papillary carcinoma. Therefore, we identified thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the urinary bladder {{as the cause of}} hematuria in our patient. Thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the bladder is extremely rare, but it should be included among differential diagnoses for gross hematuria in patients with a clinical history of thyroid carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Lidocaine unmasks silent {{symptoms}} and eases neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis patients; however, {{the effects of}} lidocaine in neuromyelitis optica have never been reported.

500|$|In May 1846, {{the family}} (Poe, Virginia, and her mother, Maria) {{moved to a}} small cottage in Fordham, about {{fourteen}} miles outside the city, a home which is still standing today. In what is the only surviving letter from Poe to Virginia, dated June 12, 1846, he urged her to remain optimistic: [...] "Keep up your heart in all hopelessness, and trust yet a little longer." [...] Of his recent loss of the Broadway Journal, the only magazine Poe ever owned, he said, [...] "I should have lost my courage but for youmy darling little wife you are my greatest and only stimulus now to battle with this uncongenial, unsatisfactory and ungrateful life." [...] But by November of that year, Virginia's condition was hopeless. <b>Her</b> <b>symptoms</b> included irregular appetite, flushed cheeks, unstable pulse, night sweats, high fever, sudden chills, shortness of breath, chest pains, coughing and spitting up blood.|$|E
500|$|On 17 August 1696, 11-year-old Christian Shaw, the {{daughter}} of a local landowner, John Shaw of Bargarran, saw one of her family's servants, Catherine Campbell, steal a drink of milk. Shaw reported the theft to her mother, whereupon Campbell cursed her, wishing that the Devil would [...] "haul her soul through Hell". Four days later Shaw encountered Agnes Naismith, an old woman reputed to be a witch. The following day, 22 August, Shaw became violently ill with fits, similar to the symptoms reported a few years earlier in the American Salem witch trials of 1693. After eight weeks Shaw's parents took her to see the eminent Glasgow physician Matthew Brisbane, who could find no cause for <b>her</b> <b>symptoms.</b> For eight days after her visit Shaw seemed to have recovered, but then [...] "the fits returned with increased violence. She would become as stiff as a corpse and be senseless and motionless".|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{aimed to}} send a message of early detection to the series' young audience, and had Steph initially ignore <b>her</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Stenson hoped to raise awareness of cervical cancer, and educate women about the importance of regular smear tests. She stated that Steph was confident about beating her illness, as [...] "the alternative sn't worth thinking about." [...] The character was originally reluctant to tell her family about the cancer for fear of hurting them, and was embarrassed to tell her love interest Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), not wanting him to have to look after her. As the storyline developed, Steph cancelled her wedding to Gilly due to his refusal to accept that her condition was terminal. Quinlan explained that his character impeded her ability to deal with the situation, with his disbelief contrasting Steph's attempt to [...] "take this in her stride and [...] spend quality time with the people she loves before she goes." ...|$|E

500|$|Anne's final {{pregnancy}} {{ended on}} 25 January 1700, when she miscarried a stillborn son. She had been pregnant at least seventeen times over as many years, and had miscarried or {{given birth to}} stillborn children at least twelve times. Of her five liveborn children, four died before reaching the age of two. Anne suffered from bouts of [...] "gout", pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head, from at least 1698. Based on her foetal losses and physical symptoms, she may have had disseminated lupus erythematosus, or Hughes syndrome. Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy. Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and rhesus incompatibility. Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit with the pattern of Anne's pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born {{after a series of}} stillbirths. Experts also rule out syphilis, porphyria and pelvic deformation as incompatible with her medical history.|$|E
500|$|Woodburne was {{initially}} against Susan developing the condition, {{but when she}} started researching it, she realised {{how much of a}} challenge the storyline would be and she changed her mind. The actress and the shows writers worked closely with the MS Society to make the storyline as realistic as possible and it was praised by both the society and viewers who have the condition. Jenna Litchfield of the MS Society said soap opera storylines in which characters are diagnosed with MS helped to highlight the condition and its effects. She added that the storyline had [...] "sparked interest." [...] Of the storyine, Woodburne stated [...] "It's a massive story and to take a character that has always been so strong and to challenge them physically and emotionally was terrific. I know that the writing department did an enormous amount of research." [...] Woodburne also explained that as Susan is such a strong person mentally, she goes through an emotional struggle when her body lets her down. Woodburne commented that she found the scenes distressing to play as she is so attached to her character. She told a writer for Inside Soap that it was a difficult storyline, but [...] "ultimately rewarding". On screen, Susan learnt how to keep <b>her</b> <b>symptoms</b> under control and Woodburne said she would occasionally have a relapse, as the condition does not go away. In 2011, Woodburne commented on the MS storyline, which she enjoyed, saying it was very challenging to tell a good story and make it authentic and real for people who have the condition.|$|E
