Mice administered high doses of clonidine (20 - 50 mg/kg i. p.) exhibited aggressive behavior in dose dependent manner. <b>Dilazep</b> (5 - 20 mg/kg i. p.) dose-dependently inhibited the aggressive behavior induced by clonidine (50 mg/kg i. p.). <b>Dilazep</b> (2 mg/kg i. p.), adenosine (10 mg/kg i. p.), dipyridamole (10 mg/kg i. p.) or N^ 6 -cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA; 0. 02 mg/kg i. p.) alone did not inhibit clonidine (50 mg/kg) -induced aggressive behavior, but when <b>Dilazep</b> was combined with adenosine, dipyridamole or CHA, a potent adenosine agonist, the behavior was markedly inhibited. The aggressive behavior induced by clonidine (50 ng/kg) was strongly reduced by CHA (0. 1 mg/kg i. p.), whereas that induced by a lower dose of clonidine (20 mg/kg i. p.) was stimulatedby 8 -phenyltheophyline (0. 1 mg/kg), a selective adenosine A- 1 receptor antagonist and by caffeine (10 mg/kg), an adenosine A- 1 and A- 2 receptor antagonist.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if <b>dilazep</b> is able to reduce with a direct protective action on the myocardium the deleterious effects caused by ischaemia and reperfusion. For this purpose we used an isolated rabbit heart preparation. The hearts were either perfused aerobically or made totally ischaemic for 60 min (by abolishing coronary flow) or made ischaemic for 60 min and then reperfused for 30 min. Ischaemic and reperfusion damage was measured in terms of alteration in mechanical function, lactate and CPK release, mitochondrial function and tissue content of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), Creatine Phosphate (CP) and calcium. <b>Dilazep</b> (10 (- 5) M) was administered in the perfusate either 20 minutes before ischaemia or only during post-ischaemic reperfusion. Ischaemia induced a decline of the endogenous stores of ATP and CP, followed by an alteration of calcium homeostasis with increase of diastolic pressure, mitochondria calcium overload and impairment of the oxidative phosphorylating capacities. On reperfusion, tissue and mitochondrial calcium increase the capacity of the mitochondria to use O 2 for state III respiration was further impaired and the ATP-generating capacity reduced. Diastolic pressure increased and there was only a small recovery of active tension generation associated with massive CPK release. Administration of <b>dilazep</b> before ischaemia induced a negative inotropic effect which, in turn, resulted in a slowing of the rate of CP and ATP depletion during ischaemia. This protected the hearts against the ischemic, and reperfusion-induced decline in the ATP-generating and O 2 -utilizing capacities of the mitochondria. In addition, there was a less marked increase in tissue and mitochondrial Ca++, CPK and lactate release were reduced and the recovery of developed pressure on reperfusion was significantly increased. Administration of <b>dilazep</b> during reperfusion failed to modify the exacerbation of ischaemic damage caused by the readmission of coronary flow. These data suggest that <b>dilazep</b> benefits the ischaemic myocardium via an ATP sparing action...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a yeast-based assay for selection of hENT 1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) mutants that have altered affinity for hENT 1 inhibitors and substrates. In this assay, expression of hENT 1 in a yeast strain deficient in adenine biosynthesis (ade 2) permits yeast growth {{on a plate}} lacking adenine but containing adenosine, a hENT 1 substrate. This growth was prevented when inhibitors of hENT 1 [e. g. NBMPR [S 6 -(4 -nitrobenzyl) -mercaptopurine riboside], <b>dilazep</b> or dipyridamole] {{were included in the}} media. To identify hENT 1 mutants resistant to inhibition by these compounds, hENT 1 was randomly mutagenized and introduced into this strain. Mutation(s) that allowed growth of yeast cells in the presence of these inhibitors were then identified and characterized. Mutants harbouring amino acid changes at Leu 92 exhibited resistance to NBMPR and <b>dilazep</b> but not dipyridamole. The IC 50 values of NBMPR and <b>dilazep</b> for [3 H]adenosine transport by one of these mutants L 92 Q (Leu 92 [...] >Gln) were approx. 200 - and 4 -fold greater when compared with the value for the wild-type hENT 1, whereas that for dipyridamole remained unchanged. Additionally, when compared with the wild-type transporter, [3 H]adenosine transport by L 92 Q transporter was significantly resistant to inhibition by inosine and guanosine but not by adenosine or pyrimidines. The Km value for inosine transport was approx. 4 -fold greater for the L 92 Q mutant (260 +/- 16 mM) when compared with the wild-type transporter (65 +/- 7. 8 mM).

40|$|Nucleoside {{transport}} {{in various}} types of animal cells is inhibited by the binding of nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) {{to a set of}} high-affinity sites on the plasma membrane. This work examined the binding of [3 H]NBMPR to the nucleoside transporters of cultured Nil 8 hamster fibroblasts and of cells of a virus-transformed clone (Nil SV) derived from Nil 8. Experiments conducted with intact Nil 8 and Nil SV cells and with membrane preparations indicated that the two lines differed significantly in the cellular content of binding sites and only slightly in the affinities of these sites for NBMPR. Nil 8 and Nil SV cells possessed (4. 2 - 8. 0) X 10 (5) and (2. 0 - 4. 0) X 10 (6) sites per cell respectively, whereas the dissociation constants of site-bound NBMPR obtained with intact cells and with membrane preparations were similar, ranging from 0. 29 to 1. 5 nM. <b>Dilazep,</b> a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport that is structurally unrelated to NBMPR, appeared to compete with NBMPR for binding to the high-affinity sites when tested under equilibrium conditions with Ki values for inhibition of NBMPR binding to Nil 8 and Nil SV cells respectively of 15 +/- 4 and 32 +/- 4 nM. The dissociation of NBMPR from the binding site [...] NBMPR complex of Nil SV membrane preparations was a first-order decay process with a rate constant of 0. 68 +/- 0. 26 min- 1. The rate of dissociation of NBMPR from the binding-site complex of membrane preparations and intact cells was decreased significantly in the presence of <b>dilazep</b> and increased {{in the presence of the}} permeant uridine. These results suggest that the apparent competitive-inhibition kinetics obtained for <b>dilazep</b> under equilibrium conditions should not be interpreted as binding of <b>dilazep</b> to the same site as NBMPR but rather as binding of the two inhibitors to closely associated sites on the nucleoside transporter. Similarly, uridine also appears to bind to a site separate from the NBMPR-binding site...|$|E

40|$|The {{dose-response}} curves for the {{inhibition of}} equilibrative uridine transport by <b>dilazep,</b> dipyridamole and nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) in undifferentiated HL- 60 cells were biphasic. Some 70 % of the transport activity was inhibited with IC 50 values of 0. 7, 1 and 7 nM respectively. No inhibition {{of the remaining}} 30 % of transport activity was observed until the <b>dilazep,</b> dipyridamole and NBMPR concentrations exceeded 1, 0. 1 and 3 microM respectively. Exposure to phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) for 48 h, to induce monocytic differentiation, caused a 20 -fold decrease in Vmax. of both NBMPR-sensitive and NBMPR-insensitive equilibrative uridine transport. The decrease in NBMPR-sensitive uridine transport induced by PMA corresponded to a decrease in NBMPR binding sites. A 30 % decrease in specific NBMPR binding sites occurred within 6 h of PMA exposure, and could be prevented by uridine and thymidine at concentrations as low as 100 microM, and by staurosporine at 40 nM. However, the protective effects of these compounds diminished with prolonged PMA exposure. No protection was observed with uracil. Exogenous protein kinase C (PKC) {{in the presence of}} ATP and PMA decreased the number of specific NBMPR-binding sites in purified HL- 60 cell plasma membranes.

We tested whether transfection of human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT 3) using ultrasound and lipid stabilized microbubbles could increase gemcitabine uptake and sensitivity in HEK 293 cells made nucleoside transport deficient by pharmacologic treatment with <b>dilazep.</b> To our knowledge, no published data exists regarding the utility of using hCNT 3 as a therapeutic gene to reverse gemcitabine resistance. Our ultrasound transfection system- capable of transfection of cell cultures, mouse muscle and xenograft CEM/araC tumors- increased hCNT 3 mRNA and 3 H-gemcitabine uptake by. 2, 000 – and 3, 400 –fold, respectively, in dilazep-treated HEK 293 cells. Interestingly, HEK 293 cells with both functional human equilibrative nucleoside transporters and hCNT 3 displayed 5 % of 3 H-gemcitabine uptake observed in cells with only functional hCNT 3, suggesting that equilibrative nucleoside transporters caused significant efflux of 3 H-gemcitabine. Efflux assays confirmed that <b>dilazep</b> could inhibit the majority of 3 H-gemcitabine efflux from HEK 293 cells, suggesting that hENTs were responsible for the majority of efflux from the tested cells.

40|$|The {{transport}} of [U- 14 C]uridine {{was investigated in}} rat cerebral-cortical synaptosomes using an inhibitor-stop filtration method. Under these conditions the rapid efflux of uridine from the synaptosomes is prevented and uridine is not significantly metabolized in the synaptosome during the first 1 min of uptake. The dose-response curve for the inhibition of uridine transport by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) was biphasic: approx. 40 % of the transport activity was inhibited with an IC 50 (concentration causing half-maximal inhibition) value of 0. 5 nM, but the remaining activity was insensitive to concentrations as high as 1 microM. Similar biphasic dose-response curves were observed for <b>dilazep</b> inhibition, but both transport components were equally sensitive to dipyridamole inhibition. Uridine influx by both components was saturable (Km 300 +/- 51 and 214 +/- 23 microM, and Vmax. 12 +/- 3 and 16 +/- 3 pmol/s per mg of protein, for NBMPR-sensitive and NBMPR-insensitive components respectively), and inhibited by other nucleosides such as 2 -chloroadenosine, adenosine, inosine, thymidine and guanosine with similar IC 50 values for the two components. Inhibition of uridine transport by NBMPR was associated with high-affinity binding of NBMPR to the synaptosome membrane (Kd 58 +/- 15 pM).

No Na+-dependent uridine {{transport system}} was detected. The NBMPR-insensitive transport system is similarly insensitive to inhibition by <b>dilazep</b> and dipyridamole. Dose-response curve for the inhibition of equilibrative uridine transport by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl reagent, in these cells was biphasic. About 30 – 40 % of the uridine transport was inhibited by NEM at IC 50 value of 0. 15 mM. The other 60 – 70 % of the transport activity remained insensitive to NEM at concentration {{as high as}} 3 mM. The decrease in NBMPR-sensitive uridine transport {{in the presence of}} 0. 3 mM NEM was due to a 3 -fold decrease in transport affinity. Apparent Km values of 500 and 1600 μM and Vmax values of 13 and 12 μM/s were obtained for untreated and NEM-treated cells, respectively. NEM (0. 3 mM) has little effect on the Km of NBMPR-insensitive transporter, with apparent Km values of 100 and 110 μM and Vmax values of 3. 0 and 2. 5 μM/s for untreated and NEM-treated cells, respectively. High sensitivity of NBMPR-sensitive transporter to NEM inhibition was also observed in HL- 60 and MCF- 7 cells. Decrease in specific 3 H-NBMPR equilibrium binding affinity in myeloma cells was observed after treatment with 0. 3 mM NEM. Apparent Kd values of 0. 32 and 2. 3 nM with Bmax values of 48 000 and 44 000 sites/cell were obtained for untreated and NEM-treated cells, respectively. NBMPR, <b>dilazep</b> and dipyridamole at 30 μM, and uridine at 10 mM failed to protect the NBMPR-sensitive transporter against NEM inhibition. It is possible that a critical sulfhydryl residue is closed to substrate binding/transporting site of the NBMPR-sensitive transporter. NEM, a sulfhydryl reagent containing an activated double bond, hinders the affinity of this transporter by forming a stable thiol ether bond with the reactive residue...|$|E

40|$|Mammalian cells express {{at least}} two subtypes of equilibrative {{nucleoside}} transporters, i. e. ENT 1 and ENT 2, which can be distinguished functionally by their sensitivity and resistance respectively to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine. The ENT 1 transporters exhibit distinctive species differences in their sensitivities to inhibition by dipyridamole, <b>dilazep</b> and draflazine (human>mouse>rat). A comparison of the ENT 1 structures in the three species would facilitate {{the identification of the}} regions involved in the actions of these cardioprotective agents. We now report the molecular cloning and functional expression of the murine (m) ENT 1 and mENT 2 transporters. mENT 1 and mENT 2 encode proteins containing 458 and 456 residues respectively, with a predicted 11 -transmembrane-domain topology. mENT 1 has 88 % and 78 % amino acid identity with rat ENT 1 and human ENT 1 respectively; mENT 2 is more highly conserved, with 94 % and 88 % identity with rat ENT 2 and human ENT 2 respectively. We have also isolated two additional distinct cDNAs that encode proteins similar to mENT 1; these probably represent distinct mENT 1 isoforms or alternative splicing products. One cDNA encodes a protein with two additional amino acids (designated mENT 1 b) that adds a potential protein kinase CK 2 phosphorylation site in the central intracellular loop of the transporter, and is similar, in this regard, to the human and rat ENT 1 orthologues. The other cDNA has a 5 '-untranslated region sequence that is distinct from that of full-length mENT 1. Microinjection of mENT 1, mENT 1 b or mENT 2 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes resulted in enhanced uptake of [(3) H]uridine by the oocytes relative to that seen in water-injected controls. mENT 1 -mediated, but not mENT 2 -mediated, [(3) H]uridine uptake was inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine and <b>dilazep.</b> Dipyridamole inhibited both mENT 1 and mENT 2, but was significantly more effective against mENT 1.

40|$|Effect of {{anti-anginal drugs}} on the {{distribution}} of blood flow in the left ventricular free wall has been studied using thirty anesthetized open-chest dogs. The regional myocardial blood flows in the inner-(subendocardial) and outer-(sub-epicardial) layer were continuously monitored by heated cross-thermocouples designed according to Grayson's heat exchange principle. The techniques used were essentially the same as that described by Uchida (1970). The antianginal drug (nitroglycerin, 20 μg/Kg; prenylamine, 1 mg/Kg; dipyridamole, 0. 3 mg/Kg; or <b>dilazep,</b> 0. 2 mg/Kg) was administered intravenously. The results were as follows: (1) No difference in the regional myocardial blood flow between the inner- and outer-layer was observed. The flow ratio of the inner- to the outer-layer (I/O ratio) was 0. 97 ± 0. 17. (2) Nitroglycerin produced a slight decrease in the flow through the inner-layer in spite of a remarkable drop in coronary perfusion pressure, while it did a marked decrease through the outer-layer. As the result, I/O ratio was significantly elevated after the injection. (3) Prenylamine produced a moderate increase in the flow through the both layers in spite of a remarkable fall in the coronary perfusion pressure. The ratio was rather elevated after a significant initial decline. (4) Dipyridamole caused a marked increase in the flow through the both layers, whereas I/O ratio was only minimaly lowered. (5) A change similar to that caused by dipyridamole was observed except a slight elevation of the ratio from 20 to 30 minutes when <b>dilazep</b> was injected. As mentioned above, these anti-anginal drugs produced different effects on the flow in the both layers. One of the explanation of these differences observed might be that these drugs have different effects on sites of coronary vessels, large intramural conductive vessels or small resistive vessels. Another explanation could be that these drugs cause different effects on the systemic hemodynamics. For the studies on effect of anti-anginal {{drugs on the}} intramyocardial distribution of blood flow, it is necessary that the regional myocardial blood flow must be monitored continuously since the intramyocardial distribution of the blood flow can be changed from time to time after the administration...|$|E

The role of N-linked glycosylation in the interaction of NBMPR with hENT 1 was examined by the quantification of binding of [3 H]NBMPR to yeast producing either wild-type hENT 1 or a glycosylation-defective mutant (hENT 1 /N 48 Q) in which Asn- 48 was converted into Gln. The Kd for binding of NBMPR to hENT 1 /N 48 Q was 10. 5 +/- 1. 6 nM, indicating that the replacement of an Asn residue with Gln decreased the affinity of hENT 1 for NBMPR. The decreased affinity of hENT 1 /N 48 Q for NBMPR was due to an increased rate of dissociation (koff) and a decreased rate of association (kon) of specifically bound [3 H]NBMPR because the values for hENT 1 -producing and hENT 1 /N 48 Q-producing yeast were respectively 0. 14 +/- 0. 02 and 0. 36 +/- 0. 05 min- 1 for koff, and (1. 2 +/- 0. 1) x 10 (8) and (0. 40 +/- 0. 04) x 10 (8) M- 1. min- 1 for kon.

Specific association of NBMPR with BeWo cells at 22 degrees C required 1. 5 h {{to reach an}} equilibrium between free and bound ligand, whereas association with HeLa cells required 20 - 30 min. Scatchard analysis of NBMPR binding to low-density cultures of BeWo cells revealed a total of 27 x 10 (6) sites per cell, consisting of two distinct populations that differed in their affinities for NBMPR. One population bound NBMPR with 'high' affinity (Bmax. 1 15. 0 pmol/ 10 (6) cells; Kd 1 0. 6 nM) and the other, larger, population bound NBMPR with 'low' affinity (Bmax. 2 29. 0 pmol/ 10 (6) cells; Kd 2 14. 5 nM). By contrast, HeLa cells possessed only 4. 1 x 10 (5) sites per cell, and these sites all bound NBMPR with the same affinity (Bmax. 0. 7 pmol/ 10 (6) cells; Kd 0. 5 nM). Interaction of NBMPR with both populations of sites in BeWo cells could be blocked by nitrobenzylthioguanosine (NBTGR), <b>dilazep</b> or dipyridamole. Concentration-effect relationships for <b>dilazep</b> inhibition of binding of 1 nM- and 25 nM-NBMPR to BeWo cells were monophasic, with virtually complete inhibition achieved at 0. 1 microM and 1 microM respectively. Plasma-membrane preparations from BeWo cells also had high numbers of NBMPR-binding sites, and u. v. irradiation of site-bound [3 H]NBMPR in such preparations labelled polypeptides that migrated in electrophoretograms as a broad band with a peak M(r) of 60, 000. The concentration-effect relationship for NBMPR inhibition of thymidine transport by BeWo cells was biphasic, with an IC 50 for inhibition of the 'NBMPR-sensitive' component of 1. 6 nM and a substantial (15 - 20 %) component of flux that was not inhibited by 10 microM-NBMPR and was thus 'NBMPR-insensitive'. Vmax. values for thymidine transport by BeWo cells were 20 - 30 -fold larger than the corresponding values for transport by HeLa cells. Elimination of the Na+ gradient {{had no effect on}} initial rates of thymidine fluxes measured in either the presence or the absence of NBMPR. Our results demonstrate that BeWo cells have an unusually large capacity for NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport, apparently resulting from high levels of expression of 'erythrocyte-like' transport elements, identified by their high-affinity interaction with NBMPR. The relationship of the low-affinity binding sites to NBMPR-sensitive transporter elements is uncertain...|$|E
40|$|NoThe genome of Caenorhabditis elegans encodes {{multiple}} homologues of the {{two major}} families of mammalian equilibrative and concentrative nucleoside transporters. As part of a programme aimed at understanding the biological rationale underlying the multiplicity of eukaryote nucleoside transporters, we have now demonstrated that the nematode genes ZK 809. 4 (ent- 1) and K 09 A 9. 3 (ent- 2) encode equilibrative transporters, which we designate CeENT 1 and CeENT 2 respectively. These transporters resemble their human counterparts hENT 1 and hENT 2 in exhibiting similar broad permeant specificities for nucleosides, while differing in their permeant selectivities for nucleobases. They are insensitive to the classic inhibitors of mammalian nucleoside transport, nitrobenzylthioinosine, <b>dilazep</b> and draflazine, but are inhibited by the vasoactive drug dipyridamole. Use of green fluorescent protein reporter constructs indicated that the transporters are present in a limited number of locations in the adult, including intestine and pharynx. Their potential roles in these tissues were explored by using RNA interference to disrupt gene expression. Although disruption of ent- 1 or ent- 2 expression alone had no effect, simultaneous disruption of both genes yielded pronounced developmental defects involving the intestine and vulva...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Concentrative {{nucleoside}} transporters (CNT; SLC 28) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT; SLC 29) {{mediate the}} uptake of natural nucleosides {{and a variety}} of nucleoside-derived drugs, mostly used in anticancer therapy. SLC 28 and SLC 29 families consist in three and four members, respectively, which differ in their substrate selectivity and their energy requirements. Tissue distribution of these transporters is not homogeneous among tissues, and their expression can be regulated. In epithelia, CNT and ENT proteins are mostly localized in the apical and basolateral membranes, respectively, which results in nucleoside and nucleoside-derived drugs vectorial flux. Nucleoside transporters can play physiological roles other than salvages, such as the modulation of extracellular and intracellular adenosine concentrations. Moreover, these transporters also have clinical significance. ENT proteins are target of dipyridamole and <b>dilazep,</b> used as vasodilatory drugs in the treatment of heart and vascular diseases. On the other hand, nucleoside transporters are responsible for the cellular uptake of currently used anticancer nucleoside-derived drugs, thus these membrane proteins might {{play a significant role in}} nucleoside-based chemotherapy. Finally, several polymorphisms have been described in CNT and ENT proteins that could affect nucleoside homeostasis, adenosine signalling events or nucleoside-derived drug cytotoxicity or pharmacokinetics...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} of the anti-varicella-zoster virus agent 6 -methoxypurine arabinoside and its 2 '-O-valerate prodrug, 170 U 88, was investigated {{by using the}} human erythrocyte model. The influx of 6 -methoxypurine arabinoside was found to occur primarily {{by means of the}} nucleoside transporter. (i) Influx was nonconcen-trative and saturable (Km = 106 ± 2 I,M). (ii) The inhibitors of nucleoside transport, nitrobenzylthioinosine, dipyridamole, and <b>dilazep,</b> inhibited the influx of 10,iM 6 -methoxypurine arabinoside by> 94 %. (iii) Influx was inhibited by nucleosides but not by nucleobases. (iv) 6 -Methoxypurine arabinoside was a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 129 ± 10,uM) of adenosine influx, and adenosine (Km = 160 ± 9,uM) was found to be a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 134 ± 9,uM) of 6 -methoxypurine arabinoside influx. By contrast, the influx of 170 U 88 occurred by means of nonfacilitated diffusion. (i) Influx was linearly dependent on the 170 U 88 concentration. (ii) Influx was not inhibited by nucleobases, nucleosides, or inhibitors of nucleoside transport. The {{transport of}} arabinosides into human cells has re-ceived relatively little attention. Cytosine arabinoside trans-port into human T lymphoblasts, normal lymphocytes, and neutrophils proceeds primarily by means of the nitroben-zylthioinosine (NBMPR) -sensitive nucleoside transport sys...|$|E
40|$|Plasmodium, the {{aetiologic}} {{agent of}} malaria, cannot synthesize purines de novo, and hence depends upon salvage from the host. Here {{we describe the}} molecular cloning and functional expression in Xenopus oocytes of the first purine transporter to be identified in this parasite. This 422 -residue protein, which we designate PfENT 1, is predicted to contain 11 membrane-spanning segments and is a distantly related member of the widely distributed eukaryotic protein family the equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs). However, it differs profoundly at the sequence and functional levels from its homologous counterparts in the human host. The parasite protein exhibits a broad substrate specificity for natural nucleosides, but transports the purine nucleoside adenosine with a considerably higher apparent affinity (K(m) 0. 32 +/- 0. 05 mM) than the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine (K(m) 3. 5 +/- 1. 1 mM). It also efficiently transports nucleobases such as adenine (K(m) 0. 32 +/- 0. 10 mM) and hypoxanthine (K(m) 0. 41 +/- 0. 1 mM), and anti-viral 3 '-deoxynucleoside analogues. Moreover, it is not sensitive to classical inhibitors of mammalian ENTs, including NBMPR [6 -[(4 -nitrobenzyl) thio]- 9 -beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine, or nitrobenzylthioinosine] and the coronary vasoactive drugs, dipyridamole, <b>dilazep</b> and draflazine. These unique properties suggest that PfENT 1 might be a viable target {{for the development of}} novel anti-malarial drugs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dilazep,</b> a {{vasodilator}} previously {{recognized as}} an inhibitor of adenosine permeation, very rapidly blocked the uptake of adenosine by cultured L 5178 Y cells, and accordingly {{was used as a}} quencher in a simple quenched-flow system for measuring cellular uptake of nucleosides during very short intervals. Time courses of cellular uptake of adenosine, assayed during intervals between 0. 05 and 0. 5 s with the quenched-flow system, were linear and defined initial rates of adenosine uptake. The latter are rates of inward transport of adenosine. Kinetic constants for that process in cultured S 49 cells determined with the quenched-flow procedure were similar to those determined with an assay dependent on manual timing. In studies of adenosine uptake kinetics in human erythrocytes at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C in which the quenched-flow procedure was used, time courses of adenosine uptake were linear at both temperatures and defined initial uptake rates; kinetic constants (means +/- S. E. M.) at 22 degrees C (n = 8) were Km 25 +/- 14 microM and Vmax. 15 +/- 5 pmol/s per microliter of cell water and at 37 degrees C (n = 3) were Km 98 +/- 17 microM and Vmax. 80 +/- 9 pmol/s per microliter of cell water...|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} transporters for nucleobases {{have been}} characterized in LLC-PK 1 cells. The first system accumulates hypoxanthine against a concentration gradient {{in the presence}} of sodium. The sodium-dependent uptake of hypoxanthine was saturable at 22 -degrees-C with a K(m) value of 0. 79 +/- 0. 43 muM, a V(max) of 15 +/- 4 pmol/mg protein/ 60 s, and a Na+:hypoxanthine coupling stoichiometry of 1. 27 +/- 0. 20. Uptake of hypoxanthine was inhibited by 5 -fluorouracil, uracil, thymine, and guanine (K(i) values 3 - 6 muM). Adenine and nucleosides were without effect. Using cell monolayers grown on a permeable filter support, Na+-dependent hypoxanthine uptake occurred preferentially from the apical surface. The second system exhibited no cation specificity and was saturable with a low affinity for hypoxanthine (K(m) of 124 +/- 22 muM) and a high V(max) of 275 +/- 38 pmol/mg protein/ 60 s. Adenine and guanine inhibited Na+-independent hypoxanthine uptake (K(i) values 30 +/- 15 and 18 +/- 7 muM, respectively). Other nucleobases and nucleosides exhibited little or no inhibition of equilibrative hypoxanthine influx. Dipyridamole, <b>dilazep,</b> and phloridzin were effective inhibitors of Na+-dependent hypoxanthine uptake but had little effect on the Na+-independent flux. This study represents the first direct demonstration of a unique high affinity Na+ nucleobase co-transporter system in cultured animal cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether coronary vascular resistance remains constant during long diastoles and whether critical closure of arterial microvessels occurs at zero-flow pressure. For this purpose, we directly measured internal diameters and red blood cell velocities in arterial and venous coronary microvessels during long diastoles under maximal vasodilation. The epicardial coronary microcirculation was viewed in anesthetized, open-chest mongrel dogs through an intravital microscope equipped with a newly developed floating objective. Coronary microvascular diameters and red blood cell velocities were measured with high-speed cinematography. During maximal vasodilation (150,ug/kg body wt i. v. <b>dilazep),</b> long diastoles were induced by vagal nerve stimulation. Internal diameters of all small arteries and arterioles (n= 12) gradually declined with decreasing aortic pressure during long diastoles, and the reduction of the diameter was greatest when aortic pressure was less than 35 mm Hg. The mean internal diameter (88. 8 ± 52. 2 jtm) at minimal aortic pressure (19. 2 + 6. 4 mm Hg) was significantly less than that at an aortic pressure of 100 mm Hg (116. 2 +± 68. 5,um, p< 0. 01). The internal diameters of small veins and venules remained nearly constant during long diastoles. When red blood cell progression in coronary microvessels stopped at the nadir of aortic pressure...|$|E
40|$|We quantitated phasic epimyocardial microcirculatory {{coronary}} {{blood flow}} velocity {{patterns in the}} beating left ventricle. Using a newly developed floating objective and high-speed cinematography, red cell velocities in small arterioles, capillaries, and small venules and microvascular diameters in the superficial layer of the epimyocardium of beating left ventricle were determined throughout the entire cardiac cycle in open-chest anesthetized dogs. Heart rate was maintained at 140 beats/min by means of left atrial pacing. Peak red cell velocity was observed in midsystole in small arterioles and capillaries, and in late systole in small venules. Abrupt decline in red cell velocity and, in many cases, a momentary cessation or reverse of flow, was observed in these microvessels during the pre-ejection period. The internal diameter of small venule was increased in late systole, while that of small arteriole remained almost constant during the cardiac cycle. Furthermore, in these epimyocardial microves-sels, {{a higher percentage of}} the total area under the velocity curve occurred during the ejection phase; 51 % in small arterioles, 43 % in capillaries, and 40 % in small venules. These findings indicate that the phasic blood flow pattern is markedly different in the subepimyocardial microvessels from that in the large epicardial artery and the septal artery. During vasodilation following <b>dilazep</b> (50 fig/kg, i. v.), an adenosine potentiator, red cell velocity increased throughout the entire cardiac cycle in epimyocardia...|$|E
40|$|We {{identified}} four {{genes for}} potential equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) from rice (Oryza sativa; designated OsENT 1 through OsENT 4). Growth analysis of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells expressing OsENTs showed that OsENT 2 transported adenosine and uridine with high affinity (adenosine, Km = 3. 0 μm; uridine, Km = 0. 7 μm). Purine or pyrimidine nucleosides and 2 ′-deoxynucleosides strongly inhibited adenosine transport via OsENT 2, suggesting that OsENT 2 possesses broad substrate specificity. OsENT 2 -mediated adenosine transport was {{resistant to the}} typical inhibitors of mammalian ENTs, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, <b>dilazep,</b> and dipyridamole. The transport activity was maximal at pH 5. 0 and decreased slightly at lower as well as higher pH. In competition experiments with various cytokinins, adenosine transport by OsENT 2 was inhibited by isopentenyladenine riboside (iPR). Direct measurements with radiolabeled cytokinins demonstrated that OsENT 2 mediated uptake of iPR (Km = 32 μm) and trans-zeatin riboside (Km = 660 μm), suggesting that OsENT 2 participates in iPR transport in planta. In mature plants, OsENT 2 was predominantly expressed in roots. The OsENT 2 promoter drove {{the expression of the}} β-glucuronidase reporter gene in the scutellum during germination and in vascular tissues in germinated plants, suggesting a participation of OsENT 2 in the retrieval of endosperm-derived nucleosides by the germinating embryo and in the long-distance transport of nucleosides in growing plants, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian equilibrative {{nucleoside}} transporters {{are typically}} {{divided into two}} classes, es and ei, based on their sensitivity or resistance respectively to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). Previously, we have reported the isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a prototypic es-type transporter, hENT 1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1), from human placenta. We now report the molecular cloning and functional expression in Xenopus oocytes of a cDNA from the same tissue encoding a homologous ei-type transporter, which we designate hENT 2. This 456 -residue protein is 46 % identical in amino acid sequence with hENT 1 and corresponds to a full-length form of the delayed-early proliferative response gene product HNP 36, a protein of unknown function previously cloned in a form bearing a sequence deletion. In addition to placenta, hENT 2 is found in brain, heart and ovarian tissue. Like hENT 1, hENT 2 mediates saturable transport of the pyrimidine nucleoside uridine (Km 0. 2 +/- 0. 03 mM) and also transports the purine nucleoside adenosine. However, in contrast with hENT 1, which is potently inhibited by NBMPR (Ki 2 nM), hENT 2 is NBMPR-insensitive (IC 50 < 1 microM). It is also much less sensitive to inhibition by the coronary vasoactive drugs dipyridamole and <b>dilazep</b> and to the lidoflazine analogue draflazine, properties that closely resemble those reported for classical ei-type transport in studies with intact cells...|$|E
40|$|Immunoglobulin A {{nephropathy}} (IgAN) is {{the most}} common form of chronic glomerulonephritis worldwide. In Japan, the treatment for use as an initial therapy was established in Guidelines for the Treatment of Childhood IgA nephropathy; however, no rescue therapy for recurrent or steroid-resistant pediatric IgAN was established. We report here a 15 -year-old boy with severe IgAN, who was treated with combination therapy involving prednisolone, mizoribine, warfarin, and <b>dilazep</b> dihydrochloride for 2 years. The response to the combination therapy was good and both proteinuria and hematuria disappeared. The pathological findings at the second renal biopsy were improved and PSL was discontinued. However, due to nonadherence to the treatment regimen and tonsillitis, macrohematuria and an increase of proteinuria were again observed and the pathological findings at the third renal biopsy showed clear deterioration. The patient was, therefore, diagnosed with recurrent IgAN. Tonsillectomy plus methylprednisolone pulse therapy (TMP) was performed as a rescue therapy for the recurrence of severe IgAN. Both the proteinuria or hematuria subsequently disappeared, and no proteinuria or hematuria has been observed and kidney function has remained normal during a 5 -year follow-up. The patient experienced no severe side effects associated with the drug regimens. In conclusion, our case suggests that TMP may be an effective and useful rescue therapy for recurrent IgAN after multi-drug combination therapy...|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that monkey kidney (COS- 1) cells have a single type of nucleoside transport process, which, because it was equilibrative, sodium-independent and could be inhibited by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), was identified as the 'equilibrative sensitive' or 'es' transporter. Using NBMPR or <b>dilazep</b> to inhibit the endogenous nucleoside transport activity, we have transiently expressed a cDNA that encodes an inhibitor-insensitive, concentrative nucleoside transporter protein (cNT 1 rat) of rat intestine in COS- 1 cells. The production of recombinant cNT 1 rat was examined by immunoblotting using an epitope-tagged construct and by analysis of inward fluxes of 3 H-labelled nucleosides. Recombinant cNT 1 rat was sodium-dependent and selective for pyrimidine nucleosides, with approximately Km values of 21 microM, 12. 5 microM and 15 microM for uridine, thymidine and adenosine, respectively. Although adenosine exhibited high affinity for the recombinant transporter, its Vmax value was low. A variety of anti-viral and anti-cancer nucleoside drugs inhibited cNT 1 rat-mediated uptake of uridine by transfected COS- 1 cells although to different extents (Floxidine > Idoxuridine > Zidovudine > Zalcitabine > Cytarabine > Gemcitabine), suggesting that the concentrative pyrimidine-selective nucleoside transporters, of which cNT 1 rat is a representative, {{may play a role}} in cellular uptake of these drugs. The cNT 1 rat/COS- 1 expression system is a useful tool for analysis of cNT 1 rat-mediated transport processes...|$|E

Initial rates of hypoxanthine influx were independent of extracellular cations: replacement of Na+ with Li+, Rb+, N-methyl-D-glucamine or choline had no significant effect on hypoxanthine uptake by ECV 304 cells. Kinetic analysis demonstrated {{the presence of a}} single saturable system for the transport of hypoxanthine in ECV 304 cells with an apparent K(m) of 320 +/- 10 microM and a Vmax of 5. 6 +/- 0. 9 pmol/ 10 (6) cells per s. Hypoxanthine uptake was inhibited by the nucleosides adenosine, uridine and thymidine (apparent Ki 41 +/- 6, 240 +/- 27 and 59 +/- 8 microM respectively) and the nucleoside transport inhibitors nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), <b>dilazep</b> and dipyridamole (apparent Ki 2. 5 +/- 0. 3, 11 +/- 3 and 0. 16 +/- 0. 006 microM respectively), whereas the nucleobases adenine, guanine and thymine had little effect (50 % inhibition at > 1 mM). ECV 304 cells were also shown to transport adenosine via both the NBMPR-sensitive and -insensitive nucleoside carriers. Hypoxanthine specifically inhibited adenosine transport via the NBMPR-insensitive system in a competitive manner (apparent Ki 290 +/- 14 microM). These results indicate that hypoxanthine entry into ECV 304 endothelial cells is mediated by the NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside carrier present in these cells...|$|E
