50|$|The EF 35-105mm lens is {{a family}} of <b>EF</b> mount wide-to-normal <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> {{manufactured}} and sold by Canon. There were three versions made. The first version was released in 1987 as an f/3.5 - f/4.5 aperture lens. The next was released in 1991 as a f/4.5 - f/5.6 aperture lens. The last version was released in 1992 as a f/4.5 - f/5.6 USM version.|$|R
50|$|The EF 24-85mm f/3.5-4.5 is an <b>EF</b> mount wide-to-normal <b>zoom</b> <b>lens.</b> It was {{introduced}} by Canon in 1996. The lens was originally sold with the Canon EOS IX, an APS film SLR, although it was fully compatible with Canon's 35mm film SLRs. The lens was available in two colour schemes; silver when sold with the EOS IX, and black when sold separately. The lens remained in production during Canon's shift to digital SLRs and was often included in press images of the Canon EOS D30. As of June 2010 {{it is no longer}} listed on Canon's North American product page.|$|R
50|$|Wide angle L-lenses {{typically}} have a {{gelatin filter holder}} on the mounting point of the lens, which allows the photographer to cut a small, square piece of gelatin out of a larger filter sheet {{and place it on}} the lens. On film cameras, these are typically used to correct the color temperature, but on digital cameras this is largely unnecessary, as the color temperature can be corrected in software. The mount is still commonly used for neutral density gelatin sheets though, especially on certain wide-angle lenses where the protruding front element precludes the use of any screw-in filters. Some telephoto L-lenses, such as the <b>EF</b> 70-200mm <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses,</b> or the <b>EF</b> 300mm f/4L IS USM do not have rear gelatin filter holders. Super-telephoto lenses such as the EF 500mm f/4L IS USM, or the EF 200mm f/2L IS USM do have a rear 52mm drop-in filter holder which can be used to hold gelatin type filters.|$|R
50|$|The Canon EF 24-70mm lens is {{a family}} of {{professional}} <b>EF</b> mount wide-to-normal <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> manufactured and sold by Canon. The first of the family, the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L, was introduced in 2002 to replace the well-regarded 28-70mm f/2.8L. Two later versions were announced in 2012. The first of these, the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II, was announced by Canon in February, but would not ship to customers until September of that year. This lens replaced the Mk I, and had an MSRP of US$2299 when introduced. The latest {{member of the family}} is the EF 24-70mm f/4L IS USM, which became available in January 2014. The f/4 version, which is the first of the family to include image stabilization, was initially reported to be the standard kit lens for the Canon EOS 6D, but did not appear in 6D kits in most markets until late 2014, and 5D Mark IV kit in 2016.|$|R

Early <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> {{often had}} very inferior optical quality compared to prime lenses, but improvements in computer assisted <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> {{design and construction}} allowed annual Japanese 35 mm SLR <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> production to surpass prime lenses in 1982 and zooms became normal on virtually all but the highest end still cameras by the late 1980s. Ponder & Best's designed in the USA/made in Japan Vivitar Series 1 lenses were among the best available (many were the first of their kind) for about a dozen years, before new owners debased the brand.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> - {{variable}} {{focal length}} <b>lenses.</b> <b>Zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> cover {{a range of}} focal lengths by utilising movable elements within {{the barrel of the}} lens assembly. In early varifocal lens lenses the focus also shifted as the lens focal length was changed. Varifocal lenses are also used in many modern autofocus cameras as the lenses are cheaper and simpler to construct and the autofocus can take care of the re-focussing requirements. Many modern <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> are now confocal, meaning that the focus is maintained throughout the zoom range. Because of the need to operate over a range of focal lengths and maintain confocality, <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> typically have very many lens elements. More significantly, the front elements of the lens will always be a compromise in terms of its size, light-gathering capability and the angle of incidence of the incoming rays of light. For all these reasons, the optical performance of <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> tends to be lower than fixed-focal-length lenses.|$|R
50|$|In 1977, <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> had {{advanced}} far {{enough that the}} Fuji Fujinon-Z 43-75mm f/3.5-4.5 (Japan) became the first <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> to be sold as the primary lens for an interchangeable lens camera, the Fujica AZ-1 (1977, Japan) 35mm SLR, instead of a prime.|$|R
50|$|The {{fixed lens}} on this camera is {{much faster than}} other Olympus point-and-shoots many of which include <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses.</b> The <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> {{versions}} have much slower lenses(f/4.5 at the wide end), and in general, lower quality optics, compared to the fixed 35mm lens.|$|R
40|$|Compared {{with prime}} <b>lenses,</b> <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> have {{inherent}} advantages {{in terms of}} operational flexibility. <b>Zoom</b> <b>lens</b> camera systems have therefore been extensively adopted in computer vision where precise measurement is not the primary objective. However, the variation of intrinsic camera parameters with respect to <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> settings poses a series of calibration challenges that have inhibited widespread use in close-range photogrammetry. A flexible <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> calibration methodology is therefore proposed in this study, developed {{with the aim of}} simplifying the calibration process and promoting practical photogrammetric application. A zoom-dependent camera model that incorporates empirical zoom-related intrinsic parameters into the collinearity condition equations is developed. Coefficients of intrinsic parameters are solved in a single adjustment based on this <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> camera model. To validate the approach, experiments on both optical- and digital-zoom lens cameras were conducted using a planar board with evenly distributed circular targets. <b>Zoom</b> <b>lens</b> calibration was performed with images taken at four different zoom settings spread throughout the zoom range of a lens. Photogrammetric accuracies achieved through both mono-focal and multi-focal triangulations were evaluated after calibration. The relative accuracies for mono-focal triangulations ranged from 1 : 6300 to 1 : 18, 400 for the two cameras studied, whereas the multi-focal triangulation accuracies ranged from 1 : 11, 300 to 1 : 16, 200. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the approach, calibrated <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> imagery was used to render a laser-scanned point cloud of a building façade. Considered alongside experimental results, the successful application demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed calibration method, thereby facilitating the adoption of <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> cameras in close range photogrammetry {{for a wide range of}} scientific and practical applications...|$|R
