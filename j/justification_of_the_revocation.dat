40|$|In ownership-based {{access control}} {{frameworks}} with <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> delegating permissions and administrative rights, chains of delegated accesses will form. There are {{different ways to}} treat these delegation chains when revoking rights, which give rise to different revocation schemes. Hagström et al. [8] proposed a framework for classifying revocation schemes, in which <b>the</b> different <b>revocation</b> schemes are defined graph-theoretically; they motivate <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> schemes in this framework by presenting various scenarios in which the agents have different reasons for revocating. This paper {{is based on the}} observation that there are some problems with Hagström et al. 's definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> schemes, which have led us to propose a refined framework with new graph-theoretic definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> schemes. In order to formally study the merits and demerits of various definitions of revocation schemes, we propose to apply the axiomatic method originating in social choice theory to revocation schemes. For formulating an axiom, i. e. a desirable property of revocation frameworks, we propose a logic, Trust Delegation Logic TDL), with which one can formalize the different reasons an agent may have for performing a revocation. We show that our refined graph-theoretic definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> schemes, unlike Hagström et al.

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> paper {{presents}} <b>revocation</b> schemes in role-based {{access control}} models. We are particularly interested in two key issues: how to perform <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> and how to manage <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> policy. We show {{how to deal with}} these two aspects in our delegation model based on the OrBAC formalism and its administration licence concept. This model provides means to manage several types of of delegations, such as the delegation or <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> permissions and roles, multi-step delegation and temporary delegation. We state formally in this paper how to manage <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>of</b> these delegations schemes. Our model supports a wide spectrum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>revocation</b> dimensions such as propagation, dominance, dependency, automatic/user revocation, transfer revocation, role/permission revocation. ...|$|R
