5|$|Another {{key feature}} of N. rajah is the {{relative}} <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it {{is able to}} hybridise in the wild. Hybrids between it and all other Nepenthes species on Mount Kinabalu have been recorded. However, due to the slow-growing nature of N. rajah, few hybrids involving the species have been artificially produced yet.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, No. 7 Wing SAAF {{shot down}} another 16 Italian SM.82s. The <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> they caught fire led the Allied pilots {{to believe they}} were carrying precious fuel cargoes.

5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled, the taxonomy having proved complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, due to {{the diversity of the}} wild species, the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> natural hybridization occurs, and extensive cultivation and breeding accompanied by escape and naturalisation. Consequently, the number of accepted species has varied widely.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{phylogeny}} of Narcissus {{still remains}} relatively unsettled. The taxonomy has proved very complex {{and difficult to}} resolve, particularly for the Pseudonarcissus group.

60|$|At {{this moment}} Mr. Glastonbury was announced. He had a general invitation, and was {{frequently}} {{in the habit of}} paying an evening visit when the family were disengaged. When he found Ferdinand, Henrietta, and Katherine, all assembled together, and in so strange a garb, his perplexity was wondrous. The tone of comparative <b>ease,</b> too, <b>with</b> <b>which</b> Miss Temple addressed him, completed his confusion. He began to suspect that some critical explanation had taken place. He looked around for information.|$|R

60|$|The <b>ease,</b> however, <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the Northmen {{moved from}} {{point to point}} in their ships gave them such immense {{advantage}} that their defeats at Hasle and Saucourt in no way checked their depredations. Appearing suddenly off the coast, or penetrating into the interior by a river, their hordes would land, ravage the country, slay all who opposed them, and carry off {{the women and children}} captives, and would then take to their ships again before the leaders of the Franks could assemble an army.|$|R
5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the battery could be identified by the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|The locust {{is large}} and easy to breed and rear, and is used as an {{experimental}} model in research studies. It {{has been used in}} evolutionary biology research and to discover to what degree conclusions reached about other organisms, such as the fruit fly (Drosophila) and the housefly (Musca), are applicable to all insects. It is a suitable school laboratory animal because of its robustness and the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it can be grown and handled.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled {{for over a year}} without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could easily be done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E
50|$|Ceratopteris is also {{important}} {{in the study of}} pteridophytes because it is a commonly used model organism for use in genomic studies, due to the <b>ease</b> and rapidity <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it can be grown in laboratories, as well as well characterized phenotypes. Patented strains of this plant have been developed.|$|R

5|$|Despite its aims, the Committee was {{in large}} part {{responsible}} for the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the Germans could implement their policies in Belgium {{and was unable to}} moderate many German policies, such as deportation of workers to Germany (though delayed to October 1942) or the persecution of Jews. In particular, encouraging the Germans to delegate tasks to the Committee meant that the Germans were effectively using the established national civil service, which allowed much more efficient implementation than could have been achieved by force. Since Belgium was also dependent on Germany for the imports of food it needed, the Committee was always at a disadvantage during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. Other studies have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: integrity and authenticity. Integrity is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E

5|$|P. moranensis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{commonly}} cultivated Pinguicula, in part due to its large size, large and pretty flowers, and the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> it can be grown as a container plant. Most growers use an open soil mix composed of some combination of washed sand, perlite, vermiculite, peat moss, gypsum and/or decomposed granite. Soil should be kept well drained, but watered regularly with distilled water in the summer and only very rarely once the plant enters its winter rosette. The species grows readily on well-lit windowsills, under fluorescent lights, or in warm to hot greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{financial}} oversight and the apparent <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet and Chief of the General Staff Jakob Annasohn chose the Mirage (at the time, the world's fastest jet fighter) led, {{for the first}} time in Swiss history, to the formation of a parliamentary fact-finding commission. As a result, parliamentary oversight on military procurements was improved and the military was given the organizational and professional structures to avoid such budget overruns. One Air Force officer had to retire, and Annasohn himself retired voluntarily in the end of 1964, followed by Chaudet who stepped down in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> large numbers may be housed and studied. However, {{the lack of an}} adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> they can be manipulated, bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> {{they may be}} grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of}} the hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions {{of the structure of the}} hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the strong}} {{resistance}} {{exhibited by the}} Chinese, the Canadians expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives {{as part of the}} second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 Chinese were also killed. Indeed, the <b>ease</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.|$|E
5000|$|Handling {{qualities are}} those {{characteristics}} of a flight vehicle that govern the <b>ease</b> and precision <b>with</b> <b>which</b> a pilot is able to perform a flying task. [...] The way in which particular vehicle factors affect handling qualities has been studied in aircraft for decades, and reference standards for the handling qualities of both fixed-wing aircraft and rotary-wing aircraft have been developed and are now in common use. These standards define {{a subset of the}} dynamics and control design space that provides good handling qualities for a given vehicle type and flying task. A new generation of spacecraft now under development by NASA to replace the Space Shuttle and return astronauts to the Moon will have a manual control capability for several mission tasks, and the <b>ease</b> and precision <b>with</b> <b>which</b> pilots can execute these tasks will have an important effect on performance, mission risk and training costs. No reference standards currently exist for handling qualities of piloted spacecraft.|$|R
