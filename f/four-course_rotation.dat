Three <b>four-course</b> <b>rotations</b> were compared. Two of the rotations had one year of grass-clover as a green manure crop, either followed by spring wheat or by winter wheat.

40|$|Nitrate {{leaching}} from {{crop rotations}} for organic grain production were investigated {{in a field}} experiment on different soil types in Denmark from 1997 to 2002. Three experimental factors {{were included in the}} experiment in a factorial design: 1) proportion of grass-clover and pulses in the rotation, 2) cover crop (with and without), and 3) manure (with and without). Two <b>four-course</b> <b>rotations</b> were compared. They had one year of grass-clover as a green manure crop, either followed by spring wheat or by winter wheat. The nitrate leaching was measured using ceramic suction cells. The nitrate leaching did not differ between the rotations, as a change in leaching following the grass-clover was compensated by a reverse effect in the grain crops. Use of cover crops reduced N leaching by 23 to 38 % at crop rotation level with the highest reduction on the coarse sandy soil. Simulation of N leaching using the FASSET model showed that a practice of using part of the summer period in the grass-clover as a bare fallow to control couch grass could increase leaching substantially, in particular on the sandy soil...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate {{leaching}} from {{crop rotations}} supporting organic grain production was investigated from 1997 to 2000 {{in a field}} experiment at three locations in Denmark on different soil types. Three experimental factors {{were included in the}} experiment in a factorial design: (1) proportion of N 2 -fixing crops in the rotation (crop rotation), (2) catch crop (with and without), and (3) manure (with and without). Three, <b>four-course</b> <b>rotations</b> were compared, two at each location. The nitrate leaching was measured using ceramic suction cells. Leaching losses from the crop rotation with grass–clover green manure and without catch crops were 104, 54 and 35 kgNha 21 yr 21 on the coarse sand, the loamy sand, and the sandy loam, respectively. There was no effect of manure application or time of ploughing-in the grass–clover green manure crop on the accumulated nitrate leaching from the entire rotation. Catch crops reduced nitrate leaching significantly, by 30 – 38 %, on the sandy soils. At all locations catch crops reduced the annual averaged nitrate concentration to meet drinking water quality standards in the crop rotation with green manure. On the coarse sand there was a time lag between the onset of drainage and the start of N-uptake by the catch crop...|$|R
50|$|Although most of Hatherton's {{income from}} {{agriculture}} {{came in the}} form of rents and tithes, he was also a considerable farmer on his own account. He drained and developed a large area of land to expand the farm at Teddesley into a holding of some 1700 acres. Here he had 200 head of cattle and 2000 sheep. 700 acres were under cultivation, using a <b>four-course</b> crop <b>rotation.</b> By 1860, he had established a free agricultural college at Teddesley for 30 boys, many the sons of tenants. The boys worked for part of each day on the estate as well as receiving practical and formal instruction.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) supply through animal and green manures on grain yield of winter wheat and winter rye was investigated from 1997 to 2004 in an organic farming crop rotation experiment in Denmark on three different soil types varying from coarse sand to sandy loam. Two experimental factors {{were included in}} the experiment in a factorial design: 1) catch crop (with and without), and 2) manure (with and without). The <b>four-course</b> crop <b>rotation</b> was spring barley undersown with grass/clover - grass/clover - winter wheat or wheat rye - pulse crop. All cuttings of the grass-clover were left on the soil as mulch. Animal manure was ap-plied as slurry to the cereal crops in the rotation in rates corresponding to 40...|$|R
5000|$|His {{remaining}} {{years were}} passed at Raynham, where he interested himself in agriculture. He died at Raynham on 21 June 1738.He promoted {{adoption of the}} Norfolk <b>four-course</b> system, involving <b>rotation</b> of turnips, barley, clover, and wheat crops. He was an enthusiastic advocate of growing turnips as a field crop, for livestock feed. As {{a result of his}} promotion of turnip-growing and his agricultural experiments at Raynham, he became known as [...] "Turnip Townshend". (Alexander Pope mentions [...] "Townshend’s turnips" [...] in Imitations of Horace, Epistle II.) Townshend is often mentioned, together with Jethro Tull, Robert Bakewell, and others, as a major figure in England's [...] "Agricultural Revolution", contributing to adoption of agricultural practices that supported the increase in Britain's population between 1700 and 1850.|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{carbohydrates}} are immediate by-products of {{microbial metabolism}} and {{play an important}} role in the formation and stabilization of soil structure. The effect of long-term management on soil carbohydrate content and monosaccharide composition was investigated in five. Danish sandy loams under organic and conventional management with animal manure and mineral fertilizers. Hot-water (80 °C) extraction was used to measure the distribution and composition of carbohydrates in aggregate size. Carbohydrates released to hot water were determined after hydrolysis as reducing sugars equivalent to glucose. The monosaccharide composition in hot-water extracts was analyzed as the corresponding alditol acetates. Sites with a history of long-term continuos management practices were used. Three treatments from the > 100 year Askov long-term field experiment were used to show results of contrasting fertilization on soil carbohydrate content. These were all grown to a <b>four-course</b> crop <b>rotation.</b> Total carbohydrate content was signifcantly infuenced by long-term management practices, with a signifcantly higher carbohydrate content in soils fertilized with either mineral fertilizers or animal manure (1200 to 800 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate) than in an unfertilized soil (600 to 500 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate). These results were as true for micro-aggregates (, 0. 25 mm) as for the 0. 5 – 1. 0 mmand 4. 0 – 8. 0 mm fractions. The organically managed soil (> 40 years) was sited at a commercial farm with forage crop rotations, organic manure and nouse of crop protection chemicals. These results showed signifcantly higher levels of carbohydrate both in micro-aggregate and macro-aggregates (1200 to 900 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate) than an adjacent conventionally managed soil with annual cash crop, mineral fertilizers and use of cropprotection chemicals (960 to 760 mg C kg- 1 DM aggregate). Carbohydrate Ccontent generally increased as aggregate size decreased in both soils. Monosaccharide distribution was generally similar among three aggregate size classes studied. In all soils the content of monosaccharide was highest in micro-aggregates and lowest in macro-aggregates. Mannose and galactose were normally the most common monosaccharides in the hot-water extracts of aggregate fractions, indicating a predominantly microbial origin...|$|R
