5000|$|EH is Zeeman energy: This is energy {{which is}} added to or {{subtracted}} from the magnetostatic energy, due to {{the interaction between the}} magnetic material and an externally applied magnetic field. It is proportional to the negative of the cosine of the angle between the field and magnetization vectors. Domains with their magnetic <b>field</b> <b>oriented</b> parallel to the applied field reduce this energy, while domains with their magnetic <b>field</b> <b>oriented</b> opposite to the applied field increase this energy. So applying a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic material generally causes the domain walls to move so as to increase the size of domains lying mostly parallel to the field, at the cost of decreasing the size of domains opposing the field. This is what happens when ferromagnetic materials are [...] "magnetized". With a strong enough external field, the domains opposing the field will be swallowed up and disappear; this is called saturation.|$|E

The present measurements reveal a surprising non-monotonic evolution of the phase diagram as the magnetic field is rotated in the [001]-[100] plane. The angle dependence of the critical field (Hc 1) that marks {{the closing of the}} spin gap can be quantitatively accounted for using a minimal spin Hamiltonian comprising superexchange between nearest and next nearest Mn ions, the Zeeman energy and single ion anisotropy. This Hamiltonian also predicts a non-monotonic evolution of the transition between the two ordered states as the field is rotated in the a-c plane. However, the observed effect is found to be significantly larger in magnitude, implying that either this minimal spin Hamiltonian is incomplete or that the magnetically ordered states have a slightly different structure than previously proposed.

40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} focused on the {{employment}} of university graduates within the job market. The theme is currently relevant, because post-graduates present a high-risk group in the economically active population in terms of employment. After their graduation they often end up at government offices and job centres, faced with unemployment. Recent post-graduates are especially at risk {{due to a lack of}} work experience. Many employers however require work experience, resulting in a paradoxical circle of unemployment. The aim of this thesis is to compare health and social <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> with economic and technology <b>oriented</b> <b>fields.</b> Students of these three fields were compared with a view to whether they secured employment in their expected fields, and more importantly whether their wage was what they predicted they would earn. Disparity in expected and actual wage was also assessed. The theoretical part of this thesis is focused above all on the job market, unemployment, and employment policies; specifically active employment policies. The empirical portion consists of a completed and described investigation, which was executed by way of a questionnaire filled out by post-graduates living in and around České Budějovice. Participants were of the Health & Social, Theological and Economic Faculties, as well as students of the Institute of Technology and Business. In this thesis, health and social <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> will include students of the Faculty of Health & Social Studies and Faculty of Theology. The economic <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> will include all students from the Faculty of Economics and from the Faculty of Business Economics of The Institute of Technology and Business. Other faculties of The Institute of Technology and Business are classified as technology <b>oriented</b> <b>fields.</b> The survey showed that in reality, differences exist between individual <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> as to the expectations they have of their subsequent employment within the job market. The students of technology <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> are the most optimistic in their expectations in comparison with health and social and economic <b>oriented</b> <b>fields.</b> They expect a straightforward transition into employment within their field, they believe their field to have enough jobs, they expect higher wages, and some have already secured a job or work experience for after graduation. One positive for students of health and social <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> is that they chose this field on the basis of a genuine interest in the subject. In contrast, students of technology <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> chose with a view to future prospects. Students of economic <b>oriented</b> <b>fields</b> chose their subject as a close follow-on to a previously studied subject or by the distance of the university to their place of residence. Furthermore, students of individual fields were divided in their expectations by their age. Younger students were more skeptical that older students. From the study, it is possible to conclude that university students in health and social fields have lower expectations of their future salary, which supports the hypothesis. The survey also shows further differences between the students within individual fields...|$|R
