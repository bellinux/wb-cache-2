Note that DACs implement an internal, <b>interpolating</b> <b>filter</b> which improves the signal quality at its output, resulting in a sampling rate of 160 Msample/s.

Moreover, given that the DACs have a resolution of 16 bits, the signals are properly quantized, giving as a result 16 -bit integer values for the samples. These signals are stored off-line in buffers available at the transmit nodes of the testbed.|$|E

30|$|When {{compared}} {{to the state of}} the art of digital input power amplifiers our prototype stands for its low-complexity, while keeping high power efficiency and low THD levels. The distortion levels, THD below 0.2 % at 1 [*]kHz in the power range 35 – 60 [*]Wrms with a minimum of 0.13 % at 45 [*]Wrms (see A 3 in Figure 10), are suitable for audio Hi-Fi applications. Other works in literature achieve lower THD values, as example in [13] the THD is 0.02 % for similar power levels of 50 W, but at the expense of a lower efficiency and an increased complexity. The power efficiency is 80 % in [13] while in our work is higher than 90 %. The digital processing tasks in [13] require the use of multiple boards (1 DSP board for the digital audio processing plus 1 FPGA board for PWM processing) while our architecture just requires 1 low-cost FPGA having a bounded circuit complexity of 15 [*]Kgates. The multiple boards digital amplifier in [13] features also a configuration with 90 % power efficiency but with a THD of 0.2 %. In [16] with a 9 level PWM inverter the achieved performances of 0.25 % THD and 80 % efficiency are worse than our results. This confirms our analysis in Section 3.4 that 3 -level PWM is the optimal choice for the output stage. Compact solutions using a single chip for the digital part, as in our work, and without heatsink have been proposed in [9, 19, 23, 31, 32]. However [19] is missing the feedback scheme needed, as proved in Section 4, against parameter changes; in [9] the efficiency levels are lower than those achieved by our scheme. The FPGA-based audio amplifier in [23] is missing feedback and NPWM techniques; it has a power efficiency of 80 % and a THD of 1 % both worse than our achieved results. In [31, 32] only the interpolation filter is implemented occupying a whole Spartan FPGA. With respect to our previous conference paper [20], where only UPWM is implemented and a lower oversampling factor and a less-performance FIR <b>interpolating</b> <b>filter</b> are used, the audio processing system in this work has been improved including the digital techniques for NPWM, more accurate models for all the analog components, a more performing <b>interpolating</b> <b>filter.</b> The prototyped architecture in this work versus [20] achieves a much better THD value, predicted by the simulations and confirmed by measures on the prototype. Finally in some works [10, 17, 24], the shown results refer to simulations or prototypes only of the low-power PWM generator without including a real prototyped power stage. As discussed in this work, and widely proved in literature, the nonideal behaviour of the power stage is a key issue in power audio amplifiers.|$|E

It exhibits a 15 -tap finite impulse response (FIR), with a bandpass frequency response centered at 57 MHz and a stop-band rejection higher than 45 dB. At the same time, it translates 22 – 24 MHz input signals at 80 MS/s, to the frequency range of 56 – 58 MHz in the output at 320 MS/s, allowing also a perfect operation at 400 MS/s, in 0. 35 - m CMOS technology.

In-band case (4), more free degrees available in design enable us to construct such scaling functions. In this paper, a novel approach to designing such scaling functions is proposed.

Therefore, the theory and application of ultrasound have become of extreme importance in nondestructive inspection of complete engineered systems. However, {{despite the fact that}} most of these ultrasound inspection techniques are based on well-established phenomena, two key problems pertaining to their application still remain unresolved. These problems can be identified as (1) the material being tested is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous by nature, and (2) the scanning/data collection process, prior to the reconstruction scheme, is very time consuming. As a result, techniques for fast, accurate testing of anisotropic and nonhomogeneous media have been the focus of attention in modern non-destructive testing research;This dissertation first describes the development and implementation of a time domain synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT) to reconstruct flaws imbedded within Plexiglass[superscript] TM and Graphite/Epoxy samples. A modification to the present SAFT algorithm is then proposed in order to improve the quality of the images produced by SAFT when applied to composites. In addition, since the finite element method (FEM) can be used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations, which govern wave propagation, FEM solutions are used to mimic a SAFT measurement. That is, the FEM is used to simulate the action of a transducer array. This is done to study the sensitivity of parameters involved in the SAFT algorithm. Using the same FEM model as a test bed, the data independent beamformer, in its basic form, is studied to determine its performance in reducing data acquisition time. It is seen that this technique is capable of adjusting the weights of the <b>interpolating</b> <b>filter</b> (beamformer) to predict an incoming signal from a desired direction while discriminating against other signals from different directions;SAFT results indicate that the FEM model can be used as a Test Bed for SAFT sensitivity studies, and point out the possible use of lateral displacement data for SAFT reconstruction. Extensive beamforming test comparisons reveal that the resulting optimal filters are indeed able to predict not only A-scan signals from a set of data produced by a nonuniformly spaced transducer baseline, based on one material geometry, but also A-scan signals from a data set produced by a nonuniformly spaced transducer baseline based on a different material geometry.
