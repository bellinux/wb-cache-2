5|$|Thymine and uracil, nucleic {{bases of}} {{thymidine}} and uridine, respectively, {{do not have}} exocyclic amino groups and hence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> any protection.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed. The seeds <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> any {{treatment}} before sowing, {{and take}} around 14 days to germinate. This is a slow-growing plant, taking 5 to 7 {{years to reach}} maturity and begin flowering.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the store}} buys video games from all consoles, {{it is known}} for its {{collection}} of classic titles. However, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the box or manual for cartridge based games.|$|E
5000|$|Prototype <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> subclassing, but it {{does require}} an [...] "initialize" [...] operation. Factory method <b>requires</b> subclassing, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> initialization. (GoF, p116) ...|$|R
5000|$|Bleach: (Iron EDTA) Oxidises the {{metallic}} silver to silver halide. The bleach must be aerated. The former ferricyanide bleach <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> aeration and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a conditioner.|$|R
50|$|The law <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{settlers}} to be Mexican citizens, although {{citizens were}} given preference in land grants, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> that the settlers convert to Catholicism. However, federal laws prohibited all religions except Catholicism.|$|R
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers are largely free of it. Baggage is seldom inspected, and cash customers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> identification. Greyhound says that security wands {{have been deployed}} on buses, {{but they do not}} appear to be routinely used.|$|E
5|$|All-electric and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles}} {{also have}} lower maintenance costs {{as compared to}} internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems on board last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. PEVs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
25|$|BiFC <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{specialised}} equipment, as visualisation {{is possible}} with an inverted fluorescence microscope that can detect fluorescence in cells. In addition, analysis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> complex data processing or correction for {{other sources of}} fluorescence.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of ADAP method is the simplicity. It {{can be adapted}} to such a cheap equipment as, for example, SlipChip. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> complex and expensive equipment, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> working with hazardous radioactive reagents.|$|R
25|$|ERISA <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{employers}} to establish pension plans. Likewise, {{as a general}} rule, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> that plans provide a minimum level of benefits. Instead, it regulates the operation of a pension plan once it has been established.|$|R
5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> any treatment, {{and take}} 14 to 49 days to germinate. In {{the absence of}} further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of which require a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{though these}} can be {{difficult}} to extract from the follicles. Seeds <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> any treatment before sowing, and take 12 to 48 days to germinate. Cultivars require propagation by cutting for progeny to grow true. Cuttings are slow to strike. Attempts to graft B.coccinea have met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Reads <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> an erase of {{the flash}} memory, {{so they are}} not {{generally}} associated with write amplification. In the limited chance of a read disturb error, the data in that block is read and rewritten, but this would not have any material impact on the write amplification of the drive.|$|E

50|$|Like all walnuts, unripe fruit husks {{produce a}} strong yellow dye that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> mordant; ripe fruits produce a strong red to brown dye that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a mordant, and if cooked in an iron pot, a strong deep black dye.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 2003, MSCA {{licensed}} software was distinguishable from non-MSCA {{licensed software}} {{in that the}} CDs were <b>not</b> holographic, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> activation (for those products which would have otherwise required activation), and, in some cases, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a valid license key.|$|R
5|$|Since 2008, {{consensus}} American and British opinion {{has been}} that in general people with TSH under 10mIU/l <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> treatment. American guidelines recommend that treatment should be considered if the TSH is elevated but below 10mIU/l in people with symptoms of hypothyroidism, detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, a {{history of heart disease}} or are at an increased risk for heart disease.|$|E
5|$|Sinhala {{does not}} come built in with Windows XP, unlike Tamil and Hindi. However, all {{versions}} of Windows Vista and Windows 10 come with Sinhala support by default, and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> external fonts to be installed to read Sinhalese script. Nirmala UI is the default Sinhala font in windows 10.|$|E
5|$|The use of antigen-based malaria rapid {{diagnostic}} tests (RDTs) {{emerged in the}} 1980s. In the twenty-first century Giemsa microscopy and RDTs became the two preferred diagnostic techniques. Malaria RDTs <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> special equipment and offer the potential to extend accurate malaria diagnosis to areas lacking microscopy services.|$|E

5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in baryon density <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|A heated {{public debate}} followed, which {{resulted}} in a substantial rift within the Republican Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46â€“53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a change in law.|$|E
5000|$|... the Arizona Juvenile Code {{was unconstitutional}} because it (a) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> {{that either the}} accused or his parents be {{notified}} of the specific charges against him; (b) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> that the parents be given notice of hearings; and (c) allowed no appeal; and ...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the statute}} {{at issue in}} Baker, the DPPA <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the States in their {{sovereign}} capacity to regulate their own citizens. The DPPA regulates the States as the owners of databases. It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or regulations, and it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> state officials {{to assist in the}} enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals. We accordingly conclude that the DPPA is consistent with the constitutional principles enunciated in New York [...] and Printz.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{outstanding}} {{problems associated with}} the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem. Alternative theories have been proposed that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>require</b> either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
