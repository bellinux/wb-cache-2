25|$|The city's {{municipal}} road network is centred around a series of high-capacity boulevards, which generally radiate out from the city centre to the outskirts. The main axes, which run north-south, east-west and northwest-southeast, {{as well as one}} internal and one <b>external</b> <b>ring</b> road, support the bulk of the traffic. The city's roads are usually very crowded during rush hours, due to an increase in car ownership in recent years. In 2013, the number of cars registered in Bucharest amounted to 1,125,591. This results in wear and potholes appearing on busy roads, particularly secondary roads, this being identified as one of Bucharest's main infrastructural problems. A comprehensive effort on behalf of the City Hall to boost road infrastructure was made, and according to the general development plan, 2,000 roads have been repaired by 2008. On 17 June 2011, the Basarab Overpass was inaugurated and opened to traffic, thus completing the inner city traffic ring. The overpass took five years to build and is the longest cable-stayed bridge in Romania and the widest such bridge in Europe; upon completion, traffic on the Grant Bridge and in the Gara de Nord area became noticeably more fluid.|$|E

40|$|The Silverpit crater is a {{recently}} discovered, 60 - 65 Myr old complex crater, which lies buried beneath the North Sea, about 150 km east of Britain. High-resolution images of Silverpit's subsurface structure, provided by three-dimensional seismic reflection data, reveal an inner-crater morphology {{similar to that}} expected for a 5 - 8 km diameter terrestrial crater. The crater walls show evidence of terrace-style slumping {{and there is a}} distinct central uplift, which may have produced a central peak in the pristine crater morphology. However, Silverpit is not a typical 5 -km diameter terrestrial crater, because it exhibits multiple, concentric rings outside the main cavity. <b>External</b> concentric <b>rings</b> are normally associated with much larger impact structures, for example Chicxulub on Earth, or Orientale on the Moon. Furthermore, <b>external</b> <b>rings</b> associated with large impacts on the terrestrial planets and moons are widely-spaced, predominantly inwardly-facing, asymmetric scarps. However, the seismic data show that the <b>external</b> <b>rings</b> at Silverpit represent closely-spaced, concentric faultbound graben, with both inwardly and outwardly facing fault-scarps. This type of multi-ring structure directly analogous to the Valhalla-type multi-ring basins found on the icy satellites. Thus, the presence and style of the multiple rings at Silverpit is surprising given both the size of the crater and its planetary setting. A further curiosity of the Silverpit structure is that the <b>external</b> concentric <b>rings</b> appear to be extensional features on the West side of the crater and compressional features on the East side. The crater also lies in a local depression, thought to be created by postimpact movement of a salt layer buried beneath the crater...|$|R

The reduction wires (olive wires) and units (hinges) were designed later [1] and provided control of bone fragment positions. Thus, the wires that crossed inside the bone at angles could be guided with the adjustments of the external elements in order to correct bone angulation, translation or torsion. And that was the zest that has resulted in numerous solutions for bone reconstruction with the external apparatus.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} uni-axial {{behaviour}} of circular double-skinned concrete-filled-steel-tubular (CFST) columns with external confinement {{in form of}} <b>external</b> steel <b>rings.</b> Particular {{attention is paid to}} the experimental behaviour of double-skinned CFST columns and theoretical model for evaluating the loadcarrying capacity of un- and ring-confined double-skinned CFST columns. Experimental studies on circular double-skinned CFST columns with various spacing of confinement, concrete strength and hollow ratio were conducted and discussed comprehensively. The mechanical properties of double-skinned CFST columns such as elastic stiffness, elastic strength, load-carrying capacity and ductility are presented. From the result, it is found that the elastic stiffness, elastic strength, load-carrying capacity and ductility are enhanced by installing the <b>external</b> steel <b>rings</b> to the outer tube as external confinement. To verify the effectiveness of <b>external</b> steel <b>rings,</b> the Poisson’s ratios of the double-skinned CFST columns are listed and found to be similar to that of concrete so that a perfect bonding is maintained. To emphasis the excellent performance of double-skinned CFST columns with <b>external</b> <b>rings</b> under uni-axial compression, the load-carrying capacity, elastic strength and elastic stiffness are compared to those of single-skinned CFST columns and reinforced concrete columns. To fill up the gap that no design model is provided in Eurocode 4 (EC 4) for confined double-skinned CFST columns, a theoretical model based on the force equilibrium condition is proposed for evaluating the load-carrying capacity of both un- and ring-confined double-skinned CFST columns. The model takes into account the composite action between the steel tubes and core concrete. To verify the proposed model, numerous test results obtained by the author and other researchers are used for comparing the theoretical results. According to the above theoretical model above, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of various geometry and material properties on the load-carrying capacity of double-skinned CFST columns. The confining pressure is expressed in terms of geometry and material factors. A simplified design formula is proposed to facilitate the preliminary design of double-skinned CFST columns with and without external confinement. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
