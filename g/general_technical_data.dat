40|$|Abstract. The {{solution}} of the Ukrainian integration problem {{in the field of}} education needs a set of reforms in higher educational institutions. The analysis of the peculiarities of contemporary science (more interdisciplinary) and technical education (connection and dependence of <b>general</b> <b>technical</b> disciplines, vocational oriented and humanitarian disciplines) is considered. The achievements in the field of interdisciplinarity are given. The aim of the paper is outlined. The notion of interdisciplinary learning is considered in the context of teaching the students of technical specialties. The interdisciplinary links (between a foreign language and <b>general</b> <b>technical</b> disciplines; a foreign language and <b>general</b> <b>technical</b> disciplines; a foreign language and vocational oriented disciplines (narrow specialization); a foreign language and other humanitarian disciplines; technical / vocational oriented disciplines) are defined. The internal discipline links (between topics within a <b>general</b> <b>technical</b> / vocational oriented disciplines, English) are described...|$|R

It is normal for MULTIPLE contract clauses and provisions to be inserted into the contract solicitation for the acquisition of a SINGLE CATEGORY of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> (for example, DFARS 7013, Non-Commercial <b>Technical</b> <b>Data,</b> and 7017 clauses). However, it {{is important}} to note that if multiple categories of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> (or even FAR data) is to be acquired, multiple categories of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> clauses must be inserted and each contract line item number (CLIN) must be specifically drafted to cover each separate CATEGORY of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> (e.g., commercial AND separately non-commercial software) ...|$|R

Because a weapon system may remain in the defense inventory for decades following initial acquisition, <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> decisions made during acquisition can have far-reaching implications over its life cycle. In August 2004, GAO recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) consider requiring program offices to develop acquisition strategies that provide for future delivery of <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> should the need arise to select an alternative source for logistics support or to offer the work out for competition. For this review, GAO (1) evaluated how sustainment plans for Army and Air Force weapon systems had been affected by <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> rights and (2) examined requirements for obtaining <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> rights under current DOD acquisition policies. ...|$|R

Phase 1 examines aviation industry procedures for developing maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data.</b> Phase 2 will document user problems with maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data.</b> Phase 3 will identify maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> development improvements by applying human factors principles. Five aircraft manufacturers were surveyed regarding company policy, communication, data tracking, user feedback, and error reduction efforts. The five industry participants represent both regional and large commercial transport manufacturers. Phase 1 survey results revealed three significant maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> issues: inconsistent development process guidelines, reactive rather than proactive response to user feedback, and inadequate assessment of errors involving usability as opposed to accuracy. Phase 1 results will later be compared to Phase 2 surveys of user problems with maintenance <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> to identify the impact of development procedures on the users perception of manual quality...|$|R
