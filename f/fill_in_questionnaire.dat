AKI Indonesia is 359 per 100, 000 live births, not in accordance with MDGs target in 2015 that is 102 deaths per 100, 000 live births. One {{of the causes of}} high AKI is because mothers do not utilize Antenatal Care (ANC) visit. Antenatal Care (ANC) is a professional health service (doctors specialist, general practitioner, midwife, and nurse) for the mother during her pregnancy in accordance with antenatal care standards. Objective: The purpose of this research is to know factors related to maternity compliance in performing pregnancy examination and to correlate each factor with the compliance.

40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} {{features}} of lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin in high and very high cardiovascular risk patients in real outpatient practice. Material and methods. Patients ≥ 30 years, visited internists or cardiologists of district outpatient clinics in the period from October 2013 to July 2014 were included into the study. Each patient <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Determination of total cholesterol (TC) level was performed without special preparation of the patient using a portable photometric blood analyzer. Doctors prescribed rosuvastatin therapy when indicated, {{in accordance with the}} Guidelines, choosing the dose on their own. Repeated TC level was determined after 1 month. Results. TC level was initially determined in 10547 patients. Rosuvastatin treatment was recommended for all patients. Repeated TC level determination was performed in 7897 patients in an average after 33 days. Baseline TC level in them was 6. 37 ± 0. 89 mmol/l, and after 1 month while taking rosuvastatin – 4. 89 ± 0. 81 mmol/l (p< 0. 001). The change of TC level was - 22 % (p< 0. 001). The average prescribed dose of rosuvastatin was 11. 88 ± 5. 1 mg per day. The most often (62. 8 %) rosuvastatin was prescribed in a dose of 10 mg per day, in 27. 3 % of patients – 20 mg per day, in 9. 2 % – 5 mg per day, and only 0. 5 % of patients took it in the maximal dose. Conclusion. In real clinical practice, rosuvastatin for treatment of patients with high or very high cardiovascular risk is often prescribed in moderate doses and rarely in the maximum dose despite the proven lipid-lowering effect. </p...|$|E

We can prevent {{or change the}} course of disease, by recognizing the cause of renal failure and its treatment. For recognizing the etiology of end stage renal failure in those helodialysis patients who were under the permanent treatment of hemodialysis in seven provincial hemosialysis centers of mazandaranprovince in 1998. Materials and Methods : 353 patients (182 Female, 171 Male) with the average age 47 years old were studied the cause of end stage renal failure has extracted from the file or summary of the file of patients in their last hospitalization before they began their hemodialysis. The information about each patients has obtained from interview. Medical examination and <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Results : The results of this research shows that hypertension 24. 6 %, chronic glomerulonephritis 10. 8 %, diabetes. 9 %, urinary tracts stones 7. 6 %, and pyelonephritis in 6 % of cases were the cause of end stage renal failure. Cystic and congenital diseases of kindney, lupus erythematosus, amyloidosis. Alport’s syndrome, traumatic and obstructive diseases and medicines, all together in 11 % of causes were responsible for renal failure. In 31 % of cases the cause of renal failure was Iunknown. Conclusion : In compare with foreign statistics the prevalence of infectious and obstructive diseases are more and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and glomerulonephritis are less than that. Though the diabetes and hypertension are common in Mazandaran, nevertheless from etiological point of view less cases of them from hemodialysis patients. The result of this research shows that many curable disease reach end stage renal disease in mazandaran. Many of diabeteic and hypertensive patients probably die because of their non renal complications or no one them to hemodialysis centers...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} has shown that the use of authentic children’s literature is an effective and motivating ESL classroom strategy. However, this study investigated the use of children’s stories in EFL elementary classrooms where the teaching methods are very traditional and the resources are limited. This study was carried out in an elementary school in an Arab town in Israel. Approximately a hundred fifth and sixth grade pupils <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> a <b>questionnaire</b> expressing their attitudes towards being taught through stories. Teacher trainees taught the classes, wrote reflections, <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> <b>questionnaires</b> and were observed by the researchers. This information has been collected and served as the data for the study. Results suggest that the use of this strategy is very positive and should be carefully considered by EFL teachers, EFL trainees and teacher educators.

It is concluded that differences in personality traits between dancers and non-dancers are most likely the result of a process of self-selection, i. e. the ballet subculture attracts persons who possess particular personality traits. © 1991...|$|R
