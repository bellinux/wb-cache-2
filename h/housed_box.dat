50|$|The {{town house}} was built in 1827 to house the Free Will Baptist congregation, and {{was known as the}} North Ridge Meeting House. From 1828 the {{building}} was also used by the town for town meetings and other civic purposes. Its main hall originally <b>housed</b> <b>box</b> pews, which were removed at an unknown date, and there is significant evidence that the pulpit (also long since removed) was located in the south wall (nearest the entrance) of the hall, an unusual configuration seen in only a dozen or so churches in Maine. Ownership of the building is uncertain prior to 1895, by which time the congregation had faded away and it was clearly under municipal control. In 1909-10 the town made a number alterations, including the construction of the selectmen's meeting room and the addition of the tin ceiling. The theater seating was installed in the 1950s, replacing bench pews.|$|E

50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{are used}} on the ICF bogies. These bearings are press fitted on the axle journal by heating the bearings at a temperature of 80 to 100 °C in an induction furnace. Before fitting the roller bearing, an axle collar is press fitted. The collar ensures that the bearing does not move towards {{the center of the}} axle. After pressing the collar, a rear cover for the axle box is fitted. The rear cover has two main grooves. In one of the grooves, a nitrile rubber sealing ring is placed. The sealing ring ensures that the grease in the axle <b>box</b> <b>housing</b> does not seep out during the running of the wheels. A woolen felt ring is placed in another groove. After the rear cover, a retaining ring is placed. The retaining ring is made of steel and is a press fit. The retaining ring ensures that the rear cover assembly is secured tightly between the axle collar and the retaining ring and stays at one place. The roller bearing is pressed after the retraining ring. Earlier, the collar and the bearings were heated in an oil bath. But now the practices has been discontinued and an induction furnace is used to heat them before fitting on the axle. The axle <b>box</b> <b>housing,</b> which is a steel casting, is then placed on the axle. The bearing is housed in the axle <b>box</b> <b>housing.</b> Axle <b>box</b> grease is filled in the axle <b>box</b> <b>housing.</b> Each axle <b>box</b> <b>housing</b> is filled with approximately 2.5 kg. of grease. The front cover for the axle box is placed on a housing which closes the axle box. The front cover is bolted by using torque wrench.|$|R
