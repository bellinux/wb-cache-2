The Soviets also developed an extension of the ambush tactic in which all the guns could be targeted on one particularly valuable or heavily armored target and fired on command, the combined impacts essentially guaranteeing an instant kill. This technique was especially effective against German command tanks (because it generally caused a catastrophic kill, or K-kill, that minimized any chance for the command team to escape) and heavy vehicles (like the Tiger I) that might have otherwise need dozens of separate hits to <b>disable.</b> <b>To</b> counter the effectiveness of the Soviet pakfront, the Germans developed the panzerkeil ("armoured wedge"), but this offensive tactic had limited effectiveness.|$|E

The application involves extended individualized supported for communicate through a society using simple and easy inputs. Over {{the past quarter century}} such a communication has occurred from traditional models of care for persons with <b>disable</b> <b>to</b> more individualized community-based communication mechanisms. Along with this, there has been a significant shift in thought about the potential for persons with new system to be "supported" toward lifestyles that more closely approximate those of persons without such issues. A central issue is the ability of a person to hold a regular full-time communication for a sustained period of time with a community. There have been several attempts to develop novel and radical models for mobile program interventions designed to assist persons with <b>disable</b> <b>to</b> sustain full-time communication while living in the community. The most promising o f these have emerged from the tradition of communication ways with its emphases on individual needed, new communication skills. These are relatively new and field evaluations are rare or have only recently been initiated. Most of the early attempts to evaluate such areas have naturally focused almost exclusively on disability people outcomes. However, application suggests that sustained such people and living in the community may have important of reduced communication gap benefits in addition to the obvious economic ones. To date, there have been no formal studies of the effects o f economic benefits on key mobile application-related outcomes to the community. Over the past several decades, the theory of disabled people's communication has experienced one major stage of evolution. Original models of communication were based on natural figure language. Some equipment was worked and understands only with other individuals who were disabled. N e w mobile application model of services called system for communicate with blind and dumb people was proposed as less expensive and more normalizing for disable persons undergoing issues related to communication with community. The application emphasizes services in an integrated setting for minimum communication gap or bellow. There are two key outcome constructs of interest in this study. The first is the overall disable communication functioning of the key persons with community. This would include the specification of existing mechanisms as well as the overall level of new investigations. The second is the level of new mobile application and importance of reduced the communication gap between key persons and the community.

Taking advantage of design patterns is usually beneficial to software design and makes software development relatively easier. The state pattern proposed by GoF {{is not a}} determined design and can hardly be transformed into implementation code directly. It is <b>disable</b> <b>to</b> cope with sophisticated response event either. Hereby we propose a novel event-condition-state pattern framework, an event-based finite state machine. The framework improves GoF state pattern by re-segmenting Context into two classes, one for management {{and the other for}} operation interface. Essential components for implementation, such as management, state transferring, and event triggering mechanism, are also taken into consideration in the framework. We use pattern framework to develop a thirty party input method system which has a Windows Mobile system version and a Symbian system version separately. We rewrote Context part related with system interfaces in the two different systems, and encapsulated the part related with internal logic of input method by concrete subclasses, thus avoiding redundant developing work in both systems and providing convenience for later synchronous updating and maintenance of two input methods. With the pattern framework, much effort during software development is saved. The development logic seems simpler and clearer. As a result, the whole development process is simplified...|$|E

Databases of the area were formed using all available relevant maps and reports which were supported by fieldwork. A supervised image classification approach was used and thirty-two training areas were applied. Separability of the spectral classes was examined using feature space plots of imagery data and self-classification of training areas. The accuracy of the classification was examined by using test and random pixels. The results show the potential of Landsat data for the discrimination of landforms and zones of the playas.
