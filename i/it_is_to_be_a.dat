25|$|The {{measurement}} of critical application characteristics involves measuring structural {{attributes of the}} application's architecture, coding, and in-line documentation, as displayed in the picture above. Thus, each characteristic is affected by attributes at numerous levels of abstraction in the application and all of which must be included calculating the characteristic's measure if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> valuable predictor of quality outcomes that affect the business. The layered approach to calculating characteristic measures displayed in the figure above was first proposed by Boehm {{and his colleagues at}} TRW (Boehm, 1978) and is the approach taken in the ISO 9126 and 25000 series standards. These attributes can be measured from the parsed results of a static analysis of the application source code. Even dynamic characteristics of applications such as reliability and performance efficiency have their causal roots in the static structure of the application.|$|E
25|$|Polovtsian maidens sing {{comparing}} love to {{a flower}} that droops {{in the heat}} of the day and is revived by night. They dance together (Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join her soon (Konchakovna's Cavatina). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day is fading (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).|$|E

[...] Entitled [...] "What <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> farmer", the article did not contain the concept of God {{creating}} the farmer seen in his 1978 speech, but he still described {{the characteristics of a}} farmer. Many of the same phrases made their way into his 1978 speech. [...] The 1975 column was largely similar to a definition of a dirt farmer given by Boston B.

After Tom dies, George Shelby eulogizes Tom by saying, [...] "What a thing <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Christian."

500|$|Ne-Yo's third album, Year of the Gentleman, was {{released}} internationally on August 5, 2008. Speaking to noted UK R writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Ne-Yo explained the thinking behind its title: [...] "To me Year of the Gentleman {{is all about}} a persona, a swag and a charm. I made {{an assessment of the}} music business. And, in my personal opinion, the essence of the gentleman is absent right now. Everybody kinda looks the same, everybody's kinda doing the same thing, everybody's kinda rude and full of themselves. Whereas a gentleman is calm, courteous, kind, charming... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example, and showing these cats what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gentleman in this business still." ...|$|E

500|$|Stacey Abbott of PopMatters cited David Greenwalt's {{statement}} that [...] "Angel {{is about how}} hard <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> man." [...] Greenwalt observed that the show raises questions {{about what it means}} to be a man and does this not only through the characterization of Angel but also the men around him. He said that like other male characters, taken alone Connor may seem a stereotypical teen boy, but considered with rest of the cast offers a complex image of modern masculinity. Greenwalt also compared Connor's journey with others in terms of identity, which he considers a poignant theme within the series. He found it ironic that Connor who was [...] "initially the most damaged of all the characters", was the only one able to [...] "reconcile his actions and new man existence together" [...] and be at peace with himself in the end.|$|E

Thus, he was living in border-state Missouri as the secession crisis came to a climax. While trying to hold himself aloof from controversy, he observed firsthand the efforts of Congressman Frank Blair, who later served under Sherman, to hold Missouri in the Union. In early April, he declined an offer from the Lincoln administration to take a position in the War Department as a prelude to his becoming Assistant Secretary of War. After the bombardment of Fort Sumter, Sherman hesitated about committing to military service and ridiculed Lincoln's call for 75,000 three-month volunteers to quell secession, reportedly saying: [...] "Why, you might as well attempt to put out the flames of a burning house with a squirt-gun." [...] However, in May, he offered himself for service in the regular army, and his brother (Senator John Sherman) and other connections maneuvered to get him a commission in the regular army. On June 3, he wrote that [...] "I still think <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long war – very long – much longer than any Politician thinks."

Handlen wrote that [...] "Awake benefits from not poking its premise too hard", and [...] "this single-mindedness stems directly from the show's leading man".

McHatton claimed that [...] "It's hard not to wonder if Kate's story, and her pushing of her sister {{to go through with}} their little surfing outing that turned deadly, is some foreshadowing of how Britten's accident. He concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "4.8 out of 5". Caroline Preece from Den of Geek claimed that [...] "It's more fun to block this out and theorise for yourself". She called it [...] "enjoyable" [...] and there were [...] "frustrations" [...] for the episode.
