Any genes not {{paired with a}} homolog, {{as well as any}} paired homologs of that gene, are silenced during the sexual phase by a mechanism known as meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Two genes required for MSUD have been described previously: sad- 1 (suppressor of ascus dominance), encoding an RNA-directed RNA polymerase, and sad- 2, encoding a protein that controls the perinuclear localization of SAD- 1.

Acoustic cymbal transducers, so named for their geometric similarity to the percussion instruments, are miniature "class V" flextensional transducers that consist of a piezoelectric ceramic <b>drive</b> <b>element</b> bonded to two opposing cymbal-shaped metal shells. Operating as mechanical transformers, the two metal shells convert the naturally large generative force of a piezoelectric ceramic in the radial mode into increased volume displacement at the metal shell surface to obtain usable source levels and sensitivities in a broad frequency range. The magnified displacement makes the acoustic cymbal element a potential alternative to acoustic transduction technologies presently used to generate and receive Navy sonar frequencies. Potential benefits to utilizing this technology are generating or receiving broadband sound, at sonar frequencies in a thin, low volume, conformable package.

40|$|In the {{filamentous}} fungus Podospora anserina, two phenomena {{are associated with}} polymorphism at the het-s locus, vegetative incompatibility and ascospore abortion. Two het-s alleles occur naturally, het-s and het-S. The het-s encoded protein is a prion propagating as a self-perpetuating amyloid aggregate. When prion-infected [Het-s] hyphae fuse with [Het-S] hyphae, the resulting heterokaryotic cells necrotize. [Het-s] and [Het-S] strains are sexually compatible. When, however, a female [Het-s] crosses with [Het-S], {{a significant percentage of}} het-S spores abort, in a way similar to spore killing in Neurospora and Podospora. We report here that sexual transmission of the [Het-s] prion after nonisogamous mating in the reproductive cycle of Podospora is responsible for the killing of het-S spores. Progeny of crosses between isogenic strains with distinct wild-type or introduced, ectopic het-s/S alleles were cytologically and genetically analyzed. The effect of het-s/S overexpression, ectopic het-s/S expression, absence of het-s expression, loss of [Het-s] prion infection, and the distribution patterns of HET-s/S-GFP proteins were categorized during meiosis and ascospore formation. This study unveiled a het-S spore-killing system that is governed by dosage of and interaction between the [Het-s] prion and the HET-S protein.

40|$|A piezoelectrically-driven {{hydraulic}} amplification microvalve {{for use in}} high {{specific power}} hydraulic pumping applications was designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. High frequency, high force actuation capabilities were enabled through the incorporation {{of one or more}} bulk piezoelectric material elements beneath a micromachined annular tethered-piston structure. An hydraulic amplification mechanism was employed to amplify the limited stroke of this piezoelectrically-driven piston structure to a significantly larger motion (40 - 50 x) of a micromachined valve membrane with attached valve cap. This valve cap was actuated through its stroke to open and close against a fluid orifice. These design features enabled the valve device to simultaneously meet a set of high frequency (1 - 10 kHz), high pressure(0. 1 -IMPa), and large stroke (15 - 40,um) requirements that had not previously been satisfied by other microvalves presented in the literature. This research was carried out through a series of modeling, design, fabrication, assembly, and experimental testing tasks. Linear and non-linear modeling tools characterizing the structural deformations of the active valve sub-systems were developed. These tools enabled accurate prediction of real-time stresses along the micromachined valve membrane structure during deflection into its non-linear large-deflection regime. A systematic design procedure was developed to generate an active valve geometry to satisfy membrane stress limitations and valve power consumption requirements set forth by external hydraulic system performance goals. (cont.) Fabrication challenges, such as deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) of the <b>drive</b> <b>element</b> and valve membrane structures, wafer-level silicon-to-silicon fusion bonding and silicon-to-glass anodic bonding operations, preparation and integration of piezoelectric material elements within the micromachined tethered piston structure, die-level assembly and bonding of silicon and glass dies, and filling of degassed fluid within the hydraulic amplification chamber were overcome. The active valve structural behavior and flow regulation capabilities were evaluated over a range of applied piezoelectric voltages, actuation frequencies, and differential pressures across the valve. For applied piezoelectric voltages up to 500 Vpp at lkHz, the valve devices demonstrated amplification ratios of <b>drive</b> <b>element</b> deflection to valve cap deflection of 40 - 50 x. These amplification ratios correlated within 5 - 10 % of the model expectations. Flow regulation experiments proved that a peak average flow rate through the device of 0. 21 mL/s under a lkHz sinusoidal drive voltage of 500 Vpp, with valve opening of 17 pm, against a differential pressure of 260 kPa could be obtained. Tests revealed that fluid-structural interactions between the valve cap and membrane components and flow instabilities (due to transition between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes through the valve orifice) limited the valve performance capabilities. by David C.

Relatively high frequencies of X(d) in C. dalmanni and C. whitei (13 - 17 % and 29 %, respectively) cause female-biased sex ratios in natural populations of both species. Sex ratio distortion is associated with spermatid degeneration in male carriers of X(d). Variation in sex ratios is caused by Y-linked and autosomal factors that decrease the intensity of meiotic drive. Y-linked polymorphism for resistance to drive exists in C. dalmanni in which a resistant Y chromosome reduces the intensity and reverses the direction of meiotic drive. When paired with X(d), modifying Y chromosomes (Y(m)) cause the transmission of predominantly Y-bearing sperm, and on average, production of 63 % male progeny.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of a number of}} mechanical applications could be greatly improved by the introduction of transducers that are capable of exploiting the inherent power densities of piezoelectric materials. The ability of these solid-state materials to exert large forces at high frequencies engenders them with specific power levels (mass normalized) that are often several orders of magnitude greater than conventional transducers, but their utility is offset by their small achievable strains. A novel concept for a device capable of improved solid-state transduction, Micro Hydraulic Solid-State Transducers (MHSTs), is introduced and explored in this thesis. The concept is comprised of two core principles: (1) utilization of a hydraulic system consisting of a pump, valves, and a working fluid to rectify the high frequency reciprocations of a piezoelectric <b>drive</b> <b>element</b> into unidirectional motion, and (2) performance enhancement through miniaturization. The goal is a transducer possessing high power densities that is useful in conventional applications. Feasibility of the MHST concept is evaluated by designing, modeling, and simulating a prototype mechanism. The effects of miniattariza~ion on device performance are investigated and an optimal scale is determined. Concept feasibility is based on predicted system performance, existing issues, and manufacturing constraints. It is concluded that the concept is feasible and warrants further development. by Seward Webb Pulitzer, III. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{step that}} occurs during sexual reproduction is meiosis, {{which is a}} specialized type of cell division. During meiosis, pairs of chromosomes exchange genetic information via recombination. At this point, the genome is particularly susceptible to viruses and other foreign genetic invasions. Therefore, {{it is important to}} protect the genome to prevent the transmission of foreign genetic materials to the offspring. There are several mechanisms work together to protect host genome from foreign genetic materials. These are known as “genome defense mechanisms”. The fungus Neurospora crassa {{is one of the best}} organisms for genome defense studies due to the presence of at least three genome defense mechanisms; including Repeat Induced Point mutation (RIP), Quelling, and Meiotic Silencing by Unpaired DNA (MSUD). The main focus of my dissertation is the MSUD pathway. MSUD is a process that detects and silences unpaired DNA between homologous chromosomes. During MSUD, Homologous chromosomes are scanned for unpaired regions by unknown protein complexes. These protein complexes may also contribute to homology search required by some DNA repair pathways. Therefore, identification of these proteins could thus have a significant impact for cancer research. Hence, one part of my dissertation is to identify and characterize novel proteins that detect unpaired DNA during meiotic silencing. In my findings, I have found a putative SNF 2 -family protein (SAD- 6) required for efficient MSUD in Neurospora crassa and it is closely related to a protein called Rad 54, which involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. Moreover, I was able to identify and characterize Neurospora crassa sad- 7, a gene encoding a protein with RNA recognition motif (RRM). My experiments have confirmed that SAD- 7 in N. crassa, is required for fully-efficient MSUD in the presence of unpaired DNA. Additionally, I have focused on Meiotic drive elements. These elements are found in eukaryotic genomes. In general, genetic loci are transmitted to the offspring during sexual reproduction by following the Mendelian inheritance patterns. However, there are some selfish loci that are capable of bias their own transmission rates through meiosis or during gametogenesis in the presence of a competing locus. These are known as meiotic drive elements. Neurospora crassa has a meiotic <b>drive</b> <b>element</b> known as Spore killer- 2 (Sk- 2) and it achieves the biased transmission by spore killing. When Sk- 2 is crossed into a Spore killer sensitive opposite mating type (SkS), hypothetically there should be a mixed offspring population of killer resistant and killer sensitive ascospores. Surprisingly, when analyzing the ascospores, nearly all the survived ascospores express the Sk- 2 genotype and all the ascospores with the Spore killer sensitive genotype are non-viable. However, there are a little known about the exact location of Sk- 2 meiotic <b>drive</b> <b>element</b> and it’s mechanism of transmission. In my experiments, I was able identify a genetic element located in Neurospora chromosome III that is required and sufficient for spore killing. Overall, my results provide new insights to the search and unpaired DNA detection during meiosis and also the identification of the genetic element required for spore killing sheds lights towards the understanding of the spore killer mechanism in Neurospora crassa...|$|E

Genetic diversity was depressed within esterase 5 within Sex-ratio chromosomes, while the four other genes failed to show a reduction in heterozygosity in the Sex-ratio background.

The director receives that wave slightly delayed in time (amounting to a phase delay of about 35° which will be important for the reverse direction calculations later), and generating a current that would be out of phase with the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (thus an additional 180° phase shift), but which is further advanced in phase (by about 70°) due to the director's shorter length. In the forward direction the net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about 110° (180° - 70°) retarded with respect to that from the <b>driven</b> <b>element</b> (green), in this particular design. These waves combine to produce the net forward wave (bottom, right) with an amplitude slightly larger than the individual waves.|$|R
5000|$|An antenna {{may have}} more than one <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> {{although}} the most common multielement antenna, the Yagi, usually has only one. For example, transmitting antennas for AM radio stations often consist of several mast radiators, each of which functions as a half-wave monopole <b>driven</b> <b>element,</b> to create a particular radiation pattern. A two-element array with the elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart has a distinct cardioid radiation pattern when the second <b>element</b> is <b>driven</b> with a source -90° out of phase relative to the first element. A log-periodic antenna (LPDA) consists of many dipole elements of decreasing length, all of which are driven. However because they are different lengths, only one of the many dipoles is resonant at a given frequency, so only one is driven at a time. The dipole that is driven depends on the frequency of the signal. Phased arrays may have hundreds of <b>driven</b> <b>elements.</b> Household multiband television antennas generally consist of a hybrid between a UHF Yagi with one driven dipole and a log-periodic for VHF behind that with alternating active <b>elements.</b> The <b>driven</b> <b>elements</b> between the UHF and VHF are then coupled and often matched for a 75 ohm coaxial downlead to the receiver.|$|R
