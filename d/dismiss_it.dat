5|$|The terrain {{has led to}} the {{development}} of specialised frames, wheels and tyres. Punctures and other mechanical problems are common and often influence the result. Despite the esteem of the race, some cyclists <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> because of its difficult conditions. The race has also seen several controversies, with winners disqualified.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, it is {{unwise to}} <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> {{altogether}} {{as it is}} also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention of the author, like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian's Wall was constructed during Hadrian's reign and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the Historia Augusta, the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|On his day off, Nikumbh {{sets off}} to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is {{surprised}} to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Mr Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Mr Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Mr Awasthi tries to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia as well as he may be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.|$|E

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as nothing.|$|E
25|$|According to Bryant, OIT proponents {{tend to be}} {{linguistic}} dilettantes {{who either}} ignore the linguistic evidence completely, <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as highly speculative and inconclusive, or attempt to tackle it with hopelessly inadequate qualifications; this attitude and neglect significantly minimises the value of most OIT publications.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{appearance of}} goblins in Tolkien's writings is the 1915 poem Goblin Feet, also his first published work, {{which appeared in}} the annual volume of Oxford Poetry published by Blackwells. It features quaint elvin creatures, and some 45 years later Tolkien was to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as juvenile.|$|E

25|$|On {{the eve of}} the Open Championship in 2016, McIlroy said {{he would}} not watch the golf tournament at the Olympic Games and would focus on the sports that matter like {{swimming}} and track & field having previously withdrawn from representing Ireland in the games due to the threat of the Zika virus in Brazil. Following the tournament, McIlroy went on to admit his surprise at how successful it had been, and that he had been wrong to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{television}} {{special to}} celebrate the series. Many cast and crewmembers, fans and celebrities, such as Patrick Stewart, offer an opinion on the popular British sci-fi comedy series. In one skit, a couple of Daleks being interviewed disapprove of the series. They <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as human propaganda, along with Earth television in general. However, one of them then begins to compliment Red Dwarf on its jokes. The other one takes notice of its associate having a sense of humour and, naturally, exterminates it on the spot.|$|E

25|$|The album has {{received}} an unfavourable response from many music critics; these writers <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as unfocused, unstructured, and consisting of random sounds. Some commentators and musicians recognise {{it as an}} adventurous work that displays the Moog's sonic potential {{at a time when}} the system was in its infancy. In the United States and Canada, the LP was pressed with the two tracks swapped around, leading to confusion regarding the identity of the pieces. The order was corrected for the album's CD release in 1996 and its reissue in 2014. The 2014 reissue includes essays by Kevin Howlett and electronica musician Tom Rowlands, along with Dhani Harrison's explanation of his father's artwork.|$|E
25|$|Discretionary appeals make up {{the bulk}} of the court's docket. A {{discretionary}} appeal begins when a petition for appeal is filed with the clerk of the court. Petitions are assigned to a law clerk or staff attorney for initial research, culminating in a memorandum summarizing the pertinent facts and evaluating the legal issues raised by the petition and any brief in opposition filed in response to the petition. If the law clerk, staff attorney, or brief in opposition identify any procedural defects in the petition, it is referred to a panel of two justices who may <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> with or without prejudice depending {{on the nature of the}} defect. (When a petition is dismissed without prejudice, the petitioner has an opportunity to correct the procedural error and file a new petition. When a petition is dismissed with prejudice, the appeal ends and the judgment of the lower court is affirmed.) Otherwise, the case is then placed on the docket for consideration by a panel of three justices.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 27(f), respondent-appellee Commander S.L. Wright respectfully moves this Court to remand {{this case}} to the {{district}} court with instructions to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Respondent-appellee has conferred with counsel for petitioner-appellant, and they agree with the briefing schedule proposed below. As explained below, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), Pub. L. No. 109-366 (see Attachment1), which took effect on October 17, 2006, removes federal court jurisdiction over pending and future habeas corpus actions and any other actions filed by or on behalf of detained aliens determined by the United States to be enemy combatants, such as petitioner-appellant al- Marri, except as provided in Section1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) of the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA). In plain terms, the MCA removes this Court's jurisdiction (as well as the district court's) over al-Marri's habeas action. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand {{the case to the}} district court with instructions to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|As {{they had}} done while campaigning for the federal {{election}} in 2004, the New Democratic Party and Bloc Québécois stated, during the leadup to the January 2006 election, their support for an apology and redress for the head tax. Similarly, on December 8, 2005, Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper released a press statement expressing his support for an apology for the head tax. As {{a part of his}} party platform, Harper promised to work with the Chinese community on redress, should the Conservatives be called to form the next government. Before his party ultimately lost the election, Martin issued a personal apology on a Chinese language radio program. However, he was quickly criticized by the Chinese Canadian community for not issuing the apology in the House of Commons and for then trying to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> completely in the English-speaking media on the very same day. Several Liberal candidates with significant Chinese-Canadian populations in their ridings, including Vancouver-Kingsway MP David Emerson and the Minister of State for Multiculturalism and Richmond MP Raymond Chan, also made futile attempts to change their positions {{in the midst of the}} campaign. Others, such as Edmonton Centre MP Anne McLellan lost her riding to Conservative MP Laurie Hawn.|$|E
25|$|Chua J. {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the basic features doctrine in Singapore. He reasoned that a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, can never be invalid if the procedure for amendment is complied with. If the framers of the Constitution had intended limitations on the power of amendment, they would have expressly provided for such limitations. Furthermore, if the courts were allowed to impose limitations on the legislative power to amend, they would be usurping Parliament's legislative function, contrary to Article 58. In any case, Chua J. did not agree that Parliament had violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The subjective test reinserted into the ISA had served the national security interests of Singapore for a long time. The amendments merely reaffirmed the law which the courts had followed since Lee Mau Seng, and ensured that the legislative intent behind the ISA was not disregarded. Moreover, nothing in the amendments was unrelated to national security. A reaffirmation of the original principles could not be said to be objectionable as usurping judicial power or being contrary to the rule of law. The rule of law had not been abolished by legislation, as Parliament had done no more than to enact the rule of law relating to judicial review. The legislation did not order the court to decide a case in a particular way or to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> – the court was left to deal with the case {{on the basis of the}} amendments.|$|E

Tuđman accepted the plan (which Croatia considered unacceptable) as a base for negotiations with the RSK, hoping that they would <b>dismiss</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|The lockout {{was officially}} {{started by the}} owners on July 1, 2011, during which, teams could not trade, sign or contact players, and players could not access NBA team facilities, {{trainers}} or staffs. Negotiations resumed at an August 1 bargaining session, but it fell apart after three hours. On August 2, 2011, the NBA filed two unfair labor practice claims against the NBPA, one at the NLRB and another at a federal district court in New York. The league accused the players of being uncooperative in negotiations by threatening to dissolve their union and file antitrust lawsuits. Hunter, {{in a statement released}} by the union, called the lawsuits [...] "without merit" [...] and that the union would seek to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> in court. On August 4, Hunter said that he thought the entire [...] would likely be canceled.|$|E
500|$|His work in OVW {{was a key}} {{plot device}} in WWC's main storyline of the year. On May 15, 2004, the {{promotion}} began a backstage angle where Enrique Cruz told Eddie Colón that Carly Colón was wrestling as a heel in OVW, only for José Rivera, Jr. to <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "internet gossip". A subsequent phone conversation between brothers concluded without a direct response on the matter. On June 13, 2004, Carly Colón's role as a heel was made official in a segment where he told his sister {{that he was no}} longer interested in his father or the people of Puerto Rico. Consequently, Eddie Colón traveled to the United States to meet with his brother. Upon arriving to the hotel where Carly Colón was staying, he asked to contact him, but the clerk refused to attend him after receiving the response that [...] "Mr. Colón says that he has no brother" [...] and receiving no response upon knocking on the room door.|$|E
500|$|During {{its long}} {{banishment}} from the stage, The Country Wife continued a shadowy {{existence in the}} form of David Garrick's cleaned-up version The Country Girl (1766), where Margery is a virgin and Horner her romantic lover. This play was very popular, going through at least twenty editions, reaching the New York stage in 1794, and surviving in both London and New York into the twentieth century. The few modern critics who have read Garrick's version typically <b>dismiss</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "sentimental and boring, where The Country Wife is astringent and provocative". Wycherley's original is now again a stage classic, with countless professional and amateur performances, an actors' favourite because of the high number of good parts it offers. The movie Shampoo (1975), with Warren Beatty as the Horner character, is a somewhat distant version of The Country Wife after exactly 300 years, reportedly inspired by the Chichester Festival production of 1969. There was a BBC Play of the Month production of The Country Wife, in 1977, in which Anthony Andrews plays Horner and Helen Mirren plays Margery.|$|E
