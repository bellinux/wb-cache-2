5|$|After 9600 BCE, the area's {{environment}} grew {{warmer and}} drier, {{a change that}} brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though {{it is unclear whether}} they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance {{at a time when most}} of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> {{to move on}} top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking {{on a variety of}} surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} of the black market for organs has {{been a number of}} cases and suspected cases of organ theft, including murder for the purposes of organ theft. Proponents of a legal market for organs say that the black-market nature of the current trade allows such tragedies and that regulation of the market could prevent them. Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to claim that their stolen organs were legal.|$|E
25|$|Parasitic worms {{have been}} used as a medical {{treatment}} for various diseases, particularly those involving an overactive immune response. As humans have evolved with parasitic worms, proponents argue they are needed for a healthy immune system. Scientists are looking for a connection between the prevention and control of parasitic worms and the increase in allergies such as hay-fever in developed countries. Parasitic worms may be able to damp down the immune system of their host, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to live in the intestine without coming under attack. This may be one mechanism for their proposed medicinal effect.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the scout}} ant is {{observed}} {{to lay a}} pheromone trail on the return journey to the nest, the other ants seem to be unable to follow this trail {{without the help of}} the scout. The scout ant therefore leads the raid from the front, with the other ants following in a column-like formation. Recruitment time varies between 60 and 300 seconds, with all castes taking part in a raid. During the outward journey towards the termites, all ants are laying a pheromone trail, making it much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to find their way back to the nest later without having to rely on the scout ant.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{trees are}} more likely to support more Orthalicus reses reses snails than smaller trees, {{probably}} because they provide the snails with an increased surface area for foraging. It is not known if Orthalicus reses reses prefer certain tree types or species; however, Voss (1976) suggested tree snails generally prefer trees with smooth bark rather than trees with rough bark, because it would require less energy to crawl over smooth bark. Voss also believed Orthalicus reses reses would prefer smooth bark because it would make it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to form a secure mucous seal when they were aestivating, resulting in lower mortalities from dehydration or accidental dislodgement.|$|E
25|$|Since the Byzantine {{army was}} still holding on after this defeat the sultan {{thought it was time}} to set up his secret weapon, a huge mobile tower. This tower could hold many {{soldiers}} who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is one reason that he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E
25|$|After their {{missions}} for the Navy, Knorr {{arrived on}} site on August 22, 1985, and deployed Argo. When they {{searched for the}} two submarines, Ballard and his team discovered that they had imploded from the immense pressure at depth. It littered thousands of pieces of debris all over the ocean floor. Following the large trail of debris led them directly to both and made it significantly <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to locate them than {{if they were to}} search for the hulls directly. He already knew that the Titanic imploded from pressure as well, much the same way the two submarines did, and concluded that it too must have also left a scattered debris trail. Using that lesson, they had Argo sweep {{back and forth across the}} ocean floor looking for the Titanic's debris trail. They took shifts monitoring the video feed from Argo as it searched the ocean floor two miles below.|$|E
25|$|Thinking of virginity as {{a stigma}} disempowered many boys {{because they felt}} deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, were more likely than adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E

500|$|In {{all three}} types of {{structure}} the cross-section area of the choanocyte-lined regions {{is much greater than}} that of the intake and outlet channels. This makes the flow slower near the choanocytes and thus makes it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to trap food particles. For example, in Leuconia, a small leuconoid sponge about [...] tall and [...] in diameter, water enters each of more than 80,000 intake canals at 6cm per minute. However, because Leuconia has more than 2million flagellated chambers whose combined diameter is much greater than that of the canals, water flow through chambers slows to 3.6cm per hour, making it easy for choanocytes to capture food. All the water is expelled through a single osculum at about 8.5cm per second, fast enough to carry waste products some distance away.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{have two}} pairs of {{flippers}} {{on the front and}} back, the fore-flippers and hind-flippers. The elbows and ankles are enclosed within the body. Pinnipeds tend to be slower swimmers than cetaceans, typically cruising at [...] compared to around [...] for several species of dolphin. Seals are more agile and flexible, and some otariids, such as the California sea lion, are capable of bending their necks backwards far enough to reach their hind-flippers, allowing them to make dorsal turns. Pinnipeds have several adaptions for reducing drag. In addition to their streamlined bodies, they have smooth networks of muscle bundles in their skin that may increase laminar flow and make it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to slip through water. They also lack arrector pili, so their fur can be streamlined as they swim.|$|E
500|$|The gender {{wage gap}} is a {{possible}} consequence of occupational segregation. The gender wage gap is the [...] "difference between wages earned by women and men". In 2008, globally, men were estimated to earn 16.5 per cent more than women. The gender wage gap is narrowing, but progress remains slow. Additionally, the narrowing of the gender wage gap {{may be attributed to}} a decrease in men's wages instead of an increase in women's wages. [...] "The persistent gender wage gap across regions may reflect a number of factors, including women's continued disadvantage in terms of education and skills; their lack of an organized voice and bargaining power; gender-specific constraints on their labour market mobility; and their relatively high involvement in part-time or temporary jobs." [...] Many characteristics of the labor market constrain the employment opportunities of women and make it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to be responsible for care work.|$|E
