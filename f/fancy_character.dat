50|$|Generally {{acknowledged}} {{to be the}} first sequel to the work of Jane Austen, Old Friends and New <b>Fancies</b> incorporates <b>characters</b> from each of Austens six major novels into one unified story, alongside characters of Brintons own invention. The novel generally focuses on various pairings of lovers and the challenges that their unions create.|$|R
60|$|It is one which, in some vague, {{unconscious}} way, symbolizes, to my <b>fancy,</b> the <b>character</b> of a man. I {{have never}} been able to explain exactly why. I think I must have seen the picture in some illustrated volume when a baby, or my mother may have dreamed it before I was born.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it did {{break that}} unity between you, and prevent your leading her insensibly. I <b>fancy</b> your two <b>characters</b> would have grown apart anyhow, {{but this was}} the moving cause. Now I fancy, so far as I can see, that she is more afraid of being wearied and {{restrained}} than of anything else. It is just what I felt for many years of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the earlier}} {{numbers of the}} Comic Almanac all the manners and customs of Londoners that would afford food for fun were noted down; and if {{during the last two}} years the mysterious personage who, under the title of [...] "Rigdum Funnidos," [...] compiles this ephemeris, has been {{compelled}} to resort to romantic tales, we must suppose that he did so because the great metropolis was exhausted, and it was necessary to discover new worlds in the cloud-land of <b>fancy.</b> The <b>character</b> of Mr. Stubbs, who made his appearance in the Almanac for 1839, had, we think, great merit, although his adventures were somewhat of too tragical a description to provoke pure laughter.|$|R
60|$|But had I {{been born}} in a class which would have {{deprived}} me {{of what is called}} a liberal education, it is not unlikely that, being strong in body, I should have taken to a way of life such as that in which my 'Pedlar' passed the greater part of his days. At all events, I am here called upon freely to acknowledge that the character I have represented in his person is chiefly an idea of what I <b>fancied</b> my own <b>character</b> might have become in his circumstances.|$|R
60|$|What principally raised {{this dance}} of the devils round poor Ludwig, I perceive, was a {{marriage}} he had made, three years before Waldemar emerged; of which, were it only {{for the sake of}} the Bride's name, some mention is permissible. Margaret of the Tyrol, commonly called, by contemporaries and posterity, MAULTASCHE (Mouthpoke, Pocket-mouth), she was the bride:--marriage done at Innspruck, 1342, under furtherance of father Ludwig the Kaiser:--such a mouth as we can <b>fancy,</b> and a <b>character</b> corresponding to it. This, which seemed to the two Ludwigs a very conquest of the golden-fleece under conditions, proved the beginning of their worst days to both of them.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{tells the story of}} the song itself in more detail. It opens with the title <b>character,</b> <b>Fancy</b> Rae Baker, played by McEntire, riding in a taxi cab and {{arriving}} at the site of the small shack on the outskirts of New Orleans where she grew up, which is now abandoned. The video takes something of a creative license with the song as McEntire's version of Fancy, much like McEntire herself, is a famous singer and actress. The story of the song plays out against the background accompanied by flashbacks of Fancy's past with her mother and baby sibling playing prominent roles.|$|R
5000|$|Charlotte is {{also very}} open about her {{sexuality}} and makes reference to it on-screen {{on a number of}} occasions. In October 2009, Amy Yamazaki, whilst talking about the character's sexuality, stated in an interview with PA: [...] "As far as I'm concerned, acting is just acting whether you're kissing a boy or a girl. Chances are you're not going to fancy them - they're just people you work with. I don't want to come across as someone who'll kiss anybody {{but when it comes to}} an acting job, I don't have an opinion if my <b>character</b> <b>fancies</b> a person whether it be boy, girl or, I don't know, mushroom." ...|$|R
50|$|Dawn and {{her friends}} enjoyed {{a wide range of}} cool accessories. The Dawn Fashion Show was a {{revolving}} stage where the girls could use to practice modeling the latest fashions. The Dawn Beauty Pageant was a similar item that allowed the dolls to walk the runway, turn, and walk back along the other side. The Dawn's Disco was a psychedelic revolving dance floor where exclusive doll <b>characters</b> <b>Fancy</b> Feet and her dreamy boyfriend Kevin could dance the night away. Dawn's Beauty Parlor and Dawn's Dress shop let the girls try out the latest looks in the three-way mirror and actual working sink. They could drive there in Dawn's Action Car, a flashy blue convertible.|$|R
50|$|In February 2011, Martin {{appeared}} {{as one of}} the regulars on the radio-comedy program The Lonely Hearts Club which was broadcast weekly on ABC Radio National on Saturday nights from 10 pm to midnight. The show, delivered in a deadpan, straight fashion, featured an un-credited Martin appearing under the pseudonym of 39-year-old Duncan Jardine, one of Australia's most successful second-unit directors. The first episode was broadcast on 12 February 2011 and the eighth and final episode was heard on 2 April 2011. Although his own name never appeared on either the show or in any of its promotional material, Martin wrote an article in his weekly column on Scrivener's <b>Fancy</b> as the <b>character</b> of Jardine and long-time Martin fans have recognised his voice on the show.|$|R
5000|$|With the series' growth into {{an online}} video series, episodes grew {{to an average}} length of eight to twelve minutes. Although {{reviewing}} films remains a central conceit, {{the focus of the}} series quickly shifted from a mockery of amateur podcasting to an extended character study of the two podcasters. Heidecker, in character on On Cinema, frequently uses his time on camera to discuss anything on his character's mind except film, especially his bizarre ailments, personal crises, and right-wing political views, or to simply berate and belittle Turkington. Turkington's <b>character</b> <b>fancies</b> himself a [...] "film expert," [...] his primary qualification being an enormous collection of forgotten and arguably forgettable mainstream films from the 1980s and 1990s on VHS. The series continues to provide reviews that purposely offer no real critical insight.|$|R
2500|$|Ms. Endive (voiced by Mindy Sterling): An obese, intelligent, and {{somewhat}} snobbish female chef who teaches cooking to Panini with strict discipline. She's also occasionally portrayed as the show's main antagonist or villain. She is usually depicted as gargantuan in size. This {{is shown in}} the episode [...] "The Apprentice Games" [...] where Mung Daal and Chowder enter the games by riding on Endive's posterior. She regularly berates Mung Daal, whom she considers a rival. In the episode [...] "Chowder's Girlfriend", it is revealed she despises boys and boyfriends because her fianc√© did not show up on their wedding day. Ms. Endive is first seen in the second episode with Panini, [...] "Chowder's Girlfriend". The creator describes her as Martha Stewart with Oompa-Loompa colors. Greenblatt chose to name her after the endive since endive is bitter and Belgian endive is fancy; hence the character is bitter and <b>fancy.</b> Endive's <b>character</b> stayed constant throughout the initial development. The long nose, which changed from a rectangular shape to a triangle shape for the final version, represents how Endive looks down at other characters. It was revealed in later episodes that Ms. Endive is in love with Shnitzel. Greenblatt said that he felt that her evolution throughout the series was fun to observe, especially when William Reiss wrote plots involving Endive.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he said, [...] "listen, please, to my confession. I am a fraud. I {{am not a}} {{purveyor}} of new sensations for a decadent troop of weary, fashionable people. I am a fraud sometimes even to myself. I have had good luck in material things. I have had bad luck in the precious, the sentimental side of life. It has made something of an artificial character of me, on the surface at any rate. I am really a simple, elderly man who loves fresh air, clean, honest things, games, and a healthy life. I have no ambitions except those connected with sport. I don't even want to climb to the topmost niches {{in the world of}} finance. I think you have looked at me through the wrong-coloured spectacles. You have had a whimsical <b>fancy</b> for a <b>character</b> which does not exist." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bornegames is the hub for Borne's {{work and}} blog, which quickly became an {{integral}} part of the beta testing process. With new betas being released on a regular basis that no other websites had, players visiting the site act as beta testers and report software bugs. It became the central hub for the latest bug-fixes and BETA news. Borne has also used his blog to post question and answer videos to reply to questions sent in by fans, he has also posted a [...] "Behind the Fancy Pants" [...] video as well as an [...] "Official Snailshell Golf Guide". In May 2008 Borne completed a Fancy Pants Man move set and character design for the fighting game Newgrounds Rumble. In Newground Rumble Fancy Pants Man was supposedly invited for free ice cream in the Newgrounds world until he finds out that it was a setup for revenge by the other characters in the Newground universe. Newgrounds didn't appreciate [...] "kiddy" [...] games unlike killing, shooting, violent, etc. games. <b>Fancy</b> later fights <b>characters</b> like S'asshole, Hank, P-bot, Nene, and the Newgrounds mascot Pico.During the Pico and Nene stage, Pico's rival Piconjo joins Fancy's side. Fancy later tries to find whose idea was the setup.|$|R
2500|$|Clairmont {{remained}} in the Shelley household in their wanderings across Europe. The three young people traipsed across war-torn France and into Switzerland, <b>fancying</b> themselves like <b>characters</b> in a romantic novel, as Mary Shelley later recalled, but always reading widely, writing, and discussing the creative process. On the journey, Clairmont read Rousseau, Shakespeare, and the works of Mary's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. [...] "What shall poor Cordelia do ‚Äì Love & be silent," [...] Clairmont wrote in her journal while reading King Lear. [...] "Oh is is true ‚Äì Real Love will never ew itself to the eye of broad day ‚Äì it courts the secret glades." [...] Clairmont's emotions were so stirred by Cordelia that she had one of her [...] "horrors", a hysterical fit, Mary Shelley recorded in her own journal entry for the same day. Clairmont, who was surrounded by poets and writers, also made her own literary attempts. During the summer of 1814, she started a story titled The Idiot, which has since been lost. In 1817‚Äì18, she wrote a book which Percy Bysshe Shelley tried without success to have published. Although Clairmont lacked the literary talent of her stepsister and brother-in-law, she always longed to take centre stage. It was during this period that she changed her name from [...] "Jane" [...] to first [...] "Clara" [...] and finally the more romantic-sounding [...] "Claire".|$|R
2500|$|With its {{humor and}} {{occasional}} tongue-in-cheek tone, Passions {{has been known}} to [...] "break the fourth wall", or somehow call {{attention to the fact that}} the show is fictional. In an early episode, Kay, Simone, and Zombie Charity were seen actually watching Passions, and when the television in the Bennett's kitchen covered what would have been Theresa's execution, the news report actually pre-empted Passions, cutting in during the theme song just after the appearance of the logo. In a 2002 episode Theresa was giving birth while stuck in a cabin with Ethan and Gwen; she had a hallucination in which the three of them did a dance together and sang the show's theme song [...] "Breathe." [...] In 2004, TC made a reference to [...] "that crazy soap after Days of our Lives", which in most areas airs before Passions. In one episode Fancy Crane used a magazine to hide her face from Noah; the magazine had an image of the then-unseen Rachel Barrett with the sentence [...] "Who is she?" [...] under the Passions logo. Fancy later commented that serials [...] "are just like life; you never know what's going to happen!" [...] In an early 2006 episode, Ivy and assistant Valerie were searching on the internet for Miguel to bring him back to Harmony and interfere with Fox and Kay's relationship. They could not find him, but Valerie tracked down his last place of employment: he was last seen working as a gardener in some suburban town on a street called Wisteria Lane. At that time, Jesse Metcalfe (ex-Miguel) was playing a gardener on the prime-time serial Desperate Housewives, which takes place on a street called Wisteria Lane. In the March 30, 2006 episode, while Passions reruns were airing on the Sci-Fi Channel, Simone compared life in Harmony to living in a show on the Sci-Fi Channel. Similarly, in the August 10, 2006 episode, Theresa commented that her office was not like an NBC daytime serial, and that she would not hire somebody just because he looked like Jesse Metcalfe (who had portrayed her brother Miguel from 1999‚Äì2004). A similar inside joke occurred when the <b>character</b> <b>Fancy</b> had a dream that she was a cheerleader; in real life, Fancy's portrayer Emily Harper was a [...] "Laker Girl" [...] (cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers) from 2000-2003.|$|R
60|$|A {{few words}} {{regarding}} the peculiar conditions {{of life and}} society that are here rudely sketched, and often but barely outlined. The author is aware that, partly from a habit of thought and expression, partly from the exigencies of brevity in his narratives, and partly from the habit of addressing an audience familar with the local scenery, he often assumes, as premises already granted by the reader, {{the existence of a}} peculiar and romantic state of civilization, the like of which few English readers are inclined to accept without corroborative facts and figures. These he could only give by referring to the ephemeral records of Californian journals of that date, and the testimony of far-scattered witnesses, survivors of the exodus of 1849. He must beg the reader to bear in mind that this emigration was either across a continent almost unexplored, or by the way of a long and dangerous voyage around Cape Horn, and that the promised land itself presented the singular spectacle of a patriarchal Latin race who had been left to themselves, forgotten by the world, for nearly three hundred years. The faith, courage, vigor, youth, and capacity for adventure necessary to this emigration produced a body of men as strongly distinctive as the companions of Jason. Unlike most pioneers, the majority were men of profession and education; all were young, and all had staked their future in the enterprise. Critics who have taken large and exhaustive views of mankind and society from club windows in Pall Mall or the Fifth Avenue can only accept for granted the turbulent chivalry that thronged the streets of San Francisco in the gala days of her youth, and must read the blazon of their deeds like the doubtful quarterings of the shield of Amadis de Gaul. The author has been frequently asked if such and such incidents were real,--if he had ever met such and such characters. To this he must return the one answer, that in only a single instance was he conscious of drawing purely from his imagination and <b>fancy</b> for a <b>character</b> and a logical succession of incidents drawn therefrom. A few weeks after his story was published, he received a letter, authentically signed, correcting some of the minor details of his facts (!), and enclosing as corroborative evidence a slip from an old newspaper, wherein the main incident of his supposed fanciful creation was recorded with a largeness of statement that far transcended his powers of imagination.|$|R
60|$|To come at all at {{the nature}} of this quality of romance, we must bear in mind the {{peculiarity}} of our attitude to any art. No art produces illusion; in the theatre we never forget {{that we are in the}} theatre; and while we read a story, we sit wavering between two minds, now merely clapping our hands at the merit of the performance, now condescending to take an active part in <b>fancy</b> with the <b>characters.</b> This last is the triumph of romantic story-telling: when the reader consciously plays at being the hero, the scene is a good scene. Now in character-studies the pleasure that we take is critical; we watch, we approve, we smile at incongruities, we are moved to sudden heats of sympathy with courage, suffering or virtue. But the characters are still themselves, they are not us; the more clearly they are depicted, the more widely do they stand away from us, the more imperiously do they thrust us back into our place as a spectator. I cannot identify myself with Rawdon Crawley or with Eug√®ne de Rastignac, for I have scarce a hope or fear in common with them. It is not character but incident that woos us out of our reserve. Something happens as we desire to have it happen to ourselves; some situation, that we have long dallied with in fancy, is realised in the story with enticing and appropriate details. Then we forget the characters; then we push the hero aside; then we plunge into the tale in our own person and bathe in fresh experience; and then, and then only, do we say we have been reading a romance. It is not only pleasurable things that we imagine in our day-dreams; there are lights in which we are willing to contemplate even the idea of our own death; ways in which it seems as if it would amuse us to be cheated, wounded or calumniated. It is thus possible to construct a story, even of tragic import, in which every incident, detail and trick of circumstance shall be welcome to the reader‚Äôs thoughts. Fiction is to the grown man what play is to the child; it is there that he changes the atmosphere and tenor of his life; and when the game so chimes with his fancy that he can join in it with all his heart, when it pleases him with every turn, when he loves to recall it and dwells upon its recollection with entire delight, fiction is called romance.|$|R
