40|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> {{is known}} to be enhanced by combination with methyl ethyl ketone. This study was conducted to clarify the potentiating effect of aliphatic monoketones on the neurotoxicity of methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> Rats were subcutaneously injected in the back with 4 mmol/kg/day of methyl ethyl ketone, methyl n-propyl ketone, methyl n-amyl ketone, or methyl n-hexyl ketone mixed with an equimolar dose of methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> five days a week for 20 weeks. The maximum motor fibre conduction velocity and the distal latency were measured every two weeks in the tail nerves of the treated animals and controls. All the monoketones tested enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> Of the compounds tested, methyl n-hexyl ketone, which had the longest carbon chain, enhanced the neurotoxicity of methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> most strongly. These results suggest that the length of the carbon chain of the aliphatic monoketones combined with methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone</b> was related to the enhancement of the neurotoxicity of the neurotoxic compound...|$|R

The maximum conduction velocity of motor and sensory fibres and the motor distal latency of the tail nerves of rats were periodically examined in animals receiving repeated subcutaneous injections of 11 aliphatic monoketone or diketone compounds and their relatives for prolonged periods. A study of the comparative neurotoxicity of n-hexane, methyl <b>n-butyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> and their metabolites showed that 2, 5 -hexanedione was the most actively neurotoxic. Furthermore, a study of other symmetrical diketones with different carbon numbers showed that 2, 4 -pentanedione, which is structurally similar to 2, 5 -hexanedione, possessed a different type of neurotoxic activity than 2, 5 -hexanedione. Regarding aliphatic monoketone compounds, acetone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, and 2 -octanone were confirmed non-neurotoxic for the peripheral nervous system.

No evidence of teratogenicity or maternal toxicity was observed in an inhalation (2 -ethylhexyl-L-lactate) or dermal study (ethyl-L-lactate). Subacute inhalation studies have been conducted at concentration up to 600 mg/m 3 or higher on four lactate esters (<b>ethyl,</b> <b>n-butyl,</b> isobutyl, and 2 -ethylhexyl-L-lactate). Degenerative and regenerative changes in the nasal cavity were noted in all studies. The NOAEL in <b>ethyl,</b> <b>n-butyl,</b> and isobutyl-L-lactate vapor studies was 200 mg/m 3. For aerosol exposure, 2 -ethylhexyl-L-lactate, the most toxic of the lactates, minimal damage to the nasal epithelium was noted at 75 mg/m 3 with vapor being slightly less toxic than the aerosol. Lactates do not appear to cause systemic toxicity, except at very high concentrations (1800 mg/m 3 or higher). These systemic effects may be secondary to severe irritation seen at high doses. Sensory irritation tests suggest that a vapor exposure limit of 75 mg/m 3 (~ 15 ppm) should prevent irritation in humans and therefore an occupational exposure level for vapor of 75 mg/m 3 is recommended. However, aerosol exposure should be kept as low as possible. The low vapor pressure of the higher molecular weight esters would tend to keep vapor exposure low and the odor of lactate esters serves as a warning of exposure.

Density functional theory (with B 3 LYP functional and 6 - 31 G * basis set) was used to study [4 + 2] and [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions on the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces. Diels-Alder (DA) dimers of ethyl acrylate [6 -ethoxy- 2 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-pyran (EDP) ] and of n-butyl acrylate [6 -butoxy- 2 -butoxycarbonyl- 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 H-pyran (BDP) ] were found to form on the singlet surface via the concerted pathway proposed by Mayo. The formation of diethyl cyclobutane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DECD) and dibutyl cyclobutane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DBCD) via a nonconcerted pathway was identified on the singlet surface of <b>ethyl</b> and <b>n-butyl</b> acrylate, respectively.

40|$|The auto-initiated high {{temperature}} acrylate polymerization represents a versatile route for {{the synthesis of}} macromonomer building blocks. Various macromonomers were synthesized via this route based on methyl, <b>ethyl,</b> <b>n-butyl,</b> t-butyl, 2 -ethylhexyl, isobornyl and 2 -[[(butylamino) carbonyl]oxy]ethyl acrylate. The synthesis requires a temperature of 140 °C and is carried out in a 5 wt. -% solution of hexyl acetate. The macromonomer library is fully characterized via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The amount of macromonomers containing the geminal double bond lies in between 82 and 95 %, depending on the monomer type. The achievable molecular weight of the macromonomers is located between 800 and 2 000 g·mol- 1 with a polydispersity of close to 1. 6.

Even for the difficult cases of ethyl and methylacrylate, that approach provides high polymerization yields and low polydispersity, allowing the molecular weight to be predetermined. LiOEEM/initiator molar ratio, solvent polarity, temperature and monomer concentration have proved to be key parameters in the control of the polymerization process.

Typically, attention to peripheral neuropathies resulting from exposure to envi-ronmental agents is limited relative to more commonly diag-nosed causes of peripheral neuropathy (diabetes and chemotherapeutic agents). Given that there are more than 80, 000 chemicals in commerce registered with the Environ-mental Protection Agency and that at least 1000 chemicals are known to have neurotoxic potential, very few chemicals have been established to affect the peripheral nervous system (mainly after occupational exposures). Awide spectrum of exposures, including pesticides, metals, solvents, nutritional sources, and pharmaceutical agents, has been related, both historically and recently, to environmental toxicant-induced peripheral neuropathy. A review of the literature shows that the toxicity and pathogeneses of chemicals adversely affect-ing the peripheral nervous system have been studied using animal models.

For elicitation of skin reactions, topical challenge with the compounds {{in olive oil}} or intradermal challenge with saline as the solvent was necessary. Topical challenge with the methacrylates in ethanol failed to elicit any allergic skin reactions because of their volatility. All sensitized animals responded strongly {{not only to the}} inducing methacrylate but also to the other methacrylates, showing that mutual cross-sensitivity had occurred. Since methyl methacrylate has been reported to be a potent sensitizer in humans, the guinea-pig model described here may be useful for screening products before marketing...|$|R
40|$|The {{stoichiometric}} ionization constants of N,N-dialkyl-N′-(4 -substituted benzoyl) thiourea (Substitutes: H, Cl, and Br; alkyl groups: <b>ethyl,</b> n-propyl, <b>n-butyl,</b> and phenyl) derivatives {{have been}} determined potentiometrically in dioxane-water (v:v, 50 : 50) mixture at ionic strength of 0. 1 M and 25. 0 ± 0. 1 °C. The ionization constants were calculated with the BEST computer {{program and the}} formation curves using the data obtained from the potentiometric titrations. The effects of substituents and alkyl groups on the ionization constants of the benzoyl thiourea derivatives have been investigated. A comparison of the basicities of <b>ethyl,</b> n-propyl, and <b>n-butyl</b> thiourea derivatives (−C 2 H 5 <−C 3 H 7 <−C 4 H 9) shows that the n-butyl group is a more powerful electron-releasing group than the other groups in 50 % dioxane- 50 % water mixture (v:v). So, the acidity of benzoyl thiourea derivative compounds decreases, while the length of alkyl chain increases. The orders of pKa values for all thiourea derivatives are as expected {{in the light of}} steric, resonance and inductive effects of substituents. Furthermore, when the basicities of halogen derivatives of the same substitution pattern are compared, orders obtained (4 -Br < 4 -Cl < 4 -H) can be explained by considering the total electronic substituent effect (electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects) except the 4 -Br_Ph derivative...|$|R

40|$|Poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) {{microspheres}} containing aclarubicin hydrochloride {{were prepared}} by a solvent-evaporation process. The release {{rates of the}} drug from the microspheres were significantly increased by incorporating <b>ethyl</b> or <b>n-butyl</b> esters of fatty acids. In order to clarify the effects of fatty acid esters on drug release, the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of microspheres, contents of fatty acid esters in microspheres and other factors were investigated. Powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry indicated no significant differences due to incorporation of the esters in the microspheres. The contents of fatty acid esters in the microspheres and the solubility of aclarubicin hydrochloride in the fatty acid esters greatly affected the release rate of the drug from the microspheres...|$|R

In this study we {{investigated}} the multi-stage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of N-terminally acetylated di-, tri- and tetrapeptides {{in the form of}} C-terminal <b>ethyl,</b> n-propyl, isopropyl, <b>n-butyl</b> and tert-butyl esters and cationized by the attachment of Li(+), Na(+) and Ag(+). While methyl ester versions of the metal cationized peptides primarily eliminate H(2) O following collisional activation and dissociation, the ethyl, propyl and butyl ester versions of the peptides exhibit a dissociation pathway consistent with gamma-hydrogen transfer to the C-terminal carbonyl group, with associated elimination of an alkene, in a McLafferty-type rearrangement. The rearrangement leaves a metal cationized, free-acid form of the peptide, as confirmed by comparing the multi-stage CID of rearrangement products generated from peptide esters with the CID of corresponding metal cationized free-acid peptides. The transfer of a gamma-hydrogen in the rearrangement reaction was confirmed by investigating the CID of ethyl esters for which the terminal methyl group was labeled with deuterium. We found that the rearrangement product was significantly more abundant, relative to other product ions, when derived from isopropyl and tert-butyl esters than from <b>ethyl,</b> n-propyl or <b>n-butyl</b> ester analogues. peer reviewe...|$|R
