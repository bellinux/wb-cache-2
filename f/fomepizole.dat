5000|$|Concurrent {{use with}} ethanol is {{contraindicated}} because <b>fomepizole</b> {{is known to}} prolong the half-life of ethanol. Extending the half-life of ethanol may increase and extend the intoxicating effects of ethanol, allowing for greater (potentially dangerous) levels of intoxication at lower doses. <b>Fomepizole</b> slows the production of acetaldehyde by inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase, which in turn allows more time to further convert acetaldehyde into acetic acid (vinegar) by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. The result is a patient with a prolonged and deeper level of intoxication for any given dose of ethanol, and reduced [...] "hangover" [...] symptoms (since these adverse symptoms are largely mediated by acetaldehyde build up). In a chronic alcoholic who has built up a tolerance to ethanol, this removes some of the disincentives to ethanol consumption ("negative reinforcement") while allowing them to become intoxicated with a lower dose of ethanol. The danger is that the alcoholic will then overdose on ethanol (possibly fatally). If alcoholics instead very carefully reduce their doses to reflect the now slower metabolism, they may get the [...] "rewarding" [...] stimulus of intoxication at lower doses with less adverse [...] "hangover" [...] effects - leading potentially to increased psychological dependency. However, these lower doses may therefore produce less chronic toxicity and provide a harm minimization approach to chronic alcoholism. It is, in essence, the antithesis of a disulfiram approach which tries to increase the buildup of acetaldehyde resulting in positive punishment for the patient (needless to say compliance / adherence is a substantial problem in disulfiram-based approaches). Disulfiram also has a considerably longer half-life than that of <b>fomepizole,</b> requiring the person to not drink ethanol {{in order to avoid}} severe effects. If the person is not adequately managed on a benzodiazepine, barbiturate, acamprosate, or another GABAA receptor agonist, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome (known as delerium tremens [...] "DT") may occur; disulfiram treatment should never be initiated until the risk for DT has been evaluated and mitigated appropriately, but fomepazole treatment may be initiated while the DT de-titration sequence is still being calibrated based upon person's withdrawal symptoms and psychological health.|$|E
50|$|Methanol {{poisoning}} can {{be treated}} with <b>fomepizole,</b> or if unavailable, ethanol. Both drugs act to reduce the action of alcohol dehydrogenase on methanol by means of competitive inhibition. Ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, acts as a competitive inhibitor by more effectively binding and saturating the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the liver thus blocking the binding of methanol. Methanol is excreted by the kidneys without being converted into the very toxic metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid. Alcohol dehydrogenase instead enzymatically converts Ethanol to Acetylaldehyde, a much less toxic organic molecule. Additional treatment may include sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, and hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration to remove methanol and formate from the blood. Folinic acid or folic acid is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate.|$|E

50|$|About 50% {{of people}} of Northeast Asian descent have a {{dominant}} mutation in their acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, making this enzyme less effective. A similar mutation is found in about 5-10% of blond-haired blue-eyed people of Northern European descent. In these people, acetaldehyde accumulates after drinking alcohol, leading to symptoms of acetaldehyde poisoning, including the characteristic flushing of the skin and increased heart and respiration rates. Other symptoms can include severe abdominal and urinary tract cramping, hot and cold flashes, profuse sweating, and profound malaise. Individuals with deficient acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity are {{far less likely to}} become alcoholics, but seem to be at a greater risk of liver damage, alcohol-induced asthma, and contracting cancers of the oro-pharynx and esophagus due to acetaldehyde overexposure.

40|$|Although {{antidote}} development {{should proceed}} {{in an orderly}} fashion from observation, to experimental and safety studies, to clinical trials, this sequence is not always precisely followed. The development of <b>fomepizole</b> as an antidote for toxic alcohol and glycol poisoning {{is an example of how}} this may not be the case. Interest in the development of <b>fomepizole</b> was spurred in the 1960 s. Shortly thereafter studies characterized by administration to humans commenced. The potential value of <b>fomepizole</b> as an antidote for methanol poisoning was highlighted by primate experiments. Simultaneously, the utility of <b>fomepizole</b> was shown in an experimental model of ethylene glycol poisoning. Further studies on humans showed effectiveness of <b>fomepizole</b> in the treatment of disulfiram-alcohol reactions and ethylene glycol poisoning. In addition, in primate experiments, the safety of <b>fomepizole</b> was established as the subjects tolerated serum <b>fomepizole</b> concentrations over 150 times higher than therapeutic target levels. Subsequent studies have validated the efficacy of <b>fomepizole</b> in the treatment of ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings. <b>Fomepizole</b> has been found to be associated with fewer complications than the alternative alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, ethanol.

40|$|Introduction. The use and {{clinical}} {{efficacy of the}} alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor <b>fomepizole</b> is well established {{for the treatment of}} ethylene glycol and methanol poisonings in adults. Methods. A computerized search of the U. S. National Academy of medicine and EMBase databases was undertaken to identify published cases of patients treated with <b>fomepizole.</b> This search strategy identified 14 published cases related to the topic of this review: 10 due to ethylene glycol poisoning, 1 due to diethylene glycol poisoning, 1 due to butoxyethanol ingestion, and 2 due to methanol poisoning. The median age of these cases was 5. 5 years old. <b>Fomepizole</b> in glycol and glycol ether poisoning. For the 10 ethylene glycol poisoned patients, the median recorded values of their arterial pH was 7. 27 (range 7. 03 – 7. 38), serum bicarbonate concentration was 13 mEq/L (range 2 – 25), and ethylene glycol concentration was 2, 140 mg/L (range 130 – 3, 840). Eight of these patients were not hemodialyzed. The eight patients who were not hemodialyzed had ethylene glycol concentrations as high as 3, 500 mg/L and serum bicarbonate concentrations as low as 4 mEq/L. All 10 patients had resolution of their metabolic acidosis and recovered without sequelae. The half-times of ethylene glycol elimination ranged from 9 to 15 h during <b>fomepizole</b> therapy, which is faster than the 19. 7 h reported in adults. The two patients who ingested diethylene glycol or butoxyethanol all recovered without sequelae. The patient who ingested the butoxyethanol had a serum bicarbonate concentration of 13 mEq/L and was not hemodialyzed. <b>Fomepizole</b> in methanol poisoning. One of the two children who ingested methanol was hemodialyzed. Both cases had a similar degree of severity. Does <b>fomepizole</b> obviate the need for hemodialysis? Based on the experience reviewed herein it appears that, as in adults, hemodialysis may not be necessary in most cases of pediatric ethylene glycol poisoning if treated with <b>fomepizole.</b> <b>Fomepizole</b> pharmacokinetics. Plasma <b>fomepizole</b> concentrations were measured in three cases and were found to be therapeutic with apparent Michaelis–Menton kinetics, having a zero-order elimination rate of 0. 6 – 1 mg/L/h at higher concentrations and a first-order elimination with an apparent elimination half-time of 3. 9 h at lower concentrations. <b>Fomepizole</b> regimen. Most cases used the current U. S. -approved regimen. Adverse effects of <b>fomepizole.</b> The one adverse effect reported during <b>fomepizole</b> therapy was transient nystagmus in a 6 -year-old with a serum ethylene glycol concentration of 130 mg/L and a serum bicarbonate concentration of 2 mEq/L; it is likely that ethylene glycol itself was the cause. Comparison of <b>fomepizole</b> with ethanol therapy. Two cases were originally treated with ethanol but switched to <b>fomepizole</b> because of adverse effects. In both cases, the adverse reactions to ethanol resolved once <b>fomepizole</b> treatment was initiated. Conclusions. The limited data available suggest that <b>fomepizole,</b> using the same dosage regimen as that used for adults, is efficacious and well tolerated in pediatric patients. In many cases of pediatric ethylene glycol poisoning treated with <b>fomepizole,</b> hemodialysis may not be necessary despite high concentrations and the presence of metabolic acidosis...|$|E

Although no study has compared its efficacy with ethanol, <b>fomepizole</b> is recommended as a first-line antidote. Treatment should be started as soon as possible, based on history and initial findings including anion gap metabolic acidosis, while awaiting measurement of alcohol concentration. Administration is easy (15 mg/kg-loading dose, either intravenously or orally, independent of alcohol concentration, followed by intermittent 10 mg/kg-doses every 12 hours until alcohol concentrations are &lt; 30 mg/dl). There {{is no need to}} monitor <b>fomepizole</b> concentrations. Administered early, <b>fomepizole</b> prevents EG-related renal failure and methanol-related visual and neurological injuries. When administered prior to the onset of significant acidosis or organ injury, <b>fomepizole</b> may obviate the need for hemodialysis. When dialysis is indicated, 1 mg/kg/h-continuous infusion should be provided to compensate for its elimination.

Patients: All methanol-poisoned patients admitted to these ICUs and treated with <b>fomepizole</b> from 1987 - 1999 (n = 14). Measurements and results: The median plasma methanol concentration was 50 mg/dl (range 4 - 146), anion gap 22. 1 mmol/l (11. 8 - 42. 2), arterial pH 7. 34 (7. 11 - 7. 51), and bicarbonate 17. 5 mmol/l (3. 0 - 25. 0). Patients received oral or intravenous <b>fomepizole</b> until blood methanol was undetectable. The median cumulative dose was 1250 mg (500 - 6000); the median number of twice daily doses was 2 (1 - 16). Four patients underwent hemodialysis for visual impairment present on admission.
