5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E

Pavle Gregorić, {{who was a member}} of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković, but could not convince him to do so. On the same day, Maček, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post-Yugoslav coup d'état government of Dušan Simović, agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> his appeal.|$|E

5|$|Hoste also {{remained}} at sea, cruising in the battered Amphion beyond {{the range of}} the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of Flore's officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of Flore had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. Flore had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.|$|E

5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped the mob against the Muslim {{community}} {{on the day of}} massacre. Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped the mob, resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided the mob of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
5|$|Major nest predators include Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbirds (Cracticus spp.), {{laughing}} kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) {{as well as}} introduced mammals such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), cat {{and black}} rat (Rattus rattus). Superb fairywrens may utilise a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. A field study in Canberra found that superb fairywrens that lived in areas frequented by noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala) recognised miner alarm calls and took flight, and had learnt to ignore their non-alarm calls, while those that live in areas not frequented by noisy miners <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> miner alarm calls. This suggests the species has adapted and learned to discriminate and respond to another species' vocalisations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> his control column.

Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still did not respond. Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E

5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were in {{negotiations}} with the Liberty Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl. Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce Van De Velde and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1, the Liberty Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite. After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, the Liberty Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3). The Liberty Bowl <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> The Times' request for comment on the situation. Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense.|$|E
5|$|When the {{campaign}} {{came to an}} end, the battalion returned to Salisbury. Guest then travelled to England and sought a commission, joining the South Lancashire Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant in September 1916. He was later promoted to Captain. He went with his battalion to France where they were posted to the 59th Division, then in the line. The sector they occupied was not very active, but shelling and sniping from both sides were carried out fairly regularly. It {{was not long before}} Guest was wounded, and then he fell victim to an irritating and persistent skin complaint which was common in the trenches and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> treatment.

5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered too sweet. Fidler says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based themselves with a regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not insure {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only be out for seven to eight weeks, his knee <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both {{during and after the}} two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E

5|$|The {{money was}} used to {{complete}} the line to Nantwich, and to build a reservoir at Bunbury Heath. The work was completed in August 1779, and the company hoped to raise enough money to then build the line to Middlewich. They proposed building it with narrow locks, to reduce the cost, but the shareholders were not prepared to support them; instead they concentrated on trying to generate traffic on the line that had been built. They attempted to mine salt at Nantwich, but failed to find any, and tried running boats on the Trent and Mersey, from which goods were carried over land to Nantwich, for onward carriage to Liverpool. They also ran boats for cargo and passengers on the canal itself. By the end of 1781, the company had no money {{and was unable to}} meet interest payments on the loans. They decided to forfeit the canal to Egerton, the main mortgagee, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> their offer. Angry landowners who had not been paid drained Bunbury reservoir in March 1782, but somehow the committee managed to keep the canal open, by selling boats and land. Disaster struck in November 1787, when Beeston Staircase Locks collapsed, and there was no money to fund repairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{new arrival}} was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a lone patrol: the frigate HMS Thames under Captain James Cotes. Thames {{was an old}} frigate, built in 1758 and {{carrying}} 32 12-pounder guns. The ship was below its standard complement of 215 men, sailing with only 184, which meant that the 6-pounder guns that augmented the main battery could not be manned. By comparison, Uranie {{was five years old}} and carried 40 18-pounder guns and weighing almost double the weight of the British ship. Her full complement was of 260 men, but she lacked 60 of her sailors, dispatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was burdened with over 260 prisoners. At first unsure of the identity of the ship to the north, Tartu hoisted a blue flag as an identification signal and sent the Alcoudia away in case the ship should be revealed to be hostile. Cotes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the signal, and the two ships were soon hidden from one another by a rain squall.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite telecommunication network was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E
