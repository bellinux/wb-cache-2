5|$|At this time, C Flight arrived. As it dipped {{down through}} the {{overcast}} toward the dogfight, Gardiner and Taylor went astray. Maybery was attacked by a green Pfalz D.III. Hoidge's counterattack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> the falling Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Knott left Congress {{and made}} a {{successful}} run for governor. He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky and helped organized the college's law school in 1894. He served as dean {{of the law school}} until an illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died at his home in Lebanon, Kentucky on June 18, 1911.|$|E

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> a {{unification}} {{of the fundamental}} forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{was again}} chosen {{to serve on}} the Governor's Council in 1810 and 1811. In 1811, President James Madison offered him a {{position}} as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, but he declined on account of failing eyesight. Lincoln retired to his Worcester estate, where he took an active interest in farming; <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> scientific interests related to agriculture were widely recognized, and he served as the first president of the Worcester Agricultural Society, founded in 1818.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has been explored widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> knowledge beyond human bounds and {{for creating the}} deception of the Trojan horse.|$|E

5|$|The six {{judges of}} the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled {{unanimously}} that all {{issues raised by}} Abu-Jamal, including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, were without merit. The Supreme Court of the United States denied a petition for certiorari against that decision on October 4, 1999, enabling Ridge to sign a second death warrant on October 13, 1999. Its execution in turn was stayed as Abu-Jamal commenced <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> federal habeas corpus review.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his life, Payton {{had claimed}} his {{date of birth}} as July 25, 1954, a date which is cited in many of his early biographies. However, while researching his {{biography}} of Payton, Sports Illustrateds Jeff Pearlman discovered his actual date of birth to be July 25, 1953.

5|$|Walt Patterson, {{who acted}} as series adviser, {{was a leading}} {{commentator}} on nuclear affairs, {{best known for his}} book Nuclear Power (Penguin, 1976–1986). Following Edge of Darkness, he acted as specialist adviser to the British House of Commons Select Committee on Environment for their 1986 study, Radioactive Waste. He continues to contribute to the policy debate about energy and environmental issues. Advice on the policing aspects of the serial was provided by the West Yorkshire Police and former Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper, famous for <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> the train robber Ronnie Biggs.|$|E
5|$|Wishing to {{emphasize}} his piety and {{role as the}} leader of the Muslim community, Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) in particular was the most energetic of the early Abbasid rulers in <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> warfare against Byzantium: he established his seat at Raqqa close to the frontier, he complemented the thughur in 786 by forming a second defensive line along northern Syria, the al-'Awasim, and was reputed to be spending alternating years leading the Hajj and leading a campaign into Anatolia, including the largest expedition assembled under the Abbasids, in 806.|$|E

500|$|Moreau and Jourdan faced similar difficulties. Jourdan {{continued}} in <b>his</b> single-minded <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> Wartensleben, and Moreau continued <b>his</b> single-minded <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> Charles, and Moreau in particular penetrated deep into Bavaria. The French armies drew {{further and further}} away from the Rhine, and from each other. Napoleon later wrote of Moreau's actions, [...] "One {{would have said that}} he was ignorant that a French army existed on his left". Historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge asserted that the combined army [...] "could have crushed the Austrians".|$|R
5|$|Early in 1523 Anne was {{secretly}} betrothed to Henry Percy, {{son of the}} 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle. In February/March 1526, Henry VIII began <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, which her sister Mary had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he {{would be free to}} marry Anne. When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the breaking of the Catholic Church's power in England began. In 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|In 1467, {{as part of}} his brother's {{plan for}} a closer {{relationship}} with the French, John and Isabelle accompanied Warwick in escorting the French King's envoys to Canterbury. However, by this time, it was being rumoured that Warwick was moving towards supporting the House of Lancaster, as a result of dissatisfaction over the king's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville and <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> an anti-French foreign policy. In 1469, Warwick organised Robin of Redesdale's rebellion against Edward IV in Yorkshire and in July that year the king's brother George, Duke of Clarence married Warwick's daughter Isabelle whilst anchored off Calais; this was in direct defiance of the king's own wishes. It seems that Montagu, however, reacted strongly against his brother's machinations, and, unlike him, was satisfied with his current position.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{published}} on October 10, 1995, by Vintage Books. It was the first book compiled by Spin. Having edited their book, Weisbard put <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from the magazine, which {{marked the beginning of}} his career as a rock critic. Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E

However, there are not enough pieces to complete her, and so she ends up reverting to a 13-year-old girl. Finn, who is also 13, is excited, but the Ice King temporarily gives up <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> Bubblegum due to her age. As the episode ends, it is revealed that the Lich has once again possessed the body of the snail, who angrily waves goodbye to the camera.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> information {{on the fate of}} Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as a writer for the Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied with what he had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Tisiphone and Daemon cast another {{illusion}} to deceive Kratos, who overcomes it and retrieves the Oath Stone of Orkos. He encounters the Scribe of Hecatonchires, who reveals that the Furies were originally fair in their punishment, but devolved into ruthless beings because of Ares. Continuing <b>his</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> the Furies, Kratos reaches the door to Alecto's Chamber, but seemingly returns home {{to his wife and}} daughter: another illusion, this time cast by the Fury Queen Alecto. She tries to convince Kratos he can live within this illusion if he rejoins Ares, but he refuses. Enraged, Alecto and Tisiphone attack Kratos, who retrieves the eyes, and Alecto transforms into a giant sea monster. After a brutal battle, Kratos uses the eyes to break through the Furies' illusions before killing them both, which destroys the prison.|$|E
