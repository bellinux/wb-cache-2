40|$|A {{method of}} {{analysis}} of discrete communication <b>feedback</b> <b>systems</b> with noisy forward and feedback channels is given. The method uses the state transition graphs introduced by S. S. L. Chang {{and is based on}} a division of transmissions into four types. The method is developed for the discrete system in which the auxiliary decision about stopping or continuing the transmission of a message is binary, but it can be extended for the case when such decisions can take more than two forms. It permits a uniform analysis, under quite general assumptions, of both <b>decision</b> and information <b>feedback</b> <b>systems.</b> However in general {{it may be necessary to}} resort to numerical calculations. To illustrate the method a special case of stationary systems with independent transmission of messages and auxiliary decisions is considered.

40|$|Single {{carrier block}} {{transmission}} (SCBT) system {{has become one}} of the most popular modulation systems due to its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), and it is gradually considered to be used for uplink wireless communication systems. In this paper, a low complexity partial parallel interference cancellation (PIC) with maximum ratio combining (MRC) technology is proposed to use for receiver to combat the intersymbol interference (ISI) problem over multipath fading channel. With the aid of MRC scheme, the proposed partial PIC technique can effectively perform the interference cancellation and acquire the benefit of time diversity gain. Finally, the proposed system can be extended to use for multiple antenna systems to provide excellent performance. Simulation results reveal that the proposed low complexity partial PIC-MRC SIMO system can provide robust performance and outperform the conventional PIC and the iterative frequency domain <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> equalizer (FD-DFE) <b>systems</b> over multipath fading channel environment...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{communications}} and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems are important topics in current research that will play key {{roles in the}} future of wireless networks and standards. In this thesis, the various challenges in accurately detecting and estimating data signals and allocating resources in the cooperative systems are investigated. Firstly, we propose a cross-layer design strategy that consists of a cooperative maximum likelihood (ML) detector operating in conjunction with link selection for a cooperative MIMO network. Two new link selection schemes are proposed, along with an iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme that utilises channel coding techniques. Simulation results show the performance and potential gains of the proposed schemes. Secondly, a successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector is proposed for a MIMO system that has dynamic ordering based on a reliability ordering (RO), and an alternative multiple feedback (MF) candidate cancellation method. The complexity of these schemes is analysed and a hard <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> IDD <b>system</b> is also proposed. Results show that the proposed detector can give gains over existing schemes for a minimal amount of extra complexity. Lastly, a detector is proposed that is based upon the method of widely linear (WL) filtering and a multiple branch (MB) SIC, for an overloaded, multi-user cooperative MIMO system. The use of WL methods is explained, and a new method of choosing cancellation branches for an MB detector is proposed with an analysis of the complexity required. A list-based IDD system is developed, and simulation results show that the proposed detector can operate in an overloaded system and provide improved performance gains...|$|R

40|$|We derive {{an optimal}} {{nonlinear}} quantizer {{to be used}} as a decision function in a <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> structure. The criterion used to determine the quantizer characteristic is the degree to which the propagation of decision errors is sup pressed. We show that a soft saturation nonlinearity can outperform the standard nearest neighbor quantizer in a <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> equalizer structure in terms of error propagation suppression. This implies that on channels where noise is impulsive a soft saturation quantizer <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> structure is superior to a conventional <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> structure on a broad class of channels.

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{noncoherent}} <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> multiuser detection for nonorthogonal binary modulation is developed that parallels that of coherent <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> multiuser detection for single-pulse modulation. In particular, an optimum noncoherent <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> detector is obtained that maximizes symmetric energy over a newly defined class of <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> detectors. Unlike the usual per-user performance metrics such as asymptotic efficiency or near–far resistance, the symmetric energy measure captures, {{with a single}} number, the asymptotic (high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) bit-error performance of all users at once. Several properties of the optimum <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> detector are established, {{one of which is}} that it outperforms the <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> generalized-likelihood ratio (GLR) detector in symmetric energy. It is also shown that, regardless of the order in which users are detected, the optimum noncoherent <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> detector outperforms its non-decision feedback counterpart in symmetric energy. Furthermore, two simple rules are obtained for determining the order in which users must be detected to guarantee that the optimum <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> detector outperforms its non-decision feedback counterpart (which in turn, is superior to the decorrelative GLR detector presented earlier) in terms of asymptotic effective energy for every user. In fact, one of the two (greedy) ordering rules also maximizes symmetric energy among all possible orderings. Such ordering rules are not available for the noncoherent <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> GLR detector in earlier work of the authors. Feasible sets of received energies are characterized in which it is possible, with power control, to achieve quality-of-service objectives for each user. None of the results in this paper make simplifying assumptions about the effects of error propagation. The term “noncoherent ” in this work is used to denote that the receiver has no knowledge of the carrier phases and received signal energies of any of the users...|$|R

In that work, {{the idea of}} noncoherent decorrelation for NMM was introduced and post-decorrelative detectors were derived and analyzed. In this paper, we introduce the concept of noncoherent <b>decision</b> <b>feedback</b> that forms the basis for another set of solutions to the same problem.
