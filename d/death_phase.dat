5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the <b>death</b> <b>phase</b> where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

Birth is the first phase of main “transition periods” in human life; birth, marriage and <b>death</b> <b>phases.</b> Because of this it is a subject that not only medical sciences but also folklore and medical anthropology which is a branch of anthropology deals with. In fact, human birth occurs before the development of human brain – due to big size of head – does not complete its growth and baby human is helpless as he or she alone cannot survive during the birth. This situation increases the effect of cultural quality in baby care. Thus, birth and engaged traditions largely give clues about view of life of society and attitude towards women (Dictionary of Anthropology, 2003 : 237).

The morphology of the ER has been studied in paramecia in different physiological conditions. Cells are analysed in early and late logarithmic growth phases, in stationary and in <b>death</b> <b>phases,</b> during shift-up by refeeding after starvation and shift-down by using a starvation medium. In log-phase growing paramecia, the ER constitutes an anastomosing membrane system consisting of short tubules and flattened sacs forming a peripheral network, which is abundant in the cortical region around the trichocysts and the ciliary basal bodies. The tubular network and cytoplasmic membranes are reduced in stationary-phase cells; the original conditions are restored in starved cells after refeeding. The analysis of serial optical sections collected by CLSM at 0. 5 mu m intervals and three-dimensional reconstruction from these sections allow us to visualize differences between differently growing cells.

To address this, we used the rd 1 mouse model for retinal neurodegeneration, characterized by phosphodiesterase- 6 (PDE 6) dysfunction and photoreceptor death triggered by high cyclic guanosinemono-phosphate (cGMP) levels. Using cellular data on cGMP accumulation, cell death, and survival, we created mathematical models to simulate the temporal development of the degeneration. We validated model predictions using organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type animals and exposed to the selective PDE 6 inhibitor zaprinast.

Although some minor variation existed in levels of urease activity, ability to utilize xylose, and formation of N 2 gas from NO 3, all 15 isolates were rather similar and believed to represent a single species. These eubacteria exhibited aminopeptidase activity and became viscous when treated with KOH, similar to gram-negative organisms; however, the absence of lipopolysaccharide and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate in cell walls indicated that they are truly gram-positive organisms. They are unusual because peptidoglycan could not be detected during most of their growth cycle.

Growth curves and specific nitrogenase activity at pH 4. 2 were closely similar to those for cultures at pH 5. 7 (standard condition), whereas no growth occurred at pH 2. 5.

For fulfilling the objectives two experiments were devised and executed. In the first experiment two microalgal species, the flagellate tsochrysis galbana and the diatom Chaetoceros sp. were maintained as 250 ml cultures and their growth and bacterial diversity was measured. In the second experiment, the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii was added in lO* CFU/ml concentrations either as a single addition (Treatment SA) or as a daily addition (Treatment DA) to Chaetoceros species, culture. All treatments were made in triplicate and a control without addition of probiotic was maintained. The algal cell density in the culture flasks was taken daily and the total aerobic flora (on SWA), total vibrios (on TCBS) and total yeasts (on Sabouraud agar) were assessed on specific days. Results indicated that the experimental cultures showed all the typical phases of microalgal growth ie, lag, log, declining, stationary and <b>death</b> <b>phases.</b> The study shows that if microalgal cultures are used when they are In the log and stationary phase rather than in the declining phase, the amount of bacteria added to the larval culture medium can reduced by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude.

The experiments were conducted under controlled pH and temperature of 5. 5 and 42 oC, respectively.

The use of nutrients at low concentrations significantly decreased the lag period whereas lactic acid inhibition was observed when both nutrients were added at concentrations above 10 g/L. The results from this study showed that yeast extract was superior to Lactamine AA in its influence (improved yield and conversion efficiency) when used as nutrient during batch fermentation experiments of lactic acid production from cheese whey.

40|$|Foods {{containing}} {{large amounts}} of carbohydrate have frequently been involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. Custard has been {{considered to be a}} highly favorable culture medium for staphylococci; however, it may be a selective medium rather than an ideal one. The influence of dextrose, lactose, and sucrose in varying amounts from 0. 25 to 18 %, and of starch, on the growth of staphylococci in mixed populations with saprophytes was determined. The inhibitory effect of the sugars was much greater on the saprophyte population than on the staphylococci. Of the three sugars, sucrose was most inhibitory to the saprophytes. It greatly decreased their lag periods as the concentration of sugar increased. Dextrose was the least inhibitory; in fact, 0. 5 % dextrose gave considerable stimulus to saprophyte growth. This sharply repressed staphylococcal growth. Lactose occupied an intermediate position. Rapid onset of the <b>death</b> <b>phase</b> of the staphylococci was observed in all increased sugar concentrations and seemed to be a pH effect rather than a result of competition. Sucrose exerted an inhibitory effect on the growth of saprophytes at and above room temperature.
