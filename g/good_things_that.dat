25|$|The {{change of}} regime in 1989 {{brought a new}} situation, and bands now revolted against {{corruption}} and the Americanization of the country. They felt that the new system retained the bad things from the previous one, but lacked that <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> many expected. In lyrics, they often mention the newly appearing organized crime, and the still low standard of living.|$|E

25|$|For we {{all agree}} that the most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of <b>good</b> <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E
500|$|Navy {{athletic}} director Chet Gladchuk stated that Maryland's snub {{was the basis}} for their rejection of Maryland offers to renew the series in 2010: [...] "The stage was set for everything we had talked about, and all the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> could have happened for fans—a big rematch, a bowl setting, a great city ... It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship." [...] Ralph Friedgen responded by saying [...] "He's gotta get over it," [...] and that the Navy rivalry never entered into the decision-making process.|$|E
500|$|Genesis of the Daleks also {{displays}} {{a battle between}} good and evil. Letts enjoyed {{the fact that the}} story did not have clear heroes and villains, but rather a conflict of principle. The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this. Hinchcliffe described it as the [...] "hero meets antihero" [...] moment, with the two engaged in [...] "intellectual grappling". The episode also presents the [...] "moral dilemma" [...] of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks, resulting in the famous [...] "Have I the right?" [...] scene. The Doctor's comparison to knowingly killing a child who would {{grow up to be a}} dictator shows how the Doctor's ethics are influenced by his non-linear experience of time. (The Twelfth Doctor would again revisit this theme in the 2015 episodes [...] "The Magician's Apprentice" [...] and [...] "The Witch's Familiar".) He considers the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> may come out of the Daleks, such as that [...] "many future worlds would become allies". The Doctor's conclusion that he does not have the right is an example of utilitarian reasoning, and a [...] "duty-based ethical" [...] position. Sladen recalled that Baker took the scene very seriously, almost [...] "agonising" [...] over the dialogue.|$|E

500|$|Debbie Chang of BuddyTV.com {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the shows' development throughout the season, by stating it was [...] "all about couples, jumping {{in and out}} of relationships, trying their darnedest to have hot sex on the cramped, twin-sized bunk-beds in the on-call room". Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber, and the lack of romantic development in their storylines. Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George. Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn’t seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I’m maybe a little too black and white about it. I don’t really know Izzie very well right now. She’s changed a lot." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic" [...] in its fourth season. She also said that [...] "this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [...] However, the episode [...] "Physical Attraction, Chemical Reaction" [...] received a positive review, with Burrows stating that it [...] "fully encompassed all the things that make this show great: intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities". The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> show's had going for it anymore." [...] Entertainment Weekly called Reaser's performance as Ava the sixth most memorable patient performance on the show. About.com stated that Alex Karev developed into [...] "a bold and overly confident surgeon".|$|E
2500|$|Drange's {{argument}} is directed primarily to Christians, and the philosopher Laura Garcia has replied from that perspective. She says that Drange's argument {{hinges on the}} idea that belief in God's existence is, according to Christians, necessary for salvation. According to Garcia this idea is mistaken: [...] "many Christians deny this claim and the Catholic Church explicitly rejects it." [...] But as Garcia notes, Drange has answered that for many Christians—in particular, evangelical Christians—his point should remain convincing, and that there are in any case other <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> belief in God can bring for humans, which a good God would desire, such as peace of mind and a sense of meaning in life.|$|E
2500|$|Non enim pro locis res, sed pro bonis rebus loca amanda sunt – [...] "Things {{are not to}} {{be loved}} {{for the sake of a}} place, but places are to be loved for the sake of their good things." [...] When Augustine asked whether to use Roman or Gallican customs in the mass in England, Gregory said, in paraphrase, that it was not the place that {{imparted}} goodness but <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> graced the place, and it was more important to be pleasing to the Almighty. They should pick out what was [...] "pia", [...] "religiosa" [...] and [...] "recta" [...] from any church whatever and set that down before the English minds as practice.|$|E

2500|$|The song's message {{recalls that}} of Dylan's September 1965 single [...] "Positively 4th Street", as Harrison {{appears to be}} ending a relationship, {{possibly}} with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: [...] "I've got {{a word or two}} to say about the things that you do." [...] Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "a withering attack" [...] in which [...] "Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [...] could be spoken by the same voice." [...] Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to [...] "opaque" [...] minds and in the line [...] "the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> we can have if we close our eyes".|$|E
2500|$|As a {{television}} actor, Scourby had roles on Playhouse 90, Circle Theatre, and Studio One. He refused to tie himself {{down to a}} series, because, as he explained, [...] "it's hard to do <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] He took occasional parts in westerns such as , Bonanza, and The Rifleman, as well as Mr. Novak, Daniel Boone, The Asphalt Jungle, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Defenders, and other set-format dramatic shows. Most of the filmed shows were produced in California. In 1972, he joined his wife, Lori March, on The Secret Storm, on which he played Dr. Ian Northcoate #2 opposite his real-life wife Lori March (as Valerie Lake Ames Northcoate), until that show was cancelled in 1974. He later played Nigel Fargate on All My Children [...] In the Twilight Zone episode, The Last Flight he played General Harper.|$|E
2500|$|The Quran {{associates}} Jews with {{rejection of}} God's prophets including Jesus and Muhammad, thus explaining their resistance to him personally. (Cf. Surah 2:87–91; 5:59, 61, 70, and 82.) It also asserts that Jews {{believe that they}} are the sole children of God (Surah 5:18), and that only they will achieve salvation (Surah 2:111). According to the Quran, Jews blasphemously claim that Ezra is the son of God, as Christians claim Jesus is, (Surah 9:30) and that God's hand is fettered (Surah 5:64 – i.e., that they can freely defy God). Some of those who are Jews, [...] "pervert words from their meanings", (Surah 4:44), and because they have committed wrongdoing, God has [...] "forbidden some <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were previously permitted them", thus explaining Jewish commandments regarding food, Sabbath restrictions on work, and other rulings as a punishment from God (Surah 4:160). They listen for the sake of mendacity (Surah 5:41), twisting the truth, and practice forbidden usury, and therefore they will receive [...] "a painful doom" [...] (Surah 4:161). The Quran gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, [...] "... but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers"(Surah 3:54). In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the supposed Jewish plots against him ended in complete failure. In numerous verses (Surah 3:63, 71; 4:46, 160–161; 5:41–44, 63–64, 82; 6:92) the Quran accuses Jews of deliberately obscuring and perverting scripture.|$|E
