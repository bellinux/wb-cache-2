40|$|Hydrologic {{simulation}} strongly {{depends on}} the precision of underlay ground data and <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> meteorological data. Hydrologic simulation of ungauged/spare gauged area now is a hot topic and many investigations have been conducted. W. Lahmer et al suggested transplant <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> meteorological data from adequate gauged basin to ungauged area that those <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> meteorological characters are similar. W. Lahmer investigated the effect of uncertainty of <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> meteorological input on the macro - scale hydrologic simulation and {{the results showed that}} the <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> meteorological input data were vital factors in hydrological simulation. G. W. Kite and U. Haberlandt used the outputs of GCM as meteorological input to macro - scale hydrological simulation. Sten Bergstroom and L. Phil Graham used a distributed hydrologic model to analyze the long - term time series runoff in Baltic basin based on the variable parameters, and the simulated results showed that the value of the parameters of the macro - scale hydrological simulation is relatively stable. Z. Micovic, M. C. Quick used the UBC hydrologic model simulated the snowmelt and rainfall runoff in ungauged area. Gupta investigated the event floods in macro - scale basin. Many works have been carried out related to the scale problem. Sivapalan and Wood analyzed the scale effect of hydrologic. Yet the hydrologic simulation of macro - scale ungauged area event flood is reported very little. The source regions of the Yellow River (the areas above Tangnaihai hydrologic station) with the area of 122 thousand km(2) still lack adequate <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> meteorological data because of the unwelcome nature conditions. The multi - annual mean runoff of the source regions of the Yellow river is 20. 400 billion m(3), which accounts for 35. 3 % of that Yellow River. The study regions are important runoff generation area of the Yellow River, in the 1990 s, the Yellow River had experienced a serious runoff corrupt but the annual rainfall of the area didn't change significant. In this study, WMS (Watershed Model System) was chosen and HEC - 1 hydrologic model installed in the WMS was selected as to simulate 11 flood events. The study area was divided into 6 subbasins and the physical parameters of the subbasins were retrived from DEM (Digital Elevation Model). In every subbaisn the initial CNs (Curve Number) of SCS were assigned by land cover and soil type. For each simulation, the auto parameter optimization tool installed in WMS 7. 0 were used to calibrate the hydrologic model and for each subbasin and floods a CN retrieved. The uncertainty of CN was investigated into. The relative error of CN is linear with the mathematical expect experiential frequency...|$|R

40|$|Lagos is the world’s sixth largest city, {{the most}} populous city in Africa and {{the most populous}} city inNigeria. A total of {{eighteen}} groundwater exploitation borehole logs together with hydrogeological and geotechnical data {{were used for the}} study. The eighteen available borehole logs were categorized into seven areas spanning the shoreline to inland boundary ofLagosState. The study area has a high net recharge of 1838 mm/yr and the aquifer media is sand. The intrinsic vul nerability map show areas of highest potential for groundwater pollution based on <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> geological condition and hu man impacts. Seven major <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> geological factors incorporated into DRASTIC model and the geographic information system (GIS) were used to create a groundwater vulnerability map by overlaying the available <b>hydro</b> <b>-</b> geological data. The output map shows that the southeast of the aquifer is under very high vulnerability while central parts of aquifer have high vulnerability. Other parts (north, northwest and south) of the study area have moderate vulnerability to pollu tion. For testing of the vulnerability assessment, groundwater quality data were collated from literature for the different vulnerability zones of the study area. The chemical analysis results show that both the southeast and northwest west parts of study area aquifer (very high and moderate vulnerability zones) have higher nitrate concentration relative to the rest of aquifer, that are located in high vulnerability zone. The validation of the DRASTIC models was accomplished through pair wise comparison of DRASTIC vulnerability maps (using Pearson’s r correlation coefficient) with a total of 14 layers representing original DRASTIC input data, Land cover (LC) features, and groundwater TDS, Cl - and NO 3 data. Results from the correlation analysis indicate a significant association between high groundwater TDS, NO 3 con centrations and distances from certain LC types. </p...|$|R

40|$|East Italy, in {{particular}} {{in the area of}} the Cansiglio Plateau and the Classical Karst. The tiltmeters are set in natural caves (Bus de la Genziana and Grotta Gigante) making part of two interesting karstic areas of particular <b>hydro</b> <b>–</b> geologic importance. These areas have high vulnerability. From the Friuli slopes of the karstic massif the Livenza River is born. The Classical Karst hosts the Timavo River aquifer. In the specific case of Cansiglio by means of comparison of the tilt- signal registered at the Genziana station with the pluviometrical series of Cansiglio and the hydrometric series of Livenza, local hydrologic effects have been observed and interpretations have been proposed. Putting in correlation also the GPS data of Caneva, a clear correspondence has been ascertained among the clinometric, satellite geodetic and <b>hydro</b> <b>–</b> pluvimetrical signals. The slow deformations recorded match the curves of run-off of the karstic aquifer, meanwhile one can observe also brief deformations correlable to conspicuous rain precipitations. We record hydrodynamics signals also by an analysis in the Classical Karst between Grotta Gigante pendulums and the River Timavo discharge. The purpose of research is to open a new multidisciplinary frontier between geodetic studies and studies of the karstic systems to obtain a better indirect knowledge of the underground hydric circulation and thus a more complete geologic description for a water sustainable management...|$|R
