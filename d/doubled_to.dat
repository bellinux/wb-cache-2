5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields of food that they could easily provide to the growing market.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 the {{population}} of the civil parish was 2,482. This grew gradually until 1931 when there were 4,521, before there was a steeper rise to 1951 when there were 8,277. Over the next ten years this nearly <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 15,152 in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1960, {{the student}} body at New England more than <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> over 500 {{students}} with a corresponding increase in staff and faculty, forcing the school to erect temporary, weatherboard huts to accommodate its expanded facilities and classrooms. In 1958, the university received £900,000 in government grants for facilities improvements and Madgwick presided over the planning and construction of over ten permanent buildings on the main campus, {{some of which were}} completed after Madgwick retired in 1966.|$|E

In the 1931 census of Palestine, the population had more than <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 857, of which 829 were Muslims, 26 were Christians, {{as well as two}} Jews. In that year, there were 162 houses in the village. At the end of 1940, Lajjun had 1,103 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, between July and October 1940, RAF Fighter Command at RAF Bentley Priory {{received}} air threat {{warnings that}} it filtered to remove duplication, doubt and confusion. These were then forwarded to the Operations Room at RAF Uxbridge, which allocated appropriate defence resources and passed orders on to No. 11 Group sector airfields. No. 11 Group personnel <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 20,000 between April and November 1940. The RAF officers' hospital was converted to the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) hospital early in 1940.|$|E

5|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had further <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 10,104. The {{early twentieth century}} saw a period of increased urbanization of the area; in the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built, and public services, such as electricity supplies and sewerage, were completed. The steep gradient of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath.|$|E
5|$|By comparison, in 1801 the {{population}} of England and Wales was 9million; by 1851 it had more than <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 18million, {{and by the end}} of the century had reached 40million. Today, Bangladeshis form the largest minority population in Tower Hamlets, constituting 33.5% of the borough's population at the 2001 census; the Bangladeshi community there is the largest such community in Britain. The 2006 estimates show a decline in this group to 29.8% of {{the population}}, reflecting a movement to better economic circumstances and the larger houses available in the eastern suburbs. In this, the latest group of migrants are following a pattern established for over three centuries.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1891, the Society for the {{improvement}} of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered financial incentives to encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding and Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored {{in the bottom of the}} inning when Bellhorn <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after he had walked the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 census, {{the first}} to include Dawson Creek as a defined subdivision, counted 518 residents. Its growth spurred by the {{construction}} of the Alaska Highway, the town recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents in the 1951 census. Within five years, the population <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 7,531. New transport links with southern British Columbia and Alberta spurred continued growth into the next decade. The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during {{the construction of the}} nearby town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s. Dawson Creek's population has remained relatively stable since then. Between 2005 and 2009, the population rose from 10,869 to 11,514, per provincial estimates.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! and Double Jeopardy! rounds each feature six categories, each {{of which}} {{contains}} five clues, which are ostensibly valued by difficulty. The dollar values of the clues increased over time. On the original Jeopardy! series, clue values {{in the first round}} ranged from $10 to $50. On The All-New Jeopardy!, they ranged from $25 to $125. The current series' first round originally ranged from $100 to $500, and were <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> $200 to $1,000 on November 26, 2001. On the Super Jeopardy! specials, clues were valued in points rather than in dollars, and ranged in the first round from 200 to 1,000 points.|$|E

5|$|The {{service was}} {{initially}} operated on a charter basis. Having closed {{down over the}} winter, the service was resumed as a scheduled service on 13 April 1949. During 1949, two aircraft carried 2,700 cars. By 1950 the figures had risen to 3,850 cars and 1,000 motorcycles and other vehicles with passengers totalling 15,000. In that year, a London driver offered a London-Paris taxi service. Silver City Airways had estimated that they would carry nearly 7,000 cars in 1953, but this figure was reached in 1951. The three aircraft had to be <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> six to cope. Over 13,000 vehicles were carried, with 42 return flights daily at peak times. The time between Lympne and Le Touquet was 18 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Three International Tournaments, held in 1996, 1997, and 2001, {{featured}} one-week competitions among champions {{from each}} of the international versions of Jeopardy!. Each of the countries that aired their own version of the show in those years could nominate a contestant. The format was identical to the semifinals and finals of other Jeopardy! tournaments. In 1996 and 1997, the winner received $25,000; in 2001, the top prize was <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> $50,000. The 1997 tournament was recorded in Stockholm on the set of the Swedish version of Jeopardy!, and is significant for being the first week of Jeopardy! episodes to be taped in a foreign country.|$|E
5|$|Aphilas {{introduced}} {{a number of}} different standards for all three metals, some of which lasted through to the 7th century, while the use of others ended with his reign. His new gold coins (issued in conjunction with the older) of a quarter aureus and eighth aureus were soon abandoned (each are known from only one specimen), and 1/16 aureus coins have been found, though these {{are more likely to be}} deliberate debasements to increase profit (Aksumite gold was generally very pure, however). Aphilas's silver coin, however, issued at half the weight of the former, became the new Aksumite standard for silver up until the end of coinage. The older coin was presumably more valuable than needed, and the new coin remedied the problem. Aphilas's bronze issue, however, was instead <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> 4.83grams. The coin's rarity may attest to its quick withdrawal from the market, as is assumed with his quarter-aureus. These two issues are the only one of Aphilas's issues to portray him frontally, rather than in profile.|$|E
50|$|In the 7th, Matsunaka led {{off with}} a <b>double</b> <b>to</b> left, then Johjima quickly drove him home with a <b>double</b> <b>to</b> left to cut the Tigers' lead in half, 4-2. After Fujimoto made a great diving play to save a run (but no out was recorded), Torigoe brought Johjima in anyway with a bloop single to cut Hanshin's lead to 4-3. Igawa then loaded the bases after hitting Muramatsu on the elbow with a pitch. Andoh {{was brought in to}} get the pitch-hitter, but Andoh issued a bases-loaded walk to tie the game.|$|R

5|$|Desmond Jennings {{opened the}} first inning with a single, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Wil Myers then walked, {{advanced}} to third base on singles by Ben Zobrist and Evan Longoria, and finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Delmon Young. Rays starter David Price struck out leadoff batter Ian Kinsler, then allowed a walk to Elvis Andrus but picked him off and finished the inning by retiring Alex Ríos. The score remained 1–0 until {{the top of the}} third inning, when Jennings drew a walk and scored on a home run by Longoria to give the Rays a 3–0 lead. The Rangers struck right back in the bottom half, as Craig Gentry led off the inning with a single. After advancing to second on a Leonys Martín groundout, he scored on a single to right field by Kinsler. The Rays scored again in the sixth, as Longoria <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> lead off the inning, and advanced to third base on a groundout by Young. The next batter, David DeJesus, hit a double to right field that scored Longoria and put the Rays ahead, 4–1. Rangers reliever Alexi Ogando entered the game with one out and recorded the final two outs to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{single-track}} Queens Super Express Bypass for the IND Queens Boulevard Line {{had been}} <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> two tracks in 1972. The BMT Jamaica Line from 121st Street to 168th Street would be demolished {{to make room}} for a connection to the lower level of the Archer Avenue Line, which extended east to Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer. A year later, a final design for the Northeast Queens LIE line was published, while other final engineering for the Southeast Queens line was imminent. In the summer of 1972, ground was broken on the Southeast Queens Line along Archer Avenue to 147th Place. Two southeast Brooklyn IRT routes—the IRT Nostrand Avenue Line extension to Avenue W, as well as an IRT Eastern Parkway Line branch under Utica Avenue to Avenue U—were being designed. The MCTA, which was by now renamed the MTA, were rerouting the proposed IRT Pelham Line branch to Co-op City via New Haven Railroad right of way.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{released}} a limited slate of twelve features {{in its first}} year; in 1930, that figure more than <b>doubled</b> <b>to</b> twenty-nine. Originally organized as the distinct business entities RKO Productions Inc. and RKO Distributing Corp., by July the studio was making a transition to the new, unified RKO Radio Pictures Inc. Encouraged by Rio Ritas success, RKO produced several costly musicals incorporating Technicolor sequences, among them Dixiana and Hit the Deck, both scripted and directed, like Rio Rita, by Luther Reed. Following {{the example of the}} other major studios, RKO had planned to create its own musical revue, Radio Revels. Promoted as the studio's most extravagant production to date, it was to be photographed entirely in Technicolor. The project was abandoned, however, as the public's taste for musicals temporarily subsided. From a total of more than sixty Hollywood musicals in 1929 and over eighty the following year, the number dropped to eleven in 1931. RKO was left in a bind: it still had a contract with Technicolor to produce two more features with its system. Complicating matters, audiences had come to associate color with the momentarily out-of-favor musical genre due to a glut of such productions from the major Hollywood studios. Fulfilling its obligations, RKO produced two all-Technicolor pictures, The Runaround and Fanny Foley Herself (both 1931), containing no musical sequences. Neither was a success.|$|E
