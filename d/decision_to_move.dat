Blamey's objective was therefore in Allied hands; but it was of limited use without Sattelberg. The Allied intelligence failure and subsequent dithering meant that the Japanese reinforced their position faster, and thus were able to seize the initiative.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{building}} a career is largely {{the responsibility of}} employees who can craft their career in diverse ways {{through a series of}} career decisions. An important driver behind these decisions is employees’ quest for work-home balance, which becomes more prevalent as work and home life become increasingly entangled. Surprisingly however, though some theoretical insights exist (e. g., Greenhaus & Kossek, 2014), {{little is known about the}} relation between balance and multiple career decisions based on thorough empirical research. To overcome this limitation, the present study set out to examine the impact of work-home balance on six types of career <b>decisions.</b> <b>To</b> this end, a survey was conducted on the crowdsourcing website Mturk, generating a diverse sample of 323 American employees. Results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that when employees experience low balance, they are more inclined <b>to</b> make career <b>decisions</b> that reduce their job demands, i. e., <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> downwards, <b>to</b> reduce working hours, or to take a career break. When employees experience high balance, they are more inclined <b>to</b> make career <b>decisions</b> that enhance their job resources via development and growth, i. e., <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> upwards. <b>Decisions</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> laterally or <b>to</b> become selfemployed were not directly influenced by balance. Organizational work-home support buffered the impact of low work-home balance on the three previously mentioned career decisions, while career self-efficacy had no moderating effect at all. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and suggest additional avenues for future research. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It is debatable whether the destruction of one battalion {{could have been the}} goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
5|$|An ironclad is a steam-propelled warship {{protected}} by iron or steel armor plates {{used in the}} early part of the second half of the 19th century. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.|$|E

He had initially intended on beginning this story after the culmination of Prisoners of the Sun, but both his wife Germaine Remi and his close friend Marcel Dehaye convinced him to proceed with Land of Black Gold (1950), a story that he had previously left unfinished, instead.|$|E
30|$|We should {{emphasize}} that these tests are {{predicated on the}} observed <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> switch occupations or {{to stay in the}} initial occupation.

The government's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed. Independent sources put the death toll at over 2000. Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps. Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> Missouri to Pearl Harbor was {{met with}} some resistance.

To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may rest in peace.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} francophone {{selected in}} the first round of the Entry Draft by the Canadiens had been Eric Chouinard in 1998. Coaches and scouts for the Canadiens praised Leblanc for his speed, determination, goal-scoring ability and his willingness to go to the corners for the puck. Canadiens General Manager Bob Gainey felt that Leblanc's <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to the United States to play in the USHL—rather than stay in his native Quebec with the QMJHL, which would have been the easier choice—would help his development as a player and displayed the type of character that the team sought.

5|$|The steady {{increase}} in traffic encouraged the trustees {{to press on}} with improvements.

5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from the machine gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from the concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely used {{in the same manner as}} light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E
5|$|Concern was {{expressed}} at York's poor support {{towards the end}} of their third season in the Football League, and director G. W. Halliday believed the only solution was a change of ground. A major problem was the ground's relatively inaccessible location, and in early 1932, York held preliminary discussions about moving to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club. A special meeting of the shareholders was held, in which chairman Arthur Brown drew attention to gate receipts figures in Fulfordgate's three Football League seasons, which represented average crowds of 4,000 and a deficit on the balance sheet. It was pointed out by Halliday that within onemile (1.6km) of Bootham Crescent the population was 30,000, whereas it was only 3,000 for a similar radius of Fulfordgate. The directors were satisfied that the new ground would fulfil all requirements, although there was some opposition to the move. Two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited. Following much discussion, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to lease Bootham Crescent was approved by 115votes to 37, and Fulfordgate was sold and developed as a housing estate. Today, Eastward Avenue occupies the area where the ground once stood.|$|E

Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established.

He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year. His <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair. He joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914. As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its Director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918).|$|E
