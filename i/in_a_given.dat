5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> region.|$|E

They also include social, educational, and engagement components that seem to engage participants in their communities and increase members’ understanding of philanthropy and community issues. This study examines if and how participation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giving</b> circle has changed members’ behaviorrelated to giving, volunteering, and civic engagement. In addition, we asked if and how participation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giving</b> circle has changed members’ awareness or knowledge about philanthropy, nonprofit organizations, and community issues. Finally, we wanted to know if and how participation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>giving</b> circle has changed members’ perceptions or attitudes about philanthropy, community issues, citizen, government and nonprofit roles and responsibilities or political and social values. To address these areas, data were gathered through a survey of 341 current and past members of 26 giving circles of various types, sizes, and identity groups across the U. S., as well as a control group of 246 donors and public service graduate students and practitioners; semi-structured interviews with 30 giving circle members and past members from 11 giving circles; and participant observation in four giving circles.

They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common.

5|$|Alan Stern and Harold F. Levison {{introduced}} a parameter Λ (lambda), expressing {{the likelihood of}} an encounter resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> deflection of orbit. The value of this parameter in Stern's model {{is proportional to the}} square of the mass and inversely proportional to the period. This value can be used to estimate the capacity of a body to clear the neighbourhood of its orbit, where Λ > 1 will eventually clear it. A gap of five orders of magnitude in Λ was found between the smallest terrestrial planets and the largest asteroids and Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, {{the effects are}} relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E
5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much greater than that of a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E
