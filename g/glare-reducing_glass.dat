50|$|The {{building}} {{presents itself}} as a cube that has been deconstructed into four units: a dramatic cantilevered courtroom block on the front with office blocks on each side and to the rear. These four components surmount a single-story base called the podium. The building is clad in flame-treated Royal Pearl granite from Georgia and bronze-tinted, heat-absorbing, <b>glare-reducing</b> <b>glass</b> with slim bronze-anodized aluminum mullions. Lundy's skillful use of materials and voids between blocks articulate the units.|$|E
50|$|Completed in 1960, {{the two-story}} Alumni Memorial Library was {{designed}} to hold 150,000 volumes, as the collection at the time numbered approximately 62,000 volumes. It also had study space for approximately 500 students. The split-level design also included conference rooms, a music room, a visual aid room, microfilm facilities, and a smoking lounge. The buff, iron-spot building was considered cutting edge at the time, with <b>glare-reducing</b> thermo-pane <b>glass,</b> noise-reducing solid brick walls, radiant heating and cooling, and humidity control. Although originally estimated at $750,000, overall construction costs were approximately $806,000 after complications occurred when a massive mining cavity, complete with a network of surrounding tunnels, was discovered to lie only forty {{feet below the surface}} of the building site. Using a digging rig brought in from Texas, contractors sunk 33 steel casings into the ground, each more than 40 feet long, and then poured concrete through them to form pillars in order to support the structure. To raise money for the construction, a fundraising campaign led by Judge James F. Brady sought individual contributions from all the alumni.|$|R
