In 1932, development of a new type of radio navigation system - soon known worldwide as the Lorenz beam - gave a major extension of their aircraft radio business.

50|$|The South Korean {{government}} broadcasts several bizarre-sounding jamming sounds (usually warbling or chugging) in {{an attempt}} to prevent their citizens from hearing radio broadcasts from the North. The medium-wave jamming by the South is sometimes too weak to completely block the North Korean broadcasts (the jamming transmission power seems to be between 20 and 50 kilowatts, while the targeted North Korean transmissions are of much higher transmission power—typically over 500 kilowatts). Using a decent quality radio, a listener can sometimes nullify the South Korean jammer by re-orienting the set so its <b>ferrite</b> <b>antenna</b> points in a different direction. On shortwave, jamming is not as severe; only a very few North Korean frequencies are slightly jammed. FM jamming is also carried out, but it is not very effective.|$|E

50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving <b>antenna</b> is the <b>ferrite</b> loopstick <b>antenna</b> (also known as a ferrite rod aerial), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, <b>ferrite</b> <b>antennas</b> are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>antenna</b> has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Miniaturized {{ferrite ring}} patch antennas (RPAs) were {{designed}} and fabricated for multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) applications. Design parameters of higher-order mode ferrite RPAs, 1 -RPA and 2 -RPA, were optimized, and antenna {{performance of the}} ferrite 1 -RPA was evaluated. The Z-type hexaferrite and 2 %-weight borosilicate glass composite {{was used for the}} <b>ferrite</b> <b>antenna</b> disk. The measured permeability (µr) and permittivity (εr) of the hexaferrite were 2. 59 and 5. 7, respectively, at 2. 5 GHz. Three-mode orthogonal radiation of the ferrite 1 -RPA was experimentally confirmed. With regard to the ferrite 2 -RPA, excellent isolation (− 40 dB) between ports 1 and 2 was achieved at 2. 5 GHz. This excellent isolation property is attributed to both mode 3 orthogonal radiations of the bottom and top RPAs. The volumes of the 1 - and 2 -RPA were reduced to 14. 5 % and 34. 5 %, respectively, from 95 cm 3 of a dielectric 2 -circular patch antenna (2 -CPA) volume. 1...|$|E
40|$|Passive UHF (Ultra High Frequency) RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a {{promising}} technology for products tracking in logistics or routing packages in supply chain. However, passive UHF RFID tag suffers {{a lot when}} it is placed on conductive plane or water surface. Many designs like microstrip antenna and <b>ferrite</b> <b>antenna</b> {{have been used to}} solve this metal-water problem. But their use is limited by narrow bandwidth and low antenna gain. The Electromagnetic band gap (EBG) material which exhibits a unique forbidden band gap at certain frequency offers a potential solution {{to solve the problem of}} backside objects effects. In this thesis, we disclosed a new method using mushroom-like electromagnetic band gap (EBG) material to insulate the UHF RFID tag from backside objects, so that the tag could work on water surface and even metal. The design of EBG material for UHF RFID which operates at 915 MHz was discussed in this thesis. An EBG tag on metal with a gain of 4 dBi was achieved in simulation and a prototype of 4. 3 mm thick RFID on metal tag was measured in experiment. The simulation results showed that the RFID tag still could be read on EBG substrate with a good gain (~ 4 dBi). The measurement results indicated that the read rang of RFID tag with EBG substrate could reach up to 4. 5 meters on metal template...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} to select the right material for the application, as the correct ferrite for a 100 kHz switching supply (high inductance, low loss, low frequency) is quite different to that for an RF transformer or <b>ferrite</b> rod <b>antenna,</b> (high frequency low loss, but lower inductance), and different again from a suppression ferrite (high loss, broadband) ...|$|R
50|$|The antenna may be {{enclosed}} {{inside the}} receiver's case, {{as with the}} <b>ferrite</b> loop <b>antennas</b> of AM radios and the flat inverted F antenna of cell phones; attached {{to the outside of}} the receiver, as with whip antennas used on FM radios, or mounted separately and connected to the receiver by a cable, as with rooftop television antennas and satellite dishes.|$|R
50|$|A small {{loop antenna}} {{is used for}} {{wavelengths}} {{much bigger than the}} loop itself. For a given loop area, the length of the conductor (and thus its net loss resistance) is minimized if the shape is a circle, making a circle the optimum shape for small loops. Small receiving loops are typically used below 3 MHz where man made and atmospheric noise dominate. Thus the signal to noise ratio of the received signal will not be adversely affected by low efficiency as long as the loop is not excessively small. A typical diameter of loops in free air is between 30 cm and 1 meter. To increase the magnetic field in the loop and thus the efficiency while greatly reducing size, the coil of wire is often wound around a ferrite rod magnetic core; this is called a <b>ferrite</b> loop <b>antenna.</b> Such <b>ferrite</b> loop <b>antennas</b> are used in almost all AM broadcast receivers with the exception of car radios; the antenna is then usually contained inside the radio's case.

5000|$|Another {{extreme case}} of {{impedance}} matching occurs when {{using a small}} loop antenna (usually, but not always, for receiving) at a relatively low frequency where it appears almost as a pure inductor. Resonating such an inductor with a capacitor at the frequency of operation not only cancels the reactance but greatly magnifies the very small radiation resistance of such a loop.

25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the radio wave as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip <b>antennas</b> or <b>ferrite</b> loopstick <b>antennas</b> used in modern radios.|$|R
30|$|It {{may also}} be noted that the LRD {{instrument}} detected between 10 and several hundred RF pulses per second throughout the descent (over 150, 000 pulses total), whereas no optical lightning detections were claimed (the few hundred counted optical pulses being attributed to spin-modulated sunlight early in descent, or to cosmic rays—see Rinnert et al. 1998). This underscores the comparative long-range ability of electromagnetic vs optical sensing (and makes the optical nondetection of the VEGA balloon at Venus perhaps unsurprising). The LRD used a <b>ferrite</b> coil <b>antenna</b> (i.e., sensing the magnetic component of the signal, like the Groza instruments) and counted pulses in narrow bands at 3, 15, and 90  kHz, with the lowest frequencies seeing highest activity; sensed pulse amplitudes reached a few tens of nanotesla.

50|$|Later, RDF {{sets were}} {{equipped}} with rotatable <b>ferrite</b> loopstick <b>antennas,</b> {{which made the}} sets more portable and less bulky.

A key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or 'sense' antenna that substantiated the correct bearing and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearing 180 degrees opposite the actual heading. The U.S. Navy RDF model SE 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during World War I. After World War II, there were many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners, including Apelco, Aqua Guide, Bendix, Gladding (and its marine division, Pearce-Simpson), Ray Jefferson, Raytheon, and Sperry. By the 1960s, many of these radios were actually made by Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Panasonic, Fuji Onkyo, and Koden Electronics Co., Ltd. In aircraft equipment, Bendix and Sperry-Rand were two of the larger manufacturers of RDF radios and navigation instruments.|$|R
