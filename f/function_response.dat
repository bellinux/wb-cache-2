40|$|The modulational {{instability}} (MI) of plane {{waves in}} nonlocal Kerr media is studied for a general, localized, <b>response</b> <b>function.</b> It is shown that there always exists {{a finite number}} of well-separated MI gain bands, with each of them characterised by a unique maximal growth rate. This is a general property and is demonstrated here for the Gaussian, exponential, and rectangular <b>response</b> <b>functions.</b> In case of a focusing nonlinearity it is shown that although the nonlocality tends to suppress MI, it can never remove it completely, irrespectively of the particular shape of the <b>response</b> <b>function.</b> For a defocusing nonlinearity the stability properties depend sensitively on the profile of the <b>response</b> <b>function.</b> It is shown that plane waves are always stable for <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> with a positive-definite spectrum, such as Gaussians and exponentials.

50|$|Computing with Memory {{refers to}} {{computing}} platforms where <b>function</b> <b>response</b> {{is stored in}} memory array, either one or two-dimensional, {{in the form of}} lookup tables (LUTs) and functions are evaluated by retrieving the values from the LUTs. These computing platforms can follow either a purely spatial computing model, as in Field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or a temporal computing model, where a function is evaluated across multiple clock cycles. The latter approach aims at reducing the overhead of programmable interconnect in FPGA by folding interconnect resources inside a computing element. It uses dense two-dimensional memory arrays to store large multiple-input multiple-output LUTs. Computing with Memory differs from Computing in Memory or Processor-in-memory (PIM) concepts, widely investigated in the context of integrating a processor and memory on the same chip to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth. These architectures seek to reduce the distance the data travels between the processor and the memory. The Berkeley IRAM project is one notable contribution in the area of PIM architectures.|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} {{reflection}} and transmission <b>function</b> (or collectively, <b>response</b> <b>function)</b> concepts in reactor physics is extensively investigated. Previously obtained differential (invariant imbedding) and functional (adding) equations for the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are re-derived in a unified manner.

Existing <b>response</b> <b>function</b> calculations are summarized and extended by combining the invariant imbedding and functional equations. For deep-penetration shielding problems in slab geometry, this combined <b>response</b> <b>function</b> approach is shown to be more efficient than conventional Monte Carlo or discrete ordinates techniques. The <b>response</b> <b>function</b> approach is also shown to be efficient for a criticality search in slab geometry. As a step toward a more general treatment, invariant imbedding equations are derived, but not solved, in finite cylindrical geometry. Finally the feasibility of performing <b>response</b> <b>function</b> experiments to obtain cross-section and criticality information is examined. The envisioned experimental set-up is described and calculations are carried out to verify the analytical procedures, with particular emphasis on the propagation of errors. Cross-sections can be determined using the halving scheme, which provides a theoretically sound technique for multiple scattering correction. Thus experiments may be done on moderately thick slabs.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: This {{retrospective}} review describes surgical {{management of}} atherosclerotic renovascular disease (RVD) in hypertensive adults with diabetes mellitus. Methods: From July 1987 through July 1995, 54 consecutive hypertensive diabetics (mean 213 / 103 mm Hg; mean medications three drugs) requiring either insulin (16 patients) or oral hypoglycemic therapy (38 patients) had operative repair of atherosclerotic RVD. Renal dysfunction (serum creatinine [SCr] ≥ 1. 3 mg/dl) {{was present in}} 82 % of patients (mean SCr 2. 4 mg/dl). Associations between blood pressure and renal <b>function</b> <b>response</b> to operation and preoperative parameters were examined. Clinical characteristics, response to operation, and dialysis-free survival were {{compared with those of}} 291 nondiabetic patients. Results: Four (7. 4 %) operative deaths occurred. Among 50 survivors blood pressure response was considered cured or improved in 72 % and unchanged in 28 %. Of 42 patients with renal dysfunction 40 % had improved function including three patients removed from dialysis. No preoperative parameter examined demonstrated a significant association with blood pressure or renal <b>function</b> <b>response.</b> During follow-up 10 additional patient deaths occurred, and eight patients progressed to dialysis dependence. Time to death or dialysis was associated with preoperative estimates of glomerular filtration (p = 0. 03) and the change in estimates of glomerular filtration after operation (p = 0. 01). Compared with 291 nondiabetics, the diabetic group had no statistical difference in improved <b>function</b> <b>response</b> (40 % vs 51 %, p = 0. 21); however, diabetics had a significantly lower rate of beneficial blood pressure response (72 % vs 89 %, p = 0. 01) and an increased risk of dialysis or death during follow-up (p = 0. 02). By multivariate analysis independent predictors of time to death or dialysis included the presence of diabetes mellitus, patient age, history of congestive heart failure, and increased serum creatinine. Conclusions: Most of the selected diabetic patients had a beneficial blood pressure response after undergoing operative repair of atherosclerotic RVD, albeit at a lower rate compared with nondiabetics. In diabetics poor renal function before and after operation was associated with progression to dialysis and death. Improved renal function after operation was associated with improved survival; however, <b>function</b> <b>response</b> to renal revascularization was difficult to predict.

40|$|Estimation of <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> is an {{important}} task in dynamic medical imaging. This task arises for example in dynamic renal scintigraphy, where impulse <b>response</b> or retention <b>functions</b> are estimated, or in {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} where hemodynamic <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are required. These functions can not be observed directly and their estimation is complicated because the recorded images are subject to superposition of underlying signals. Therefore, the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> are estimated via blind source separation and deconvolution. Performance of this algorithm heavily depends on the used models of the <b>response</b> <b>functions.</b> <b>Response</b> <b>functions</b> in real image sequences are rather complicated and finding a suitable parametric form is problematic. In this paper, we study estimation of the <b>response</b> <b>functions</b> using non-parametric Bayesian priors.

These assumptions are used within hierarchical priors of the blind source separation and deconvolution algorithm.
