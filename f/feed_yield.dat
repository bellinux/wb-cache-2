40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site vitrifies High Level Waste for {{repository}} internment. The process {{consists of}} three major steps: waste pretreatment, vitrification, and canister decontamination/sealing. The HLW consists of insoluble metal hydroxides (primarily iron, aluminum, magnesium, manganese, and uranium) and soluble sodium salts (carbonate, hydroxide, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate). The pretreatment process acidifies the sludge with nitric and formic acids, adds the glass formers as glass frit, then concentrates the resulting slurry to approximately 50 weight percent (wt%) total solids. This slurry is fed to the joule-heated melter where the remaining water is evaporated followed by calcination of the solids and conversion to glass. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is currently assisting DWPF efforts to increase throughput of the melter. As part of this effort, SRNL has investigated methods to increase the solids content of the melter feed to reduce the heat load required to complete the evaporation of water and allow more of the energy available to calcine and vitrify the waste. The process equipment in the facility is fixed and cannot process materials with high yield stresses, therefore increasing the solids content will require that the yield stress of the melter feed slurries be reduced. Changing the glass former added during pretreatment from an irregularly shaped glass frit to nearly spherical beads was evaluated. The evaluation required a systems approach which included evaluations {{of the effectiveness of}} beads in reducing the melter <b>feed</b> <b>yield</b> stress as well as evaluations of the processing impacts of changing the frit morphology. Processing impacts of beads include changing the settling rate of the glass former (which effects mixing and sampling of the melter feed slurry and the frit addition equipment) as well as impacts on the melt behavior due to decreased surface area of the beads versus frit. Beads were produced from the DWPF process frit by fire polishing. The frit was allowed to free fall through a flame, then quenched with a water spray. Approximately 90 % of the frit was converted to beads by this process, as shown in Figure 1. Borosilicate beads of various diameters were also procured for initial testing...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) using CO 2, as an analytical technique for total fat extraction from food and feed samples. Its most significant advantages are safety, cleanness, and shorter extraction time. The main limitation of this technique includes the difficulty of extracting polar lipids due to the non-polar character of the solvent (CO 2) used for the extraction. The influence of ethanol as a co-solvent on the SFE of mash pig feed was investigated in this paper. Total fat content was determined by SFE and Soxhlet method for ten commercially available mesh pig <b>feeds.</b> <b>Yields</b> of the fat extracted by both methods were plotted one against the other and compared.

40|$|Abstract — Effective {{conservation}} of the critically endangered hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) {{in the western}} Indian Ocean is hindered {{by a lack of}} basic ecological information about its diet and habitat requirements. This study utilised stomach samples from dead turtles and oesophageal lavage, together with in-water observations of foraging turtles, to identify the relative importance of species contributing to the diet of hawksbill turtles at five localities in the Republic of Seychelles. Diets were remarkably similar to those of hawksbill turtles from the Atlantic and Pacific in that they fed predominantly on demosponges and anthozoans. In total, ten demosponges, four anthozoans, three seaweeds, one seagrass, one ascidian and the egg cases of a mollusc were identified. The most prevalent taxa encountered were Stelletta sp., Spheciospongia sp. (both demosponges) and Zoanthus sansibaricus (anthozoan). Five genera are new to the global list of taxa consumed by hawksbill turtles, viz. Stelletta, Rhabdastrella, Haliclona, Pseudoceratina and Discosoma. The relative merits of the various methods of dietary determination are discussed and it is concluded that in-water observations of turtle <b>feeding</b> <b>yields</b> results that are in many ways superior to oesophageal lavage or th...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{pearl millet}} and cowpea in {{combination}} with raising ruminant livestock is widely practiced in the Sahel. In this farming system, livestock feeding depends mostly on rangeland, fallows and cropland grazing. Nutritional constraints to grazing ruminants stem primarily from feed scarcity and seasonal fluctuations in feed supply associated with low rainfall and poor soil fertility. Low feed quality exacerbates the effects of feed scarcity and seasonality. Some herd management practices result in decreased grazing times and feed intake and (or) increased energy expenditures for walking. Land tenure and use tights, among other socioeconomic factors, constrain the nutrition of livestock by limiting herd mobility and access to feed resources. Expansion of copping areas onto rangeland may result in higher overall <b>feed</b> <b>yields</b> but limits <b>feed</b> availability and access to grazing lands during the rainy season. Nutrition of livestock can be improved with better herd and range management practices, increasing {{the quantity and quality}} of feed produced on range and cropland and by using feed supplements. These options need to be profitable and compatible with the resource endowment and production objectives to be adopted by farmers. Policies and institutional arrangements are also required to facilitate herd mobility and access to water and grazing land and to solve and prevent conflicts among users of these resources...|$|R

At very low levels of <b>feeding,</b> with <b>yields</b> of 267 – 307 kg milksolids per cow (kg MS/cow), regression coefficients of lactation yield on EBVs were not significantly different from the expected value of 1. At high levels of <b>feeding,</b> with <b>yields</b> of 383 – 411 kg MS/cow, most of the regression coefficients for yields of protein, fat and milk on EBVs were significantly greater than 1. The results of this study show that at low levels of feeding the actual differences in production between cows, which differ in EBVs correspond to the actual differences in EBVs, whereas at high levels of feeding the difference in milk yields between genetic groups are greater than the difference in EBVs. This constitutes a form of genotype x environment interaction, in which genotype is measured as breeding values, and has important practical and economic implications for dairy farms, and for the expected value of genetic improvements...|$|R

Culture of the cells in dialysed serum and hexose-free media, down-regulated the expression of GLUT 5, which was below detection within 3 - 4 days. This effect was reversed by fructose and glucose feeding of the cells. Fructose <b>feeding</b> <b>yielded</b> a 3 -fold higher abundance of GLUT 5 protein and mRNA as compared with that expressed in glucose-fed cells. Cells fed normal serum exhibited an inverse hierarchy of expression, with glucose being a better inducer than fructose for the expression of GLUT 5.

A linear relationship between cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and GLUT 5 mRNA abundance was found in cells fed dialysed serum, whereas in cells fed normal serum, mRNA abundances were not correlated to cAMP levels.

Most of the radioactivity in the dry seeds was associated with compounds having partition characteristics of, and co-chromatographing on, sequential SiO 2 partition and reverse-phase HPLC with glucosyl conjugates of the precursors (GA 4 or GA 20) and their probable major metabolite (GA 1).

This {{study was conducted to}} design and establish industrial platform for high cell density cultivation of this novel probiotic strain, L. lactis (WICC-B 25). During bioreactor cultivation of lactic acid bacteria in industrial scale, there are two main problems during process namely: low cell growth rate and high lactate production. These both together resulted in low cell mass production. Therefore, this study was focused on cultivation parameters optimization for high cell mass production with minimal lactate formation in shake flask and bioreactor levels. Cell growth was studied in 16 -L stirred tank bioreactor under controlled and uncontrolled pH conditions. The maximal cell mass of about 5. 6 g L- 1 was obtained after 14 h cultivations under uncontrolled pH condition. This value was almost 35 % higher than those cell mass obtained in pH controlled culture. Based on this data, fed-batch cultivation strategy was developed using mixed substrate feeding solution (containing all medium component) and mono-feeding (using glucose alone). For both cultures, fed was adjusted to constant rate of 3 g L- 1 h- 1 and, DO was cascaded to agitation speed to prevent the drop of DO to value less than 30 % saturation as oxygen is limited factor for high cell mass production.

Hybrids with the Bt CRW traits {{are more expensive}} and initially were available in limited supply. Corn rootworm feeding pressure typically decreases on late planted/replanted corn. Producers were asking if the additional seed costs were justified and, if they could only get a limited supply of the Bt CRW hybrids, when should they be planted for maximum response. Marlin Rice, ISU Extension entomologist, conducted an initial 3 -year study (2003 – 2005) in Central Iowa. The objective of this demonstration was to compare the corn root <b>feeding</b> damage, <b>yield,</b> and economic response of a Bt CRW hybrid with its non-Bt CRW isoline at three planting dates in a continuous corn rotation in Northern Iowa...|$|R
40|$|Samples of kukersite {{oil shale}} and pine wood and their {{mixtures}} were liquefied with water in supercritical state in an autoclave. Chosen conditions (380 ºC, 4 h) give synergy to desired direction in all <b>feed</b> compositions: <b>yields</b> of solid residue and gas with pyrogenetic water were lower 1. 7 – 2. 0 and 1. 4 – 2. 0 times, respectively, while the yield {{of the most}} expected component of oil – benzene solubles was – 1. 5 – 1. 9 times higher than additive yields. Rise in co-liquefaction oil yields (y) resulted completely from {{the rise in the}} yield of the polar components and depended on the share of wood in feed (x) according to equation y = – 0. 0089 x 2 + 0. 6626 x + 34. 846 (R 2 0. 97) ...|$|R
25|$|The feed to a {{belt press}} filter {{depends on the}} type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry solids {{concentration}} is typically in the range of 1-10%. The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry solids concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%. Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher <b>feed</b> solids concentration <b>yields</b> an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.|$|R
40|$|Organic {{animal feed}} {{is the basic}} element for organic animal production. In our country, in organic animal feed farming, farmers {{generally}} prefer forage crops as by-products and do not follow an alternation system for animal feed production. They make feed production either as inter-crop or as second crop. For this reason, there is no production based on an alternation {{system in which the}} animal can meet all nutritional needs. In the same season in the production of organic animal feed, roughage, energy feed and protein feed are needed to meet all animal nutritional values. The cultivation of these feed plants can be achieved with a good rotation system. However, most of the farmers do not know which rotation system give more organic feed. For this reason, yields of some plants suitable for Aegean Region conditions have been examined in 2 different rotation systems. In this study carried out in Menemen Plain, in Aegean Region, Izmir, Turkey during a period of 4 years between 2013 and 2016 the effect of two different rotation systems on the roughage, energy and protein <b>feed</b> <b>yields</b> in organic <b>feed</b> cultivation was studied. According to the results of soil analysis, organic fertilizer containing 2 % N, 2. 5 % P 2 O 5, 2. 5 % K 2 O, 60 % organic matter and 9 / 12 C/N was given to the plots. Fertilization was carried out so as not to exceed 170 kg / ha nitrogen as stated in the organic farming law. In the first rotation system vetch/triticale mixture - cotton, Persian clover - silage corn, vetch/triticale mixture - cotton and Persian clover - silage corn were evaluated. In the second rotation system vetch/triticale mixture - soybean, vetch/oats mixture - corn, vetch/triticale mixture - soybean and vetch/oats mixture - corn were evaluated. In both systems roughage (vetch/triticale mixture and Persian clover) yield decreased in consecutive years, but subsequent energy (maize) and protein feed (soybean and cotton seed) yields were increase...|$|R
40|$|Diets {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} concentrates or of concentrates plus silage {{in a total}} mixed ration (TMR) or discrete ingredient format were compared for effects on beef production traits and on beef quality. Sixty continental cross heifers (377 kg, s. d. 31) were allocated {{to one of the}} following feeding regimens for 96 days pre-slaughter: (i) a control ration of grass silage, maize silage, a cereal-based concentrate and straw at proportionately, 0. 23, 0. 15, 0. 59 and 0. 03 of dietary dry matter, respectively; (ii) a total mixed ration (TMR) with the same dietary ingredients as the control ration; (iii) a high concentrate ration (HC) of a cereal-based diet and straw at proportionately 0. 95 and 0. 05 of dietary dry matter, respectively. Subcutaneous fat samples were taken from all animals at slaughter and the strip-loin was excised from 10 animals per group for colour, texture and fatty acid determination. The HC and TMR groups had higher (P < 0. 05) daily live-weight gain, slaughter weight and carcass weight than the control group. Muscle protein was highest (P < 0. 01) in the TMR group while muscle marbling was highest (P < 0. 01) in the HC group. Subcutaneous fat from the HC group was less (P < 0. 001) yellow than fat from the other groups. Fatty acid analysis of intramuscular fat showed that the HC group had higher C 18 : 1 and lower C 18 : 3 proportions than the control group (P < 0. 05). The n- 6 :n- 3 fatty acid ratio of intramuscular fat from the HC group was higher (P < 0. 05) than that of the other groups. The results suggest that, at similar feed intakes, TMR feeding offers advantages for beef production over feeding ingredients separately, and yields muscle with a higher protein concentration, while high concentrate <b>feeding</b> <b>yields</b> whiter subcutaneous fat and intramuscular fat with a less nutritionally favourable n- 6 :n- 3 fatty acid ratio. peer-reviewedRichard Keenan and Co.
