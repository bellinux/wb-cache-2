Also cancelled by the Conservative federal government was the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E

Jancsi plays a sorrowful Hungarian melody on his violin one last time. The melody speaks so to the Cossack guard that he promises the two Hungarians that he'll release them, if only he can receive the violin {{in exchange for their}} freedom. Stefan Koltay and Jancsi don't have to consider long, and after they have given the violin to the Cossack, they both leave the prison camp immediately and escape towards Japan.|$|R
