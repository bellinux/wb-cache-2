6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} what I've heard. Who is she? IS IT MRS. M. THAT YOU GAVE THAT MONEY <b>TO?</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who she is! <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what a respectable man, with grown-up girls of his own, is doing {{with such a}} looking thing as that in his office? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how long she's been there? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what she's there at all for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> George," [...] the old gentleman said, after slowly smacking {{his first}} bumper--"what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is, how you and--ah--that little thing upstairs, are {{carrying}} on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's not a {{question}} of my right over you--though I HAVE some right, remember. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what it is that subjugates you to that little scum of a sculptor downstairs, what it is that brings you down like a humble maggot, in worship of him. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what you creep after.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I hope we {{are both}} above that," [...] said Cecil. [...] "No, it is Camilla that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about.</b> I must know whether she told me truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Link. You didn't expect I'd {{follow you}} so soon, did you?" [...] cried Roger.

6000|$|... "You {{was only}} goin' to say. You was! You was only goin' to say--what was you goin' to say? That's it!

6000|$|... "Stop!"

60|$|But {{how do they}} die, or how stop growing, then?--it is {{the first}} thing <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> them. And from all the books in the house, I can't as yet find out this. Meanwhile I will look at the leaves themselves.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes! {{it tells}} all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> insects. I had it {{here to see}} how to fix the {{butterflies}} right. I covered it, {{so it is not}} hurt;" [...] and Dan caught it up, fearing the lender might think him careless.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Such as what? Can't see {{anything}} myself. I call it perfectly indecent dragging the good lady {{out of her}} well-earned tomb {{at this time of}} day. I've looked her up in the Dic. of Antiquities, and it appears that she committed suicide some years ago. Body-snatching, I call it.

6000|$|... "Yes, 'm. Wasn't David a fine feller?

6000|$|... "Minnie dear," [...] I said, {{holding her}} hands very tight in my own, [...] "it wasn't that, I assure you. I've {{forgotten}} him, utterly. If ever I knew a Dr. Ivor, if ever I flirted with him, as {{you seem to}} imply, he's gone clean out of my head. His name stirs no chord--recalls absolutely nothing.
