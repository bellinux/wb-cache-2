50|$|In Belarus, nearly 1,500 {{species of}} {{vascular}} plants (including 1,422 flowering plants), 450 mosses, 2,000 algae and 1,500 fungus species are known. In the north, conifers predominate in forests that also include birch and alder; farther south, other deciduous trees grow. Pines compose 50.2% of total forest area, spruces - 10%, black alder - 8.2%, oaks - 3.3%, <b>gray</b> <b>alder</b> - 2.3%, aspen - 2.1%. 15.4% of Belarus {{is covered by}} meadows with one third being natural and the rest being specially cultivated. The most common plants on natural meadows are Deschampsia and several different sedges (Carex). In the marshes, 267 species of Embryophyta are growing - herbs (167 species), trees and bushes (37 species), Bryidae (32 species) and Sphagnopsida (31 species). 50 of them are considered drug plants.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== About {{one-third of}} the reserve is forested, mostly on the lower north slopes. The forests are mostly oak (on the Rocky Ridge and {{depression}} to 800 meters), and beech (to 1,500 meters) communities. Underbrush at the mid-level include sea buckthorn (Hippophae), willow, <b>gray</b> <b>alder,</b> and in places extensive hazel. Approaching the sub-alpine zone the brush features Caucasian rhododendron. [...] Above 2,000 meters but below the alpine zone at 2,500 meters is a belt of mountain forest-steppe: wheatgrass-wormwood-cereal xerophytic steppes on shallow meadow soils. The animal life of the reserve is still being inventories and studied, as the reserve {{is one of the}} newest in the system. As of 2016, 115 species of birds had been recorded, 60 species of mammals (15 of which were hooved, 10 were bats, and 20 were rodents).|$|E
40|$|For several years, FORAN Remote Sensing in Linköping {{has been}} using pulseintense laser scannings {{together}} with multispectral imaging for developing analysismethods in forestry. One area these laser scannings and images are used for is toclassify the species of single trees in forests. The species have been divided intopine, spruce and deciduous trees, classified by a Maximum Likelihood classifier. This thesis presents the work done on a more spectrally high-resolution imagery,hyperspectral images. These images are divided into more, and finer gradedspectral components, but demand more signal processing. A new classifier, SupportVector Machine, is tested against the previously used Maximum LikelihoodClassifier, {{to see if it}} is possible to increase the performance. The classifiers arealso set to divide the deciduous trees into aspen, birch, black alder and <b>gray</b> <b>alder.</b> The thesis shows how the new data set is handled and processed to the differentclassifiers, and shows how a better result can be achieved using a Support VectorMachine...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the success of woody plantings carried out in order to revitalize small streams. For selected restorations was assessed dendrological composition, establishment, health and care after planting. The most common species planted in the revitalization of small streams is the alder (Alnus glutinosa), a pioneer tree species reinforcing shores, to which it was coupled with flowing water home. Sometimes forming groups with <b>gray</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus incana) {{but that does not}} fit stagnant water and silver birch (Betula pendula). Also mountain elm (Ulmus glabra) and willow species (Salix sp.) are widely planted along streams. Locally, there were planted common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) but mostly in very poor condition, and oak (Quercus robur), sporadically rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), dogwood (Swida sanquinea) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides). A statistical evaluation shows that the biggest influence on species composition and state of health of trees has the revitalization age. Also important is the care of the vegetation in later years after planting...|$|E
40|$|Tree-ring {{records from}} {{conifers}} have been regularly used {{over the last}} few decades to date debris-flow events. The reconstruction of past debris-flow activity was, in contrast, only very rarely based on growth anomalies in broad-leaved trees. Consequently, this study aimed at dating the occurrence of former debris flows from growth series of broad-leaved trees and at determining their suitability for dendrogeomorphic research. Results were obtained from <b>gray</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus incana (L.) Moench), silver birch and pubescent birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), aspen (Populus tremula L.), white poplar, black poplar and gray poplar (Populus alba L., Populus nigra L. and Populus x canescens (Ait.) Sm.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and black elder (Sambucus nigra L.) injured by debris-flow activity at Illgraben (Valais, Swiss Alps). Tree-ring analysis of 104 increment cores, 118 wedges and 93 cross-sections from 154 injured broad-leaved trees allowed the reconstruction of 14 debris-flow events between AD 1965 and 2007. These events were compared with archival records on debris-flow activity at Illgraben. It appears that debris flows are very common at Illgraben, but only very rarely left the channel over the period AD 1965 – 2007. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of disturbed trees contributed to the identification of six patterns of debris-flow routing and led to the determination of preferential breakout locations of events. The results of this study demonstrate the high potential of broad-leaved trees for dendrogeomorphic research and for the assessment of the travel distance and lateral spread of debris-flow surges...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains {{evaluation of}} the growth dynamics and nutritional status of tree species plantations after application of biological and chemical amelioration treatments, impact of trees on quality of soil and on the accumulation of surface humus. There were evaluated: Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), Blue spruce (Picea pungens Engelm.), Birch (Betula spp.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), <b>Gray</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus incana Moench.), Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.), Eastern White pine (Pinus strobus L.) and Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.). On 4 research plots in Boleboř (Ore Mts.) was measured height, thickness of root collar, breast-height diameter. Were taken samples of soil, weed and assimilation apparatus. There was determined yellowing, browsing, plants mortality and calculated amount of accumulated surface humus. Application of fertilizer Silvamix Forte on spreading windrows reduced mortality and increased increment for the first 3 years, the effect is evident even after 10 years. It was not confirmed the attractiveness of plants for wildlife after Silvamix Forte application. Silvamix Mg fertilizer application had minimal effect on the growth dynamics and nutrient contents in needles. Positively impacted soil characteristics, increased {{the value of the}} cation exchange capacity, decrease in hydrolytic acidity, increase the saturation of sorption bases, decrease of aluminium ions Al 3 + and decrease of Fe 2 O 3. On fertilized plots increased content of available nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium, increase of the total supply of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium. The rapid increase in the content of Ca and Mg is related to the liming in 2002. Fertilizer application significantly supported the development of ground-weed on plots of Colorado blue spruce mixed with birch, while in pure stands of Colorado blue spruce led to a reduction in aboveground biomass. For the Colorado blue spruce mixed with birch plot compared with only Colorado blue spruce plot were documented favourable soil properties, increased supply of total nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Rowan tree on an intact soil surface exhibits the lowest reaction pH as humus and in the mineral, high hydrolytic acidity, extremely sorption unsaturated soil state, high content of ion Al 3 + and low content of available calcium, although was applied liming. Technical and biological reclamation (Boleboř III.) has a long-term positive effect on the average height and breast-height diameter of Colorado blue spruce and white pine. The growth dynamics of European larch and Lodgepole pine were affect only at the beginning. Meliorated stand of <b>Gray</b> <b>Alder</b> has very good growth dynamics, comparable with Larch and Lodgepole pine. The big problem is the game impact, especially in Lodgepole pine, which led to the destruction of all individuals. Colorado Blue spruce in terms of biological reclamation is totally inappropriate. This Spruce has reduced resistance to abiotic factors, which often suffer uprooting and breakage. During the 21 years the Clorado Blue spruce mixed with birch accumulated of 66, 09 t. ha- 1 humus matter with better properties also in the deeper horizon. Colorado Blue spruce accumulated 54, 11 t. ha- 1 of humus matter. Rowan tree accumulated on the intact soil largest amount of humus matter (194, 98 t. ha- 1), however acidifies the deeper horizons. The stand of Norway Spruce occurred during the reporting period a decrease of 47 % to 107, 03 t. ha- 1. The decline may be associated with more open stand and due to air liming...|$|E
30|$|For Central European Russia, it {{was shown}} that pioneer trees, such as European white birch (Betula pendula), <b>gray</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus incana), or goat willow (Salix caprea), can settle on {{abandoned}} arable lands within the first 2  years, and in very high densities (Utkin et al. 2002, 2005). Intensive natural thinning of such stands occurs especially between 4 to 10  years of age while {{the density of the}} stands remains relatively high: up to 110, 000 ind/ha were counted in 5 -year-old Alnus incana stands (Gulbe 2012) and up to 66, 000 ind/ha in 10 -year-old Betula pendula stands (Gulbe 2009). Further, 30 -year-old Betula pendula forest developed on formerly plowed fields located within an old-growth multi-species broad-laved forest in the Kaluzhskie zaseki Reserve held between 500 to 1725 ind/ha in the overstorey (Smirnova et al. 2017). In this 30 -year-old birch forest, in a 100 -m-wide zone along the old-growth forest margin, shade-tolerant trees predominated in the understory: the total number of tree individuals varied from 20, 558 to 83, 314 ind/ha; European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides) dominated. European aspen (Populus tremula), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and Norway spruce (Picea abies), as well as birch and goat willow, also occurred in former fields located in the middle and south taiga (Novoselova et al. 2016). Spontaneous regrowth of forest vegetation occurs even in the fields that have been in agricultural use {{for a long period of}} time (up to several centuries and longer) (Utkin et al. 2002, 2005). However, as many researchers have noted, the density of the undergrowth in the regenerating forest vegetation on former arable lands varies greatly within the same climatic conditions and sometimes there are no trees at all (Utkin et al. 2002; Prévosto et al. 2011; Ruskule et al. 2012; Prishchepov et al. 2013; Novoselova et al. 2016; Baeva et al. 2017; Jagodziński et al. 2017; Telesnina et al. 2017; Kalinina et al. 2018; Maslov et al. 2018). Reasons of such striking differences in the undergrowth volume are not well investigated (Prévosto et al. 2011; Ruskule et al. 2012; Novoselova et al. 2016). We propose that grass fires are the most important factors defining the successional trajectory on formerly plowed fields. The lack of research on this topic may be due to the fact that it is not easy to register grass fires, especially in remote fields; their traces can disappear rather quickly and it can be difficult to identify the occurrence of spring grass fires in an area after just several weeks. Another possible reason for the lack of researches on this topic may be that abandoned plowed land without grazing is a rare phenomenon all over the world, whereas it is common in Russia and Eastern Europe. Even so, such abandoned areas are large and their input in the general biogeochemical cycles and regular ecological processes over the world is significant.|$|E
40|$|Innerdalen {{was once}} a {{mountain}} valley (ca. 780 m a. s. l.) with birch forests, bogs and several summer farms. Today it is a 6. 5 km** 2 artifical lake. In 1980 and 1981 archaeological and palynological investigations were carried out due to the hydroelectric power plans. Radiocarbon dated pollen diagrams from 9 different localities in Innerdalen provide information on a mountain environment which has been exploited to varying degrees by human groups for thousands of years. In the Birch Zone, ca. 9500 - 8500 years B. P., the deglaciated surface is vegetated by the normal sequence of pioneering species, first show-bed communities, then shrub/dwarf-shrub communities, and finally a birch forest community. In the Pine Zone, ca. 8500 - 7500 years B. P., the mixed Birch-Pine forest which prevailed {{at the end of}} the Birch Zone is replaced by a dense pine forest. The tree limit was higher than it is today. In the Alder Zone, ca. 7500 - 4000 years B. P., the newly arrived alder gradually succeeded pine, particularily on good soils. This alder forest has a modem analog in the pre-alpine <b>gray</b> <b>alder</b> forests in Norway. In the last part of the Alder Zone, ca. 6000 - 4000 years B. P., elm and hazel are nominally present on particularily rich soils, marking the edaphic and climatic optimum in Innerdalen. During this time the first evidence of human impact on the vegetation is apparent in the pollen diagrams. At both Sætersetra in the south of the valley and Liabekken in the north, forest clearance and the development of grazed grass meadows is documented, and human impact continues until the present. The Herb Zone, ca. 4000 years B. P. to 1600 A. D., is characterized by the rapid decline of alder. The forest is increasingly open, and bog formation is initiated. The sub-alpine belt of birch forest is established, probably due to the shift to a cooler, moister climate. Human activity can also have influenced the vegetational changes, although at 4 of the localities human activity also is first apparent after the alder decline. Some localities show measurably less human impact on the vegetation ca. 2600 - 2000 years B. P. Grazing intensity increases ca. 2000 years B. P. At the end of the Herb Zone rye and barley pollen is registered at Sætersetra and Flonan, indicating contact between the grazing activities of Innerdal and grain cultivation activities outside the valley. The Spruce Zone, ca. 1600 A. D. to the present, does not begin synchronously since the presence of long-distance transported spruce pollen at a locality is entirely dependent on the density of the vegetation ie. degree of human impact. The youngest spruce rise is ca. 1500 A. D. at Røstvangen, when summerfarming is initiated. Summerfarming activities in Innerdal produce an increasingly open landscape. Rye and barley pollen at several localities may indicate limited local cultivation, but is more likely long-distance transport via humans and domesticated animals from cultivated areas outside Innerdalen...|$|E
