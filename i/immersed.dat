5|$|Gandhi was cremated per the Hindu tradition. Gandhi's ashes were {{poured into}} urns which were sent across India for {{memorial}} services. Most of the ashes were <b>immersed</b> at the Sangam at Allahabad on 12 February 1948, but some were secretly taken away. In 1997, Tushar Gandhi <b>immersed</b> {{the contents of}} one urn, found in a bank vault and reclaimed through the courts, at the Sangam at Allahabad. Some of Gandhi's ashes were scattered at {{the source of the}} Nile River near Jinja, Uganda, and a memorial plaque marks the event. On 30 January 2008, the contents of another urn were <b>immersed</b> at Girgaum Chowpatty. Another urn is at the palace of the Aga Khan in Pune (where Gandhi was held as a political prisoner from 1942 to 1944) and another in the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja {{on the night of}} Diwali, the festival of lights. On one Kali puja night, he {{performed}} the puja and sang throughout the night. In the morning, Ramprasad carried the jar of Divine Mother's sanctified water on his head to the Ganges. He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be <b>immersed</b> in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was <b>immersed,</b> Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

25|$|There are differing customs {{about how}} many immersions are {{performed}} at each visit to a mikveh. It is the custom of many in the Orthodox community to <b>immerse</b> at least twice. Accordingly, they would <b>immerse,</b> recite the blessing, then <b>immerse</b> again. The other opinion states that like other commandments, here too the blessing should be recited before performing the commandment.|$|R

5|$|<b>Immersed</b> curves on Riemannian manifolds, with finitely many self-crossings, become self-tangent {{only at a}} {{discrete}} set of times, at each of which they lose a crossing. As a consequence the number of self-crossing points is non-decreasing.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, actor Christian Bale was <b>immersed</b> in {{shooting}} a scene {{for the film}} Terminator Salvation in New Mexico. While performing with actress Bryce Dallas Howard, Bale shouted at the film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, for walking into his line of sight. Hurlbut responded calmly, apologized to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.|$|E

5|$|Curves {{that have}} self-crossings may reach {{singularities}} before contracting to a point. For instance, if a lemniscate (any smooth <b>immersed</b> curve {{with a single}} crossing, resembling a figure 8 or infinity symbol) has unequal areas in its two lobes, then eventually the smaller lobe will collapse to a point. However, if the two lobes have equal areas, then they will remain equal throughout {{the evolution of the}} curve, and the isoperimetric ratio will diverge as the curve collapses to a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins dispose {{their dead}} by {{cremation}}. The dead person's son carries the corpse to the cremation ground atop a bier. The eldest son lights {{the fire to}} the corpse at the head for males and at the feet for females. The ashes are gathered in an earthen pitcher and <b>immersed</b> in a river {{on the third day}} after the death. This is a 13-day ritual with the pinda being offered to the dead soul on the 11th and a Śrāddha ceremony followed by a funeral feast on the 13th. Cremation is performed according to vedic rites, usually within a day of the individual's death. Like all other Hindus, the preference is for the ashes to be <b>immersed</b> in the Ganges river or Godavari river. Śrāddha becomes an annual ritual in which all forefathers of the family who have passed on are remembered. These rituals are expected to be performed only by male descendants, preferably the eldest son of the deceased.|$|E

The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted.

Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's footwear included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high boots, ankle boots, trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but <b>immersed</b> curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Royal Question, national priorities shifted to other political questions. On 17 September 1950, the government of Joseph Pholien announced its intention of dispatching Belgian volunteers to fight in the Korean War. Negotiations about the European Defence Community followed and, by the mid-1950s, Belgium was <b>immersed</b> in a new political crisis, known as the Second School War, surrounding the secularisation of education.|$|E
