5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder of that <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} days of July, the 24th Infantry {{generally}} tried to hold positions during the <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> withdrew at night. Their performance was mixed; during the first few North Korean attacks, most units held positions until they ran out of ammunition. Higher officers attempted to move the units back in position but were unsuccessful in the face of mounting North Korean resistance. Notably, L Company fought until surrounded by North Korean attackers; the rest of the regiment was able to drive them off.|$|E

5|$|Cena made a {{surprise}} return {{as the final}} participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's No Way Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him not getting the championship. The night after No Way Out, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match, making it a triple threat match also involving Triple H, during which he was pinned by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, {{in which he was}} pinned by Orton. Triple H won the title during that match, during which Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment <b>Day</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> at One Night Stand in a First Blood match. JBL, however, defeated him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{suppose the}} {{operator}} chose the message setting KYG for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors {{to the ground}} setting, which might be GBL on that particular <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter KYGKYG (which might come out to something like QZKBLX). The operator would then reposition the rotors at KYG, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited {{to break into the}} cipher.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili was {{the second}} deadliest and second costliest {{hurricane}} of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, being surpassed by Hurricane Isidore, which affected the same areas around a week before Lili. Lili was the twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the open Atlantic on September 21. It continued westward, affecting the Lesser Antilles as a tropical storm, then entered the Caribbean. As it moved west, the storm dissipated while being affected by wind shear south of Cuba, and regenerated when the vertical wind shear weakened. It turned to the northwest and strengthened up to category 2 strength on October 1. Lili made two landfalls in western Cuba later that <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> entered the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane rapidly strengthened on October 2, reaching Category4 strength that afternoon. It weakened rapidly thereafter, and hit Louisiana as a Category1 hurricane on October 3. It moved inland and dissipated on October 6.|$|E

5|$|Meyer and {{his friend}} Denny Martin Flinn wrote the {{screenplay}} by the nascent means of e-mail; Meyer lived in Europe while Flinn was based in Los Angeles. The pair worked out a system where Flinn would write all <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> send the draft to Meyer, who would read and make revisions. The script constantly changed because of demands made {{not only by the}} core cast, but also the supporting players. Flinn was aware that the film would be the last to feature the cast of the original television series, so he wrote an opening that embraced the passage of time. In the opening, each of the crew was to be rounded up out of unhappy retirement for one final mission.|$|E

5|$|The 1945 Homestead {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense tropical cyclone to strike the U.S. state of Florida since 1935. The ninth tropical storm, third hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, it developed east-northeast of the Leeward Islands on September12. Moving briskly west-northwestward, the storm became a major hurricane on September13. The system moved over the Turks and Caicos Islands the following <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Andros on September15. Later that day, the storm peaked as a Category4 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 130mph (215km/h). Late on September15, the hurricane made landfall on Key Largo and then in southern Miami-Dade County, and across Homestead, FL where much damage was done and winds were clocked at Homestead Army Air Corps Base at 145mph.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nephrotoxicity is {{a serious}} side effect of using gentamicin. Garlic is an {{important}} component in the complementary medicine. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether garlic has ameliorative effects on gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Methods: 50 male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups of 10; I: They kept in the same condition as others without receiving any drug for 10 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sacrificed. II: Rats in this group were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) with 100 mg/kg of gentamicin for 10 consecutive <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sacrificed. Group III: Rats in this group received garlic juice 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 10 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sacrificed. IV: Rats in this group received gentamicin for 10 days, then received 20 mg/kg garlic intraperitoneally for the next 10 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sacrificed on <b>day</b> 20 th. V: Rats in this group received a combination of intraperitoneal gentamicin and garlic 20 mg/kg for 10 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sacrificed. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) were measured and the kidneys were processed for histopathological examinations. All specimens were examined for morphologic parameters involving tubular cells. Findings: The post administration of garlic after gentamicin treatment potentially attenuated the serum levels of BUN and Cr. The pathology damage scores indicated that post administration of garlic after 10 days of gentamicin treatment attenuated the damage score significantly. Conclusion: We concluded that garlic is a nephroprotective drug to attenuate tubular injury by gentamicin...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Diarra {{struggled}} with a thigh injury and didn't appear {{with the team}} for almost three months. In March 2007, he finally returned to the team in its 3–1 win over Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne appearing as a substitute. During the season, Diarra complained twice with regards to playing time, which led to Houllier equivocally questioning Diarra's ego. The feud culminated on 6 April when Houllier dropped Diarra from the squad to face Valenciennes the following <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> ordered him {{to play for the}} club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth level of French football. Diarra refused the orders and Houllier responded by reportedly threatening not to play him {{for the rest of the}} season. The Lyon manager later stated the Diarra should issue an apology to him and the team. The defensive midfielder did not budge and, subsequently, missed the team's next four league matches, as well as the 2007 Coupe de la Ligue Final. Diarra returned to the team on 28 April playing the entire match in a 3–1 win over Le Mans. He repeated this feat in three of the team's last five matches as Lyon were crowned champions for the sixth consecutive season. Included in one of those three matches was Diarra's first league goal for the club, which came in a 3–0 victory over his former club Lens.|$|E
