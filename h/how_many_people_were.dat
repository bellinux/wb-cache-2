5|$|The main {{shopping}} area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success {{due to the}} captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> in or {{would be in the}} town, and concessions were only {{for the duration of the}} war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.|$|E

25|$|An anti-Soviet guerrilla {{movement}} {{known as}} the Metsavennad ("Forest Brothers") developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946–48.

Probably the last Forest Brother was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.|$|E

25|$|Other {{activists in}} California {{originally}} planned {{to hold a}} protest in San Francisco on the Saturday but they changed to the Sunday {{in order not to}} conflict with the city's Chinese New Year's parade. The protest was held on Sunday 16 February. The BBC estimated the crowd size to be 150,000 people, while protest organisers and police agreed that the crowd count was 200,000 people. However, a San Francisco Chronicle photographic investigation estimated that the number in attendance at the peak period was closer to 65,000 people, although it did not state <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> in attendance {{for the duration of the}} demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Exodus says {{each day}} one omer of manna was {{gathered}} per family member (about 3.64 litres), and may imply this was {{regardless of how}} much effort was put into gathering it; a midrash attributed to Rabbi Tanhuma remarks that although some were diligent enough {{to go into the}} fields to gather manna, others just lay down lazily and caught it with their outstretched hands. The Talmud states that this factor was used to solve disputes about the ownership of slaves, since the number of omers of manna each household could gather would indicate <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> legitimately part of the household; the omers of manna for stolen slaves could be gathered only by legitimate owners, and therefore legitimate owners would have spare omers of manna.|$|E
25|$|Landlords were {{responsible}} for paying the rates of every tenant whose yearly rent was £4 or less. Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over £4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, {{there had been some}} clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847. According to James S. Donnelly, Jr., it is impossible to be sure <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.|$|E

25|$|Many events {{illustrate}} {{violence and}} resistance as Aborigines sought {{to protect their}} lands from invasion and as settlers and pastoralists attempted to establish their presence. In May 1804, at Risdon Cove, Van Diemen's Land, perhaps 60 Aborigines were killed when they approached the town. The British established a new outpost in Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) in 1803. Although Tasmanian history is amongst the most contested by modern historians, conflict between colonists and Aborigines was referred to in some contemporary accounts as the Black War. The combined effects of disease, dispossession, intermarriage and conflict saw a collapse of the Aboriginal population of Tasmania from a few thousand people when the British arrived, to a few hundred by the 1830s. Estimates of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> killed during the period begin at around 300, though verification of the true figure is now impossible. In 1830 Governor Sir George Arthur sent an armed party (the Black Line) to push the Big River and Oyster Bay tribes out of the British settled districts. The effort failed and George Augustus Robinson proposed to set out unarmed to mediate with the remaining tribespeople in 1833. With the assistance of Truganini as guide and translator, Robinson convinced remaining tribesmen to surrender to an isolated new settlement at Flinders Island, where most later died of disease.|$|E

There is [...] conflicting information about <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> killed at Omarska. According to survivors, usually about 30 and sometimes as many as 150 men were singled-out and killed in the camp every night. The U.S. State Department and other governments believe that, at a minimum, hundreds of detainees, whose identities are known and unknown, did not survive; many others were killed during the evacuation of the camps in the Prijedor area.|$|E
50|$|Audience {{measurement}} measures <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> in an audience, {{usually in}} relation to radio listenership and television viewership, but also {{in relation to}} newspaper and magazine readership and, increasingly, web traffic on websites. Sometimes, the term is used as pertaining to practices which help broadcasters and advertisers determine who is listening rather than just <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> listening. In {{some parts of the}} world, the resulting relative numbers are referred to as audience share, while in other places the broader term market share is used.
