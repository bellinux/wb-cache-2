I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made me <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{depositions}} for the case, Trump told {{attorneys in}} December 2007, [...] "My net worth fluctuates, {{and it goes}} {{up and down with}} markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings." [...] Trump clarified, [...] "Yes, even my own feelings as to where the world is, where the world is going, and that can change rapidly from day to day. Then you have a September 11th, and you don't <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> about yourself and you don't <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> about the world and you don't <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> about New York City. Then you have a year later, and the city is as hot as a pistol. Even months after that it was a different feeling. So yeah, even my own feelings affect my value to myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The track [...] "Sober", {{which is}} the album's second single, was written by Pink at a party hosted at her home, where {{everyone}} was drunk or drinking except for her, and she wanted them all to leave. She went {{to the beach and}} had a line in her head saying [...] "How do I <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> sober?". Eventually {{it had nothing to do}} with alcohol but with identities. [...] "How do I <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> with just me, without anyone to lean on?", Pink said in an interview.|$|E

These are luxuries that we just don't appreciate every day." ...|$|E

60|$|Sure enough, the old cow {{was in the}} stable, and {{she gave}} Jim Leonard a snort of welcome and then lowed anxiously. He fumbled through the dark to her side, and began to milk her. She had been milked {{only a few hours}} before, and so he got only a gourdful from her. But it was all strippings, and rich as cream, and it was smoking warm. It seemed to Jim Leonard that it went down to his very toes when he poured it into his throat, and it made him <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> {{that he did not know}} what to do.|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder if}} you ever read Dickens' Christmas books? I don't know that I would {{recommend}} you to read them, because they are too much perhaps.

60|$|Poor boy! {{the long}} train of exhaustion, deprivation, rudeness, no food, no {{friendly}} word or deed, but {{all kinds of}} upstart airs and impudent, unfeeling speeches and deeds, {{from all kinds of}} small officials (and some big ones), cutting like razors into that sensitive heart, had at last done the job. He now lay, at times out of his head but quite silent, asking nothing of any one, for some days, with death getting a closer and a surer grip upon him; he cared not, or rather he welcomed death. His heart was broken. He felt the struggle to keep up any longer to be useless. God, the world, humanity--all had abandoned him. It would <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> to shut his eyes forever on the cruel things around him and toward him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ever {{since we}} hit the Sacramento Valley," [...] Billy affirmed. [...] "Too much sun ain't good. I've worked that out. Sunshine is like liquor. Did you ever notice how good you felt when the sun come out {{after a week of}} cloudy weather. Well, that {{sunshine}} was just like a jolt of whiskey. Had the same effect. Made you feel good all over. Now, when you're swimmin', an' come out an' lay in the sun, how good you feel. That's because you're lappin' up a sun-cocktail. But suppose you lay there in the sand a couple of hours. You don't <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b> You're so slow-movin' it takes you a long time to dress. You go home draggin' your legs an' feelin' rotten, with all the life sapped outa you. What's that? It's the katzenjammer. You've been soused to the ears in sunshine, like so much whiskey, an' now you're payin' for it. That's straight. That's why fog in the climate is best." ...|$|E
