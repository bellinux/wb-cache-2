5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth.

5|$|Twenty {{years after}} Sarah's death, Joel {{works as a}} {{smuggler}} in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point at the Massachusetts State House. Making their way there, Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy {{in order to continue}} the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him at his settlement in Jackson County, Colorado, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, after which Joel tells her the doctors gave up on discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E

500|$|The head of British Secret Intelligence Service, Stewart Menzies, {{stated that}} Cicero {{was indeed a}} double agent and that among the {{documents}} submitted to the Germans were documents of misinformation. Author James Srodes states in his biography of Allen Dulles that some British historians believed that Cicero was [...] "'turned' into a double agent to send disinformation via von Papen". Malcolm Gladwell, author of Pandora's Briefcase, said that an interviewer had questioned Menzies before he died about whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Menzies told the interviewer [...] "Of course, Cicero was under our control," [...] but his truthfulness is questioned. Gladwell stated {{in an article in}} The New Yorker; [...] "if you had been the wartime head of M.I.6, giving an interview shortly before your death, you probably would say that Cicero was one of yours." [...] Gladwell also mentions that while Ribbentrop was wary of Bazna, which curtailed the dissemination of some of Bazna's intelligence, most German intelligence officials were not wary of him.|$|E

[...] He said that Johnny had a birthmark on his chest, a scar on his tongue and a burn scar on his lower leg; although {{a description of the}} birthmark had been widely circulated, information about the scars had not been made public. Bonacci also described a stammer that Johnny had when he was upset. The FBI and local police do not believe that Bonacci is a credible witness in the case and have not interviewed him.|$|E
2500|$|While Dr. Evans {{claims that}} Britten using his two realities is good, Dr. Lee notes that Britten's two realities are [...] "problems" [...] rather than [...] "tools". However, Britten {{claims that he}} is fine with both realities. Meanwhile, Hannah goes to Cole's house and tells him she opened the box; he {{confirms}} {{that there is a}} camshaft inside. When she asks why Rex had the parts shipped to Cole's house, Cole takes her to a storage facility and shows her the motorcycle they were rebuilding. Hannah tells Cole to finish it, because Rex would have wanted him to. While Britten and Vega interview people in the neighborhood about Mackenzie's death, Britten finally finds a homeless man (Jeris Lee Poindexter) who recognizes MacKenzie's photo and talks to him. The man tells the detectives that he saw an [...] "angry little guy" [...] shoot MacKenzie. After transferring to the [...] "green reality" [...] Bird brings in a suspect, Dr. Arthur Taylor (Jordan Lund), but Britten is convinced of his innocence when he discovers that Taylor is [...] Taylor claims that he was at home watching television, and Britten asks him what he was watching that night. Hearing that Taylor was watching Sunday Night Football, Britten asks what in particular the commentators said at that time. Taylor describes the commentary in detail; Britten and Bird check the broadcast, and confirm that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Police tech Nat (Jay Seals) confirms that someone hacked the clinic computer system and deleted a number of patient records. The IP address belongs to Laura Harvison, one of the clinic clients. Nat figures she does not have the computer skills to pull it off, but confirms that her 17-year-old son Sam (Brian Norris) might have.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} I was {{staggered}} by John Stumpy's announcement.

60|$|I {{was rather}} puzzled {{by this man}} and his way of speech. It was evident to me from his manner that in the main <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> but somehow he seemed {{different}} from the ordinary run of Zulus, and I rather mistrusted his offer to come without pay. Being in a difficulty, I translated his words to Sir Henry and Good, and asked them their opinion.|$|E

There was an air of openness and honesty {{in the manner in which}} Marco related these facts, which convinced Forester that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E

60|$|At {{the time}} I knew {{him he was}} dabbling in Satanism, magic and the occult. There was just then {{something}} of a vogue in Paris {{for that sort of}} thing, occasioned, I surmise, by the interest that was still taken in a book of Huysmans's, Là Bas. Crowley told fantastic stories of his experiences, {{but it was hard to}} say whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> or merely pulling your leg. During that winter I saw him several times, but never after I left Paris to return to London. Once, long afterwards, I received a telegram from him which ran as follows: 'Please send twenty-five pounds at once. Mother of God and I starving. Aleister Crowley.' I did not do so, and he lived on for many disgraceful years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lontulu, {{the senior}} chief of Bolima, came with twenty witnesses, [...] {{which was all}} the canoe would hold. He brought with him one hundred [...] and ten twigs, each of which {{represented}} a life sacrificed for rubber. [...] The twigs were of different lengths and represented chiefs, men, women [...] and children, according to their length. It was a horrible story of [...] massacre, mutilation and cannibalism {{that he had to}} tell, and it was [...] perfectly clear that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> He was further [...] supported by other eye-witnesses. These crimes were committed by those [...] who were acting under the instructions and with the knowledge of white [...] men. On one occasion the sentries were flogged because they had not [...] killed enough people. At one time, after they had killed a number of [...] people, including Isekifasu, the principal chief, his wives and [...] children, the bodies, except that of Isekifasu, were cut up, and the [...] cannibalistic fighters attached to the A.B.I.R. force were rationed on [...] the meat thus supplied. The intestines, etc., were hung up in and [...] about the house, and a little child who had been cut in halves was [...] impaled. After one attack, Lontulu, the chief, was shown the dead [...] bodies of his people, and asked by the rubber agent if he would bring [...] in rubber now. He replied that he would. Although a chief of [...] considerable standing, he has been flogged, imprisoned, tied by the [...] neck with men who were regarded as slaves, made to do the most menial [...] work, and his beard, which was of many years' growth, and reached [...] almost to the ground, was cut off by the rubber agent because he [...] visited another town." ...|$|E
60|$|And now, {{in these}} days,--the days {{immediately}} following the departure of Luke Rowan from Baslehurst,--the Tappitt family were constrained {{to work very hard}} at the task of defaming the young man who had lately been living with them in their house. They were constrained to do this by the necessities of their position; and in doing so by no means showed themselves to be such monsters of iniquity as the readers of the story will feel themselves inclined to call them. As for Tappitt himself, he certainly believed that Rowan was so base a scoundrel that no evil words against him could be considered as malicious or even unnecessary. Is it not good to denounce a scoundrel? And if the rascality of any rascal be specially directed against oneself and one's own wife and children, is it not a duty to denounce that rascal, so that his rascality may be known and thus made of no effect? When Tappitt declared in the reading-room at the Dragon, and afterwards in the little room inside the bar at the King's Head, and again to a circle of respectable farmers and tradesmen in the Corn Market, that young Rowan had come down to the brewery and made his way into the brewery-house with a ready prepared plan for ruining him--him, the head of the firm,--he thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> And again, when he spoke with horror of Rowan's intention of setting up an opposition brewery, his horror was conscientious. He believed that it would be very wicked in a man to oppose the Bungall establishment with money left by Bungall,--that it would be a wickedness than which no commercial rascality could be more iniquitous. His very soul was struck with awe at the idea. That anything was due in the matter to the consumer of beer, never occurred to him. And it may also be said in Tappitt's favour that his opinion,--as a general opinion,--was backed by those around him. His neighbours could not be made to hate Rowan as he hated him. They would not declare the young man to be the very Mischief, as he did. But that idea of a rival brewery was distasteful to them all. Most of them knew that the beer was almost too bad to be swallowed; but they thought that Tappitt had a vested interest in the manufacture of bad beer;--that as a manufacturer of bad beer he was a fairly honest and useful man;--and they looked upon any change as the work, or rather the suggestion, of a charlatan.|$|E
