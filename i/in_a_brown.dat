5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
5|$|Mark's ex-girlfriend, Lana Turnboldt, has {{a picnic}} with her fiancé at the secluded {{place in the}} mountains, where they {{discover}} Mr. Griffin's medicine bottle. The police investigate, and find Mr. Griffin's body buried nearby. However, police do not find the ring Mr. Griffin was wearing when he died as David had taken it. Irma Ruggles, David's paternal grandmother who lives with him, discovers the ring and refuses {{to give it back}} to him, believing the ring to be that of David's father who had left him. David tells Susan he took the ring and his grandmother found it, but they are unsuccessful at retrieving it from her, so Susan tells Mark about the situation because she feels he would know what to do. Irma Ruggles is later murdered, and a neighbor refers to the suspect as a boy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> sweater. Susan makes the connection, knowing that Mark has a brown sweater he wears all the time, and that Mark would stop at nothing to get what he needed – in this case, the ring.|$|E

Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to have a drink with Elizabeth Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time.

500|$|The cap is {{hemispherical}} to convex, reaching [...] in diameter, although {{specimens of}} [...] {{have been found}} in some cases. Slightly velvety and lobed or dented, it is dark brown, greyish-brown, violet brown, or purple brown, often with copper, golden, or olivaceous patches. The stipe is [...] high by [...] wide, usually shorter than the cap diameter, initially barrel shaped but gradually becoming club shaped and tapering at the base. The stipe is pale brown, chestnut, or reddish brown in colour, covered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> or concolorous reticulation. Like in other boletes, there are tubes rather than gills {{on the underside of the}} cap. The tube openings—known as pores—are small and rounded. Whitish or greyish-white when young, they slowly become yellowish or greenish yellow at maturity, and can turn wine coloured with bruising. The tubes themselves are initially white, later becoming yellowish or olivaceous. The thick flesh is white, exudes a robust and pleasant smell reminiscent of hazelnuts, and has a mild sweet taste.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} of [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] was co-directed by Usher and music video {{director}} Chris Robinson, who also directed the video for the album's fourth single, [...] "My Boo". [...] "Confessions (Interlude)" [...] {{serves as the}} opening of the video. Set in a studio, Usher receives a phone message and finds out that he impregnated his mistress.

He occasionally shows a large ring on his ring finger. In the middle of the video, he lies on a piano and in his imagination, his woman and mistress are beside him. The next scene shows Usher <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>brown</b> car singing, goes out and kneels before his woman to confess. She refuses to listen and slaps Usher, then leaves and he becomes shirtless.

Several instances in the video are unknown as in the scene in which Usher takes a phone call, unknown to the viewer for [...] "business or pleasure," [...] as explained by James Montgomery of MTV News. In describing the video, he went on to say, [...] "...you can kind of see why it'd be about both. Such is the life he's chosen, and now he must deal with the repercussions." [...] In following scenes the threat of infidelity is seen even clearer as Usher gets close to the [...] "over-friendly dancers" [...] and [...] "sipping — and spitting — champagne in a place that looks very much like a strip club." ...|$|E
500|$|The Old Stone House (3051 M Street NW) {{was built}} in 1765 by Christopher and Rachel Layman.
