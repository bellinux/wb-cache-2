5|$|In February 1866, having briefly {{served at}} Iași's Pantelimon Church, he was welcomed by hegumen Isaia Vicol Dioclias {{into the service}} of Golia Monastery. Around 1867, his wife Ileana left him. After that moment, Creangă began losing {{interest}} in performing his duties in the clergy, and, while <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to hide {{that he was no}} longer living with his wife, took a mistress. The marriage's breakup was later attributed by Creangă himself to Ileana's adulterous affair with a Golia monk, and rumors spread that Ileana's lover was a high-ranking official, the protopope of Iași. Creangă's accusations, Călinescu contends, are nevertheless dubious, because the deacon persisted in working for the same monastery after the alleged incident.|$|E

Although he took responsibility for the first goal conceded, manager Joachim Löw refused to blame him and instead commended him for <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best.</b>|$|E

25|$|However, the new home, while splendidly {{located in}} an 18th-century house {{surrounded}} by a park and woodlands, caused financial difficulties that almost brought Pearse to disaster. He strove continually to keep ahead of his debts while <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to maintain the school. In February 1914, he went on a fund-raising trip to the United States, where he met John Devoy and Joseph McGarrity {{both of whom were}} impressed by his fervour and supported him in raising sufficient money to secure the continued existence of the school.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginnings}} of Blind Faith begin in mid-1968, with the break-up of Cream. Today {{considered to be}} the first true super group, Cream had become a financial powerhouse, selling millions of records within a few years and bringing international popularity to both the group and each individual member. Despite that success, the band was crumbling from within because of frequent animosity between Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, with Eric Clapton <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to mediate. In addition, Clapton had tired of playing commercially-driven blues and hoped to move forward with a new, experimental, less straitjacketed approach to the genre.|$|E
25|$|There {{is usually}} a hum of {{expectancy}} when Holmes and Sutcliffe appear, their faces wreathed in smiles, and chatting happily together. They seem to be sharing some all-absorbing joke. Holmes, proudly wearing his Yorkshire cap, walks with quick, short steps, shoulders erect and head in the air, <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to look as tall as (John) Tunnicliffe. Sutcliffe has dark, glossy hair and usually disdains the valued White Rose cap when batting. He strolls casually along {{by the side of}} Percy, keeping his weather eye open for the wicket-keeper's end and the honour of taking the first ball.|$|E
500|$|John Fleming and Colin McWilliam are in {{agreement}} that Adam was at <b>his</b> <b>best</b> as a collaborator. Fleming's comment that Adam [...] "was at <b>his</b> <b>best</b> when guided by a man of taste who knew his own mind", is echoed by McWilliam, who suggests that William Adam [...] "always <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best,</b> but <b>did</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> architecture... {{when he was in}} touch not only with his source books, but with other lively minds".|$|R

25|$|The French fleet, {{on course}} to {{approach}} the coasts of Galicia, captured two Spanish merchant ships, an error which alerted the Governor at the time, Don Sancho de Leyva, who immediately sent emissaries to Bazán warning {{of the presence of}} the fleet and its course. Bazán, having been detached from his army and especially the soldiers sent to Flanders at that time, was <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to finish fitting out his ships, as he only had at his disposal a few thousand soldiers. Reading the messages of Leiva, he sent for reinforcements, and was quickly reinforced with 500 arquebusiers.|$|E
500|$|The obituarist for The Times {{highlighted}} Horne's [...] "remarkably skilful {{but very}} personal comic technique" [...] of playing [...] "a friendly good-natured old buffer who was simply <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best,</b> apparently lost in wonder, at the glossier, more spectacular talents of those among whom he found himself". The media analysts Frank Krutnik and Steve Neale see a similar role, and consider that [...] "Horne functioned, like [...] Benny, [...] Allen and [...] Handley before him, as a 'stooge' {{rather than a}} joke-wielder, frequently switching roles between announcer and in-sketch performer".|$|E
500|$|Foraker was not {{actively}} involved in the controversy, and in the sole interview he gave, said he was <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to keep out of it. [...] Nevertheless, most of Hanna's Republican opponents were from Foraker's wing of the party. [...] Ohio's senior senator did, however, state his belief that Hanna would have a difficult time being elected. When asked by Hanna supporters to intercede with the insurgents, Foraker responded, [...] "I will not antagonize lifetime friends for Hanna," [...] and that Hanna was [...] "not honorable enough" [...] to go to Bushnell and Kurtz and work out a solution.|$|E

Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father [...] "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> {{to make up for lost}} time." [...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD. For the release of the mini album Come On Pilgrim, Thompson adopted the alias [...] "Black Francis", a name inspired by his father: [...] "he had been saving that name in case he had another son." ...|$|E
500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Stone's {{performance}} and Raimi's directing. [...] "Stone's presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Raimi, the cult filmmaker now <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> {{to reinvent the}} B movie {{in a spirit of}} self-referential glee." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the film for being overtly cliché, but praised Raimi's direction and Dante Spinotti's cinematography. Critic and Raimi biographer Bill Warren wrote that the film [...] "is a very conscious (though not self-conscious) attempt to recreate some of the themes, style and appeal of Sergio Leone's majestically operatic Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s, especially the Man with No Name trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood. It's brisker, more romantic and somehow more American than Leone's movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Corporate informs Michael Scott (Steve Carell) that an {{incentive}} {{program has been}} set up where the top Dunder Mifflin sales representative will be rewarded with a prize of up to $1000. [...] As Michael decides on choosing that prize, Katy Moore (Amy Adams), a pretty young purse saleswoman, comes into the office to sell her wares. When Michael sees her, he offers to let her set up shop in the conference room, which catches every male's eye. As he shows her around the office, Michael tries to impress her while <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to impede the chances of any other office male. Roy Anderson mentions that he would go for her if he were not dating Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and an angry Pam corrects him that they are engaged.|$|E

500|$|Critics also {{praised the}} quality and {{maturity}} of the band's songwriting. Corey Deiterman of the Houston Press called The Pale Emperor a [...] "triumphant return to the songwriting principles that made him famous in the first place." [...] In a positive review for Yahoo! Music, Allan Raible highlighted the album's focus on songcraft instead of shock value. Similarly, Kerrang! said that it [...] "trades shock-tastic thrills for something even darker", calling it [...] "brave, smart and intriguing." [...] Dean Brown of The Quietus said Manson was a revitalized performer, and praised the record for its addictive hooks. Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News, who regarded The Pale Emperor as the band's first excellent post-millennial collection of music, praised its lyrical content, saying that Manson sounds [...] "both inspired and disgusted , which is usually the tightrope he walks when he's <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> work." [...] A review for Revolver dubbed it an {{album of the year}} contender, and it topped the publication's weekly readers poll.|$|E
500|$|On May 15, 2010, Brown {{performed}} [...] "Deuces" [...] with Tyga at the [...] "Virginia Stand Up! A Call to Action" [...] benefit concert {{as part of}} a set list, {{which included}} [...] "Say Goodbye", [...] "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)", [...] "Gimme That", [...] "Kiss Kiss", [...] "Take You Down" [...] and [...] "Forever". The concert was organized by Brown to help with continued relief efforts in Haiti following the January 2010 earthquake. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News wrote that [...] "the superstar singer couldn't have been more giving, <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to please the packed house". On December 3, 2010, Brown, wearing a charcoal grey suit with Adidas sneakers, performed the song with Tyga and Kevin McCall as part of his set list at the Cali Christmas concert. In March 2011, Brown and Tyga performed [...] "Deuces" [...] on the television music show, 106 & Park. [...] "Deuces" [...] was also added to the set list of Brown's F.A.M.E. Tour. In his review of the tour, Jeremy Trucker of The Baltimore Sun criticized Brown for lip syncing his performances, and remained unconvinced that Brown's [...] "talent was special enough to warrant his continued, well, fame". In April 2012, Brown performed [...] "Deuces" [...] at the Supafest tour in Australia {{as part of a}} set list, which included [...] "Run It!", [...] "Yeah 3x", [...] "Look at Me Now", [...] "She Ain't You", [...] "Wet the Bed" [...] and [...] "Turn Up the Music", among others. A reviewer for Rap-Up magazine praised his set, writing [...] "A tatted Chris Brown thrilled with his chart-topping hits".|$|E

2500|$|This has led {{a number}} of {{forensic}} pathologists to support Dr. Siebert's diagnosis. Mr. Steve Meadows, the State Attorney who succeeded Mr. Ober, concluded that the criticism of Dr. Siebert was politically motivated. When the Medical Examiner Commission voted not to retain Dr. Siebert following the expiration of his contract, Mr. Meadows appointed Dr. Siebert back into the position as temporary Medical Examiner. Mr. Meadows stated: [...] "I will not sacrifice Charles Siebert {{on the altar of}} political expediency or correctness. Despite what amounts to a reckless character assassination by some media outlets and, regrettably, even some members of our government, I believe Dr. Siebert to be a competent and thorough medical examiner–not beholden to anyone or any cause. Quite simply, Dr. Siebert is a well-qualified doctor <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to serve the people of this district. I am certain that Dr. Siebert looks forward to a hearing before an administrative judge and his first opportunity to respond to the allegations upon which the vote for his removal was based." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 201, after Cao Cao {{defeated}} his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he sent Zhang Liao {{to pacify}} the various counties in Lu State, and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack a}} minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating. Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan, [...] "Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful attention to me. He's also running short of arrows. I suspect he's having doubts, therefore he isn't <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to resist us. Wouldn't it be better if I manage {{to persuade him to}} surrender?" [...] He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi's home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.|$|E
