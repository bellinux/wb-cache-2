5|$|<b>Insomniac</b> had {{exclusively}} developed {{games for}} the PlayStation console until in 2010 when <b>Insomniac</b> announced its partnership with Electronic Arts via EA Partners to develop a multi-platform game for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Studios' Xbox 360 console. The company hoped to reach a wider audience, while keeping the rights to its IP and retain full control of its franchises. The company revealed nothing about the game. The company established a new subsidiary called <b>Insomniac</b> Click, which focused on casual games and games for Facebook. Its first game was not set in any of Insomniac's existing franchises. <b>Insomniac</b> again partnered with Electronic Arts, which owned the popular casual game developer Playfish, to help the game to reach a broad audience. Outernauts was announced shortly after; it was released in July 2012 for browsers and mobile platforms. Click was later re-incorporated into <b>Insomniac,</b> and the browser version of Outernauts was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} {{development with}} Fuse, and beginning began {{soon after the}} completion of Resistance 3, <b>Insomniac</b> Games began development of Sunset Overdrive. The game was inspired by Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank Girl, I Am Legend, The Young One, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. Sunset Overdrive was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac's head was rejected as being too confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game's development. The game was later pitched to various publishers, which rejected them because <b>Insomniac</b> demanded to retain ownership of the IP. The project was later pitched to Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with <b>Insomniac.</b> Microsoft allowed <b>Insomniac</b> to own the rights to the game. Sunset Overdrive was made exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of <b>Insomniac,</b> in 2014.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, <b>Insomniac</b> originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (<b>Insomniac</b> game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after <b>Insomniac</b> considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, <b>Insomniac</b> realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E
40|$|Complaints of daytime {{dysfunction}} {{are common}} among chronic <b>insomniacs,</b> but laboratory comparisons of <b>insomniacs</b> and age-matched and gender-matched normal controls have generally failed to document these complaints. However, a few studies, which allowed subjects {{to sleep in}} their homes on the nights before daytime testing, have shown some relative diurnal deficits among <b>insomniacs.</b> The current study compared the effects of nocturnal laboratory and home polysomnogram (PSG) studies on subsequent daytime test results among older <b>insomniacs</b> and normal sleepers. <b>Insomniacs</b> (n = 32) and normal sleepers (n = 32) {{were randomly assigned to}} first undergo three nights of nocturnal PSG monitoring either in the sleep laboratory (16 <b>insomniacs,</b> 16 normal sleepers) or in their homes (16 <b>insomniacs,</b> 16 normal sleepers). Following the third night of PSG monitoring, subjects spent 1 day in the sleep laboratory, where they completed a four-trial multiple sleep latency test along with four trials of a computer-administered performance test battery. Results showed that <b>insomniacs,</b> as a group, were slightly, albeit consistently, sleepier than were normal sleepers following nights of home sleep monitoring, but a reverse of this trend was found among subjects who underwent nocturnal laboratory PSG before daytime testing. Furthermore, normal sleepers showed faster reaction times on a signal detection task than did <b>insomniacs</b> within the subgroup who underwent home PSGs prior to such testing. However, within the subgroup that underwent nocturnal laboratory PSGs, <b>insomniacs</b> 2 ̆ 7 signal detection reaction times were significantly faster than those shown by normal sleepers. Results provide some support for the speculation that the nocturnal PSG monitoring site, used as a precursor to daytime testing, may systematically affect daytime comparisons between <b>insomniacs</b> and matched controls. Moreover, these results suggest that the use of home-based nocturnal PSG monitoring prior to daytime testing may provide an enhanced understanding of <b>insomniacs</b> 2 ̆ 7 diurnal complaints...|$|R
40|$|The EEG of {{the sleep}} onset period of psychophysiological <b>insomniacs,</b> {{psychiatric}} <b>insomniacs</b> and controls was compared using power spectral analysis (FFT). Eighteen drug-free subjects were equally {{divided into three}} groups according to their responses in the Brock Sleep and Insomnia Questionnaire, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire. Group 1 consisted of psychophysiological <b>insomniacs,</b> group 2 included <b>insomniacs</b> with an indication of psychiatric disturbances, and group 3 was a control group. EEG, EOG and EMG were recorded for two consecutive nights. Power spectral analysis (FFT) of EEG at C 4 from the sleep onset period (defined as lights out to the first five minutes of stage 2) was performed on all standard frequency bands, delta:. 5 - 4 Hz; theta: 4 - 8 Hz; alpha: 8 - 12 Hz; sigma: 12 - 15 Hz beta: 15 - 25 Hz. Psychophysiological <b>insomniacs</b> had less alpha during wakefulness {{than the other two}} groups and did not show the dramatic drop in alpha across the sleep onset period, which characterizes normal sleep. They also had less delta, especially during stage 2 on night 2. They also showed less delta in the last quartile of the chronological analysis of the sleep onset period. Psychiatric <b>insomniacs</b> showed lower relative beta power values overall while psychophysiological <b>insomniacs</b> showed higher relative beta power values during wakefulness. This microanalysis 11 confirms that the sleep onset period is generally similar for psychiatric <b>insomniacs</b> and normal sleepers. This {{may be due to the}} sample of psychiatric <b>insomniacs</b> being heterogeneous or may reflect a sleep onset system that is essentially intact. Psychophysiological <b>insomniacs</b> have higher cortical arousal during the sleep onset period than do the psychiatric <b>insomniacs</b> and the controls. Clear differences in the sleep onset period of psychophysiological <b>insomniacs</b> exist. The dramatic changes in power values in these two groups are not seen in the psychophysiological <b>insomniacs,</b> which may make the discrimination between wakefulness and sleep more difficult...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-five <b>insomniacs</b> and 10 good {{sleepers}} {{slept in}} a laboratory for two consecutive nights, and for an intervening daytime nap session. Each subject was awakened {{at the end of}} the 10 th consecutive epoch of initial Stage 2 sleep and was asked to report on her/his experience of sleep or wakefulness. <b>Insomniacs</b> reported less sleep experience in both the night and nap sessions. Clinical experience and recent research suggest that some <b>insomniacs</b> may experience and/or report the presence of sleep differently than others. For example, subjective <b>insomniacs</b> are now distinguished from psychophysiological <b>insomniacs</b> by their persistent and apparently honest reports of disturbed sleep despite polygraphic evidence of relatively normal sleep (cf., "The Diagnostic Classification of Sleep and Arousal Disorders, " 1979). Moreover, in laboratory studies subjective overestimation of sleep-onset latency by <b>insomniacs</b> is commonly observed (e. g., Carskadon et al., 1976), even when subjective <b>insomniacs</b> are excluded (e. g., Bixler, Kales, Leo, & Slye, 1973). Even more compelling was Slama's (cf., Borkovec, 1979) finding that <b>insomniacs,</b> awakened during a nap session from Stage 2 sleep, reported the presence of sleep significantly less often than good sleepers. The basic purpose of the present study was to replicate this effect and to assess whether the same phenomenon occurs during night sleep. Subject...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Despite many studies, {{the impact}} of chronic {{insomnia}} on daytime functioning is not well understood. The aim of our study was to detect this impact by evaluating quality of life (QoL) using a validated instrument, the 36 -item Short Form Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study (SF- 36), in three matched groups of severe <b>insomniacs,</b> mild <b>insomniacs,</b> and good sleepers selected from the general population. Methods: Three matched groups of 240 severe <b>insomniacs,</b> 422 mild <b>insomniacs,</b> and 391 good sleepers were recruited from the general French population after eliminating those with DSM-IV criteria for anxiety or depression. All {{subjects were asked to}} complete the SF- 36. Scores for each QoL dimension were calculated and compared statistically among the three groups. Results: Severe <b>insomniacs</b> had lower QoL scores in eight dimensions of the SF- 36 than mild <b>insomniacs</b> and good sleepers. Mild <b>insomniacs</b> had lower scores in the same eight dimensions when compared with good sleepers. No dimension was significantly more altered than the other. Conclusions: The mental health status and role of emotional QoL dimensions were worse in severe and mild <b>insomniacs</b> than in good sleepers. This result held even though we screened for psychiatric diseases, which shows a clear interrelation between insomnia and emotional state. General health status was also worse in severe and mild <b>insomniacs</b> than in good sleepers. However, we could conclude only that insomnia was related to a worse health status and not whether it was a cause or consequence of this worse health status. Finally, the degradation of QoL scores was correlated with the severit...|$|R
50|$|A 2011 study {{published}} in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine has shown that sleep misperception (i.e., underestimation of sleep duration) is prevalent among chronic <b>insomniacs</b> who sleep objectively more than 6 hours in the sleep lab. The psychological profile of these chronic <b>insomniacs</b> with objective normal sleep duration is characterized by depressive, anxious-ruminative traits and poor coping resources. Thus, it appears that not all chronic <b>insomniacs</b> underestimate their sleep duration, and that sleep misperception is a clinical characteristic of chronic <b>insomniacs</b> with objective normal sleep duration. Furthermore, rumination and poor coping resources may {{play a significant role in}} sleep misperception.|$|R

40|$|<b>Insomniacs</b> report daytime {{functioning}} problems, but {{studies of}} neurobehavioral functioning in <b>insomniacs</b> have shown little objective evidence of impairment. In addition, {{very little is}} known about the influence of the circadian clock on performance in chronic <b>insomniacs.</b> In the present study, we investigated whether chronic insomnia is associated with an overall performance deficit, and what the effect is of circadian rhythmicity, under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. A 24 -h experiment was carried out under constant routine conditions. Psychomotor performance, body temperature, and subjective functioning of 11 <b>insomniacs</b> and 13 healthy subjects were assessed. The <b>insomniacs</b> showed significant overall performance impairments in vigilance, working memory, and motor control. In addition, body temperature, performance and subjective functioning showed a circadian pattern similar to healthy subjects, with trough values in the late night/early morning and peak values in the early evening. Self-reported functioning among the <b>insomniacs</b> indicated mood disturbances, concentration problems, elevated fatigue and elevated sleepiness. The results indicated that chronic insomnia is associated with a substantial lowering of the 24 -h level of performance and subjective functioning, irrespective of the type of task and/or the particular parameter, and without differential effects of circadian rhythmicity. Apparently, chronic insomnia has a negative impact upon performance as measured under strictly controlled, unmasked conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigate}} whether alterations of sleep propensity or of wake propensity are implicated in sleep initiation disturbances encountered in major depressive insomnia and in primary insomnia. For this purpose, {{the time course of}} electroencephalogram (EEG) power density during the period preceding sleep onset and during the first non-rapid eye movement (REM) period was examined in three age and gender matched groups of 10 women and 11 men (healthy controls, primary <b>insomniacs</b> and depressive <b>insomniacs).</b> In contrast to healthy controls and depressive <b>insomniacs,</b> patients with primary insomnia did not experience a gradual decrease of their alpha and beta 1 power during the sleep onset period and had a lower delta activity in the 5 min preceding sleep onset. Compared with the two other groups, depressive patients exhibit less dynamic changes in slow wave activity during the first non-REM period. The present results suggest that hyperarousal (high 'Process W') may mainly be implicated in the sleep initiation difficulties of primary <b>insomniacs</b> whereas the homeostatic sleep regulation process seems to be partially maintained. In our major depressed patients, the sleep initiation disturbances appeared to relate to a lower sleep pressure (low 'Process S') rather than to hyperarousal. This study supports the idea that different mechanisms are implicated in sleep disturbances experienced by primary <b>insomniacs</b> and major depressive <b>insomniacs.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Non-invasive measures of heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and pre-ejection period (PEP) were collected by impedance cardiography during a night of polysomnographic recording. Frequency domain measures [low-frequency (LF), high-frequency (HF) ] of heart rate variability (HRV) were also estimated. Decrements in HR and CO and increases in SV and HF normalized units (n. u.) were found in both groups after sleep onset compared with wakefulness. Conversely, PEP (related inversely to sympathetic beta-adrenergic activity) showed increases after sleep onset in controls, but remained unchanged in <b>insomniacs.</b> PEP was also significantly lower in <b>insomniacs</b> than in normal sleepers in both conditions.
