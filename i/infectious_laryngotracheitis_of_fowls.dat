40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown (Burner (1)) that the virus of <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls</b> can be readily propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of the developing egg, producing in this situation lesions characterised by ectodermal proliferation {{and the presence of}} intranudear inclusions. The recognition of the disease in New South Wales by Seddon and Hart (2) has stimulated further work on these lines with strains of Australian origin. The lesions produced have been studied in greater detail than previously in the light of further experience with the developing egg technique, and a method of detecting the corresponding antibodies has been developed which has proved of great value in studying the epidemiology of the disease.

40|$|By {{experiments}} {{reported in}} the preceding paper (1) the writer has demonstrated the causative agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> <b>of</b> <b>fowls</b> in tissues in which bacteria were not detected. Efforts were next made {{to determine whether a}} filtrable virus is responsible for the disease. Method In the filtration experiments, 23 inch Berkefeld V and N candles and Seitz discs have been used. The Berkefeld candles were given a preliminary test of their ability to retain bacteria by the filtration of a young (6 to 24 hour) broth culture of a chromogenic strain of B. prodigiosus. A like test was made at each filtration. To determine whether B. prodigiosus or other bacteria were present, two or more blood or plain agar slants were inoculated with 1 loopful of the unfiltered suspensions and other tubes of the same culture media with 0. 5 to 2 cc. of the filtrates. In addition when the suspension was in broth a portion of the filtrate was incubated and examined for growth. The cultures were not discarded until they had been incubated at least 10 days. In all instances the media inoculated with unfiltered material yielded a profuse growth of B. prodigiosus whereas the media inoculated with filtrates remained sterile. The comparative porosity of the Berkefeld filters was determined by the waterflow test of Ward and Tang (2) by which measurement was made of the amount of water that will flow through them in 5 minutes at 10 cm. negative pressure. The Berkefeld V filters and some of the Berkefeld N filters usually permitted from 50 to 80 cc. of water to pass; others of the Berkefeld N filters passed from 28 to 36 cc. of water.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{vaccines}} for the avian {{respiratory disease}} <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> consist <b>of</b> naturally attenuated {{strains of the}} causative agent—the herpesvirus <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus (ILTV). Due to the dissemination of these viruses from vaccinated chickens {{as well as their}} possible reversion to more pathogenic forms, the use of genetically engineered viral vaccines lacking virulence factors while retaining antigenicity is being considered. Since the thymidine kinase (TK) activity of herpesviruses has been associated with virulence, inactivation of the encoding gene in the ILTV genome should attenuate the virus. Moreover, by analogy to other TK- herpesviruses, the ability of such ILTV mutants to induce a protective response in chickens should not be compromised. Therefore, the deliberate genetic alteration of ILTV was attempted. In order to prevent reversion and also to enable identification of the modified virus, a "marker" transcriptional unit (Escherichia coli lacZ gene fused to a SV- 40 3 ′-polyadenylation signal sequence and regulated by the pseudorabies virus gX gene promoter) was inserted via homologous recombination at one of two loci within the ILTV TK gene. Recombinant viruses were identified and plaque-purified {{on the basis of their}} ability to produce β-galactosidase. Retention of the foreign DNA at the predicted sites in the genomes of the recombinant ILTV was verified by Southern hybridization. Since their replication was unaffected by the thymine analog 1 -(2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-β-d-arabinofuranosyl) - 5 -methyluracil, the recombinants appeared to have a TK- phenotype. Despite this apparent deficiency, prior inoculation of either recombinant virus into chickens afforded the birds protection against a lethal challenge of virulent ILTV. Moreover, the degree of respiratory distress in the chickens vaccinated with the recombinants was relatively mild compared to the severe reaction in birds receiving the parental virus. Thus, ILTV can be genetically attenuated without an accompanying loss of immunogenicity...|$|R

The virus itself is classified as an alpha herpesvirus (Gallid herpesvirus 1), with a genome approximately 150, 000 nucleotides in length (49). By using next-generation sequencing (Illumina) technology we have sequenced two field isolates of ILTV. The first isolate (1874 C 5) is a 2005 field isolate from Georgia. The second isolate (632) is a 1985 Delaware field isolate. The sequences of these two isolates were compared to show how similar the strains remain across time and geographical location. The results of sequencing for the 1874 C 5 strain yielded a total of 6, 122, 687 ILTV bases that aligned to the published reference sequence (49).
