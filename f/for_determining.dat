A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the interference pattern and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E

The γ_s^AB values <b>determined</b> <b>for</b> the microalgae and for the cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa are a measure of the hydrophilic repulsion, since these microorganisms presented a hydrophilic surface.

The magnitude of AB interactions increases with increasing surface hydrophobicity (decreasing γ_s^+ and γ_s^-), and species having hydrophilic surface properties experience repulsive acid-base interactions [49]. γ_s^AB values <b>determined</b> <b>for</b> the studied consortia were not statistically different (p[*]=[*] 0.64) from those <b>determined</b> <b>for</b> microorganisms grown in single cultures, ranging from 0.0 [*]±[*] 0.0 to 11.7 [*]±[*] 0.8  mJ m− 2. Since positive G_sws^TOT values were <b>determined</b> <b>for</b> all studied consortia, except for the one composed by both cyanobacteria, γ_s^AB values are a measure of hydrophilic repulsion. In the mixed culture of both cyanobacteria, γ_s^AB indicates the degree of hydrophobic attraction.|$|R
