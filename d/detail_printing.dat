40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} INKtelligent printed sensor structures using maskless depositition technologies. This paper begins with a general introduction to INKtelligent printing. Starting with layout and ink development, the fabrication of printed sensors is described in <b>detail.</b> <b>Printed</b> strain gauges, thermopiles and gas sensitive films are successfully fabricated with maskless deposition technologies, offering advantages for continuous non-destructive measurement compared to conventional sensors. This paper shows a new approach for customized sensor structures. The application of a resource efficient and flexible printing technique for sensor fabrication is demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Lithography uses simple {{chemical}} processes {{to create an}} image. For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("hydrophobic") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("hydrophilic"). Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image. This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more <b>detailed</b> <b>print</b> runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., intaglio printing, letterpress printing).|$|R

50|$|Fuzzy-Felt is {{a simple}} fabric toy {{intended}} for young children. It was created in 1950 by Lois Allan of the United Kingdom. The toys consist of a flocked backing board onto which a number of felt shapes are placed to create different pictures. Felt pieces can be simple silhouettes or more <b>detailed</b> <b>printed</b> shapes. For a farmyard scene, for example, auxiliary pieces would typically be cows, sheep, chickens, horses, cats, dogs, a farmer, and a tractor. Other scenes might include hospital, pets, vehicles. Fuzzy-Felt is for children {{over the age of}} three years, as the pieces may present a choking hazard.|$|R
