40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 185 - 201). Measurements {{of muscle}} activity derived from surface EMG electrodes are variable due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The intrinsic factors are endogenous in nature (features within the body) and include muscle fiber type, muscle fiber diameter and length, {{the amount of}} tissue between muscle and electrode, and depth and location of muscle {{with respect to the}} placement of electrodes (24). These biological factors vary between subjects and cannot be controlled. The extrinsic factors are experimental variables which are influenced by the researcher and can be controlled to some extent. Examples of extrinsic factors include the location, area, orientation, shape of electrodes and the distance between electrodes (interelectrode distance). In order to measure biological variation in the EMG signal, which is important in studies where surface EMG is used to gain understanding of physiological regulation, it is important to minimise the variation caused by these factors. This is in part achieved through the appropriate method <b>of</b> <b>normalisation.</b> The isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) {{has been used as a}} standardmethod <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> for both static and dynamic exercises. However, researchers have recently improved the methods <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> by developing alternative techniques for the measurement of EMG during dynamic activities. By using the same type <b>of</b> movement for <b>normalisation</b> as during the trial, experimental errors can be reduced. The appropriate method <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> is defined as a method that is capable of showing repeatability, reliability (low intra-subject variation) and sensitivity to changes in EMG amplitude that is due to biological change and not the contribution of experimental factors. The aim of this thesis was to critically analyse alternative methods <b>of</b> EMG <b>normalisation</b> during dynamic exercise. The data should provide possible guidelines to researchers who are planning studies involving measurement of EMG activity during cycling, running and in clinical populations. Furthermore, the thesis aimed to illustrate that decisions regarding the most appropriate method <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> should be based on the study design, research question (absolute muscle activity or changes in muscle pattern) and the muscles being investigated...|$|R

While normalisation research is conducted predominantly in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context, understanding normalisation in the primary mainstream education in England is important due to the contrast between teachers’ lack of readiness to deliver languages as part of the National Curriculum, and technology penetration in the classrooms. This thesis therefore, taking a sociocultural perspective of Activity Theory, attempts to redefine normalisation to include context specific characteristics, identify what factors contribute to and impede normalisation, and assess where primary CALL is on route to normalisation. An ethnographic approach was deemed to be most suitable to gain deep understanding <b>of</b> <b>normalisation.</b> Prolonged immersion in a primary school and the thematic analysis of observations, interviews, field notes and audio recordings revealed that factors impeding <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> primary CALL revolve around the following areas: attitudes, logistics, training and support and pedagogy. The issues related to the subject itself, e. g. negative attitudes toward the subject, lack of skills, impact on the achievement <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> to larger extent than issues related to technology. Hence in the primary context, normalisation needs to be considered from the point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> MFL and then the technology that is embedded into MFL. The analysis of the data allowed the researcher to create a model which serves as a form of audit of factors that need to be considered when thinking of successful technology integration into languages. Such guidance is needed for the primary MFL context having reoccurring issues, but is also relevant to primary EFL contexts in Europe where similar problems related to teaching of the subject are reported...|$|R

40|$|There {{still seems}} to be some {{confusion}} about the consequences <b>of</b> <b>normalisations</b> in the optimal taxation literature. We claim that: 1) Normalisations do not matter for the real solution of optimal taxation problem. 2) Normalisations do matter for good characterisations of the solutions to optimal taxation problems. Whereas the first point is uncontroversial, the second one is less well understood. There is also a need to distinguish between the following senses of taxation of endowment: 1) The taxation of own consumption of initial endowments (e. g. leisure). 2) The taxation of the sale of initial endowments (e. g. labour). By postponing the <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> consumer prices, we detail how <b>normalisations</b> <b>of</b> consumer prices affect the characterisation of optimal commodity taxes, derive the preferred characterisation, and show how it depends on the normalisation.

In their study, {{there was only}} a very slight advantage in classification performance between controls, participants with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer’s disease when using hippocampal volumes normalised by eTIV instead of raw hippocampal volumes. The combined impression from two studies by Westman et al. [27] and Zhou et al.

The small benefit <b>of</b> eTIV <b>normalisation</b> in these three studies could be due to a number of reasons, such as: (1) the total-brain-volume-dependent bias in eTIV; (2) the choice <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> method; and (3) the reduced need <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> when comparing groups with large mean volume differences.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a critical analysis <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> by evaluation as a technique for speeding up compilation of typed functional programming languages. Our investigation {{focuses on the}} SML. NET compiler and its typed intermediate language MIL. We implement and measure the performance <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> by evaluation for MIL {{across a range of}} benchmarks. Taking a different approach, we also implement and measure the performance of a graph-based shrinking reductions algorithm for SML. NET. MIL is based on Moggi’s computational metalanguage. As a stepping stone to normalisation by evaluation, we investigate strong <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> the computational metalanguage by introducing an extension of Girard-Tait reducibility. Inspired by previous work on local state and parametric polymorphism, we define reducibility for continuations and more generally reducibility for frame stacks. First we prove strong normalistion for the computational metalanguage. Then we extend that proof to include features of MIL such as sums and exceptions. Taking an incremental approach, we construct a collection <b>of</b> increasingly sophisticated <b>normalisation</b> by evaluation algorithms, culminating in a range <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> algorithms for MIL. Congruence rules and alpha-rules are captured by a compositional parameterised semantics. Defunctionalisation is used to eliminate eta-rules. Normalisation by evaluation for the computational metalanguage is introduced using a monadic semantics. Variants in which the monadic effects are made explicit, using either state or control operators, are also considered. Previous implementations <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> by evaluation with sums have relied on continuation-passing-syle or control operators. We present a new algorithm which instead uses a single reference cell and a zipper structure. This suggests a possible alternative way of implementing Filinski’s monadic reflection operations. In order to obtain benchmark results without having to take into account all of the features of MIL, we implement two different techniques for eliding language constructs. The first is not semantics-preserving, but is effective for assessing the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> by evaluation algorithms. The second is semantics-preserving, but less flexible. In common with many intermediate languages, but unlike the computational metalanguage, MIL requires all non-atomic values to be named. We use either control operators or state to ensure each non-atomic value is named. We assess our normalisation by evaluation algorithms by comparing them with a spectrum of progressively more optimised, rewriting-based normalisation algorithms. The SML. NET front-end is used to generate MIL code from ML programs, including the SML. NET compiler itself. Each algorithm is then applied to the generated MIL code. Normalisation by evaluation always performs faster than the most naıve algorithms— often by orders of magnitude. Some of the algorithms are slightly faster than normalisation by evaluation. Closer inspection reveals that these algorithms are in fact defunctionalised versions <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> by evaluation algorithms. Our normalisation by evaluation algorithms perform unrestricted inlining of functions. Unrestricted inlining can lead to a super-exponential blow-up in the size of target code with respect to the source. Furthermore, the worst-case complexity of compilation with unrestricted inlining is non-elementary {{in the size of the}} source code. SML. NET alleviates both problems by using a restricted form <b>of</b> <b>normalisation</b> based on Appel and Jim’s shrinking reductions. The original algorithm is quadratic in the worst case. Using a graph-based representation for terms we implement a compositional linear algorithm. This speeds up the time taken to perform shrinking reductions by up to a factor of fourteen, which leads to an improvement of up to forty percent in total compile time.
