5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement</b> was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E

Due {{to a lack}} of power the centre nacelle was raised, elongated forwards and a pusher engine added. With this <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement</b> the pilots cockpit was moved to the hull in a more conventional position.|$|E

50|$|However, Mitchell {{was already}} in discussions {{about a number of}} {{improvements}} - these included a new wing, tailplane, and <b>engine</b> <b>arrangements</b> - which would give it a top speed of 265 mph (426 km/h). The Ministry felt that, as eight rather than four guns would be needed, a wholly new aircraft, rather than a modification of the Type 224, was called for.|$|R
25|$|During a 1960 {{visit to}} France, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was so {{impressed}} by the quiet cabin of the Caravelle, that on 1 August 1960 the Tupolev OKB received an official directive to create the Tu-124A with a similar <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The requirement was also driven {{by the need to}} replace slow, aging piston-engined Il-14s on domestic routes. In 1961, the Soviet state airline, Aeroflot, updated its requirement specifications to include greater payload and passenger capacity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first of}} two Bodmins flew early in 1924. [...] It flew well, though with some drive and cooling {{problems}} and showed that despite Bristol's problems with the Tramp the fuselage mounted <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement</b> was workable. John North {{had been able to}} compensate the extra weight of this configuration by the savings of metal construction, which he estimated after the Bodmin was built to be as high as 20%, a factor of two better than his design estimate. [...] The safety bonus of engines that could be adjusted and mended in the air, the most important reason behind the layout was achieved. [...] The maximum speed and climb rate of the Bodmin were marginally better than those of the identically powered though slightly smaller metal-framed Boulton & Paul BugleII.|$|E

50|$|The Harlequin of 1868 was {{the first}} tug design with twin screws, which {{provided}} superior towage control and had advanced <b>engine</b> <b>arrangements</b> for their day. The same year, John Payne completed two river steamers for Brazil, the Corruipe and Mondahu, steel twin-screw vessels of 200 t and the largest vessels yet built by the yard.

2500|$|The SM.80 also flew with a 112kW (150hp) CNA C.VI six-cylinder in-line engine. [...] The third aircraft, {{registered}} in 1934, was more radically re-engined; a four-seater, {{it was named}} the SM.80bis. [...] This is powered by two pusher configuration, 56kW (75hp) seven-cylinder radials Pobjoy R engines, placed further aft than the single engine of the SM.80 but located above the wing {{on either side of}} the fuselage on very similar mountings. [...] The cabin is positioned about 950mm (2ft) further forward but otherwise the two models were structurally identical. [...] The SM.80bis was 80kg (175lb) heavier and significantly slower, with a decrease of maximum speed of (16mph), though climb rates were similar. [...] The speed decrease has been attributed to the extra drag of the twin <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement,</b> since the SM.80 and SM.80bis had the same overall engine power.|$|E
2500|$|Botnica {{is powered}} by six engine-generator-engine sets {{consisting}} of twelve [...] Caterpillar 3512B V12 high-speed diesel engines, each with an output of , driving six ABB generators. The ship was originally designed for six bigger Wärtsilä generating sets, but the lower initial acquisition cost of the Caterpillars resulted in the very unusual <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement.</b> While having {{a large number of}} smaller engines increases the flexibility and efficiency of the power system — engines can be started and stopped on demand and the running engines operate at maximum efficiency — the main engines of Botnica require considerably more maintenance hours in comparison to ships with fewer generating sets. The fuel consumption of the main engines at maximum draught is 50 tons of marine diesel oil (MDO) per day at full power, 25 tons at a service speed of , 10–15 tons during dynamic positioning and 4 tons at port.|$|E
2500|$|The Lightning {{had several}} {{distinctive}} design features, {{the principal of}} these being the twin <b>engine</b> <b>arrangement,</b> notched delta wing, and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimizing frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the drag equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin engine installations. The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with inlet cone), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. However, because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other engine. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance; although this was rarely done operationally because {{there would be no}} hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed [...]|$|E

2500|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{steam engine}} {{was developed by}} Thomas Newcomen in 1712. The steam engine improvements brought forth by James Watt in the later half of the 18th century greatly improved steam engine efficiency and allowed more compact <b>engine</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Successful adaptation of the steam engine to marine applications in England {{would have to wait}} until almost a century later after Newcomen, when Scottish engineer William Symington built the world's [...] "first practical steamboat", the Charlotte Dundas, in 1802.

50|$|The {{initial test}} engines had some minor problems, notably with sealing, {{but these were}} worked through and the engines were under test during 1944. One {{particularly}} nice feature of swing-piston engines {{is that they can}} be bolted back to back along a common crank shaft to make a larger engine, and with each additional stage the running becomes smoother and the only part that needs to be made larger is the crankshaft. A similar arrangement with a radial engine is generally more difficult to arrange, especially cooling, and ones with inline <b>engine</b> <b>arrangements</b> soon become so long that keeping the crankshaft from vibrating becomes a serious problem (see Chrysler IV-2220 for example).|$|R
