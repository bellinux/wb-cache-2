Whether it would produce this effect, or would be an <b>idle</b> <b>threat,</b> depended {{not so much on}} Gregory VII as on Henry's subjects, and, above all, on the German princes. Contemporary evidence suggests that the excommunication of Henry made a profound impression both in Germany and Italy.|$|E

2500|$|Trick-or-treating is a Halloween ritual custom for {{children}} and adults in many countries. Children in costumes travel from house-to-house, asking for treats with the phrase [...] "Trick or treat". The [...] "treat" [...] is usually some form of candy, although, in some cultures, money is used instead. The [...] "trick" [...] is a usually <b>idle</b> <b>threat</b> to perform mischief on the homeowners or their property if no treat is given. Trick-or-treating usually occurs on the evening of October 31. Some homeowners signal {{that they are willing to}} hand out treats by putting up Halloween decorations outside their doors; others simply leave treats available on their porches for the children to take freely.|$|E

60|$|Then {{they carried}} {{him into the}} palace and none saw him {{for three days and}} nights.

Already the shadow of the Cross lay deep upon the altars of Anahuac, but still the smoke of their offerings went up to heaven and the cry of the captives rang round the teocallis. The hour of the demon gods was upon them indeed, but now they reaped their last red harvest, and it was rich.|$|E
50|$|The playful form of teasing is a {{parenting}} {{method used}} in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This form of teasing utilizes stories, fabrications, or empty threats to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. It can teach children values by establishing expectations and encouraging the child to meet them via playful jokes and/or <b>idle</b> <b>threats.</b> For example, a parent may tell a child {{that there is a}} monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that alarm creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.|$|R

She will not kill herself, I know her well, she loves her life too much; and soon, when you are wed, she will love you also, {{for it is the}} nature of us women to worship those who master us. Moreover, that man, the Deliverer, is not her husband, except in name; for months I have lived with them and I know it.

60|$|She had {{followed}} Jim's trail for miles {{out toward the}} range. And now she dismounted to see if his tracks were as fresh as she had believed. He had left the little village camp about sunrise. Someone had seen him riding away and had told Joan. Then he had tarried on the way, for it was now midday. Joan pondered. She had become used to his <b>idle</b> <b>threats</b> and disgusted with his vacillations. That had been the trouble--Jim was amiable, lovable, but since meeting Joan he had not exhibited any strength of character. Joan stood beside her horse and looked away toward the dark mountains. She was daring, resourceful, used to horses and trails {{and taking care of}} herself; and she did not need anyone to tell her that she had gone far enough. It had been her hope to come up with Jim. Always he had been repentant. But this time was different. She recalled his lean, pale face--so pale that freckles she did not know he had showed through--and his eyes, usually so soft and mild, had glinted like steel. Yes, it had been a bitter, reckless face. What had she said to him? She tried to recall it.|$|R

In the mid-1980s during a time period quoted by some as [...] "Revolution Summer", bands like Gray Matter, Embrace, Rites of Spring, Soulside, Three, and Rain emerged. Other DC hardcore bands from this time period are Fire Party and Dag Nasty.|$|R
