40|$|Quick {{assessment}} of the condition of gearboxes used in helicopters is a safety requirement. One {{of the most widely}} used helicopter on-board-mounted condition monitoring system these days is the Health and Usage Monitoring System. It has been specifically designed to monitor the condition of all safety-critical components operating in the helicopter through calculation of so-called condition indicators (CIs) - signal processing routines designed to output a single number that represents the condition of the monitored component. Among number of available parameters, there is a couple of CIs that over the years of testing have earned a reputation of being the most reliable measures of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>condition.</b> At the same time, however, it has been observed that in some cases, those techniques do not properly indicate the deteriorating condition with the propagation of a gear tooth fault with the period of operation. Hence, three more robust methods have been suggested, which are discussed in this article...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} of a once-through oil mist {{system to the}} lubrication of helicopter spur gears was investigated and compared to conventional jet spray lubrication. In the mist lubrication mode, cooling air was supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the out of mesh location of the gear sets. The mist air was also supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the radial position mist nozzle at a constant rate of 0. 0632 mol/s (3 SCFM) per nozzle. The lubricant contained in the mist air varied between 32 - 44 cc/hour. In the recirculating jet spray mode, the flow rate was varied between 1893 - 2650 cc/hour. Visual inspection revealed the jet spray mode produced a superior surface finish on the gear teeth but a thermal energy survey showed a 15 - 20 % increase in heat generated. The <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>condition</b> in the mist lubrication mode system could be improved if the cooling air and lubricant/air flow ratio were increased. The test gearbox and the procedure used are described...|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{receiving}} airworthiness certification, extensive testing is required {{during the development}} of rotary wing aircraft drive systems. Many of these tests are conducted to demonstrate the drive system's ability to operate at extreme conditions, beyond that {{called for in the}} normal to maximum power operating range. One of the most extreme tests {{is referred to as the}} loss-of-lubrication or run dry test. During this test, the drive system is expected to last at least 30 min without failure while the primary lubrication system is disabled for predetermined, scripted flight conditions. Failure of this test can lead to a partial redesign of the drive system or the addition of an emergency lubrication system. Either of these solutions can greatly increase the aircraft drive system cost and weight and extend the schedule for obtaining airworthiness certification. Recent work at NASA Glenn Research Center focused on performing tests, in a relevant aerospace environment, to simulate the behavior of spur gears under loss-of-lubrication conditions. Tests were conducted using a test facility that was used in the past for spur gear contact fatigue testing. A loss-oflubrication test is initiated by shutting off the single into mesh lubricating jet. The test proceeds until the gears fail and can no longer deliver the applied torque. The observed failures are typically plastically deformed gear teeth, due to the high tooth temperatures, that are no longer in mesh. The effect of several different variables to <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>condition</b> during loss-of-lubrication have been tested such as gear pitch, materials, shrouding, lubrication condition, and emergency supplied mist lubrication in earlier testing at NASA. Recent testing has focused on newer aerospace gear steels and imbedding thermocouples in the shrouding to measure the air-oil temperatures flung off the gear teeth. Along with the instrumented shrouding, an instrumented spur gear was also tested. The instrumented spur gear had five thermocouples installed at different locations on the gear tooth and web. The data from these two types of measurements provided important information as to the thermal environment during the loss-of-lubrication event. This data is necessary to validate on-going modeling efforts...|$|E

40|$|Gears {{are common}} {{mechanical}} components used to transfer torque. A gear train consists of multiple gears on multiple gear shafts {{with the purpose}} of producing an output torque or speed proportional to an input torque or speed. Gear trains are usually housed in a gearbox, which contains the gears, gear shafts, bearings, and some sort of lubrication. Gearboxes are found in many applications including automotive transmissions, wind turbines, helicopter engines, and geared motors. Essentially anywhere a rotational motion is produced, gears can be used to transfer that motion using a constant of proportionality to the output torque and speed. Gearboxes are prone to mechanical failure due to the surface contact between and fluctuating stresses on the <b>gear</b> <b>teeth.</b> Fatigue cracks, pitting, wear, and lubrication degradation are common precursors to severe failure such as chipped or missing <b>gear</b> <b>teeth,</b> which could have catastrophic effects on the gearbox and surrounding mechanical components. ^ Gearbox diagnostic methods could allow for the detection of deterioration in the health of the gear train. The use of a torque transducer on a gear shaft to measure the torsional vibrations of the gear train has the potential to detect gearbox faults. Such a detection system could make the user of a gearbox aware of the need for repair or replacement of gearbox components before more serious failure occurs. This research presents techniques that are used to mathematically model a gearbox and faults within the gearbox in order to predict the capabilities of the torque transducer to detect gear failure. The effects of gear failure and deterioration on the torsional vibrations of the gearbox are also analyzed. Data collected during experimentation with a gearbox fitted with a torque transducer is presented and compared to the analytical model. The modeling techniques accurately calculated the gear mesh stiffness properties {{for a wide range of}} <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> health <b>conditions.</b> Then, the same modeling techniques within a simulation environment were able to show the effects of gear damage on the dynamic response of the system measured by a torque transducer. The simulation results correlated well with the experimental data, but due to the lightly loaded nature of the test gearbox, the dynamic effects of the included faults were not as clear in the experimental results as in the simulation results where the load was increased. ...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Compact light weight and dry sump (significantly reduced volume of lubricant) are the desired {{attributes}} for high performance racing transmissions, whilst improving upon efficiency and reliability remain paramount objectives. The complex multi-objective {{nature of this}} task points to an integrated approach to lubricant-mechanical system optimisation. The extreme operating conditions in racing transmissions, such as contact kinematics and thermal loading present significant tribological challenges. Thin lubricant films in non-Newtonian shear are subjected to mixed thermo-elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Under these conditions boundary active lubricant species often determine the contact tribological performance rather than the bulk rheological properties of the lubricant itself. Therefore, the interaction of lubricant additive package with the contacting solid surfaces {{is the key to}} an optimised solution. The paper investigates the lubricant-surface interfacial effect upon frictional characteristics in contact conditions which are representative of <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> meshing <b>conditions</b> in high performance transmissions. The study uses pin-on-disc tribometry. As the contact conditions are mainly governed by the formation of surface-adhered tribo-films, their effect upon frictional characteristics is further investigated through use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in lateral force mode (LFM). A test procedure is presented to benchmark lubricant additive package-surface combinations for improved tribological performance. The investigation takes into account surface material, surface topography and lubricant additive package, all of which affect the tribo-chemical absorption or bonding of a thin film to the contacting surfaces. The test protocol also includes surface chemical spectrometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The presented methodology has not hitherto been reported in literature...|$|R

40|$|Regarding <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method <b>Gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus.
