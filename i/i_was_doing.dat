5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> that craziness <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it convinced me that I had overcome all traces of my depression. [...] My only thought was to keep on doing what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and I saw nothing in the future that could stop me.|$|E

5000|$|What {{happened}} is, somebody traded me off—they used my {{popularity and}} money to elect somebody else. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> dirty. And I'm so proud that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> dirty, because if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> elected ... <b>I</b> woulda had {{a job to do}} ... maybe woulda finally quit. So that's one time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> dirty and <b>I</b> want to thank them for it now.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} so now," [...] he remarked, [...] "I {{do not know what}} you will say to me presently. What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> now, Ella, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> with your mother's sanction, and you must {{associate}} her with the gift which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to place in your keeping." ...|$|R
500|$|On 7 May 2009, Hsu {{pleaded guilty}} {{in federal court in}} New York to ten counts of mail and wire fraud in {{connection}} with the Ponzi scheme. Hsu stated that [...] "I knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was illegal" [...] and faced up to 20 years in prison on each count. Hsu was still contesting the charges of campaign finance fraud, however.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{commented on}} the character's {{depiction}} as an anarchist since his first appearance. According to Alan Grant, anarchists with whom he associated were angered by his creation of the character, seeing it {{as an act of}} recuperation for commercial gain. Neither Grant nor Breyfogle could fully agree with this criticism. As Grant put it, [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> them a favour you know?" ...|$|E
500|$|Hardly {{knowing what}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing...</b> I {{sat down and}} started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Peter, do {{you care}} so much as that? If--if <b>I</b> could <b>be</b> sure that <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> it for you! If in spite--of all that has {{happened}} to me, <b>I</b> could <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> something for you--!" ...|$|R

I thought so myself, but something has happened that has opened my eyes, and I {{have every reason to}} be thankful that it has. I dare say you think that I have behaved very badly, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sorry; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> right now." ...|$|R
500|$|Other {{actors have}} also used Terry-Thomas's persona as an {{inspiration}} for their characters: Dustin Hoffman acknowledged that he based his interpretation of the character Captain Hook in Hook on Terry-Thomas; Rupert Everett disclosed that when he provided the voice for Prince Charming in Shrek 2 Terry-Thomas [...] "was vocally my role model while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> it"; and Paul Whitehouse's character, the 13th Duke of Wybourne, from The Fast Show was also modelled on Terry-Thomas's on-screen persona.|$|E
500|$|The first issues Lowndes was {{responsible}} for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had over Hornig, vetoing {{five of the seven}} stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and [...] didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> for the best," [...] he replied; [...] "at least, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> {{what must}} <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> for <b>I</b> see {{no other way}} through it--so {{all you have to}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to copy this paper, and bid adieu to bank dividends--for a little while at least. I trust soon to double this little matter for you, if Fortune will but stand my friend." ...|$|R

500|$|Midway through Stevens' first season, {{with the}} Bulldogs at 12–1, The New York Times wrote [...] "so far, Stevens {{has made the}} {{transition}} [...] look easy." [...] The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and composure of a seasoned veteran. [...] "You’ve {{got a lot of}} people always looking for the next step. And that’s not what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I was just trying to figure out a way to win the next game and think like a head coach." [...] Stevens said.|$|E
500|$|In {{the photo}} book Kylie / Fashion, Emmett {{commented on the}} [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] and Impossible Remixes photo shoot;: [...] "There are no fashion {{constraints}} with Kylie... Her natural poise and dynamism transcended all typical props and accessories. We've made great use here of our easy rapport." [...] Minogue commended the photo shoot at the time, saying [...] "So much of what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> at this time had a tiny budget so I {{brought a lot of}} pieces, including the pink glitter stick roll, from home [...] It was a great, simple shoot with a lot of heart." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1912, Moreno {{attended}} one of Sigmund Freud's lectures. [...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E

But {{when my husband}} quarrels with me on some issue, he always says: “It would have <b>been</b> better if <b>I</b> had come here alone. It was my fault that I decided to bring you here.” And when I hear such things from his mouth, I feel very bad and humiliated.|$|R
500|$|At the university, {{he decided}} to take acting classes and took up theatre as his minor. After {{completing}} his studies and returning to Mumbai in 2007, Singh worked for a few years in advertising as a copywriter, with agencies like O and J. Walter Thompson. He then worked as an assistant director, but left it to pursue acting. He then decided to send his portfolio to directors. [...] He would go for all kinds of auditions, but did not get any good opportunities, while only getting calls for minor roles: [...] "Everything was so bleak. It was very frustrating. There were times I would think whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing or not." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} took Bob's {{frustration with}} celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome's comment that [...] "when everyone's super, {{no one will}} be" [...] {{as a reflection of}} views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche or an extension of Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand's Objectivism philosophy, which Bird felt was [...] "ridiculous." [...] He stated that {{a large portion of the}} audience understood the satire whereas [...] "two percent thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> The Fountainhead or Atlas Shrugged." [...] Some purported that The Incredibles exhibited a right-wing bias, which Bird also scoffed at. [...] "I think that's as silly of an analysis as saying The Iron Giant was left-wing. I'm definitely a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd." ...|$|E
500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes. Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this." [...] Jenner explained, [...] "It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got {{the rest of my life}} to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?" ...|$|E

500|$|As a vocalist, Rollins {{has adopted}} a number of styles through the years. He was noted in the Washington, D.C. {{hardcore}} scene for what journalist Michael Azerrad described as a [...] "compelling, raspy howl." [...] With State of Alert, Rollins [...] "spat out the lyrics like a bellicose auctioneer." [...] He adopted a similar style after joining Black Flag in 1981. By their album Damaged, however, Black Flag began to incorporate a swing beat into their style. Rollins then abandoned his State of Alert [...] "bark" [...] and adopted the band's swing. Rollins later explained: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> kind of matched the vibe of the music. The music was intense and, well, I was as intense as you needed." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more certain that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> right, than I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.|$|E
