5|$|The city {{received}} its contemporary name in 1919. Until then, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> known in English by its German name, Pressburg, {{as it was}} long dominated by Austrians and other German-speakers. That is the term from which the pre-1919 Slovak (Prešporok) and Czech (Prešpurk) names are derived.|$|E
5|$|Bank Street, {{known for}} a time as Bank Lane, was a {{multi-purpose}} stadium in Clayton, Manchester, England. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> used for football matches and was the second home ground of Manchester United Football Club (then known as Newton Heath Football Club), after North Road, which they left in 1893. The stadium had a capacity of around 50,000, but the club moved to Old Trafford in 1910 because club owner John Henry Davies believed he could not sufficiently expand the ground.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being located}} outside Kyustendil at the time, {{up until the}} {{construction}} of the city's main Bulgarian National Revival-style church in 1816, the Church of St George served as Kyustendil's cathedral. The church suffered some severe damage during the 19th century, the time of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> destroyed, leaving only the foundations of the arches. It was reconstructed in 1878–1880, just after the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria, with further restoration in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art & Design {{served as}} the project's {{production}} manager. She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection. Painting the mural took about six weeks, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> finished by November 2013. Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14. The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|Propagated {{from seed}} {{collected}} by William Baxter in southern Australia, common heath was introduced into cultivation in England by the Clapton Nursery in 1825. Due to its frost-tenderness, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> restricted to greenhouse cultivation. In 1873, a variety known as Epacris impressa alba was recorded as being grown commercially for cut flowers in Boston in the United States.

5|$|The first {{images of}} viruses were {{obtained}} upon {{the invention of}} electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> made of protein. A short time later, this virus was separated into protein and RNA parts.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena purpureofusca grow singly or in {{clusters}} on the decaying wood of conifers, particularly spruce, pine, and Douglas-fir. It is commonly found on decaying pine cones.

5|$|By December 15, {{newspapers}} had attributed 286 deaths to the blizzard, including 54 in New York, 51 in New Jersey (later {{confirmed as}} 52), 26 in Pennsylvania, and 71 in the New England states. Fatalities {{related to the}} storm and associated cold snap were far-reaching, involving 23 states. A wide variety of factors contributed to the high death toll, including over-exertion, exposure to cold, transportation accidents, structural fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The storm caused some isolated power failures along its path. In north-central Virginia, telephone and electricity lines were damaged. The blizzard cut electricity to all of Newtown, Connecticut, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> restored within hours. In Rhode Island, Block Island and some inland towns were without power. Short-lived power outages affected southern New Hampshire.|$|E

The abbey was closed in 1539 and granted to Lord Russell. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> demolished promptly, though a section remained in domestic use until the 19th century. In 1842, a parish church was built {{on a part of}} the site. Some surviving fragments of monastery include the partial end wall of the cellarers range and parts of a gatehouse. Some carved fragments survive within the Victorian era church.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the band}} contributed {{a cover of}} the Underdog theme song to be {{included}} on the tribute album , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA. Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged {{on for more than}} three years.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> undisputed that pre-human australopithecines did {{not have}} {{communication}} systems significantly different from those found in great apes in general. However, a 2017 study on Ardipithecus ramidus challenges this belief. Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since {{the appearance of the}} genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development of primitive language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development of primitive symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.|$|E

It runs along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay, {{connecting}} San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway is also known as James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards.

This instrument was rebuilt on a new gallery in the North Transept by William Hill & Son of London in 1868, to a specification of forty stops spread over four manuals and pedals, although the Solo department, which would have brought the total to well over forty, was not completed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> removed to the Church of St Peter & St Paul, Cromer in 1896, the remainder being kept for incorporation in the new abbey organ.|$|E

NY291 was removed in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>mostly</b> due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} see to the business of their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E
