He'll learn dignity--or perhaps lose his simplicity and be ruined; and then I'll marry him off to some nice well-bred pink-face, like Jeff Saxton's pretty cousin--who may turn him into a beastly money-grubber; and I'm monkeying with destiny, and I ought to be slapped, and <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it,</b> and I can't help it, and all my latent instinct as a feminine meddler is aroused, and--golly, I almost went off that curve!" ...|$|E

50|$|Lorenzo Semple, Jr. {{wrote the}} script. He later recalled:Dino {{wanted to make}} Flash Gordon humorous. At the time, I {{thought that was a}} {{possible}} way to go, but, in hindsight, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> was a terrible mistake. We kept fiddling around with the script, trying to decide whether to be funny or realistic. That was a catastrophic thing to do, with so much money involved... I never thought the character of Flash in the script was particularly good. But there was no pressure to make it any better. Dino had a vision of a comic-strip character treated in a comic style. That was silly, because Flash Gordon was never intended to be funny. The entire film got way out of control.|$|E

'I'm not having a very good day,' he replied. Running into the building to clock in, I realized there were an unusually greater {{number of people in the}} parking lot, and I was taken aback by the new sign, 'HOSPITAL,' that hung over the door.

[...] — Stern on his move to WNBC in 1982 In April 1982, four months before he started at WNBC, NBC Magazine aired a {{critical}} news report on shock radio by Douglas Kiker that centered around Stern and the controversial nature of his show. The piece caused NBC executives to discuss the potential withdrawal of Stern's contract, but, rather than spend money on buying Stern out of the deal, management agreed to control Stern. To make matters worse, the station did not allow Stern to bring his show partners at first, which caused some friction between Stern and Quivers for several months. Stern began his afternoon show at WNBC on August 30, 1982 and was closely monitored, instructed to avoid discussions of a sexual or religious nature. In his first month, he was suspended for [...] "Virgin Mary Kong", a sketch about a video game where a group of men pursued the Virgin Mary around a singles bar in Jerusalem. The station then hired an attorney to operate a seven-second delay if Stern said something potentially offensive. This soon became the task of program director Kevin Metheny, who Stern infamously feuded with and nicknamed [...] "Pig Virus". Stern also began his long time feud with morning host Don Imus.|$|E
40|$|According to orthodoxy, the {{contents}} of propositional attitudes are, well, propositions. To believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a proposition. On an alternative account, developed and defended by David Lewis (1979) and Roderick Chisholm (1979 and 1981), {{the contents}} of the attitudes are not propositions but properties: to believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a property. Call this alternative the property theory. Its chief advantage over orthodoxy is its superior handling of the irreducibly first-personal de se attitudes. Not knowing I am looking in a mirror, I see a man with an inkspot on his collar and say to myself, “His collar is stained. ” I may believe that Jason Turner’s collar is stained — perhaps, thanks to selective amnesia, I remember what Jason Turner looks like but not that I am he — but, until <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> is a mirror I am looking in, I still lack the belief that my collar is stained. What I lack is a de se belief. If I already believe the proposition that Jason’s collar is stained, what new entity do I believe when I realize that I am the one with the stained collar?...|$|E

Sunday, April 11, 1943 Dear Miss Blaney, Thank you {{for your}} long and pleasantly {{readable}} letter; I realize {{that the amount of}} mail sent into your office must be of an overwhelming amount and my appreciation is correspondingly increased. I’d like, at the same time, to thank the Bryant Service Club for the box of candy so generously mailed to me. My exams have been completed and I’m now awaiting classification. No, I didn’t know Mr. Lee, now Major Lee, had been commissioned and was in the nation’s capitol; I had met Mr. Shors after his being commissioned upon a visit to Bryant {{and at the same time}} had been informed of Mr. Hammond’s rank. Naturally I’m disappointed about the Alumni Bulletin just as are many others; however in regards the “On the Campus”, I’d like to say I sympathize with you rather think you are engaging in dictatorial practices; you do a splendid job – and <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>it</b> as much if not more than most others because of my close association wit the publication of such a paper. Again, thank you for the letter and gift. Sincerely Roger Gaioni [Transcription ends...|$|E
