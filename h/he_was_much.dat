5|$|On 7 October 1966, {{at the age}} of 59, Horne {{suffered}} a major heart attack. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> weakened, and was unfit to work for three months. As a result, he did not appear in the Round the Horne Christmas special. He returned to work in January 1967 to record the third series.|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> attracted by the sounds of gamelan ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E

5|$|When Blamey {{relieved}} Rowell {{of command}} of I Corps in New Guinea, he nominated Herring as successor. Blamey proposed Mackay {{as a second}} choice but preferred Herring as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> younger, and this was important in the taxing New Guinea climate. When Blamey relinquished command of New Guinea Force on 30 January 1943, he handed over temporary command to Mackay to enable Herring to go on leave. The period was a quiet one, with no major operations being carried out, and Mackay handed back to Herring and returned to command of the Second Army at Parramatta, New South Wales, in May 1943.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 and so he was succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} is of ashlar stone masonry, 25feet (7.6m) high, in the English Baroque style. On {{the south}} side is a slate tablet inscribed with a quotation from the account by Lord Clarendon (1609–1674) in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England of the Battle of Lansdowne (1643). On the north side are two poems. On top is a griffin (the crest and supporters of the Grenvilles) holding an escutcheon displaying the Grenville coat of arms: Gules, three clarions or. On another side are shown the Royal Arms of King Charles II (1660–1685) supported by the arms of Sir Bevil's eldest son and heir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) and by {{the arms of the}} latter's half first cousin General George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle, KG (1608–1670). Monck was the principal figure behind the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660, in effecting which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> assisted by Sir John Grenville, for which services both were elevated to the peerage.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the early}} part of the century, Wood was {{influential}} in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen's Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in The Manchester Guardian, which listed the number of each composer's works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> happier than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing with the media because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{more active}} in the British Academy, being elected in 1975 and serving on the council from 1979 to 1982, and as {{chairman}} of Section 2 from 1986 to 1989.|$|E

25|$|In 1855, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{affected}} {{by the death of}} his wife. In September he traveled to Sedlnitz for the christening of his grandchild. Shortly after he made his very last trip, dying of pneumonia on 26 November 1857 in Neiße. He was buried the next day with his wife.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Darlan chose Project A variant 2 for {{the third}} Richelieu-class ship to be laid down, named Clemenceau. He chose project B variant 3 for the second ship– a design in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> involved– and named her Gascogne after Gascony where he was born, marking a {{transition}} to adopting province names for battleships.|$|E

25|$|March 2008 saw Maroulis {{joining the}} cast of American Idol Extra as cohost, along with fellow Idol alum Gina Glocksen and J.D. Roberto. His next major role {{occurred}} that June, when Constantine starred as Judas Iscariot in the Premier Theatre Company's production of Jesus Christ Superstar. Constantine had previously {{played the role of}} Jesus in an earlier production when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> younger.|$|E
25|$|Bravo de Acuña {{promptly}} {{began to}} construct galleys and other {{vessels in the}} shipyard, to defend the sea, which was full of enemies and pirates from other islands, especially from Mindanao. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> preoccupied with settling matters with the Empire of Japan and with the Sultanate of Sulu, and he also had to see to the ships that were to make the voyage to New Spain.|$|E

25|$|Marquis had 3 starts {{early in}} the 2010 season for the Nationals, posting an 0–3 record with a 20.52 ERA before being placed on the 15-day DL on April 22, 2010, with bone chips in his right elbow. He {{returned}} to action on August 8, 2010. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> improved upon returning from his injury, but still finished the season a disappointing 2–9 with a 6.60 ERA.|$|E
25|$|From then onwards, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> sought after, {{appearing}} in {{such films as}} A Bridge Too Far (1977) as Lieutenant General Horrocks – a role he has cited as a personal favourite – and for which he won yet another Best Supporting Actor award at the British Academy Film Awards. He also starred in Force 10 from Navarone (1978), with Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{attached}} {{no great}} importance to formal syllabuses and course structures. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{more interested in the}} contact between teacher and student, and brought in a system of fortnightly undergraduate essays which has persisted for a long time. There were fortnightly tutorials and weekly seminars, all supplemented by lectures. Postgraduate research was, surprisingly, not a high priority although he encouraged his younger colleagues in research, and pursued his own research with vigour and distinction.|$|E
