40|$|In 1989, the Legislature {{found that}} there is a growing crisis in this country and State {{affecting}} the stability of our families and that the family unit is being torn apart due to the need for families to have 2 income producing parents. In order to address this situation and to provide for the love, nurturing and education of our children, the Legislature enacted “The Parental Leave Act, ” codified as West Virginia Code § 21 - 5 D- 1 et seq. to provide employees with unpaid time away from work (after exhausting annual and personal leave) without risk of employment loss. Later, in 1993, Congress enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA),which similarly provides for family and medical leave to be taken by eligible employees for qualifying events. The FMLA is administered and enforced by the U. S. Department of Labor’s Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division and the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations remain the official sources for regulatory information concerning this law.

Crystal Research' Laboratory at Camden, New Jersey. The Laboratory personnel consists of the following: C. T. Beishline, Laboratory Technician; J. W. Conn, Wireman; L. L. Dimmick, Engineer; P. D. Gerber, Engineer; M. Shaffer, Laboratory Technician; S. Steltz, Toolmaker; E. M. Washburn, Engineer, Laboratory Manager. The <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel,</b> and the equipment of the Laboratory, is such as to enable the group to completely fabricate a crystal unit of production or experimental design. This requires ability and equipment to grind to frequency, silver plate, bake at high temperatures, produce mounts and covers, design and assemble oscillator or other circuits; they can also perform highly accurate frequency measurements and impedance measurements in connection with tests involving operation over wide temperature variations, vibration effects, aging, and over-excitation effects. The entire personnel of the R. C. A. Crystal Laboratory was entirely cooperative in familiarizing the author with their problems, equipment, and techniques. The manager, Mr. E. M. Washburn, encouraged work along many lines of inquiry {{of interest to the}} Armed Services; he made available to the author the facilities and engineering advice of his department in an investigation of general methods of frequency and impedance measurements of crystals at frequencies from 80 KC to 60 MC, and the specific problem to the effect of variations of the interpin capacity of crystals on their stability and activity. Dr. W. D.

Prior to the formation of the Health Boards (or Health Authorities), health inspectors were employed by the local authorities, who were then the health authorities. This goes back to 1970 and in the case of Dublin, Cork; Limerick and Waterford to 1960. The <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>personnel</b> was clear-cut in most cases but not so in the case of health inspectors, whose duties and responsibilities bridged the functions of both Health Boards and Local AuthoritIes: It was estimated that the majority of the work was on the local authority side and rather than having a division of staff, arrangements were made by way of Sec 25 (3) of the Health Act 1970 whereby health inspectors became authorised officers of the local authority for the purpose of certain legislation. The reporting relationship :of the Health Inspectorate is -therefore a two way one - to the Eastern Health Board on matters such as food control, infectious diseases, port health and pest control. and to Dublin Corporation through three Departments -Abusing Planning Unfit houses, repairs, re-housing.

It is likewise important to the U. S. government for U. S. citizens to take positions with the IAEA to contribute to its success. It is important for persons {{within and outside the}} U. S. nuclear and safeguards industries to become aware of the job opportunities available at the IAEA and to be informed of important vacancies as they arise. The International Safeguards Project Office (ISPO) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is tasked by the U.

In addition, ISPO has been working more closely with the IAEA <b>Division</b> <b>of</b> <b>Personnel.</b> ISPO staff members attend trade shows to distribute information about IAEA opportunities. The shows target the nuclear industry as well as shows that are unrelated to the nuclear industry. ISPO developed a web site that provides information for prospective candidates. They have worked with the IAEA to understand its recruitment processes, to make suggestions for improvements, and to understand employment benefits so they can be communicated to potential U. S. applicants. ISPO is also collaborating with a State Department working group that is focused on increasing U. S. representation within the United Nations as a whole. Most recently Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice issued a letter to all Federal Agency heads encouraging details and transfers of their employees to international organizations to the maximum extent feasible and with due regard to their manpower requirements. She urged all federal agencies to review their detail and transfer policies and practices to ensure that employment in international organizations is promoted in a positive and active manner. In addition, she wrote that it is important that agencies examine their policies and practices for returning employees from details and transfer to ensure that reintegration procedures result in both the agency and such employees receiving optimal benefit from the international organization experience.
