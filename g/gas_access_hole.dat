40|$|It is {{important}} that the condition of <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> structures in a sewer collection network be known and maintained because these structures provide access to the sewer pipes for regular maintenance, condition assessment and rehabilitation. Costs of the maintenance and rehabilitation of sewer pipes would increase significantly if admittance to sewers via the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> were restricted. To date much attention has been focused towards developing cost effective strategies for condition assessment, maintenance, rehabilitation and renewal of sewers, but little attention on <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> This paper will present a unique decision-making approach to assess the condition and planning of rehabilitation for <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> Some of the unique concepts of the approach include an impact assessment for <b>access</b> <b>holes,</b> a defect coding system that includes unique structural and service defects found in <b>access</b> <b>holes,</b> a decision-making process that allows users to determine whether rehabilitation or another condition assessment is required immediately, within {{the next couple of years}} or not at all and a compilation of various rehabilitation techniques and their costs. A case study is used to solidify each component of the approach. This decision-making approach to assess the condition and planning of rehabilitation of <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> is currently being considered for inclusion in the National Guide to Sustainable Municipal Infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Background. Fracture load of implant-supported restorations is an {{important}} factor in clinical success. This study evaluated the effect of two techniques for screw <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> preparation on the fracture load of cement-screw-retained implant-supported zirconia-based crowns. Methods. Thirty similar cement-screw-retained implant-supported zirconia-based maxillary central incisor crowns were evaluated in three groups of 10. Group NH: with no screw <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> for the control; Group HBS: with screw <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> prepared with a machine before zirconia sintering; Group HAS: with screw <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> prepared manually after zirconia sintering. In group HBS, the <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> were virtually designed and prepared by a computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing system. In group HAS, the <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> were manually prepared after zirconia sintering using a diamond bur. The dimensions of the screw <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> were equal in both groups. The crowns were cemented onto same-size abutments and were then subjected to thermocycling. The fracture load values of the crowns were measured using a universal testing machine. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey test (P < 0. 05). Results. The mean fracture load value for the group NH was 888. 37 ± 228. 92 N, which was the highest among the groups, with a significant difference (P < 0. 0001). The fracture load values were 610. 48 ± 125. 02 N and 496. 74 ± 104. 10 Nin the HBS and HAS groups, respectively, with no significant differences (P = 0. 44). Conclusion. Both techniques used for preparation of screw <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> in implant-supported zirconia-based crowns de-creased the fracture load...|$|R

40|$|A custom {{version of}} the TerminatorBot is {{described}} for corebored inspection during search-and-rescue operations. “Corebored inspection ” refers to visual inspection of a void by passing a small camera through an <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> into the void. This is the classic “camera-on-a-stick ” approach. Sometimes the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> occurs naturally. Sometimes a suspected void has no <b>access</b> <b>hole.</b> To gain <b>access,</b> a <b>hole</b> is bored through the rubble with a coring tool, hence the term “core-bored inspection. ” In either case, the camera, once inside, can articulate to look around, but is limited to line-of-sight. Occlusions can prevent a thorough inspection or force using/boring another hole. A small, agile robotic device could augment {{the use of such}} cameras. We propose the TerminatorBot as as a prototype limbed robot for studying such applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Modular {{structural}} {{systems are}} constructed using a method that they are assembled with prefabricated unit modular frames on-site. This provides a benefit that can significantly reduce building construction time. The structural design is usually carried out {{under the assumption that}} their load-carrying mechanism {{is similar to that of}} traditional steel moment-resisting systems. However, both systems are different in terms of beam-column connection details which may strongly influence the lateral structural behavior. Specially, the presence of <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> in a beam-column joint of a unit modular frame could cause undesirable failure during strong earthquakes. Therefore, this study carried out finite element analyses (FEMs) of unit modular frames to investigate the cyclic behavior of beam-column joints with the <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> Analysis results show that the unit modular frames present stable cyclic response with large deformation capacities and their joints are classified into semi-rigid connections even if there are <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> Keywords—Unit modular frame, steel moment connection, nonlinear analytical model, moment-rotation relation, <b>access</b> <b>holes.</b> I...|$|R

50|$|The main {{advantages}} {{of this system}} are in increased safety for the fire-fighter, as they may remain outside the most hazardous area. In particular, the need for highly-dangerous smoke diving is reduced. The small size of the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> also reduces any risk of flashover or backdraft. Flashover is reduced by avoiding the need {{to open up a}} large <b>access</b> <b>hole,</b> backdraft by the flow of water through this small hole keeping any flow cooled and directed inwards, towards the fire.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} roots on soil-moisture {{measurements}} {{taken with a}} neutron probe were studied. These effects were observed under three different soil-moisture conditions, with different sized roots, and with varying distances between the access tube and root. The moisture conditions used were air dry, field capacity, and saturated. Large roots can greatly affect neutron soil-moisture measurements when the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> is drilled through the root. Positive errors as large as 52 percent were found when the soil moisture was at field capacity. With dry and saturated conditions positive errors of 43 percent and 38 percent respectively, were found. In most practical field situations, where the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> is not drilled through large roots, root material appears to have very little effect, if any, on neutron soil-moisture measurements. The largest positive error found, when the <b>access</b> <b>holes</b> were not drilled through the roots, was only 8 percent.

30|$|Nowadays, implant screw-retained {{prosthesis}} {{becomes a}} popular mode of implant supra-structure restoration. Cement retained implant restoration has issues including irretrievability and difficulty {{of controlling the}} cement excess beyond the abutment joint. The cement excess can be {{a major cause of}} peri-implantitis [13 – 15]. Screw-retained implant restoration has also some disadvantages including the difficulty to get a right positioning of the access-hole compatible with a suitable aesthetic appearance and the aesthetic result of the access-hole restoration [16]. Inclined abutment or angling the screw channel can be an option to ameliorate the aesthetical outcomes [17, 18]. Moving the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> to an occlusal or palatal/lingual zone would increase the indication of screw retained implant restoration. The development of the computer-assisted implant surgery increases the use of the screw-retained prosthesis compared to the cement retained method [19, 20]. Nevertheless, the integrity of the filling of the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> is necessary to preserve to occlusal function and the aesthetic outcomes. Moreover, the <b>access</b> <b>hole</b> filling contributes to reinforce the surrounding ceramic [9].|$|R
