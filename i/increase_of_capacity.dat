5000|$|... exFAT allows {{individual}} files {{larger than}} 4 GiB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video which can exceed the 4 GiB limit {{in less than}} an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4 GiB. With the <b>increase</b> <b>of</b> <b>capacity</b> and the increase of data being transferred, the write operation needs to be made more efficient. SDXC cards, running at UHS-I have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10 MBps and exFAT plays a factor in achieving that throughput through the reduction of the file system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a cluster bitmap and elimination (or reduction) of writes to the FAT. A single bit in the directory record indicates that the file is contiguous, telling the exFAT driver to ignore the FAT.This optimization is analogous to an extent in other file systems, except that it only applies to whole files, as opposed to contiguous parts of files.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} the Fig.  4 that the EENS index {{decreases}} as the installed <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the TPGS or WPGS increases. However, the impact <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> installed <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the TPGS is larger than that <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> installed <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> the WPGS. The difference becomes more significant as the increased installed capacity is larger. It is reasonable to judge that the reliability of the hybrid generation system is more sensitive to the TPGS than the WPGS. This is because the power system can obtain more power from the TPGS than the WPGS on the average when they have the same increased installed capacity since in general, tidal power has less randomness than wind power.|$|R
