25|$|Few animals live {{in these}} areas; birds, mostly, {{such as the}} willow warbler, the meadow pipit, the {{northern}} wheatear, and these rarer ones: the European golden plover, the Eurasian <b>dotterel,</b> the snow bunting, and the Lapland longspur. The willow ptarmigan is relatively common, whereas the rock ptarmigan is found only on the highest peaks. For many of these species, Fulufjället is the southernmost part of their range in Sweden.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Papakanui Spit on {{the south}} head of the harbour entrance, a mobile sandspit, is {{important}} as a breeding and roosting area for the New Zealand <b>dotterel</b> and the fairy tern. It also has areas of pingao. The spit was an important habitat for the Caspian tern. The birds have moved {{to other parts of}} Kaipara Harbour, possibly due to human disturbance. An air weapons range used by the New Zealand Defence Force is a short distance south of the spit.|$|E
25|$|The provincial fish is {{the brown}} trout which is found {{together}} with common whitefish, grayling, European perch, Arctic char, burbot, salmon and the carnivorous northern pike. Roughly 250 types of birds {{have been observed}} in Jämtland. The species presence greatly varies, in the fells bluethroat, long-tailed skua, Eurasian <b>dotterel,</b> ptarmigan, Lapland and snow bunting are found. The forested region is inhabited by species such as hazel hen, black grouse, capercaillie, Siberian jay, three-toed woodpecker and rustic bunting. Several different types of owls dwells in the province and the provincial owl is the northern hawk owl.|$|E

50|$|The family Charadriidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in {{a guide to the}} contents of the British Museum published in 1820. Most members of the family are known as plovers, lapwings or <b>dotterels.</b> These were rather vague terms which were not applied with any great consistency in the past. In general, larger species have often been called lapwings, smaller species plovers or <b>dotterels</b> and there are in fact two clear taxonomic sub-groups: most lapwings belong to the subfamily Vanellinae, most plovers and <b>dotterels</b> to Charadriinae.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand plovers are {{shorebirds}} and {{are usually}} found on sandy beaches and sandspits or feeding on tidal estuaries. Around 1990 these birds were nearing extinction with about 1300 northern <b>dotterels,</b> and approximately 75 or so southern <b>dotterels</b> but conservation measures have been effective in raising these numbers to 1700 and 250 respectively by 2005.|$|R
25|$|As of 2006, the {{following}} birds {{have been observed}} - Richard's pipit, wedge tailed eagle, white-faced heron, eastern reef egret, ruddy turnstone, masked woodswallow, galah, red-necked stint, Cape Barren geese, Horsfield's rufous tailed, Australian raven, white-fronted chat, crimson chat, rockhopper penguin, Australian kestrel, white bellied sea eagle, welcome swallow, silver gull, Pacific gull, singing honeyeater, budgerigah, rock parrot, golden whistler, osprey, house sparrow, red-capped robin, red-tailed tropicbird, great cormorant, white-browed scrubwren, crested tern, common starling, hooded <b>dotterel,</b> barn owl, masked plover, silver eye and breeding colonies of fairy tern, little penguin and sooty oystercatcher.|$|E
25|$|Many coastal {{birds are}} {{frequently}} found in Rottnest. These include the pied cormorant, osprey, pied oystercatcher, silver gull, crested tern, fairy tern, bridled tern, rock parrot and the reef heron. The island salt lakes contain brine shrimp which support birds {{such as the}} red-necked avocet, banded stilt, ruddy turnstone, curlew sandpiper, red-capped <b>dotterel,</b> Australian shelduck, red-necked stint, grey plover, white-fronted chat, Caspian tern and the crested tern.

25|$|Despite its {{understated}} reputation A' Bhuidheanach Bheag {{does offer}} the walker {{the feeling of}} space and the wide open skies of the high Grampian mountains. Its gentle curving slopes have much wildlife with Eurasian <b>dotterel,</b> ptarmigan, grouse and mountain hare seen on a regular basis. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as “Little Yellow Place” and is thought {{to refer to the}} coarse yellow grass which grows on its slopes. The “Little” part of the name is slightly confusing as the hill is the highest point on {{the southern part of the}} plateau but demonstrates that the hill was named from how it looked from the valley not by its altitude.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} least weasel, mouse-like rodents predominate in the stoat's diet. However, unlike the least weasel, which almost {{exclusively}} feeds on small voles, the stoat regularly preys on larger rodent and lagomorph species, and will take down individuals far larger than itself. In Russia, its prey includes rodents and lagomorphs such as European water voles, common hamsters, pikas, and others, which it overpowers in their burrows. Prey species of secondary importance include small birds, fish, and shrews and, more rarely, amphibians, lizards, and insects. In Great Britain, European rabbits are an important food source, with the frequency in which stoats prey on them having increased between the 1960s and mid 1990s {{since the end of}} the myxomatosis epidemic. Typically, male stoats prey on rabbits more frequently than females do, which depend to a greater extent on smaller rodent species. British stoats rarely kill shrews, rats, squirrels and water voles, though rats may be an important food source locally. In Ireland, shrews and rats are frequently eaten. In mainland Europe, water voles make up a large portion of the stoat's diet. Hares are sometimes taken, but are usually young specimens. In North America, where the ecological niche for rat and rabbit sized prey is taken by the larger long-tailed weasel, the stoat preys on mice, voles, shrews, and young cottontails. In New Zealand, the stoat feeds principally on birds, including the rare kiwi, kaka, mohua, yellow-crowned parakeet, and New Zealand <b>dotterel.</b> Cases are known of stoats preying on young muskrats. The stoat typically eats about [...] of food a day, which is equivalent to 25% of the animal's live weight.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are a few}} {{very curious}} {{cases in which the}} female bird is {{actually}} more brilliant than the male, and which yet have open nests. Such are the <b>dotterel</b> (Eudromias morinellus), several species of phalarope, an Australian creeper (Climacteris erythropus), and a few others; but in every one of these cases the relation of the sexes in regard to nidification is reversed, the male performing the duties of incubation, while the female is the stronger and more pugnacious. This curious case, therefore, quite accords with the general law of coloration.[124] ...|$|E
60|$|The {{females of}} Phalaropus fulicarius and P. hyperboreus are larger, {{and in their}} summer plumage “more gaily attired than the males.” But the {{difference}} in colour between the sexes is far from conspicuous. The male alone of P. fulicarius undertakes, according to Professor Steenstrup, the duty of incubation, as is likewise shewn {{by the state of}} his breast-feathers during the breeding-season. The female of the <b>dotterel</b> plover (Eudromias morinellus) is larger than the male, and has the red and black tints on the lower surface, the white crescent on the breast, and the stripes over the eyes, more strongly pronounced. The male also takes at least a share in hatching the eggs; but the female likewise attends to the young.[248] I {{have not been able to}} discover whether with these species the young resemble the adult males more closely than the adult females; for the comparison is somewhat difficult to make on account of the double moult.|$|E

60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, <b>dotterel,</b> red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E
