50|$|Jordan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I, but did not serve overseas. After college, he was a sheep rancher in Hells Canyon in Idaho during the Great <b>Depression</b> at Kirkwood <b>Bar,</b> and then settled in Grangeville in 1940, where he established a farm implement business, a real estate agency, and an automobile dealership.|$|R
50|$|The Lock Back Safety mechanism, also {{invented by}} Ron Lake, {{is similar in}} {{function}} to the LAWKS mechanism. It is a lockback folder with a switch that can prevent the locking bar from being depressed. Inside the handle {{there is a small}} rod with a flange near the butt of the handle. The other end is connected to a switch near the pivot end. When the switch is pulled back (away from the pivot) the lock functions as a regular lockback. When the switch is closed the flange on the rod slides under tip of the locking bar at the butt end. This prevents the <b>depression</b> of the <b>bar</b> and the blade from unlocking. When the knife is closed the system functions the same way to lock it closed or allow it to open.|$|R
5|$|The Great <b>Depression</b> {{prevented}} <b>Bär</b> from {{gaining a}} civil pilot license. In 1934, {{he joined the}} Reichswehr and {{was assigned to the}} 3. Kompanie of Kraftfahrabteilung 4 (3rd Company of the 4th Motor Vehicle Battalion) as a mechanic. He served in this position until the following year, when he was transferred to a combat wing of the Luftwaffe. A few months later, he was accepted for pilot training, receiving his transport aircraft pilot's training. From 1 November 1937 to 31 March 1938, Bär attended the flight school at Oldenburg and was then transferred to the flight school at Hildesheim. He was transferred again, attending the flight school at Ludwigslust where he attained his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot's Certificate (Erweiterter Luftwaffen-Flugzeugführerschein), also known as 'C'-Certificate, confirming proficiency on multi-engine aircraft, on 16 May 1938. Bär then attended the blind flying school Blindflugschule 2 (BFS 2—2nd blind flying school) at Neuburg an der Donau from 7 July to 14 August 1938. He was transferred to I./Jagdgeschwader 135, the core of the future Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51), on 1 September 1938, usually flying the Junkers Ju 86. The Squadron Leader (Staffelkapitän) Douglas Pitcairn noticed Bär's flying talents and tried to convince Bär to become a fighter pilot. Initially Bär refused, but after he illegally conducted some aerobatics in the Ju 86 leading to an engine failure, he reluctantly accepted and became a fighter pilot.|$|R
5000|$|It {{appears that}} {{the first person to}} carry out any {{reported}} experimental programme to investigate the heat produced as a result of plastic deformation was Henri Tresca. These results were reported in a very long and useful paper in June 1878 [...] Tresca forged a bar of platinum (as well as many other metals); at the moment of forging the metal had just cooled down below red heat. The subsequent blow of the steam hammer, which left a <b>depression</b> in the <b>bar</b> and lengthened it, also reheated it in the direction of two lines {{in the form of a}} letter X. So great was this reheating, the metal along these lines was fully restored for some seconds to red heat. Tresca carried out many forging experiments on different metals. Tresca estimated the amount of plastic work converted into heat from a large number of experiments, and it was always above 70%.|$|R
50|$|It first {{formed as}} part of the parish of Holytown when {{substantial}} coal workings were being exploited during the 19th Century. The village prospered and so when the Church of Scotland suffered Disruption in 1843 the new Free Church was constructed in New Stevenston or Wrangholm to serve the mining community.With the decline of coal mining, {{and the rise of the}} steel and heavy engineering industries the bulk of the population were employed until the serious industrial decline of the late 20th Century, culminating in the closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks.Employment has shifted towards more diverse occupations and housing development has continued. There has been significant redevelopment since the late 1960s when the bulk of the late 19th century tenement flats were demolished.Ethnic and cultural diversity has broadened and there is now a purpose-built mosque on the site of the former apprentices' training school of the old Stewart's and Lloyd's tube works.The coal mining past is still significant; the area has suffered widespread undermining, which was a serious limit to new construction until relatively recently. The local church has cracked walls, garden <b>depressions</b> and tie <b>bars</b> as evidence for this.|$|R
40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) {{surveys of}} unit and compound braid bars in the sandy South Saskatchewan River, Canada, {{are used to}} test the influential facies model for sandy braided alluvium presented by Cant & Walker (1978). Four main radar facies are identified: (1) high-angle (up to angle-of-repose) inclined reflections, interpreted as having formed at the margins of migrating bars; (2) discontinuous undular and/or trough-shaped reflections, interpreted as cross-strata associated with the migration of sinuous-crested dunes; (3) lowangle (< 6 °) reflections, interpreted as formed by low-amplitude dunes or unit bars as they migrate onto bar surfaces; and (4) reflections of variable dip bounded by a concave reflection, interpreted as being formed by the filling of channel scours, cross-bar channels or <b>depressions</b> on the <b>bar</b> surface. The predominant vertical arrangement of facies is discontinuous trough-shaped reflections at the channel base overlain by discontinuous undular reflections, overlain by low-angle reflections that dominate the deposits near the bar surface. High-angle inclined reflections are only found near the surface of unit bars, and are of relatively small-scale (< 0. 5 m), but can be found at a greater range of depths within compound bars. The GPR data show that a high spatial variability exists in the distribution of facies between different compound bars, with facies variability within a single bar being as pronounced as that between bars. Compound bars evolve as an amalgamation of unit bars and other compound bars, and comprise a facies distribution that is representative of the main bar types in the South Saskatchewan River. The GPR data are compared with the original model of Cant & Walker (1978) and reveal a much greater variability in the scale, proportion and distribution of facies than that presented by Cant & Walker (1978). Most notably, high-angle inclined strata are over-represented in the model of Cant and Walker, with many bars being dominated by the deposits of low- and high-amplitude dunes. It is suggested that further GPR studies from a range of braided river types are required to properly quantify the full range of deposits. Only by moving away from traditional, highly generalized facies models can a greater understanding of braided river deposits and their controls be established...|$|R
