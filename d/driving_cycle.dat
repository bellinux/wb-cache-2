40|$|Chassis {{dynamometer}} <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> {{designed to}} quantify vehicle emissions often miss the extremes in driver behaviour. The vehicle emissions measured during these <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> {{are used for}} modelling and policy purposes. To better understand the impact of omitting such extremes, two drivers were asked to follow a set of behavioural rules to replicate ‘aggressive’ and ‘passive’ driving styles along a real-world route in Southampton, UK. The test route included {{a wide range of}} traffic conditions that could be expected on urban roads. The resulting driving profiles were compared to a number of legislative <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> – this indicated that aggressive driving was poorly addressed by these cycles. When replicated on a chassis dynamometer, the aggressive profile produced carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide emission rates of 2 · 68, 0 · 853 and 183 · 6 g/km, respectively, whereas the passive profile produced only 0 · 064, 0 · 011 and 124 · 4 g/km, respectively. Non-inclusion of aggressive driving styles in legislative <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> will mean that driving events that lead to disproportionately high emissions are not addressed by legislation designed to improve overall vehicle emissions control performance (e. g. Euro standards).
