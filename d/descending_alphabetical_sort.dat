50|$|The descriptors, usually {{placed at}} the {{beginning}} of the systematic name, are not taken into account in the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting.</b>|$|R
30|$|Authors {{have contributed}} equally to the {{development}} of the manuscript, hence the <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> of authors. Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.|$|R
50|$|Also −13 comes alphabetically after −12 {{although}} it is less. With negative numbers, to make ascending order correspond with <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> more drastic measures are needed such as adding a constant to all numbers to make them all positive.|$|R
5000|$|While n, iso and neo {{are written}} in small and italic letters, for cyclo {{this is only the}} case in {{inorganic}} compounds. In organic compounds, [...] "cyclo" [...] is frequently used as a name component, not separated by a hyphen and also considered in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For example, in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> [...] "z11" [...] {{would be}} sorted before [...] "z2" [...] because [...] "1" [...] is sorted as smaller than [...] "2", while in natural sorting [...] "z2" [...] is sorted before [...] "z11" [...] because [...] "2" [...] is sorted as smaller than [...] "11".|$|R
40|$|Of how modern Encyclopedia, {{characterized}} by a body qualified writers, authoritative direction, systematic plan development, Encyclopédie <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> entries and scientific conception of the illustrations is fixed. Since then it has undergone transformations, sometimes considerable, but as Salsano qualifies as an essential invariance, which lies {{in the role of}} encyclopedias both budgets: of the transmission of an aggregation of knowledge at a given time...|$|R
25|$|For practicality, {{usually only}} the last surname (excluding prepositions) is used in formal {{greetings}} or in scientific papers indexing. But, in a list of people, the first given name, not the surname, is used for <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting.</b> A married woman may add her partner's last surname(s) {{to the end of}} her own name, but this is not mandatory and increasingly less common. The same may happen with men, though this is extremely rare.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, {{this means}} that legally von simply became an {{ordinary}} part of the surnames {{of the people who}} used it. There are no longer any legal privileges or constraints associated with this naming convention. According to German <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> people with von in their surnames - of noble or non-noble descent alike - are listed in telephone books and other files under the rest of their name (e.g., the economist Ludwig von Mises would have been found under M in the phone book rather than V).|$|R
50|$|Since that time, {{the terms}} Edle, Edler von etc. {{are not to}} be translated, as they have lost their title status. These terms now appear {{following}} the given name, e.g. Wolfgang Gans Edler Herr zu Putlitz. As dependent parts of the surnames (nichtselbständige Namensbestandteile), the terms Edle, Edler von etc. are ignored in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> of names, as is the eventual nobility particle, and might or might not be used by those bearing them. The unofficial titles do, however, retain prestige in some circles of society.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were several}} methods used for <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> {{depending}} on the features provided by the particular sorter and {{the characteristics of the}} data to be sorted. A commonly used method on the 082 and earlier sorters was to sort the cards twice on the same column, first on digit rows 1-9, then on the zone rows 12, 11, and 0 (or vice versa, zone rows first then digit rows). Operator switches allow zone-sorting by [...] "switching off" [...] rows 1-9 for the second pass of the card for each column.|$|R
50|$|Tag {{clouds are}} {{typically}} represented using inline HTML elements. The tags can appear in alphabetical order, {{in a random}} order, they can be sorted by weight, and so on. Sometimes, further visual properties are manipulated in addition to font size, such as the font color, intensity, or weight. Most popular is a rectangular tag arrangement with <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> in a sequential line-by-line layout. The decision for an optimal layout should be driven by the expected user goals. Some prefer to cluster the tags semantically so that similar tags will appear near each other. Heuristics {{can be used to}} reduce the size of the tag cloud whether or not the purpose is to cluster the tags.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{consequence}} of YouTube introducing a system called AudioSwap on February 22, 2007, which replaces the audio of copyrighted soundtracks with a different, Creative Commons licensed song, a number of songs from 009 Sound System, particularly [...] "Dreamscape", [...] "With a Spirit", [...] "Space and Time", [...] "Born To Be Wasted", [...] "Holy Ghost", and [...] "Trinity", became widely prominent on many YouTube videos. YouTube commenters at one point jokingly declared {{one or the other}} of these songs as the unofficial [...] "national anthem" [...] for YouTube, particularly [...] "Dreamscape" [...] and [...] "With a Spirit". Due to <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> 009 Sound System songs were placed at the top of the AudioSwap list, leading them to be chosen by a majority of users.|$|R

5000|$|The order {{followed}} by the standard series letters and digits is rather unusual - numbers below 4000 are reserved for custom plates: those from 4000 to 9999 are assigned in blocks of 1000 with a changing sequence of letters. The series set out by the legislation was BA4000-BA4999, CA5000-5999, DA6000-DA6999, etc. However, {{it would appear that}} the issuers of the numbers took a while to adopt this, as the CA series used 4000-4999 before DA followed with 5000 to 5999.The prescribed sequence of issue follows a pattern of ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>alphabetical</b> order of the two letters, as can be seen in the following list. When the first block of 1000 AZ numbers has been issued, we will presumably see the issue of BA5000.Note that certain letters (I and O) and combinations are excluded. The list should be read from top to bottom, left to right: ...|$|R

50|$|Earlier {{instead of}} aa the letter å or a {{ligature}} of two a was also used.In 1948 the letter å was re-introduced or officially introduced in Danish, replacing aa. The letter then {{came from the}} Swedish alphabet, {{where it has been}} in official use since the 18th century. The initial proposal was to place Å first in the Danish alphabet, before A. Its place as the last letter of the alphabet, as in Norwegian, was decided in 1955. The former digraph Aa still occurs in personal names, and in Danish geographical names. Aa remains in use as a transliteration, if the letter is not available for technical reasons. Aa is treated like Å in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> not like two adjacent letters A, meaning that while a is the first letter of the alphabet, aa is the last.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, NIST {{withdrew the}} FIPS 55-3 {{database}}. This database included 5-digit numeric place codes for cities, towns, and villages, or other centers of {{population in the}} United States. The codes were assigned alphabetically to places within each state, {{and as a result}} changed frequently {{in order to maintain the}} <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting.</b> NIST replaced these codes with the more permanent GNIS Feature ID, maintained by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. The GNIS database is the official geographic names repository database for the United States, and is designated the only source of geographic names and locative attributes for use by the agencies of the Federal Government. [...] FIPS 8-6 [...] "Metropolitan Areas" [...] and 9-1 [...] "Congressional Districts of the U.S." [...] were also withdrawn in 2008, to be replaced with INCITS standards 454 and 455, respectively.|$|R
50|$|German nobility, {{although}} not abolished (unlike the Austrian nobility {{by the new}} First Austrian Republic in 1919), lost recognition as a legal class in Germany under the Weimar Republic in 1919 under the Weimar Constitution, article 109. Former hereditary noble titles legally simply transformed into dependent parts of the legal surname (with the former title thus now following the given name, e.g. Otto Graf Lambsdorff). As dependent parts of the surnames (nichtselbständige Namensbestandteile), they are ignored in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> of names, as is the eventual nobiliary particle, such as von or zu, and {{might or might not}} be used by those bearing them. The distinguishing main surname is the name following the Graf, or Gräfin, and the eventual nobiliary particle. Today, having lost their legal status, these terms are often not translated, unlike before 1919. The titles do, however, retain prestige in some circles of society.|$|R
50|$|The modern Danish {{alphabet}} {{is similar}} to the English one, with three additional letters: æ, ø, and å, which come {{at the end of the}} alphabet, in that order. A spelling reform in 1948 introduced the letter å, already in use in Norwegian and Swedish, into the Danish alphabet to replace the digraph aa. The old usage still occurs in some personal and geographical names (for example, the name of the city of Aalborg is spelled with Aa following a decision by the City Council in the 1970s and Aarhus decided to go back to Aa in 2011). When representing the å sound, aa is treated just like å in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> even though it looks like two letters. When the letters are not available due to technical limitations (e.g., in URLs), they are often replaced by ae (Æ, æ), oe or o (Ø, ø), and aa (Å, å), respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The German republic, under Article 109 of the Weimar Constitution of 1919, legally {{transformed}} all hereditary {{noble titles}} into dependent {{parts of the}} legal surname.

40|$|Humans {{are born}} with innate {{abilities}} that vary across individuals. Those innate abilities are at their origin unaffected by their name. Yet, as a child grows up it can be put in different situations based solely on name it holds. Those situations alter individuals' behavior in allocation of scarce resources (Carlson and Conrad, 2008) and consequently its earnings (Jurajda and Munich, 2007). At origin of these empirically observed differences might be use of alphabetical ordered lists at elementary and lower secondary schools. The empirical test I conducted fails to reject the null hypothesis that there is relation between surname initials and student achievement. Those {{at the bottom of}} alphabetical ordered list of students tend to do better {{than the rest of the}} class. Possible explanation might be use of <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> during examinations, which creates uneven incentives among students. To support this explanation a model of student's decision under risk is presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The letter Å (HTML &aring;) {{was officially}} {{introduced}} in Norwegian in 1917, replacing Aa or aa. The new letter {{came from the}} Swedish alphabet, {{where it has been}} in official use since the 18th century. The former digraph Aa still occurs in personal names. Geographical names tend to follow the current orthography, meaning that the letter å will be used. Family names may not follow modern orthography, and as such retain the digraph aa where å would be used today. Aa remains in use as a transliteration, if the letter is not available for technical reasons. Aa is treated like Å in <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> not like two adjacent letters A, meaning that while a is the first letter of the alphabet, aa is the last. This rule does not apply to non-Scandinavian names, so a modern atlas would list the German city of Aachen under A but list the Danish city of Aabenraa under Å.|$|R

5000|$|A prefix [...] {{is used in}} C {{to specify}} string {{representations}} of octal numbers, {{as required by the}} ANSI C standard for the [...] "strtol" [...] function (the string to long integer converter) in the [...] "stdlib.h" [...] library. Many other programming languages, such as Python 2, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and the Unix shell bash also follow this specification for converting strings to numbers. As an example, [...] "" [...] does not represent 2010 (2×101 + 0×100), but rather 208 = 1610 (2×81 + 0×80 = 1×101 + 6×100). Decimal numbers written with leading zeros will be interpreted as octal by languages that follow this convention and will generate errors (not just unexpected results) if they contain [...] "8" [...] or [...] "9", since these digits do not exist in octal. This behavior can be quite a nuisance when working with sequences of strings with embedded, zero-padded decimal numbers (typically file names) to facilitate <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting</b> (see above) or when validating inputs from users who would not know that adding a leading zero triggers this base conversion.|$|R

40|$|Many years ago, Leigh Mercer {{constructed}} several dictionaries {{to aid the}} aspiring palindromist. In these dictionaries, {{he listed}} various words which contain interior reversals; for example, PRETTIFY contains the word FITTER. The value of such dictionaries lies in the arrangements of the words for quick and easy access; one very useful method is to arrange all the words in reverse <b>alphabetical</b> order, <b>sorted</b> out {{by the number of}} hanging letters they contain. Thus, Y FITTER P, with a single hanging letter in front, appears toward the end of one dictionary. A second dictionary lists reversed words with double hanging letters, and a third, words with multiple hanging letters...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to other survey modes, web-surveys allow {{for using a}} closed response format for survey questions {{with a large number}} of categories, such as car types, camera types, countries, regions, industries, and occupations. In other survey modes, these questions require an open response format, followed by field- or office-coding. Web-surveys allow the use of drop-downs, for example for an alphabetically sorted list of 200 + countries, or for the use of search trees. A search tree is the most appropriate way for selfidentification of occupation, which is a key variable in socio-economic research. This paper summarizes the design principles underlying a Database of Occupations for the measurement of occupations in multi-country web-surveys by means of selfidentification. The Database was compiled as part of the FP 6 funded EurOccupations project (2006 - 2009, no 028987). The paper introduces the use of the occupation variable in datasets, in particular multi-country datasets, and explores the reasons why the Database has been designed. Using a variety of sources, the Database includes almost 1, 600 occupational titles, which is judged to be sufficiently detailed for valid-self-identification. The Database consists of a source list, a search tree and translations into the languages of almost 50 countries. It is explained how the source list has taken into account issues such as skill levels, corporate hierarchies, job ladders, managerial and supervisory occupations, craft versus manufacturing occupations, composite occupations and the methods used for translations. The requirements posed by web-surveys, such as readability, <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting,</b> coping with the category "Other" are discussed. Finally, the paper details how the Database is used in the worldwide WageIndicator web-survey. For more information see www. euroccupations. org or www. wageindicator. org...|$|R

40|$|With its diverse {{cultural}} and linguistic heritage, India today produces significant volume of digital material in Indian languages. This has been facilitated by increasing availability of word processing systems supporting Indian languages {{and their use}} in various areas including e-governance; education and research; and mass media. There is need for digital library software for organizing and provision of access to this material. Such software has to meet two prime requirements: Indexing and searching of documents in Indian languages (full text and metadata), and customizing the collection user interface in Indian languages. Further the software {{should be able to}} handle Indian language material in different encoding formats and fonts. Majority of Indian language material available online today seem to follow one of the three encoding strategies: ISO 8859 - 1 and Windows 1252 series character sets, with custom fonts; ad-hoc (font-specific or user defined) encoding schemes; and Unicode character set. Search and retrieval requirements would include features such as word truncation and <b>alphabetical</b> <b>sorting.</b> Cross-language material searching is an advanced search requirement. Greenstone is a very popular open source software used today for creating digital library collections. Main objective {{of this study was to}} assess capabilities of this software in creating Indian language digital library collections with above mentioned requirements for indexing, searching and display. We gathered five sample collections in two Indian languages Hindi and Kannada, in different encoding formats, for this study. For each of these collections, we assessed the multilingual support of Greenstone with respect to collection building; search and retrieval; and interface design. We used the Collector approach of Greenstone to build the five collections. We could successfully build the collections. Limitations were found in handling metadata in Indian languages using the GLI approach. We present details of internal mapping of character sets carried out by Greenstone during collection building process. We could successfully carry out simple keyword and Boolean searches on these collections. We discuss details of search features. Viewing results requires installation of suitable fonts at the operating system level and configuration of the browser. We found limitations in sorting. Greenstone does not support crosslanguage searching. In terms of users interface, Greenstone has in-built support for customizing the interface for well known languages. It also supports designing customized interface for other languages. We could successfully design desired user interface for the test collections in Hindi and Kannada. Overall, Greenstone appears to be a versatile software for building Indian language digital library collections, with some limitations...|$|R
