40|$|Expression of the mec- 3 /unc- 86 {{selector}} gene complex induces {{the differentiation}} of the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) of Caenorhabditis elegans. These genes are also expressed in {{another set of}} embryonically derived mechanosensory neurons, the FLP neurons, but these cells do not share obvious TRN traits or proteins. We have identified ∼ 300 genes in each cell type that are up-regulated at least threefold using DNA microarrays. Twenty-three percent of these genes are up-regulated in both cells. Surprisingly, some of the common genes had previously been identified as TRN-specific. Although the FLP neurons contain low amounts of the mRNAs for these TRN genes, {{they do not have}} detectable proteins. These results suggest that transcription control is relatively inexact but that these apparent <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> are tolerated and do not alter cell fate. Previous studies showed that loss of the EGL- 44 and EGL- 46 transcription factors cause the FLP neurons to acquire TRN-like traits. Here, we show that similar changes occur (e. g., the expression of both the TRN mRNAs and proteins) when the FLP neurons ectopically express the auxiliary transcription factor ALR- 1 (Aristaless related), which ensures, but does not direct, TRN differentiation. Thus, the FLP neurons can acquire a TRN-like fate but use multiple levels of regulation to ensure they do not. Our data indicate that expression of common master regulators in different cell types can result in inappropriate expression of effector genes. This misexpression makes these cells vulnerable to influences that could cause them to acquire alternative fates...|$|R

60|$|In 1911, {{twelve years}} after the above words were written, the {{estimate}} expressed in them of Stevenson's qualities as a writer, and of the place he seemed likely to maintain in the affections of English readers all the world over, had been amply confirmed by the lapse of time. The sale of his works kept increasing rather than diminishing. Editions kept multiplying. A new generation of readers had found life and letters, nature and human nature, touched by him at so many points with so vivifying and illuminating a charm that it had become scarcely possible to take up any newspaper or magazine and not find some reference to his work and name. Both series of letters--even one mainly concerned, as the Vailima Letters are, with matters of interest both remote and transitory--had been read in edition after edition: and readers had been and were continually asking for more. The time was thought to have come for a new and definitive edition, {{in which the two}} series of letters already published should be thrown into one, and as much new material added as could be found suitable. The task of carrying out this scheme fell again upon me. The new edition constituted in effect a nearly complete epistolary autobiography. It contained not less than a hundred and fifty of Stevenson's letters hitherto unpublished. They dated from all periods of his life, those written in the brilliant and troubled days of his youth predominating, and giving a picture, perhaps unique in its kind, of a character and talent in the making. The present edition is a reprint of the edition of 1911, with a few <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> and one or two of date corrected, and with a very few new letters added.|$|R

40|$|Conversion of Chinese phonetic symbols to the {{corresponding}} Chinese characters {{has been one}} of the most important topics currently being pursued in the field of Chinese information processing. In Mandarin Chinese, the character to syllable and syllable to character are both many to many mappings. There are around 1, 300 different syllables in Mandarin, but more than thirteen thousand commonly used Chinese characters. Some syllables can be mapped to more than 100 characters (e. g. yi). In this research, the conversion of Chinese phonetic symbols to Chinese characters is based on linguistic and statistical techniques. The phonetic symbols are first segmented into a list of syllable words by the Augmented Maximal Matching method developed in this thesis. A syllable word is a sequence of syllable that can be transcribed to one or more valid Chinese words. Augmented Maximal Matching uses Maximal Matching as backbone, integrates with special techniques that identify derived words, and modules that use both linguistic and statistical methods to determine the final segmentation. The ambiguity in syllable words are then resolved by idiomatic phrase matching, adjacency constraint rules, and statistical methods. A working prototype system to demonstrate the techniques developed in the project, together with compilers for the linguistic information, has been implemented. Extensive experiments on data from domains, ranging form science articles and linguistic text to political articles, have been done and the sources <b>of</b> <b>error</b> have been identified and analyzed. Experimental results based on 264 sentences, with 3, 001 characters, show the <b>error</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> is 1. 3 %.

It has previously been shown that two transcription units (regions 2 and 4) are subject to negative control.

At the nonpermissive temperature for the mutant, the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> early region 2 were identical to the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>of</b> WT.

The incidence of MEs was determined through the disguised direct observation method conducted by a trained observer.

For the 202 patients and the 1, 031 medication doses evaluated in the present study, 707 (68. 5 %) MEs were recorded in total. In other words, 3. 5 errors per patient and almost 0. 69 errors per medication are reported to have occurred, with the highest frequency <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> pertaining to cardiovascular (27. 2 %) and antimicrobial (23. 6 %) medications. The highest rate <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> occurred during the administration phase of the medication use process with a share of 37. 6 %, followed by <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> prescription and <b>transcription</b> with a share of 21. 1 % and 10 % <b>of</b> <b>errors,</b> respectively.
