The Alpha Jet MS2 bore {{high levels of}} similarity to Dassault's proposed Alpha Jet NGEA, featuring a Sagem-built Uliss 81 nav/attack system, a Thomson-CSF-built laser rangefinder and HUD, along with a <b>digital</b> <b>multiplex</b> databus. The Egptian Air Force used the Alpha Jet MS1 fleet to replace the Aero L-29 Delfín and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 in the trainer role, while the later-built MS2 standard aircraft served to replace the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 in the ground-attack role. In February 2000, Egypt was reportedly seeking to replace their Alpha Jet fleet, and was investigating several options, including the BAE Systems Hawk.|$|E
