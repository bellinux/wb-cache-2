25|$|Space weather degrades GPS {{operation}} in two ways, direct interference by solar radio burst {{noise in the}} same frequency band or by scattering of the GPS radio signal in <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularities</b> referred to as scintillation. Both forms of degradation follow the 11 year solar cycle and are a maximum at sunspot maximum although they can occur at any time. Solar radio bursts are associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their impact can affect reception over the half of the Earth facing the sun. Scintillation occurs most frequently at tropical latitudes where it is a night time phenomenon. It occurs less frequently at high latitudes or mid-latitudes where magnetic storms can lead to scintillation. In addition to producing scintillation, magnetic storms can produce strong ionospheric gradients that degrade the accuracy of SBAS systems.|$|E
2500|$|CERTO - Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography Experiment (1996-18/NRL) instrumentation, {{developed}} by NRL's Plasma Physics Division, {{consists of a}} stable radio beacon transmitter on the satellite and a chain of receivers on the ground. Radio transmissions from the CERTO beacon are processed by the ground receivers to produce two-dimensional maps of the electron densities in the ionosphere. The CERTO measurement technique provides images of the ionosphere with 10km vertical and horizontal resolution. In addition, <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularities</b> of 1km or less in size can be determined by fluctuations in the CERTO radio waves. [...] CERTO {{can also be used}} to calibrate the ionospheric densities obtained using the EUV instruments such as HIRAAS, GIMI, and EUVIP on ARGOS. The CERTO radio-based technique has the advantage of higher spatial resolution than provided by the EUV-based techniques, but requires ground-based receivers aligned under the satellite orbit. The two techniques together on the same satellite provide substantial improvements over each technique separately. CERTO principal investigator, Dr. Paul Bernhardt notes that the NRL instruments on ARGOS will be the first demonstration combining EUV and radio sensors for enhanced imaging of the ionosphere.|$|E

40|$|We have {{examined}} several cases of magnetosphere compression by solar wind pressure pulses using {{a set of}} instruments located in the noon sector of auroral zone. We {{have found that the}} increase in riometric absorption (sudden commencement absorption, SCA) occurred simultaneously with the beginning of negative or positive magnetic variations and broadband enhancement of magnetic activity in the frequency range above 0. 1 Hz. Since magnetic variations were observed before the step-like increase of magnetic field at equatorial station (main impulse, MI), the negative declinations resembled the so-called preliminary impulse, PI. In this paper a mechanism for the generation of PI is introduced whereby PI's generation is linked to SCA – associated precipitation and the local enhancement of ionospheric conductivity leading to the reconstruction of the ionospheric current system prior to MI. Calculation showed that PI polarity depends on orientation of the background electric field and location of the observation point relative to <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularity.</b> For one case of direct measurements of electric field in the place where the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularity</b> was present, the sign of calculated disturbance corresponded to the observed one.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the orientation of the}} small-scale <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularity</b> anisotropy in a plane perpendicular to the geomagnetic field and the direction of plasma convection in the F region is investigated. The cross-field anisotropy of irregularities is obtained by fitting theoretical expectations for the amplitude scintillations of satellite radio signals to the actual measurements. Information on plasma convection was provided by the SuperDARN HF radars. Joint satellite/radar observations in both the auroral zone and the polar cap are considered. It is shown that the irregularity cross-field anisotropy agrees quite well with the direction of plasma convection with the best agreement for events with quasi-stationary convection patterns...|$|R
30|$|Tsunoda (1985) {{shows that}} the <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularity</b> {{occurrence}} is a maximum when sunsets in the conjugate E-region are simultaneous. Simultaneous sunset is expected to intensify the so-called PRE (Abdu et al., 1981, 1992, 2010; Batista et al., 1986), a favorable and sufficient condition for the initiation of RTI. The angle between the geomagnetic meridian and the sunset terminator line was introduced as a proxy of the simultaneous sunset in the conjugate points (Burke et al., 2004). Since, in the Brazilian longitude sector, the angle tends to be much closer during November–February than March–September, higher occurrence probabilities and greater S 4 max are more expected during the November–February (see Figs. 2 and 3).|$|R

Based on the scintillation data and results from in situ measurements, several <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularity</b> models with different power spectra are studied. Scintillation index is computed for the various models and compared with observed results. Both magnitude and frequency dependence of the scintillation index are investigated. It is found that a thick irregularity slab {{of the order of}} 200 km with an electron density fluctuation of about 20 per cent of its background value and with a nonmonotonic power spectrum may account for the maximum observed values of the scintillation index as well as its frequency dependence. Some future observations and measurements are suggested...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the Scandinavian Twin Auroral Radar Experiment (STARE) {{very high}} {{frequency}} (VHF) coherent scatter radars were used to study field aligned E region <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularities.</b> Using two radars with overlapping fields of view, {{it was possible to}} determine the 2D velocity vector of E region ionospheric plasma flow. However, irregularities were only observed when the radar wavevector was perpendicular to the magnetic field in the scattering region. This meant that there was a problem with operating at VHF since VHF frequencies don't allow for very much refraction of the transmitted radar wave vector; thus, the perpendicularity requirement could not be easily met at high latitudes. At HF frequencies, however, refraction of the radar wavevector is greater, and this allows for the perpendicularity requirement to be met at high latitudes. Refraction of radio waves in the ionosphere is a complicated non-linear phenomenon governed by the Appleton-Hartree equation.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we have {{compared}} {{the pattern of}} <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularities</b> derived from ground-based GPS measurements with daily ROTI maps constructed from multi-satellite LEO–GPS data. We found major differences between the shapes of irregularities’ structures observed by these techniques. During the main phase of the March 2015 geomagnetic storm, ground-based ROTI maps indicated that the zone of intense <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularities</b> was expanded and moved equatorward comparing to quiescent conditions. The oval pattern of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>irregularities</b> occurred due to plasma density gradients caused by storm-induced particle precipitation and subsequent ionization of the neutral components.
