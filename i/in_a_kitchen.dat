5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen,</b> at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks and makeup for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen</b> mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E

5|$|As the 2011–12 season began, many hockey {{writers and}} {{commentators}} {{were convinced that}} the Senators would finish {{at or near the}} bottom of the NHL standings. In the midst of rebuilding, the Ottawa lineup contained many rookies and inexperienced players. The team struggled out of the gate, losing five of their first six games before a reversal of fortunes saw them win six games in a row. In December 2011, the team acquired forward Kyle Turris from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for David Rundblad and a draft pick. The team improved its play afterwards and moved into a playoff position before the All-Star Game. For the first time in Senators' history, the All-Star Game was held in Ottawa, and it was considered a great success. Five Senators were voted in or named to the event, including Daniel Alfredsson, who was named captain of one team. The team continued its playoff push after the break. After starting goalie Craig Anderson injured his hand <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen</b> accident at home, the Senators called up Robin Lehner from Binghamton and acquired highly regarded goaltender Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues. While Anderson recovered, the team continued its solid play. On April 1, 2012, the Senators defeated the New York Islanders 5–1, officially ensuring a playoff position. The team finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, drawing a first round playoff matchup against the Conference champion New York Rangers. Ultimately, Ottawa lost the series in seven games.|$|E

25|$|While {{there was}} much {{criticism}} {{of the lack of}} fire sprinkler systems, Geoff Wilkinson, the building regulations columnist for the Architects' Journal, wrote on 14 June 2017 that if a gas riser was leaking or the cladding was at fault, sprinklers would have had little effect. He also said that reports of combustible material stored in the common walkways suggested poor overall management. David Siber, an advisor to the Fire Brigades Union, said sprinklers would have prevented the fire, if it started <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen,</b> from ever spreading beyond that room.|$|E

25|$|The staple diet of Manipur {{consists}} of rice, fish, large varieties of leafy vegetables (of both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen</b> garden and rear fishes in small ponds around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown {{at home or}} obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having its own special vegetables and preparations. The taste {{is very different from}} mainland Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic herbs and roots that are peculiar to the region. They are however very similar to the cuisines of Southeast/East/Central Asia, Siberia, Micronesia and Polynesia.|$|E

25|$|In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still-life {{painting}} depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often {{arranged on}} a simple stone slab, and also a painting {{with one or more}} figures, but significant still-life elements, typically set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen</b> or tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain {{in the second quarter of}} the 17th century. The tradition of still-life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than it ever was in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'œil, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of breakfast piece did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Still-life painting in Spain, also called bodegones, was austere. It differed from Dutch still life, which often contained rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items of fabric or glass. The game in Spanish paintings is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Even while both Dutch and Spanish still life often had an embedded moral purpose, the austerity, which some find akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, appears to reject the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of Dutch still-life paintings.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, McCotter had {{not reached}} the one percent polling {{threshold}} necessary {{to participate in}} the event's August 11 debate on Fox News. At the time, McCotter had little support, even at home. Public Policy Polling showed him with only five percent from Michigan Republicans, a figure pollsters described as rare coming from a candidate's homestate. With news of his standing, McCotter cancelled a scheduled stop in New Hampshire, and returned to his headquarters in Michigan to coordinate a debate inclusion effort. As part of the effort, the campaign filmed a YouTube video <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen,</b> featuring McCotter making puns about food, and concluding with [...] "Thanks, dude." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "unfortunate". Despite the effort, McCotter did not meet the polling threshold and was excluded.

[...] When there is just one card left unturned, the killer says that it is not meant for him but for the reader, and turns it over to reveal the [...] "death" [...] card.|$|E

Another was his naturalness; the man that viewers saw on television every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen</b> making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times {{as a result of the}} frustrations of daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 to 1963 said, [...] "Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone else does.

Beyoncé is nicknamed Honey Bee, a {{reference}} to the character Honey Bunny in Tarantino's 1994 crime film Pulp Fiction. After an exchange of dialogues, Gaga and Beyoncé travel through the desert and pull over at a diner. Beyoncé sits opposite to her boyfriend, Gibson, but becomes tired of his stupidity and poisons him, but it does not kill him like she had hoped. The video later shifts to an intermediate sequence called [...] "Let's Make a Sandwich", where Gaga stands <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>kitchen,</b> wearing a folded-up telephone on her head, while dancers cavort behind her, holding salad tongs and assorted cutlery. Ultimately, Gaga prepares a sandwich and eats it, after a dance sequence. In the meantime, Gaga mixes poison into all of the dishes she is preparing for the unsuspecting customers causing Gibson and everybody else, including characters played by Semi Precious Weapons and her Great Dane, Lava, to die. Gaga and Beyoncé perform another dance sequence, wearing American flag inspired garments and shredded denims, while strutting around the dead bodies. Gaga and Beyoncé leave the diner in the [...] "Pussy Wagon" [...] and travel on a highway as a news reporter (played by Jai Rodriguez) reports the murders at the diner. The final shots shows Gaga and Beyoncé travelling through the desert with police sirens wailing in the background. The video ends with the line [...] "To Be Continued..."
