40|$|Although the {{temperature}} stability and {{uncertainty of the}} <b>freezing</b> <b>plateau</b> is better {{than that of the}} melting plateau in most of the thermometry fixed points, but realization of melting plateaus are easier than that of freezing plateaus for metal fixed points. It will be convenient if the melting points can be used instead of the freezing points in calibration of standard noble metal thermocouples because of easier realization and longer plateau duration of melting plateaus. In this work a comparison between the melting and freezing points of copper (Cu) was carried out using standard noble metal thermocouples. Platinum - platinum 10...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to develop a}} simple laboratory-based method for simulating the freezing profiles of beef trim so that their effect on E. coli 0157 survival could be better assessed. A commercially available apparatus of the type used for freezing embryos, together with an associated temperature logger and software, was {{used for this purpose}} with a - 80 degrees C freezer as a heat sink. Four typical beef trim freezing profiles, of different starting temperatures or lengths, were selected and modelled as straight lines for ease of manipulation. A further theoretical profile with an extended <b>freezing</b> <b>plateau</b> was also developed. The laboratory-based setup worked well and the modelled freezing profiles fitted closely to the original data. No change in numbers of any of the strains was apparent for the three simulated profiles of different lengths starting at 25 degrees C. Slight but significant (P < 0. 05) decreases in numbers (similar to 0. 2 log cfu g(- 1)) of all strains were apparent for a profile starting at 12 degrees C. A theoretical version of this profile with a <b>freezing</b> <b>plateau</b> phase extended from 11 h to 17 h resulted in significant (P < 0. 05) decreases in numbers (similar to 1. 2 log cfu g(- 1)) of all strains. Results indicated possible avenues for future research in controlling this pathogen. The method developed in this study proved a useful and cost-effective way for simulating freezing profiles of beef trim. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A robust {{fixed point}} using pure nickel {{contained}} in an alumina crucible {{has been developed}} for thermocouple calibrations. It was observed that a deep supercool often caused the <b>freezing</b> <b>plateau</b> to be short and have a large slope. A procedure for realizing the pure nickel fixed points was developed that reserved {{a small amount of}} nickel in the solid state to act as a seed for nucleation of the freeze. This procedure was found to allow freezing plateaus that were suitably long and flat to make them useful for calibrating thermocouples. Using a calibrated Pt/Pd thermocouple, the freezing temperature of nickel was determined to be (Formula presented.) with a (Formula presented.) uncertainty of (Formula presented.).

40|$|The methods {{currently}} used by metrologists for estimating {{the influence of}} impurities in metal fixed points require accurate knowledge of the concentrations of impurities present and of liquidus slopes of binary systems. In this thesis, two alternative methods are presented that can estimate the influence of impurities without requiring any knowledge of the impurities. Both methods are based on Scheil’s solidification model. By using a numerical solidification model it is shown that the freezing behaviour of a fixed point cell can approximate to Scheil’s model when the freezing time is greater than x 2 / D, where x is {{the thickness of the}} ingot and D is the diffusion coefficient of impurities in the liquid. The first method uses the gradient of a freezing curve at about 0. 5 fraction solid, and is able to predict the influence of impurities with a maximum uncertainty of around 25 %. This is assuming that all the important impurities have distribution coefficients much lower than 1, which is often the case in practice. By applying some modifications to this method, it is possible {{to determine whether or not}} the distribution coefficients of the dominant impurities lie below or above 1. The second method involves numerically best fitting Scheil’s equation to a freezing curve. This method works for materials with multiple impurities, but problems arise when it is applied to an experimental freezing curve due to distortion in the <b>freeze</b> <b>plateau.</b> This is thought to be caused by the thermal effects arising from the non-uniform thermal conditions under which the fixed point is realised. It is experimentally and numerically demonstrated that the thermal uniformity of the three-zone furnace is improved by separating (thermally isolating) the heating zones. By modelling the freezing behaviour of a silver cell in the three-zone furnace it is shown that (a) increasing the freeze undercooling increases the influence of the thermal effects and adversely affects the shape of the <b>freeze</b> <b>plateau,</b> and (b) making the temperature at the base of the cell higher than that at the top reduces the influence of the thermal effects and improves the shape of the <b>freeze</b> <b>plateau.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90) assigns agreed {{temperatures}} to {{the phase}} transitions (such as melting or freezing) of pure materials, which {{can then be}} used to calibrate standard platinum resistance thermometers. The freezing point is usually depressed slightly {{by the presence of}} impurities, so the use of materials with sub-ppm impurity levels is essential. During the manufacture of melting and freezing point cells, additional impurities may be introduced, however access to the sample is then difficult or impossible. Impurity estimates usually dominate the uncertainty of such fixed points, so a quantitative estimate is essential. Traditionally, Raoult’s law has been used to estimate impurities by examining the temperature variation during melting and freezing, but there are concerns that solid-soluble impurities are not detected by this method. In addition to freezing curve analysis for each cell, at NMI we now assess impurities by looking at the temperature variation amongst a batch of cells of different sources. In the past this was a very time consuming activity, as furnaces need to be balanced for each cell design. A new facility at NMI based on a modified high temperature oil bath, now allows us to compare pairs of tin cells at the 0. 2 mK level, with melting and <b>freezing</b> <b>plateaus</b> longer than 12 hours. In this paper, 4 of NMI’s tin cells (231. 928 oC) are compared, and the practical utility of Raoult’s law for fixed point cells is experimentally tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{calibration}} of platinum-based thermocouples from 420 °C to 1100 °C {{is currently}} {{carried out at}} INRIM making use of two different apparatus: for temperatures below 930 °C, a potassium gas-controlled heat pipe (GCHP) is used, whereas a metal-block furnace is adopted for higher temperatures. The standard uncertainty of the reference temperature obtained in the lower temperature range is almost one order of magnitude better than in the higher temperature range. A sealed copper cell was investigated {{to see if it}} could be used to calibrate thermocouples above 930 °C with a lower uncertainty than our current procedures allowed. The cell was characterized with Type S and Pt/Pd thermocouples and with an HTPRT. The <b>freezing</b> <b>plateaux</b> were flat within 0. 01 °C and lasted up to 1 h with a repeatability of 0. 02 °C. The temperature of the cell was determined with a standard uncertainty of 0. 04 °C. Hence, the copper cell was found to be superior to the comparator furnace for the calibration of platinum- based thermocouples because of the significant decrease in the uncertainty that it provides. An analysis was also carried out on the calibration of Pt/Pd thermocouples, and {{it was found that the}} combined use of the potassium GCHP and the Cu fixed-point cell is adequate to exploit the potential of these sensors in the range from 420 °C to 1084 °C. A comparison with a fixed-point calibration was also made which gave rise to agreement within 0. 07 °C between the two approaches...|$|R

40|$|We discuss quantum {{fidelity}} {{decay of}} classically regular dynamics, in particular for an important special {{case of a}} vanishing time averaged perturbation operator, i. e. vanishing expectation values of the perturbation in the eigenbasis of unperturbed dynamics. A complete semiclassical picture of this situation is derived in which we show that the quantum fidelity of individual coherent initial states exhibits three different regimes in time: (i) first it follows the corresponding classical fidelity up to time t 1 =hbar^(- 1 / 2), (ii) then it <b>freezes</b> on a <b>plateau</b> of constant value, (iii) and after a time scale t_ 2 =min[hbar^(1 / 2) delta^(- 2),hbar^(- 1 / 2) delta^(- 1) ] it exhibits fast ballistic decay as exp(-const. delta^ 4 t^ 2 /hbar) where delta is a strength of perturbation. All the constants are computed in terms of classical dynamics for sufficiently small effective value hbar of the Planck constant. A similar picture is worked out also for general initial states, and specifically for random initial states, where t_ 1 = 1, and t_ 2 =delta^(- 1). This prolonged stability of quantum dynamics {{in the case of}} a vanishing time averaged perturbation could prove to be useful in designing quantum devices.
