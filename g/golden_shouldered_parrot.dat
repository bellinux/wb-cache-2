50|$|The <b>Golden</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> {{is scarce}} in captivity. A {{population}} of perhaps 1,000 birds in Australia and perhaps 300 held in overseas aviaries means a limited gene pool is available. A dedicated group of breeders in Australia {{have attempted to}} promote the species and ensure that a viable breeding population is maintained in captivity. Many international breeders are also working toward this same goal.|$|E
50|$|The {{golden-shouldered parrot}} lives in open forested {{grassland}} liberally populated by numerous termite species and their mounds. Often these mounds are found every few metres apart. The parrot feeds on {{the seeds of}} small grass species and several months of the year, principally those prior to {{the onset of the}} wet season, the birds are almost entirely dependent on the small but plentiful seed of firegrass (Schizachyrium fragile). An important habitat requirement is the presence of suitably sized terrestrial termite mounds, in which the birds nest. This has led to the <b>Golden</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> and its relatives being known as the antbed parrots.|$|E
50|$|The {{golden-shouldered parrot}} {{will build a}} nest in the taller {{magnetic}} termite mounds (up to 2 m high)but surveys point to the preference for the lower dome type mounds. This may be {{to do with the}} slower heating up and cooling of the smaller denser mounds.Commonly they dig a burrow into the mound when wet season rains have softened the substrate of the mounds. Typically a 50 -350 mm long tunnel is dug down into the mound ending in the nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3-6 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The termite occupants of the mound use a natural form of airconditioning to preserve the climatic conditions of their colony and this process regulates the temperature of the parrot's nest chamber at around 28-30 degrees C. Temperature surveys have shown however, a range of 13-35 degrees C. These conditions have led to the parrots developing a habit of leaving the eggs at night beginning around the 10th day after hatching. A symbiotic relationship is present between the <b>Golden</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> and a moth species (Trisyntopa scatophaga) that is worthy of note. Found in around half of parrot nests, the moths seek out the newly dug nest tunnels and deposit their eggs in the entrance. The hatching moth larvae consume the faeces of the nestling parrots therefore helping to keep the nest chamber clean. Whether the parrots receive any other benefits from the presence of moths is arguable as not all nests contain moth larvae.|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of mycobacteriosis was detected in an aviary containing Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) and <b>golden</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>parrots</b> (Psephotus chrysopterygius). Affected birds developed granulomatous lesions, usually {{of the liver}} and intestine. Mycobacterium peregrinum, a species of the Mycobacterium fortuitum group, was cultured on pooled samples of intestinal tract from 31 euthanized finches. These rapid-growing mycobacteria are saprophytic organisms that are generally not associated with clinical disease in immunocomponenet hosts. This is the first report of mycobacteriosis in finches implicating M peregrinum as a causative agent...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>Shoulders</b> has {{released}} three albums, Let My Burden Be (2002), Friendship is Deep (2004), and Get Reasonable (2009), {{along with the}} EPs Bee 17 (2005) and Kin (2006). Thus far, all officially released <b>Golden</b> <b>Shoulders</b> songs {{have been written by}} Kline and arranged by the musicians on the recordings. Live arrangements differ from the recorded versions based on the whims of the performers. Golden Shoulders' first album, Let My Burden Be, peaked at No. 68 on the CMJ chart, which measures college radio plays in the United States. http://www.cmj.com/ The April 2005 issue of MOJO magazine gave the Golden Shoulders' second album, Friendship is Deep, a review of four out of five stars.http://www.borrowedtunes.com/archives/magazines/ The follow-up album, Get Reasonable, received another four star review from MOJO in the November 2009 issue.http://cover.mojo4music.com/Item.aspx?pageNo=1805&year=2009 <b>Golden</b> <b>Shoulders</b> have also had several songs featured on the episodic video blog, lonelygirl15.http://www.lonelygirl15.com/ ...|$|R
50|$|Its {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} the closely related Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo. It differs from the latter by having a pinkish or lighter color face, <b>golden</b> <b>shoulders,</b> white ears and smaller size. Some authorities consider the golden-mantled tree-kangaroo as a subspecies of Goodfellow's tree-kangaroo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species has}} a {{restricted}} range and {{suffers from a}} variety of threats, including predation by feral cats, tourist disturbance as well as feral pigs which disturb and dig out nests. The main threat however has been the changes to traditional Aboriginal burning regimes in the grasslands upon whose seeds the birds depend. These so-called [...] "cool fires" [...] created a mosaic of burnt landscape allowing wildlife to move to remaining food resources and reveals fallen seed that is hidden by dried grass cover. Hot uncontrolled wildfires destroy all seed stores in the environment and favour the intrusion of teatree species into grassland habitats. The cover that is created by these thickets of teatree also allow the parrot's main predator, the pied butcherbird (Cracticus nigrogularis), a more successful kill rate on the parrots, primarily upon the juvenile population and adult males. A number of cases have been noted where a juvenile male has taken over the role of an adult male ( [...] that has been predated) and is feeding the chicks of that deceased male. This may be an adaptation to the increased rate of predation on adult males in comparison to females. In captivity it is noted that golden-shouldered parrots will readily accept a new partner and this may be related to this wild breeding behaviour. Sites identified by BirdLife International as being important for golden-shouldered parrot conservation are Morehead River and Staaten River. The ongoing conservation work of the owners of Artemis Station should also be noted. These graziers have been monitoring and providing conservation works on their property {{for the benefit of the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>shouldered</b> <b>parrot</b> since the 1970s. The reinstating of former burning practices and the temporary removal of cattle from prime breeding sites has aided the parrot's survival. The recent provision of feeding stations in order to help juvenile birds through the perilous first months of the wet season has also been undertaken. This period when heavy flooding rains results in any remaining seed being washed away or drowned and many young birds perish before newly sprouted grass can provide new seed. The conservation effort toward this species seems to be resulting in a stabilization of the population decline but no notable increase in numbers has been reported.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} Azrael costume worn by Jean-Paul Valley {{consists of}} red and gold armor. After becoming an [...] "Agent of the Bat", he dons silver and black armor with a red cape and a stylized red bat symbol on the chest. Later on, he dons red armor with <b>golden</b> gauntlets, boots, <b>shoulder</b> pads and a blue cape. He sometimes carries a flaming sword, and also uses two retractable daggers hidden in the gauntlets of his costume that can be charged with thermal energy to increase their destructive power. In Batman: The Ultimate Guide to the Dark Knight, Scott Beatty implied that Azrael's changing costumes were reflections {{of the changes in}} Azrael's life from an agent of St. Dumas to an agent of the Batman to his own man. The gauntlets were taken by Kate Spencer, the current Manhunter, and are used in her outfit. The New 52 version of Jean-Paul wears a similar costume, and his weapon is a flaming knight sword called Murasame. He also possesses the familiar gauntlet blades as well.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the release}} of Joanne, Gaga had gone for an {{unconventional}} look, deviating from her fashionable attires portrayed in media. Prior to the halftime show, there was much speculation regarding her fashion for the performance. The singer combined both the aesthetic of her current style {{as well as a}} nod to her past attires. She wore a custom created Atelier Versace iridescent colored jumpsuit, which was beaded all over with Swarovski crystals, along with high shoulder pads and matching knee length boots. The outfit was promoted by designer Donatella Versace on Instagram before the show began. The body suit was required for swift movement over the stage, aiding in mobility for the singer. According to fashion pundit Cameron Silver, Gaga's final look for the performance of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was the [...] "most interesting". It consisted of silver hot pants with sequins on it, with a footballer shoulder pad like jacket. Silver called the dress as [...] "Gaga-fied" [...] saying that he [...] "appreciate that singer expresses herself so profoundly in clothes". Both the dresses were deemed as a [...] "customary nod" [...] to Gaga's past by Billboard, who added that [...] "It was a solid balance of glam and sexy without overdoing it ... dress gave fantasy to her fans. She looked great. She sounded great. It’s like she was playing football in heels." [...] In between Gaga also wore a <b>golden</b> jacket with <b>shoulder</b> spikes while playing the keytar.|$|R
