50|$|Fruit {{harvest is}} made during September, October, December, January and June. Since the fruits are dehiscent, it is {{recommended}} to harvest the fruits directly from the trees before they open to release the seeds when they are still green, but opening lines can be seeing. The safest and more recommendable way to collect the fruits is directly from the tree using a climbing technique that doesn’t damage the bark. In some cases when the trees are not too height and the branches are easy to reach, {{it is recommended}} to collect the fruit from the ground using an extension pruning pole. When collecting from the ground, special attention {{should be given to}} the presence of <b>insect</b> <b>hole</b> and fungus in the fruits to eliminate those fruits.Once the fruits have dehiscence, mature seeds are extracted and the ones with good phytosanitary conditions are selected. In order to remove the red sacotesta covering the seeds, they should be immersed in cold water for 24 hours, then macerated and rinsed with water.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPostharvest {{insect pests}} {{threaten}} the nutritional and financial security of smallholder {{farmers in the}} developing world. Hermetic storage, a technology that protects grain against insects by blocking their supply of oxygen, alleviates the problem of insect-caused losses. PICS (Purdue Improved Crop Storage) bags represent one hermetic technology that improves food availability and incomes of farmers. The polyethylene liners of PICS bags are sometime damaged during use, acquiring small holes or tears. Observations in the laboratory and field suggest that insect development remains localized around {{the point where the}} bag is damaged. We hypothesized that the grain within a hermetic container that has minimal localized damage (such as an <b>insect</b> <b>hole),</b> helps retard leakage of oxygen into the bag and contributes to limiting insect damage and to the overall protective effect. To test this hypothesis, we filled 4  cm dia. by 10  cm long PVC pipes with Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) infested cowpeas and sealed them with caps having a single, insect-sized hole in its center. A vertical tube positioned above the cowpea-filled PVC pipe was filled with one of three different grains (sesame, sorghum, and maize) to different depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 50  cm). Seed size and grain barrier depth significantly reduced the level of bruchid damage to the stored cowpea in the PVC container. Smaller sized grains used for the barriers retarded insect development more effectively than larger sized grains, while deeper grain depth was more effective than shallower barriers. The grain held in a hermetic container contributes in a small, but significant, way to the effectiveness of the containers...|$|E

40|$|Enforcement of {{sanitary}} {{practices in}} the commercial handling of wheat, particularly with reference to insect infestation, requires a method of inspection of wheat for internal or hidden insect infestation which is reliable, yet rapid enough for routine use. A number of inspection methods {{have been developed for}} this purpose, and a review has been published (1) of those proposed up to two years ago. A rigorous evaluation of several of these techniques has been made recently (2). The rapid inspection method suggested to the grain trade by the Food and Drug Administration (2), {{based on the results of}} an extensive study of the sources of insect fragments in mill products (3), involves gross examination of 100 grams of wheat for <b>insect</b> exit <b>holes.</b> More than three of such insect-emerged kernels in the sample indicate excessive internal or hidden infestation.

In a 2013 article in Psychological Science, Wilkins and Cole write that the reaction is based on a brain response that associates the shapes with danger. Shapes that elicit a reaction were said to include clustered holes in innocuous contexts such as fruit and bubbles, and in contexts associated with danger, such as <b>holes</b> made by <b>insects</b> and <b>holes</b> in wounds and diseased tissue such as those caused by mango worms in animals, especially dogs. Upon seeing these shapes, some people said they shuddered, felt their skin crawl, experienced panic attacks, sweated, palpitated, and felt nauseated or itchy.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{presence}} and characteristics of the bruchid Spermophagus niger Motschulsky as a major pest of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) seeds during post-harvest storage in Burkina Faso. Samples of roselle seeds collected in farmers granaries at three locations in Burkina Faso {{at the beginning of}} crop storage were brought to the laboratory and held for 2 months. All seed samples were infested with varying levels of S. niger, though samples from Tougan and Dedougou were more highly infested than those from Ouagadougou. Infested seeds generally had only one <b>insect</b> emergence <b>hole,</b> with seed perforation rates ranging from 1. 8 % to 4 %. Insect rearing in the laboratory provided an opportunity for a clearer discrimination of sexual dimorphism and a better morphological description of the species. Males were smaller and weighed less than females. Post-embryonic development, which took place entirely within the seed, included four larval instars and one pupal stage; these stages are common in the subfamily Bruchinae. Our preliminary observations will enable a better understanding of this previously little-known insect pest. Furthermore, these results offer baseline data for further into appropriate post-harvest management of roselle in West Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{activities}} of beavers in forested landscapes affect both ecological and economical values. The {{creation of the}} dynamic wetland mosaic associated to beaver activities can even {{improve the quality of}} water and have been documented as an important landscape engineer affecting the environment for many species. The local office of Sveaskog in Skinnskatteberg is responsible for the management of large areas of the forests in the County of Västmanland. In this area one of several company’s goals are to create ten new wetlands in their own forests as a part of cooperation with the Swedish bird society and Swedish wetland association. By establishment of an artificial wetland in an old beaver dam, Sveaskog wanted to review the economical and ecological values of the forests in wetlands created by beaver activity. This study considers fifteen sites where beaver activity had been reported. In those sites a 150 m 2 large survey circle was examined in each hectare of wetland created of beaver activity. The same area of a circle where measured in the surrounding forest. In those circles the amount of dead wood was measured along with the number of tress with traces of woodpeckers, <b>insect</b> <b>holes,</b> occurrence of lichen and tree living fungus was counted and documented. The number indicated a nature value. All values were compared to the reference survey circles in surrounding forest. The tree species composition within the circle was observed, as well as the position of the dead wood. The results showed {{a significant difference between the}} nature values in wet lands created of beaver activity and the surrounding forests. There were significant correlations between nature values associated to trees and dead wood and the age of the wetland created of beaver activity. I found no correlation between nature values and the amount of dead wood or between the tree species composition and the amount of dead wood. The difference of tree species varied from spruce dominated stands in beaver wetlands established in streams impacted by ditches. In beaver wetland established in streams without ditches there was a trend of birch dominated stands. There was a significant difference between the amount of dead wood in wetlands created by beavers and the surrounding conventionally managed forest. The economical gross value of the forest standing in the wetland created by beaver activity differed from 20 000 SEK/ha up to 197 000 SEK/ha, and this study showed that typically ditched productive forest stands were the areas at highest risks for severe tree damages and costs associated to beaver activities...|$|R

30|$|Prior {{to model}} building, we tested for {{collinearity}} among explanatory variables using Spearman’s rank correlation and included only variables with ρ[*]<[*] 0.7 {{in the same}} model (Dormann et al. 2013). As we were not primarily interested in the effects of abiotic factors (temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, wind speed) although they are known to affect bat activity (Ciechanowski et al. 2007), we only controlled for factors which were significantly correlated with the response variable within the respective models in a preceding analysis. As a result, we added the ambient air temperature to candidate models which explained activity and foraging activity of N. noctula (BAP: ρ[*]=[*] 0.27, p[*]<[*] 0.01; FAP: ρ[*]=[*] 0.34, p[*]<[*] 0.001) and P. pygmaeus (BAP: ρ[*]=[*] 0.26, p[*]<[*] 0.01; FAP: ρ[*]=[*] 0.22, p[*]<[*] 0.05), respectively. As seasonality {{is known to have}} a strong effect on bat activity in agricultural landscapes (Heim et al. 2016), we included Julian day as a covariate into all models. Furthermore, we log-transformed <b>insect</b> abundance, kettle <b>hole</b> density, and the percentage of water cover and of vegetation cover and scaled all variables before fitting GLMMs. Prior to model fitting, we explored the shape of the relationship between response and explanatory variables via generalized additive mixed models (mgcv::gamm 4, Wood and Scheipl 2014). For that, we used the full model, a cubic regression basis and a random factor for recording site and fitted smoothing splines with four knots. Only the covariate “season” was associated with the activity of N. noctula, P. pipistrellus, and P. pygmaeus in a quadratic manner. Thus, we added a second order polynomial function of the covariate season to the respective set of candidate GLMMs.|$|R
50|$|The oval egg (0.75-0.8 mm) is {{flattened}} on one side. At first, {{it has a}} white {{color and}} then it becomes yellow. In the end the color turns dark. The larva reaches 14 mm long. At first it is white, then yellow with dark head and anal scutellum. It has eight lines of dark warts with hairs. Larva also has eight pairs of legs (three pairs on thorax). The body length of yellow-brown pupae varies from 5 to 7 mm. The over-wintering takes place during the phase of fifth-instar larvae, within a dense oval cocoon in the ground on fields of pea, lentil, peavine and vetch. An insignificant number of caterpillars over-winter in places where grain is dried and threshed. The insects pupate, in their cocoons, underground {{during the month of}} May. The pupae period lasts 10-18 days. The first moths appear during the period of wild vetch and pea-vine blooming. When first buds appear, the moths are found on pea. After coupling, which takes place four to seven days after emergence from the cocoon, the insects begin to lay eggs. Additional feeding on pea flowers is preferred. Moths fly in the evening; they live 10-14 days. Mass oviposition occurs at the beginning of July. The oviposition lasts 25-30 days. Pests lay eggs in groups of one, two or three (rarely four) on upper leaves (lower side), peduncle, bell, stems. Embryonic development lasts 6-10 days. Fecundity reaches 200 eggs. Hatching caterpillars penetrate into the pods and gnaw grains from above, making wide channels, ending in a hollow at one end. They soil the grain with fecal masses and cobwebs. Usually, one, rarely two or more (up to four) caterpillars are located in pods. The entire larval period (lasting 16-25 days) occurs inside one pod. The larvae have five instars, four molts. Then the <b>insect</b> makes a <b>hole</b> in the pod wall and comes out, making a cocoon in the ground. This take place when the pods become mature and the plants become dry (from the end of July and up to the first ten-day period of September). Young caterpillars (not fifth instar) that did not finish their feeding can diapause, but eventually they perish.|$|R

Este trabajo {{describe}} los estados biologicos, el daño y los hongos asociados al barrenador, examinando especialmente los fustes de los arboles que presentaron ramas secas y poco follaje. El aislamiento de los hongos se realizo a partir de muestras obtenidas del interior de las galerias y del avance de la lesion en el arbol, incluyendo pruebas de patogenicidad en invernadero. El insecto fue identificado por el Dr. Stephen b. Wood como una nueva especie de Corthylus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Los hongos asociados al interior de las galerias se identificaron como: Fusarium solani, Fusarium sp., Verticillium sp. y una levadura que se asemeja a Pichia sp. En la lesion causada por el insecto se encontraron F. solani y Ceratocystis sp. Los resultados indicaron que Corthylus sp. esta asociado en simbiosis con varios hongos ambrosiales y una levadura. Los hongos y la levadura hacen asimilable la madera al insecto y este {{a su vez}} permite la invasion de estos organismos, causando finaimente la muerte del arbol.

This work describes the biological stages, the damage, and the fungi associated with the borer especially after examination of trees with dry branches and poor follage. Isolation of the fungus was made with samples obtained from {{the interior of the}} galleries and from lesions on the tree, including pathogenicity tests in the greenhouse. The insect was identify by Dr. Stephen L. Wood identify as a new species of Corthylus (Coleoptera: Scolytidae).

Fusarium solani and Ceratocystis sp. were found in the lesion caused by the insect. Results showed that Corthylus n. sp., has a symbiotic association with several ambrosia fungi and one yeast. These fungi and yeast make the wood available to the insect, and this allows invasion of these organisms, finally causing the death of the tree. Additionally, the insect contributes to the dispersal of the fungi in the alder plantations.
