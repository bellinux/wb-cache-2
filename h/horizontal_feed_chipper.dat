The test setup consisted of six boilers equipped with bottom feed burner (BF), one with top feed (TF) and two with horizontally feed burner (HF). Wood pellets used as fuel were DINplus certified. In real life conditions, 20 Â kW bottom feed boiler had the best performance. Emissions of dust from bottom and <b>horizontal</b> <b>feed</b> boilers were better in real life conditions than in standard laboratory conditions. All boiler technologies had lower combustion efficiencies in real life condition (2 - 5 % less) than in standard laboratory condition. Top feed boiler emitted maximum CO (1566 Â mgÂ NÂ m- 3); and dust particles from concerned boiler contained {{a considerable amount of}} elemental carbon. Almost similar NOx emissions were reported with all technologies in real life conditions. All the boilers met emissions and efficiency requirements of Swan Mark (except top feed boilers for CO) and EN- 303 - 5, in both conditions.

40|$|Among {{many other}} {{potential}} applications, intermittent solid slug feeders {{can be used}} to effectively inject biomass materials into fluidized bed reactors for pyrolysis. In particular, these feeders {{can be used to}} convey biomass materials that are highly cohesive to prevent plugging or undesirable reaction in the feeding tube. Although feeders of this design have been shown to work very effectively, they have not been studied in detail or optimized for the pyrolysis process. In addition, the operating conditions required to obtain predictable and consistent mass flow rates and slugs of desirable characteristics need to be established. The purpose of this work was to design, build and demonstrate the operation of a horizontal intermittent solid slug feeder and to test it with sawdust as the feed material. Sawdust is an extremely cohesive and difficult biomass to inject, but one that holds great potential as an important renewable feedstock for pyrolysis. The intermittent feeder designed for this work consisted of a pressurized vertical solids storage silo leading to a pneumatic pinch valve. The pinch valve, controlled by solenoid valves connected to a relay timer, released the <b>feed</b> into a <b>horizontal</b> <b>feeding</b> tube at a ninety degree angle. Within the silo, a rotating mixer prevented the bridging of solids. Intermittent pulses of gas from a control volume were fed into the <b>horizontal</b> <b>feeding</b> tube, as well as, in some cases, a continuous gas flow. The timing of the pulses was controlled by solenoid valves with a relay timer. While the pinch valve is opened, solids fall into the <b>horizontal</b> <b>feeding</b> tube forming a plug, which is then propelled by the pulsating gas into the reactor. The solid mass flow rate was experimentally measured by collecting the solids and continuously measuring the mass using a digital balance. Several variables were tested in order to optimize the performance of the feeder and the consistency of the feeding rate. They included the silo pressure, mixing rate, gas pulse pressure and volume, continuous gas mass flow rate, and the open pinch-valve time interval. The goals of this optimization were (a) to maximize the solid-to-gas ratio of mass flow rates, since the gas mass flux must be minimized to avoid wasting energy, and (b) to define operating conditions required to inject consistent biomass mass flow rates suitable for a laboratory scale pyrolysis reactor, and (c) to propose initial design criteria and a calibration procedure for intermittent solid slug feeders. The results demonstrated that the intermittent solid slug feeder system successfully achieved the desired objectives and showed how to efficiently select its optimum operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{following}} {{conclusion is}} drawn from detailed mechanical analysis of Diamond Saw Blade,The load on diamond is not significant in cutting. However, {{at the moment the}} blade starts in its working state, the impact on rock has significant destructiveness on diamonds. Higher linear velocity of the blade, higher rock hardness and higher feeding speed all contribute in greater impact force on the diamond from the rock. And it is also stated that the unstable quality of diamond saw blade is closely related to the selection of diamond without following the TT 1 test result. When designing the diamond saw blade, the saw cutting performance of the rock should be taken into consideration, as well as the necessary analysis of the force on the blade. There are three forces exerted on the saw blade: vertical downward pressure; <b>horizontal</b> <b>feeding</b> thrust; tangential cutting force of the saw. They are discussed separately in the following. Vertical Downward Pressure The vertical downward pressure from the saw is its gravity. If the pressure accesses the gravity, the cutting machine system will bear a moment, which results in deflection of the blade. Also the cut stone is deflected. Therefore, the vertical downward pressure on blade from the saw should be equal to or a little less than the gravity of the saw. The gravity of the saw can be calculated by using the following equation: 2 310 4 w D b r π − = ⋅ ⋅ × (1) In this equation: w-weight of the saw. kgf, D-diameter of the saw. cm, γ-proportion of steel, b-thickness of the saw,φ 1. 6 m, for the saw, b= 0. 7 cm.

Investigations into fatal incidents lead to a better understanding of industry dangers. However, this knowledge does not extend to how tree workers operate when an injury or fatality does not occur. Current research regarding fatal and nonfatal injuries does not include the accreditation status of the company at which the worker was employed, nor whether certified arborists were on staff. Given the highly skilled nature of the work involved, certification and accreditation might ensure a minimum level of demonstrated safety practices. This study aimed to 1. Determine whether certification and accreditation in the tree care industry are associated with safer workplace behavior, and 2. Identify safety practices that tree workers commonly violate. Tree care companies in southern New England were divided into three categories: accredited, non-accredited with certified arborists on staff, and non-accredited with no certified arborists on staff. A stratified random sample of 63 companies was evaluated in the field by direct observation, assessing workers’ adherence to the industry’s safety standard, the American National Standards for Arboricultural Operations (ANSI Z 133. 1 - 2006). Analysis indicated that, overall, accredited companies and those with certified arborists on staff complied with the Z 133. 1 Standard more than those without.

40|$|Cones in the {{vertebrate}} retina {{project to}} horizontal and bipolar cells and the horizontal cells feedback negatively to cones. This organization {{forms the basis}} for the center/surround organization of the bipolar cells, a fundamental step in the visual signal processing. Although the surround responses of bipolar cells have been recorded on many occasions, surprisingly, the underlying surround-induced responses in cones are not easily detected. In this paper, the nature of the surround-induced responses in cones is studied. <b>Horizontal</b> cells <b>feed</b> back to cones by shifting the activation function of the calcium current in cones to more negative potentials. This shift increases the calcium influx, which increases the neurotransmitter release of the cone. In this paper, we will show that under certain conditions, in addition to this increase of neurotransmitter release, a calcium-dependent chloride current will be activated, which polarizes the cone membrane potential. The question is, whether the modulation of the calcium current or the polarization of the cone membrane potential is the major determinant for feedback-mediated responses in second-order neurons. Depolarizing light responses of biphasic horizontal cells are generated by feedback from monophasic horizontal cells to cones. It was found that niflumic acid blocks the feedback-induced depolarizing responses in cones, while the shift of the calcium current activation function and the depolarizing biphasic horizontal cell responses remain intact. This shows that <b>horizontal</b> cells can <b>feed</b> back to cones, without inducing major changes in the cone membrane potential. This makes the feedback synapse from horizontal cells to cones a unique synapse. Polarization of the presynaptic (horizontal) cell leads to calcium influx in the postsynaptic cell (cone), but due to the combined activity of the calcium current and the calcium-dependent chloride current, the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell will be hardly modulated, whereas the output of the postsynaptic cell will be strongly modulated. Since no polarization of the postsynaptic cell is needed for these feedback-mediated responses, this mechanism of synaptic transmission can modulate the neurotransmitter release in single synaptic terminals without affecting the membrane potential of the entire cel...|$|R
