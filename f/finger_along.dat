25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast gently into the cup (the scoop), and she then runs her index <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E
500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Clapp's fastidiousness for {{cleanliness}} was legendary. He was {{reputed to}} polish his shoes {{up to eight}} times a day, was renowned for running a <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> high shelves of country railway stations checking for dust, and earned the nickname [...] "Clever Mary", after a popular brand of household cleaning product of the time.|$|E

2500|$|Some touchpads have [...] "hotspots", {{locations}} on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> {{an edge of}} the touch pad will act as a scroll wheel, controlling the scrollbar and scrolling the window that has the focus vertically or horizontally. Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling. Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device driver software, and can be disabled.|$|E
6000|$|... “She won’t stand much of this,” Jimmy said gravely, {{running the}} end of his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the shallow groove made by the sharp teeth of the {{splitting}} ice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurt me? No," [...] said Tom, {{putting up}} the hooks again. Then {{he took out}} a large pocket-knife, and slowly opened the largest blade and rubbed his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> it. At last he said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{scientific}} manager {{got up on}} {{his feet}} rather awkwardly. He ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro several times.|$|R
60|$|Having {{taken his}} leave {{of the friends}} who had flocked about him with the {{observation}} {{that he had a}} long journey before him, he called for the axe, and, when presented to him, ran his <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the edge, and smiled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] {{she whispered}} joyously, [...] "here {{it has been}} all the time." [...] Running her <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the molding until she found a little hidden spring, she pushed it, {{and one of the}} great panels swung slowly in, {{revealing}} the yawning mouth of a black opening behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurt me? no," [...] said Tom, {{putting up}} the hooks again, {{taking out a}} large pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at meditatively as he rubbed his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> it. Then he added,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For awhile. Until {{they get}} {{reinforcements}} {{from some other}} area." [...] Tasso began to clean {{the interior of the}} gun with a bit of rag. She finished and pushed the mechanism back into place. She closed the gun, running her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the barrel.|$|E
6000|$|Helen ran {{the point}} of her slim <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the sketch until it reached a tiny dormer window in the {{left-hand}} corner, half-hidden by an irregular chimney-stack. The curtains were closely drawn. Keeping her finger upon the spot, she said, interrogatively, [...] "And you saw THAT window?" ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{pitch is}} achieved by gripping the ball with the fingers across the wide part of the seam (called a [...] "four-seam fastball") so that both the index and middle fingers are touching two seams perpendicularly. A sinking fastball is thrown by gripping it across the narrow part (a [...] "two-seam fastball") so that both the index and middle <b>fingers</b> are <b>along</b> a seam. Lateral motion {{is achieved by}} holding a four-seam fastball off-center (a [...] "cut fastball"), and sinking action with a lateral break is thrown by splitting the <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the seams (a [...] "split-finger fastball").|$|R
60|$|But Mother Gunga {{would not}} fight as Peroo desired. After the first {{down-stream}} plunge there came no more walls of water, but the river lifted herself bodily, as a snake when she drinks in mid-summer, plucking and <b>fingering</b> <b>along</b> the revetments, and banking {{up behind the}} piers till even Findlayson began to recalculate {{the strength of his}} work.|$|R
50|$|A mandoline is used {{by running}} a piece of food (with some {{protection}} for <b>fingers)</b> <b>along</b> an adjustable inclined plane into one or more blades. On some models vertical blades cut to produce julienne, or a wavy blade is used that produces crinkle cuts. In these models a quarter turn to the food between passes produces dice and waffle cuts.|$|R
60|$|Crossing to the {{obviously}} tight window, {{he ran his}} <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> {{the edge}} of the sash with infinite care. He trembled. In a second, now, he had to turn and make light of the lips which he would fain have approached with ceremony pompous and lingering.|$|E
60|$|He feverishly ran a <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> {{the upper}} rim {{of his left}} ear, sprang up, stooped to take her hand, glared into her eyes till she shrank--and then a nail-cleaner, a common, ten-cent file, fell out of his inner pocket and clinked on the stone step.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is a curate's daughter,' said Traddles; 'one of ten, down in Devonshire. Yes!' For {{he saw me}} glance, involuntarily, at the {{prospect}} on the inkstand. 'That's the church! You come round here to the left, out of this gate,' tracing his <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the inkstand, 'and exactly where I hold this pen, there stands the house--facing, you understand, towards the church.' ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{distinct}} Martian cultures. The most advanced {{is made up}} of the Canal Martians. They live along the canals and in the Martian cities. Tall (well over six feet), with pointed ears and pale ocher skin, they vaguely resemble the elves of human myth. Their hands, like other Martians, have only three <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> with a thumb. Canal Martian food is much like human food, though more spicy.|$|R
60|$|Soames {{watched his}} {{daughter}} give her hand, saw her wince at the squeeze it received, and distinctly heard the young man's sigh {{as he passed}} out. Then she came from the window, trailing her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the mahogany edge of the billiard-table. Watching her, Soames {{knew that she was}} going to ask him something. Her finger felt round the last pocket, and she looked up.|$|E
60|$|The girl made no {{responsive}} movement. She seemed, if anything, {{to shrink}} a little away. Her head was thrown back, {{her dark eyes}} were filled with dislike. She turned suddenly to the Professor and spoke to him in her own language. She pointed to the signs upon the tent, drew her <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> one of the sentences, flashed a fierce glance at them all and disappeared.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning about}} half-past ten Mr. Polly found himself seated under {{a clump of}} fir trees by the {{roadside}} and about three miles {{and a half from}} the Potwell Inn. He was by no means sure whether he was taking a walk to clear his mind or leaving that threat-marred Paradise for good and all. His reason pointed a lean, unhesitating <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> the latter course.|$|E
5000|$|Mudra {{is used in}} the {{iconography}} of Hindu and Buddhist art of the Indian subcontinent and described in the scriptures, such as Nātyaśāstra, which lists 24 [...] ("separated", meaning [...] "one-hand") and 13 [...] ("joined", meaning [...] "two-hand") mudras. Mudra positions are usually formed by both the hand and the <b>fingers.</b> <b>Along</b> with āsanas ("seated postures"), they are employed statically in the meditation and dynamically in the [...] practice of Hinduism.|$|R
6000|$|They might chirp and chaffer, {{come and}} go [...] For {{pleasure}} or profit, her men alive-- [...] My business was hardly with them, I trow, [...] 35 [...] But with empty cells of the human hive-- [...] With the chapter-room, the cloister-porch, [...] The church's apsis, aisle, or nave, [...] Its crypt, one <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> with a torch, [...] Its face set full for the sun to shave. [...] 40 ...|$|R
5000|$|Also {{called the}} [...] "dinner knife" [...] grip. The handle is held {{with the second}} through fourth <b>fingers</b> and secured <b>along</b> {{the base of the}} thumb, with the index <b>finger</b> {{extended}} <b>along</b> the top rear of the blade and the thumb {{along the side of the}} handle. This grip is best for initial incisions and larger cuts.|$|R
60|$|When playing Follow my Leader, Peter {{would fly}} {{close to the}} water and touch each shark's tail in passing, {{just as in the}} street you may run your <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, {{especially}} as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.|$|E
60|$|Well indeed might Mbonga scream for help, for Tarzan, {{young and}} fleet-footed, covered the {{distance}} between them in great leaps, at the speed of a charging lion. He was growling, too, not at all unlike Numa himself. Mbonga heard and his blood ran cold. He could feel the wool stiffen upon his pate and a prickly chill run up his spine, as though Death had come and run his cold <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> Mbonga's back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to meet you, sir. I {{have heard}} your name {{mentioned}} {{in connection with}} that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my <b>finger</b> <b>along</b> your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{five years}} old, Botet was {{diagnosed}} with Marfan syndrome and underwent an operation to correct his pectus excavatum. He received another operation in 1997 to treat back problems, and another in 2005 to prevent aortic problems associated with his condition. The hyperlaxity of certain body tissues brought about by Botet's condition has given him extremely long and fine <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> with a tall, thin build (he stands at 2 meters tall and weighs 56 kilograms).|$|R
50|$|The {{contemporary}} {{history of}} ASMR began on 19 October 2007 when a 21-year-old registered user of a discussion forum for health-related subjects at a website called 'Steady Health', with the username 'okaywhatever', submitted a post {{in which they}} described having experienced a specific sensation since childhood, comparable to that stimulated by tracing <b>fingers</b> <b>along</b> the skin, yet often triggered by seemingly random and unrelated non-haptic events, such as 'watching a puppet show' or 'being read a story'.|$|R
