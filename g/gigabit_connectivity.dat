40|$|Millimeter wave {{spectrum}} access {{over the}} 70 GHz and 80 GHz {{is central to}} unlocking <b>gigabit</b> <b>connectivity</b> and meeting the explosive growth of mobile traffic. A pressing question, however, is whether fifth-generation (5 G) systems can harmoniously coexist with the incumbents of these bands, which are primarily point-to-point fixed stations (FSs). To this end, we thoroughly analyze the impact of 5 G coexistence on FSs. Specifically, we first analyze the geometry of existing FSs' deployment using actual databases of these stations. Then, we present a case study on the interference generated from users towards FSs in two populated areas in Chicago, where we use actual building databases to accurately compute the aggregate interference. The analysis and simulation results reveal that the deployment strategy of FSs and the high attenuation losses at 70 / 80 GHz significantly limit the 5 G interference, {{with the majority of}} FSs experiencing interference levels well below the noise floor.

40|$|With {{reference}} to an architecture {{for the full}} integration of a 60 GHz receiver in embedded systems with wireless <b>gigabit</b> <b>connectivity,</b> the paper presents the design of key building blocks such as: on-chip antenna, Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and a time-interleaved fast A/D converter (ADC) with AMBA AXI interface towards the digital baseband part. With respect {{to the state of}} the art the co-design of the on-chip antenna with the LNA, and the fast ADC architecture realized as a time-interleaved array of threshold-configuring SAR channels, represent new solutions optimized in terms of power consumption. Complexity and performance results in a 65 nm CMOS SOI technology, suitable also for digital systems integration, are presented. The performance and complexity results of the designed antenna, LNA and ADC are integrated in a system level simulator with those obtained by adopting known solutions for other receiver blocks (mixer, IF and baseband amplifiers and filters, frequency synthesizer) thus estimating the performance achievable with a whole 60 GHz receiver and digitization sub-system macrocell.

40|$|The CMS muon trigger {{will undergo}} {{considerable}} enhancements {{in preparation for}} the LHC run- 2. In order to improve rate reduction and efficiency the full muon trigger chain will be com-pletely redesigned: the plan is to move from a redundant scheme, where the three sub-detectors (CSC, DT, RPC) have a separate track finder, to three geographical track finders (barrel, endcap and overlap) that combine trigger primitives of each sub-detector. In particular, the Muon Barrel Track Finder (MBTF) will host a new algorithm, that aggregating DT and RPC trigger data, will be able to improve the fake rejection and the muon momentum measurement. This report will focus on the adaptive layer of the MBTF called TwinMux. Its primary role will be to merge, arrange and fan-out the slow optical links from the chambers in faster links (10 Gbps). It will realize a full connectivity matrix between the on-detector electronics and the MBTF allowing for different processing schemes. The TwinMux will be implemented in µTCA form factor compliant with all the CMS standards in terms of clock distribution, slow control and data acquisition. The TwinMux will be centered around a powerful Virtex- 7 FPGA able to exchange data on up to 96 optical lanes.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} software-defined, millimeter Wave (mm-Wave) networks with Radio over Fiber (RoF) for {{the delivery}} of <b>gigabit</b> <b>connectivity</b> required to develop fifth generation (5 G) mobile. This network will enable an effective open access system allowing providers to manage and lease the infrastructure to service providers through unbundling new business models. Exploiting the inherited benefits of RoF, complete base station functionalities are centralized {{at the edges of}} the metro and aggregation network, leaving remote radio heads (RRHs) with only tunable filtering and amplification. A Software Defined Network (SDN) Central Controller (SCC) is responsible for managing the resource across several mm-Wave Radio Access Networks (RANs) providing a global view of the several network segments. This ensures flexible resource allocation for reduced overall latency and increased throughput. The SDN based mm-Wave RAN also allows for inter edge node communication. Therefore, certain packets can be routed between different RANs supported by the same edge node, reducing latency. System level simulations of the complete network have shown significant improvement of the overall throughput and SINR for wireless users by providing effective resource allocation and coordination among interfering cells. A new Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) algorithm exploiting the benefits of the SCC global network view for reduced delay in control message exchange is presented, accounting for a minimum packet delay and limited Channel State Information (CSI) in a Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A), Cloud RAN (CRAN) configuration. The algorithm does not require detailed CSI feedback from UEs but it rather considers UE location (determined by the eNB) as the required parameter. UE throughput in the target sector is represented using a Cumulative Distributive Function (CDF). The drawn characteristics suggest that there is a significant 60 % improvement in UE cell edge throughput following the application, in the coordinating cells, of the new CoMP algorithm. Results also show a further improvement of 36 % in cell edge UE throughput when eNBs are centralized in a CRAN backhaul architecture. The SINR distribution of UEs in the cooperating cells has also been evaluated using a box plot. As expected, UEs with CoMP perform better demonstrating an increase of over 2 dB at the median between the transmission scenario...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Ethernet passive optical {{networks}} (EPONs) {{have emerged}} as one of the most promising access network technolo-gies. Propelled by rapid price declines in fiber optics and Ethernet components, these architectures combine the latest in optical and electronic advances and are poised to become the dominant means of delivering <b>gigabit</b> broadband <b>connectivity</b> to homes over a unified single platform. As this technology matures, related quality of service (QoS) issues are becoming a key concern. This paper proposes a novel dynamic scheduling algorithm, termed hybrid granting protocol (HGP), to support different QoS in EPON. Specifically, the proposed dynamic scheduling algorithm minimizes packet delay and jitter for delay and delay-variation sensitive traffic (e. g., voice transmissions) by allocating bandwidth in a grant-before-report (GBR) fashion. This considerably im-proves their performance without degrading QoS guarantees for other service types. Detailed simulation experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|The {{new era of}} {{software}} signal processing has a large impact on radio astronomy instrumentation. Our design and implementation of a 32 antennae, 33 MHz, dual polarization, fully real-time software backend for the GMRT, using only off-the-shelf components, {{is an example of}} this. We have built a correlator and a beamformer, using PCI-based ADC cards and a Linux cluster of 48 nodes with dual <b>gigabit</b> inter-node <b>connectivity</b> for real-time data transfer requirements. The highly optimized compute pipeline uses cache efficient, multi-threaded parallel code, with the aid of vectorized processing. This backend allows flexibility in final time and frequency resolutions, and the ability to implement algorithms for radio frequency interference rejection. Our approach has allowed relatively rapid development of a fairly sophisticated and flexible backend receiver system for the GMRT, which will greatly enhance the productivity of the telescope. In this paper we describe some of the first lights using this software processing pipeline. We believe this is the first instance of such a real-time observatory backend for an intermediate sized array like the GMRT.

50|$|The campus network at Michigan Tech is a {{continually}} evolving entity {{trying to}} keep up with the technology curve. At its heart is an MX960 Ethernet Services Router from Juniper Networks. This switch provides 10 <b>gigabit</b> ethernet <b>connectivity</b> for the backbone of the network. Storage is handled by a 100 terabyte network-attached storage/storage area network (NAS/SAN) array. Junos software is the primary software used for configuring the network. For students, there are two main networks in addition to whatever networks might be used in a computer lab. The residence halls and university owned apartments have CAT5 ethernet connections running to every room. These are part of the Resnet network. There is also a wireless network (called Rovernet) that covers most of every building on campus. Both of these networks require a login name and password provided by the university upon enrollment to connect to them. The computer labs for the various departments run on their own networks and require the same login and password as Resnet and Rovernet but will only grant access to students registered for a class in that department or taking a major in that department. University email is provided by Google and again uses the standard login. Along with standard email, Google also provides limited online document storage (in addition to a networked private H drive that all students have) and a built-in chat system.|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy is safely {{employed}} for treating {{wide variety of}} cancers. The radiotherapy workflow includes a precise positioning of the patient in the intended treatment position. While patient positioning is conducted by trained radiation therapists, consultation is occasionally required from other experts, including the radiation oncologist, dosimetrist, or medical physicist. In many circumstances, including rural clinics and developing countries, this expertise is not immediately available, so the patient positioning concerns of the treating therapists may not get addressed. In this paper, we present a framework to enable remotely located experts to virtually collaborate and be present inside the 3 D treatment room when necessary. A multi 3 D-camera framework was used for acquiring the 3 D treatment space. A client server framework enabled the acquired 3 D treatment room to be visualized in real-time. The computational tasks that would normally occur on the client side were offloaded to the server side to enable hardware flexibility on the client side. On the server side, a client specific real-time stereo rendering of the 3 D treatment room was employed using a scalable multi GPU system. The rendered 3 D images were then encoded using a GPU based H. 264 encoding for streaming. Results showed that for a stereo-image size of 1280 x 960 pixels, experts with high-speed <b>gigabit</b> Ethernet <b>connectivity</b> were able to visualize the treatment space at approximately 81 frames per second. For experts remotely located and using a 100 Mega bits per second (Mbps) network, the treatment space visualization occurred at 8 - 40 frames per second depending upon the network bandwidth.
