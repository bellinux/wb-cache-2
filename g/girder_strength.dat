While the impact of horizontal curvature on flexural response of steel girders has been studied, the impact of horizontal curvature on plate <b>girder</b> shear <b>strength</b> has not been thoroughly evaluated. ^ While {{a number of studies have}} looked at the shear strength of slender, straight, plate girder webs, limited studies have examined shear strength of horizontally curved plate girders with slender webs.

This information was used to develop two shear buckling coefficients, one based on simplified representation of Batdorf’s shear buckling coefficient and the other by introducing horizontal curvature into Timoshenko and Gere’s shear buckling coefficient. Effectiveness of these shear buckling coefficients was assessed via comparisons between shear capacities from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Load and Resistance Factor Design Bridge Design Specifications (AASHTO LRFD). Comparisons involved girder FEM models whose properties cover the range of possible horizontal curvatures, web slenderness and panel aspect ratios. After assessing how horizontal curvature could influence shear behavior, possible beneficial effects were assessed by evaluating increased possible increases in shear stiffener spacing using proposed shear buckling coefficients. ^ Results showed that horizontal curvature enhanced shear strength for the slender, steel girder webs that were studied.

A single hull bulk carrier and double hull oil tanker are taken to be analyzed. The Finite Element Method is used to assess the ultimate hull <b>girder</b> <b>strength</b> including their behavior both single hull bulk carrier and double hull oil tanker. The grounding damage is simply cretaed by removing the element component from the bottom part. Two cases of grounding damage are observed, those are center part and the asymmetric position. For the simple calculation, one-frame space is considered for the longitudinal damage extent in longitudinal direction, and the cross-section of single hull bulk carrier and double hull oil tanker are taken. The transversal damage extent is taken to be equal with the percentage of ship breadth and the vertical damage extent is equal or less than the height of double bottom structure. The cross-section of those ships are assumed to be remained plane and the vertical bending moment is applied. The welding residual stress, initial imperfection and crack exstension are not taken into account in the analyses.

40|$|In the European project ""Surfacing System for Ship Recovery"" (SuSy), gas {{inflated}} balloons are envisaged to be {{used for}} providing reserve buoyancy to damaged ships for the purpose of preventing ship capsizing and/or sinking, along with lifting wreckages from the seabed. The external application of a SuSy device on an Aframax Tanker that has been structurally compromised is studied, using the finite element method and following the IACS CSR rules for Tankers. A damage condition is assessed, where the middle compartment is compromised on the starboard side and the Tanker is heeling. The damage condition is simulated using a three compartment finite element model along with a simulated damage on the middle compartment. The residual hull <b>girder</b> <b>strength</b> is evaluated and compared to the undamaged case. Subsequently reserve buoyancy is introduced on the damaged side of the Tanker, in terms of attached balloons on the outer hull of the vessel, for the purpose of bringing the ship to an upright position. The effect of the forces exerted from the attached balloons on the vessel is studied, considering global ship strength. The global ship strength is evaluated considering the most suitable areas for attaching the balloons aimed at lowering the stress peaks that appear on the damaged compartment of the vessel. © 2011 : The Royal Institution of Naval Architects...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the {{presented}} work a hull <b>girder</b> ultimate <b>strength</b> analyses of the double hull oil tanker structures damaged by the collision or grounding is performed. An incremental-iterative progressive collapse analysis method prescribed by the forthcoming IACS Harmonized Common Structural Rules (H-CSR) is used for determination of the ultimate vertical bending moment and collapse sequence of the considered structures. Three characteristic variants of the oil tanker main frame cross sections of a different geometry and size (Aframax, Suezmax and VLCC) are considered. The position of a ship’s side and/or bottom damage is defined in accordance with the IACS H-CSR. Proposed analytical formulations of the relationship between reduction of the hull girder ultimate vertical bending moment (with respect to the undamaged state) and damage size are {{based on the results of}} a systematic variation of a ship’s side or bottom damage size. Finally, comparison of the collapse sequences determined for the undamaged and damaged state in upright position (defined by IACS H-CSR) of the considered structure of the Aframax ship example is performed...|$|R
40|$|The hull <b>girder</b> {{ultimate}} <b>strength</b> of {{a typical}} bulk carrier is analyzed using a simplified method based on an incremental-iterative approach. First, vertical bending moment is examined by seven different methods. The moment versus curvature curves and {{the values of the}} ultimate longitudinal moments at collapse states are determined for both hogging and sagging cases. Second, the ultimate strength under coupled vertical and horizontal bending moment is accounted. An interaction curve is obtained, which corresponds to the results of series of calculation for the ship hull subject to bending conditions with different angles of curvature. It is found that the interaction curve is asymmetrical because the hull cross section is not symmetrical with respect to the horizontal axis and the structural response of the elements under compression is different from that under tension due to nonlinearity caused by buckling. The angles of the resultant bending moment vector and that of the curvature vector are different in investigated cases. The interaction design equations proposed by other researches are also addressed to discuss the results presented by this study...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of , the basic method of construction of an ironclad's hull was altered. The usage of longitudinal <b>girders</b> to impart <b>strength</b> and resistance to the hull was discarded, and a [...] "bracket frame" [...] system devised by Nathaniel Barnaby was adopted. This system allowed for the inclusion into the ship of a double bottom, with clear survival implications if damaged, while at the same time allowing for a saving in weight so that 100 ft of the hull of Bellerophon weighed 1123 LT, versus 1303 LT for 100 ft of [...] Some steel was used in the hull to save weight.|$|R
