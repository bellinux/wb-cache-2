5|$|The huia {{appears to}} be a remnant of an early {{expansion}} of passerines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family Callaeidae, the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the saddleback and the kōkako. The only close relative to the family is the stitchbird; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{its primary}} effects were felt in a {{localized}} area of India, the outer {{fringes of the}} super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten {{people were killed in}} the former, while two were killed in the latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated the damage caused by a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6m (16–20ft) surge brought water up to 35km (20mi) inland, carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887fatalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>of</b> which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction wrought by the super cyclone amounted to US$4.44billion.|$|E

5|$|Baldur's Gate II, {{taking place}} {{south of the}} events of Baldur's Gate, is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> Amn, mainly in and around the city of Athkatla. The game opens shortly after the events of Baldur's Gate and {{continues}} the story of the protagonist, Gorion's Ward, whose unique heritage has now gained them the attention of the mage Jon Irenicus. The game's plot revolves around the machinations of Irenicus and the protagonist's encounters with him. The game's development began in January 1999. BioWare set out to improve upon the first Baldur's Gate in every way possible. From a list of constructive criticism (compiled from the suggestions of fans, reviews, and internal suggestions) a list of features {{to be added to the}} game was distilled: some of these were 800 x 600 resolution, 3D support, and character kits. In Baldur's Gate, the game's engine and content were being developed at the same time; whereas in Baldur's Gate II, the engine was running from the start.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance caused thunderstorms {{throughout the}} Lesser Antilles, producing squally weather and gusty winds.

Heavy rains in Mexico triggered numerous landslides, one of which killed 3people. Landslides in damaged 36homes and 334homes in the states of Chiapas and Veracruz, respectively. Heavy rainfall also caused rivers to overflow, damaging homes and businesses. Two additional people died in Mexico from unknown causes.|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{incidence}} during 1972 - 90 in Asian {{migrants to}} New South Wales, Australia, is described. Overall cancer incidence {{was lower than}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australia born <b>in</b> most migrant groups, and this reached significance in migrants born <b>in</b> China/Taiwan, <b>the</b> Philippines, Vietnam and India/Sri Lanka, and in male migrants born <b>in</b> Indonesia. For <b>the</b> majority of cancers, rates were more similar to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australia born than to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> birth. For cancers of the breast, colorectum and prostate, rates were relatively low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> birth, but migrants generally exhibited rates nearer those of the Australia born. For cancers of the liver and cervix and, in India/Sri Lanka-born migrants, of the oral cavity, incidence was relatively high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> birth but tended to be lower, nearer Australia-born rates, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> migrants. For these cancers, environmental factors related to <b>the</b> migrant's adopted <b>country,</b> and migrant selection, appeared {{to have a major}} effect on the risk of cancer. For certain other cancers, incidence was more similar to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> birth. Nasopharyngeal cancer, and lung cancer in females, had high rates <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> birth and <b>in</b> migrants to Australia. Nasopharyngeal cancer rates were highest in China/Taiwan and Hong Kong-born migrants, and were also significantly high in migrants from Malaysia/Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines. Rates of lung cancer were significantly high in women born <b>in</b> China/Taiwan, and <b>the</b> excess was greater for adenocarcinoma than for squamous cell carcinoma. Melanoma had low rates <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> migrants and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> birth. For these cancers, it was probable that genetic factors, or environmental factors acting prior to migration, were important in causation...|$|R
