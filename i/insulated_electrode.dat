This thesis presents an initial investigation of using electrostatic coalescence as an alternative to conventional separation processes to purify used automotive crankcase oil. Specific emphasis of this study was the feasibility of this approach, verified by separating and analyzing a used oil emulsion. The metal removal efficiency was compared to that of a five day gravity settling. Separation experiments were performed in a 2. 26 L coalescer with a flat parallel <b>insulated</b> <b>electrode</b> configuration. The used oil emulsion, composed of used oil, Isopar M, and water (no noticeable phase separation for 12 hours) followed the electrostatic coalescence characteristic of higher applied voltages or frequencies allowing higher feed rates. Metal removal efficiencies for iron, calcium and zinc were 3. 57, 47. 1, and 46. 7 %, respectively, using Nalco 7715 at a peak a. c. voltage of 7 kV/cm and a frequency of 1000 Hz at the maximum rate of coalescence. For gravity settlement, metal removal efficiencies for iron, calcium and zinc were 11. 2, 15. 6, and 57. 1 %, respectively.

Nonthermal plasmas generated at atmospheric pressure have recently found many applications such as surface cleaning and pollution control. One plasma generation configuration consists of two dielectrically insulated parallel plates with application of an AC voltage of several kV and several kHz. Such a plasma generating structure is very similar to many HV insulating systems and equipment and as such they share much similarity in the evolving plasma and associated plasma-structure interaction. In this contribution, we develop a one-dimensional numerical model to simulate discharge plasmas supported by such an <b>insulated</b> <b>electrode</b> structure and for simplicity we consider helium as the working gas. Assuming that the hydrodynamic approximation applies, various ionization, excitation and recombination processes are considered as sources of generation of charged particles and excited species. Boltzmann equations are then solved in conjunction with the Poisson equation. Numerical examples are then used to explore the conditions under which the induced plasma is nonthermal. Also studied is the dependence of the plasma upon frequency of the applied voltage and the pressure of the ambient gas. These correlative relationships should also be true for many insulating devices and system...|$|E
