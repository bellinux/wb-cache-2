The {{analysis}} is conducted on the EU prices of tomatoes, lemons and apples for some of the main competing countries on the EU domestic markets: Morocco, Argentina, Turkey and China. The econometric analysis is based on testing and estimating a switching vector autoregressive model with endogenous threshold <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> level.

40|$|The EU protects {{some of its}} {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} through the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system. This system consists on a two-tiered tariff, with high-priced exports paying an ad valorem tariff, whereas low-priced exports pay also a supplementary specific tariff. The breaking point {{between high and low}} export <b>prices</b> is the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> level decided by the EU, generally the same level for all third countries. In a few cases, some Southern Mediterranean partners of the EU have agreed a reduced <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> for their exports, together with the more common ad valorem tariff reduction. Among the indicators used for gauge the value of preferences, there is no one devoted to this case of reduced <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> hence we develop a new indicator that allows to split which part of the preferential gains corresponds to the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> reduction and which part corresponds to the "usual" ad valorem tariff reduction. We apply this methodology to Moroccan clementines trade flows, with two main findings: 1) The <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> reduction ranges up to 39 % of the economic value of preferences in some months; 2) Morocco is not maximizing the gains due to this reduction, and could take some trade and policy lessons, mainly trying to better fit to the concession or, if impossible, use it as negotiating capital in future reviews of the agreement.

40|$|EU {{imports of}} oranges are {{restricted}} {{not only by}} ad valorem tariffs {{but also by the}} <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system establishing a minimum import price. In addition, the EU applies a comprehensive system of trade preferences. The hypothesis of this paper is that, in contrast to its complexity, the effectiveness of the EU import system for oranges is low with respect to its goals, i. e. protecting EU producers and creating imports from preference receiving countries. The comparison of import prices for oranges from extra-EU countries with the EU <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> shows that the former are about 40 % higher than the latter on average. Also, it is pointed out that at least 72 % of extra-EU orange imports during the EU harvest season enter the EU tariff free. As a conclusion, the contribution of the import regime to the protection of EU producers is low. Concordantly, the preferential <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> is not utilized by orange preference receiving countries. Besides, although orange quotas increased from 1991 to 2003, actual exports from Mediterranean countries and thus quota filling rates have decreased over the same period. It is shown that EU trade preferences for oranges were not decisive for the development of Mediterranean countries' orange exports to the EU. In the light of the low effectiveness of the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system for oranges along with high transaction costs involved, its abolishment should be considered. Yet, results cannot be generalized, even not for citrus fruit, as is demonstrated for mandarins. trade preferences, oranges, tariff rate quota, <b>entry</b> <b>price,</b> International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} {{the value of}} the preference margin granted to Euro-Mediterranean partners in the cases of reduced <b>entry</b> <b>prices</b> in force, and then it has been simulated the impact of EU trade liberalisation for F&V on such values after two different alternatives of EP system variations resulting from a WTO agreement. The results of current preferences indicate that in monetary terms there is only a significant relevance of the preferential EPs in the case of Moroccan tomatoes and, to a lesser extent, in Moroccan clementines. Very little is the relevance for Jordanian tomatoes and cucumbers and Moroccan courgettes, cucumbers and artichokes. In the cases of oranges from Egypt, Morocco, Israel and Jordan, preferential EP has not meant potential monetary transfers to these preference-receiver countries. Instead, the ad valorem tariff exoneration seems crucial in almost all the products. With regard to the erosion of preferences {{as a result of a}} WTO agreement, the magnitude of the erosion depends crucially on the variation/no-variation of the current trigger EPs, and the undermining of preferences is concentrated mostly on Moroccan tomatoes. <b>Entry</b> <b>prices,</b> erosion of trade preferences, Euro-Mediterranean trade, fruits and vegetables, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

40|$|The EU protects EU growers of 15 {{kinds of}} {{fresh fruits and}} {{vegetables}} against international competition by the <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> system (EPS), which is designed to restrict imports below the product-specific, politically designated <b>entry</b> <b>price</b> level. This study investigates the relevance of the EPS per product and country of origin. We develop two indicators for the effectiveness of the EPS, which serve as variables in a cluster analysis identifying four classes differing in the relevance of the EPS. The relevance of the EPS is found to be heterogeneous among products as well as countries of origin. It is highest for artichokes, courgettes, cucumbers, lemons, plums and tomatoes. The influence of the EPS on apples, clementines and pears is significantly lower, and of least relevance for apricots, mandarins, oranges, peaches and nectarines and table grapes. The EPS has the greatest effect on countries which neighbour the EU, whereas it is of minor importance for exports from far-away countries with the exception of China and South Africa. <b>Entry</b> <b>price</b> system Fruits and vegetables Import policy EU Non-tariff barriers Minimum import price...|$|R

We base our estimates on a panel data sample of 40 brand‐name drugs that first experienced generic competition during the period July 1992 –January 1998. We find that generic share and price are simultaneously determined, {{while the number of}} generic entrants is a key determinant of generic market share and the generic‐to‐brand price ratio. In addition, we find generic competition to be particularly intense for blockbuster drugs, which experience significantly more generic entrants, price erosion, and generic penetration than other drugs.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments {{in the last couple of}} decades in the retail industry has been the emergence of large supermarkets (hypermarkets). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect on prices of the entry of a large supermarket into a given location. We use a panel with data from fifteen cities in Chile for the period 1998 :I – 2004 :IV. The dependent variable is the price of a bundle of 52 food products in each city relative to Santiago. We find that the entry of a hypermarket to a given city reduces prices in that local market by ten percent. Most interestingly, we also find that half of this effect takes place the year before the supermarket actually opens for business. <b>Entry,</b> <b>prices,</b> retail...|$|E
