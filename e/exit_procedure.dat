[...] Airway compression discovered at birth is a medical emergency.

50|$|Despite these concerns, MRI {{is rapidly}} growing in {{importance}} {{as a way}} of diagnosing and monitoring congenital defects of the fetus because it is able to provide more diagnostic information than ultrasound and it lacks the ionizing radiation of CT. MRI without contrast agents is the imaging mode of choice for pre-surgical, in-utero diagnosis and evaluation of fetal tumors, primarily teratomas, facilitating open fetal surgery, other fetal interventions, and planning for procedures (such as the <b>EXIT</b> <b>procedure)</b> to safely deliver and treat babies whose defects would otherwise be fatal.|$|E

[...] Large masses of the neck (such as cervical teratoma) also can cause pulmonary hypoplasia, presumably by interfering with the fetus's ability to fill its lungs.

This question becomes particularly interesting in the post- 1991 period when substantial market oriented reforms were undertaken. We argue that in the Indian institutional context (especially, the underdeveloped state of bankruptcy laws and restrictive <b>exit</b> <b>procedures)</b> outward orientation rather than size is the relevant criteria for distinguishing firms that may be 'finance-constrained' from those that are not. Using panel data for 718 Indian manufacturing firms for the period 1993 - 98, we find that exporting firms are less constrained in financial markets than firms which sell primarily to domestic markets.

50|$|In rare {{instances}} where the fetus {{has a very}} large lesion, resuscitation after delivery can be dangerous. In these situations a specialized delivery for management of the airway compression can be planned called the <b>EXIT</b> <b>procedure,</b> or a fetal laser ablation procedure can be performed. During this minimally invasive fetal intervention, a small needle is inserted into the sequestration, and a laser fiber is targeted at the abnormal blood vessel going to the sequestration. The goal of the operation is to use laser energy to stop the {{blood flow to the}} sequestration, causing it to stop growing. Ideally, after the surgery, the sequestration steals less blood flow from the fetus, and the heart and lungs start growing more normally as the sequestration shrinks in size and the pleural effusion goes away.|$|E
50|$|The ex utero intrapartum {{treatment}} (<b>EXIT)</b> <b>procedure</b> {{was originally}} developed to reverse temporary tracheal occlusion {{in patients who}} had undergone fetal surgery for severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). In {{a select group of}} fetuses with CDH, tracheal occlusion is used to obstruct the normal flow of fetal lung fluid and to stimulate lung expansion and growth. With the airway obstructed, airway management at birth is critical. The solution was to arrange delivery {{in such a way that}} the occlusion could be removed and the airway secured while the baby remained on placental support. If the uterus was kept relaxed and the utero-placental blood flow kept intact, the fetus could remain on a maternal 'heart-lung machine' while the airway was secured. While the technique of tracheal occlusion remains under study in clinical trials, EXIT procedures have been shown to be useful for management of other causes of fetal airway obstruction.|$|E
50|$|Spacecraft #11 {{also had}} a new {{explosive}} hatch release. This would allow an astronaut to exit the spacecraft quickly {{in the event of}} an emergency. Emergency personnel could also trigger the explosive hatch from outside the spacecraft by pulling on an external lanyard. Both the pop-off hatch and the lanyard are standard features of ejection seats used in military aircraft, but in the Mercury design, the pilot still had to exit the craft himself, or be removed by emergency personnel. The original <b>exit</b> <b>procedure</b> was to climb out through the antenna compartment, after removing a small pressure bulkhead. This was a difficult and slow procedure. Removal of an injured or unconscious astronaut through the top hatch would be nearly impossible. The original side hatch was bolted shut with 70 bolts and covered with several spacecraft shingles, making it a slow process to open the original hatch.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Previous {{research}} has shown that elderly and disabled travelers using Special Transportation Services (STS) are injured without being involved in a vehicle crash. In order to estimate the true costs for these vehicle-related injuries, the focus needs to be adjusted towards an incident/traveler-oriented perspective. The aim of the project was thus to utilize such a perspective, {{in order to make a}} best estimation of the true costs for injury incidents, related to STS in Sweden. Methods. In order to address the chosen perspective, a mixed-method approach was used, involving quantitative as well as qualitative research methods applied on four different sets of data, the hospital-based material (n = 32), two sets of STS material (n = 127), and interview-based material (n = 1, 000). Results. The results showed that the injury incidence rate in STS is considerable, i. e., 3. 2 per 100, 000 trips (ranging from 1. 5 - 1. 9 in STS taxis and 3. 6 - 5. 6 in STS special vehicles). However, this high incidence rate is not due to road traffic crashes, but to non-collision injury incidents involving elderly and frail passengers, easily sustaining injuries from minor to moderate external violence. Typically, this violence is affecting an older female STS user, while entering and exiting the vehicle. The true costs were estimated to be $ 35 million per annum or $ 2. 6 per trip. Conclusion. Future injury prevention measures should thus focus on safety in entering and <b>exiting</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
