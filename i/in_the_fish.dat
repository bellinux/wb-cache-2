He appeared in two episodes of The Saint in (1964-5), and had an uncredited role as Professor Spencer in The Avengers episode The Master Minds. He also starred as Herman in the Christopher Miles comedy film Up Jumped a Swagmanwhich co-starred other ITC regulars Annette Andre and Ronald Radd.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a vertical position with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone evidence indicates that there was a significant growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E

5|$|The {{section of}} SR 266 {{from the western}} {{terminus}} to the junction with SR 168 is designated by the California State Legislature as eligible by law for the State Scenic Highway System; {{but it is not}} officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation.

In the event that SR 168 is closed, SR 266 connects to Nevada State Route 264, which intersects with U.S. Route 6 in order to provide an alternate access to California.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{can cause}} {{opportunistic}} infections in weakened or immunocompromised humans. It is most {{commonly associated with}} bacteremic cellulitis, but {{has been known to}} cause endocarditis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in Texas in 1991 and in Ottawa in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined. Human infection with S.iniae was also identified in Toronto between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to Streptococcus uberis, but later correctly identified as S.iniae. In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with sepsis one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with S.iniae bacteremia. A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection. Other cases were later identified in the United States and elsewhere in Canada, and have since been reported in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore). Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E
