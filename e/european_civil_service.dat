5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> <b>service.</b> The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the insights {{provided by a}} number of authors (Bhatia 1993, 2002, 2004; Bhatia / Candlin / Engsberg / Trosborg 2003; Bhatia / Gotti 2006; Candlin / Bhatia / Jensen 2002; Drew / Heritage 1992; Garzone 2003; Goodrich 1988; Gotti 2003; Maley 1994; Swales 1990, 1996, 2004; Tessuto 2003) to examine discourse and professional practices in employment tribunals first in a national and then in an international context. With a view to investigating legal discourse in different legal systems, the chapter examines the institutional constraints on discourse processes in employment cases at Employment Tribunals in the UK, the <b>European</b> Union <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> Tribunal in Luxembourg, and the International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT) in Geneva. Although in all cases the pragmatic function is the presentation of complaints by employees against their employers for the purpose of obtaining compensation or reinstatement, the procedural rules shaping the discourse are strikingly different, with consequent variation in generic structure and lexical content. In examining the institutional procedures and case materials, it is argued that Employment Tribunals in the UK, standing firmly in the common law tradition, provide for courtroom hearings in which the parties present their evidence orally, following the classic sequence of examination-in-chief and cross-examination. On the other hand, at the <b>European</b> Union <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> Tribunal (where cases may be heard in any of the 23 official languages of the EU, depending on the language of the application) and at the ILOAT, the proceedings (in English or French) bear a stronger resemblance to the civil law tradition, with most or all of the discourse taking the form of written pleadings. The jurisdiction of the EU <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> Tribunal is supranational, and that of the ILOAT international, dealing with complaints lodged by staff members respectively of EU and UN organizations. In the case of the <b>European</b> Union <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> Tribunal, written pleadings may be accompanied by hearings. However, {{in the case of the}} ILOAT, the holding of courtroom hearings would require the parties to travel from all over the world. Partly due to this constraint, the discourse is structured in an entirely different manner compared to the national tribunal, with claims presented and argumentation constructed almost exclusively on the basis of written documents, in a genre chain (Fairclough 2003 : 31) consisting of the complaint, the defendant’s reply, the complainant’s rejoinder, the defendant’s surrejoinder, and finally the judgment. This enables the ILOAT to deal with cases entirely on the basis of written pleadings, with applications for hearings seldom allowed. An examination of the terminology in English in the three Tribunals, one national, one supranational, and one international, reflects significant divergences in legal cultures, as the parties seek to construct and interpret meanings while complying with the institutional constraints prevailing in each of the systems...|$|R

40|$|Since the the Agreement on Stabilisation and Association {{between the}} Republic of Croatia and the European Communities has been signed, Croatia {{is faced with}} a problem of {{increasing}} urgency, namely the adjustment of its law, its law system, to the law legacy of the <b>European</b> Union. <b>Civil</b> <b>service</b> bodies are continuously engaged in harmonising the two law systems, {{but because of the}} diffi culty of the task and the internal problems of the Croatian law system, they face a variety of diffi culties. The harmonisation of legal rules imposes itself as the most demanding criterion for the admission of Croatia to the European Union. The comprehensiveness and complexity of the European law system leave Croatia with little time for a successful adjustment.

50|$|A Commissioner {{can come}} under {{a great deal}} of {{influence}} from the staff under their control. The <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> is permanent whereas a Commissioner is in office usually for just five years. Hence it is the service which know the workings of the Commission and have longer term interests. Strong leadership from a Commissioner, who knows the workings of their portfolio, can overcome the power of the service. An example would be Pascal Lamy, however the best people are usually kept by their national governments leading to less solid candidates getting the job.|$|E

5000|$|In the European Commission, {{a cabinet}} (the French pronunciation, cab-ee-nay, is used) is the {{personal}} {{office of a}} European Commissioner. The role of a cabinet is to give political guidance to its Commissioner. Members of a cabinet are equivalent, within UK Government nomenclature, to a special adviser or [...] "SPAD". Technical policy preparation is handled by the <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Service.</b> The term {{is not to be}} confused with the European Commission's top decision making-body known in EU-lexicon, as the [...] "College of Commissioners" [...] (referred to in most political systems as a cabinet).|$|E
5000|$|In the European Union, {{there are}} two sources of {{democratic}} legitimacy: the European Parliament, directly elected {{by the people of}} the European Union as a whole; and the Council of the European Union (the [...] "Council of Ministers"), together with the European Council (of heads of national governments), that represent the peoples of the individual states. The <b>European</b> Commission (the <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> of the Union) is appointed by the two bodies acting together. Democratic legitimacy within the EU can be compared with the dual legitimacy provided for in a federal polity, such as the USA, where {{there are two}} independent sources of democratic legitimacy, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and, to become law, decisions must be approved both by one institution representing the people as a whole and by a separate body representing the peoples of the individual states.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a number of changes to {{qualifications}} for candidates to run for office.

This provision disqualified Ayodhya Prasad as {{he was out of the}} country during the registration period.|$|R
50|$|The idea of {{a unified}} <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> code {{can be traced to}} the {{idea of a}} unified Europe and the {{creation}} of the European Union. The European Parliament requested the creation of a <b>European</b> <b>civil</b> code in 1989, 1994 and 2000.

5000|$|Accusations of {{distorted}} or untruthful reporting {{are most}} commonly directed at conservative and Eurosceptic {{sections of the}} British media.

Examples cited as Euromyths include stories about rules banning mince-pies, curved bananas and mushy peas. Others include a story that English fish and chips shops {{would be forced to}} use Latin names for their fish (Sun, 5 September 2001), quoted in [...] that double-decker buses would be banned (The Times, 9 April 1998), that British rhubarb must be straight, and that barmaids would have to cover up their cleavage.|$|E

50|$|The President's {{office is}} on the top, 13th, floor of the Berlaymont {{building}} in Brussels. The president receives his political guidance from his cabinet, the head of which acts as a political bodyguard for the President. Such factors can lead to an isolation of the President from outside events. For the <b>European</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> the President has a very high status, due to his immense authority and symbolism within the body. The President exercises further authority through the legal service and Secretariat-General of the Commission. The former {{has the power to}} strike down proposals on legal technicalities while the latter organises meetings, agendas and minutes. His control over these areas gives the President further political tools when directing the work of the Commission. This has also increased the Presidential style of the Commission President.|$|E
