Prior to the welded side seam, the can body was folded and/or soldered together, leaving a relatively thick side seam.

The regulation requires that <b>double</b> <b>seamed</b> containers be visually inspected for gross closure defects such as sharp seams, cut-overs, deadheads, false seams, droops and broken chuck. The frequency of the visual examination should be made at intervals not to exceed 30 minutes (of operational time); and additional visual examinations must be performed immediately following a jam in a closing machine, after closing machine adjustment, or after startup of a machine following a prolonged shut-down. An example of a prolonged shut down may be when the plant ceases production at 6:00 PM and restarts production at 8:00 AM the next day." ...|$|R

They also provide a set-up aim or ideal starting dimensions for the set up of the seamer. The operating limits set the range for good practice." [...] While specifying these guidelines is important, the plant is responsible for the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> quality: [...] "It is extremely important to understand that seam guidelines by themselves cannot be used for determining the quality of a <b>double</b> <b>seam.</b> The seam guidelines are to be used in setting up the double seams initially and maintaining seam integrity during production. Final acceptability of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> should be based on total evaluation of the seam by a qualified person and not on dimensions alone. Good seaming practice requires constant visual examination, frequently scheduled tear-down evaluation, machine maintenance, and immediate correction of unacceptable conditions." [...] The regulation also states that if the double seams do not meet the guidelines, the can filler plant [...] "must know what steps to take to correct the condition".|$|E

40|$|In {{computer}} vision, video stitching is a {{very challenging}} problem. In this paper, we proposed an efficient and effective wide-view video stitching method based on fast structure deformation {{that is capable of}} simultaneously achieving quality stitching and computational efficiency. For a group of synchronized frames, firstly, an effective double-seam selection scheme is designed to search two distinct but structurally corresponding seams in the two original images. The seam location of the previous frame is further considered to preserve the inter-frame consistency. Secondly, along the <b>double</b> <b>seams,</b> 1 -D feature detection and matching is performed to capture the structural relationship between the two adjacent views. Thirdly, after feature matching, we propose an efficient algorithm to linearly propagate the deformation vectors to eliminate structure misalignment. At last, image intensity misalignment is corrected by rapid gradient fusion based on the successive over relaxation iteration (SORI) solver. A principled solution to the initialization of the SORI significantly reduced the number of iterations required. We have compared favorably our method with seven state-of-the-art image and video stitching algorithms as well as traditional ones. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing ones compared in terms of overall stitching quality and computational efficiency...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{made using}} a double seamer, which can {{have just one}} or a number of heads or seaming stations. The <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is formed by {{mechanically}} interlocking five layers of material together: three layers of the can end and two layers of the can body. Each seaming head typically consists of two rolls, a first operation roll and second operation roll, and a chuck. Some seaming machines have two first operation rolls and two second operation rolls and a few machines use a method called [...] "rail seaming" [...] which requires no rolls. During the seaming operation, the can end is lowered on to the filled can body and held down by the chuck, which acts as an anvil to the seaming operation. The first operation roll then engages the can end against the can body thereby folding the end curl around the flange of the body. In some seaming machines, this is done as the can is turning at high speed. In other seaming machines, the can is stationary and the first operation roll (or rolls) spins around several times to ensure a complete first operation. After the first operation is complete, the first operation roll disengages from the can and the second operation roll then engages the can. The purpose of the second operation is to iron out the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> into its final shape and remove the voids between the layers of can and end material. In practice, ironing {{out all of the}} can and end material in a <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> without leaving some voids is impossible without the use of a sealing compound.|$|E

50|$|The {{plates of}} early {{locomotive}} boilers {{were joined by}} simple overlapping joints. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, {{along the length of}} the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), {{along the length of the}} joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure. It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level. Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or <b>double</b> butt-strap <b>seams,</b> which do not suffer from this defect.|$|R
40|$|Because {{the cost}} of {{third-party}} construction quality assurance (CQA) of geomembrane liner installations is typically comparable to {{the cost of}} the geomembrane liner, CQA must be optimized to obtain the most benefit for the owner, rate payers, and environment. A regulation-based CQA protocol usually includes testing the material, observing the quality control (QC) program ofthe liner installer, and performing destructive tests on samples of the geomembrane seams. Another well-established type of third-party CQA is leak location surveys using an electrical leak location method. This paper compares representative costs, benefits, and results of the two types of CQA used on geomembrane liners where both types were used. The relative merits of the two types of CQA are discussed. Examples of direct cost benefits are also presented. A large percent of regulation-based CQA is the destructive testing of <b>double</b> wedge welded <b>seams.</b> Industry experience has shown that these welds seldom fail, and they require the test area to be repaired using a much longer length of inferior extrusion welding. Leak location surveys have shown that construction damage caused while placing protective drainage material on the geomembrane is a far more significant problem than <b>double</b> wedge welded <b>seam</b> failure. A much better cost benefit can be realized if {{a significant part of the}} resources spent on destructive testing of seams is used for electrical leak location surveys to eliminate construction damage...|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> is {{determined}} by the {{shape of the}} seamer roll profile and the relative position.

5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the <b>double</b> <b>seam</b> are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the can seam measurements (i.e., body hook) is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the <b>double</b> <b>seam,</b> but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a design study {{to compare the}} manufacturing costs {{at a level of}} 100, 000 hybrid vehicle batteries per year for flexible package (Flex) cells and for rigid aluminum container (Rigid) cells. Initially, the Rigid cells were considered to have welded closures and to be deep-drawn containers of about the same shape as the Flex cells. As the study progressed, the method of fabricating and sealing the Rigid cells was expanded to include lower cost options including <b>double</b> <b>seaming</b> and other mechanically fastened closures with polymer sealants. Both types of batteries were designed with positive electrodes containing Li(Ni{sub 1 / 3 }Co{sub 1 / 3 }Mn{sub 1 / 3 }) O{sub 2 } and graphite negative electrodes. The use of a different combination of lithium-ion electrodes would have little effect on the difference in costs for the two types of cells. We found that 20 -Ah cells could be designed with excellent performance and heat rejection capabilities for either type of cell. Many parts {{in the design of the}} Flex cells are identical or nearly identical to those of the Rigid Cell, so for these features there would be no difference in the cost of manufacturing the two types of batteries. We judged the performance, size and weight of the batteries to be sufficiently similar that the batteries would have the same value for their application. Some of the design features of the Flex cells were markedly different than those of the deep-drawn and welded Rigid cells and would result in significant cost savings. Fabrication and processing steps for which the Flex cells appear to have a cost advantage over these Rigid cells are (1) container fabrication and sealing, (2) terminal fabrication and sealing, and (3) intercell connections. The costs of providing cooling channels adjacent to the cells and for module and battery hardware appear to favor Rigid cell batteries slightly. Overall, Flex cell batteries appear to have an advantage of about $ 1. 20 -$ 3. 70 per cell for a 25 -kW Battery of 20 cells or about $ 24 to $ 74 per battery. Container experts assisted with this study, including a paid consultant and personnel at container manufacturing companies. Some of the companies are considering entering the business of manufacturing containers for hybrid vehicle battery manufacturers. For this reason they provided valuable guidance on overall approaches to reducing the costs of the cell containers. They have retained the description of some specific designs and procedures for future possible work with battery manufacturers, with whom they are now in contact. Through the guidance of these experts, we determined that a new type of container could be manufactured that would have the best features of performance and low cost of both the Rigid and Flex containers. For instance, the aluminum layer in a tri-layer sheet can be sufficiently thick to form a rigid container that can be fabricated in two halves, much like a Flex container, and mechanically joined at the edges for strength. In addition to the mechanical joint, this container can be sealed at the edges, much like a Flex container, by means of an inner polymer liner that can be heat-sealed or ultrasonically welded. The terminals can be flat strips of metal sealed into the top of the container as part of the edge sealing of the container, as for the Flex cell. Ridges can be stamped into one side of the container to provide cooling channels and the exterior layer of the container stock can be coated with a thin, electrically insulating, polymer layer. We expect this type of container will provide excellent sealing and durability and be less expensive than either the Flex or the Rigid container, which the study initially considered. A major cost for the original Rigid container is the welding required for sealing the container. However, the welding of the current collector tabs to the terminal piece may be even more complex and costly than welding the container. It is important, therefore, to develop an inexpensive procedure for attachment of the foils to the terminal pieces. A lower-cost procedure, such as ultrasonic welding or mechanical clipping, might replace laser welding of the foils to the terminal pieces. A conclusion from our discussions with the container experts is that the manufacturing rate required for the containers for hybrid vehicle batteries is fairly low, and thus favors procedures requiring low tooling costs and little development effort. These conditions favor flexible packaging, heat sealing, shallow stamping, <b>double</b> <b>seaming</b> and ultrasonic welding. It works against deep drawing and untested procedures for welding and joining...|$|R
40|$|Multi-material {{structures}} pose {{an attractive}} option for overcoming {{some of the}} central challenges in lightweight design. An exceptionally high potential for creating cost-effective lightweight solutions is attributed to the combination of steel and aluminum. However, these materials are also particularly difficult to join due to their tendency to form intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The growth of these compounds is facilitated by high temperatures and long process times. Due to their high brittleness, IMCs can severely weaken a joint. Thus, it is only possible to create durable steel-aluminum joints when the formation of IMCs can be limited to a non-critical level. To meet this goal, a new joining method has been designed. The method {{is based on the}} combination of a continuous wave (pw) and a pulsed laser (pw) source. Laser beams from both sources are superimposed in a common process zone. This makes it possible to apply the advantages of laser brazing to mixed-metal joints without requiring the use of chemical fluxes. The double beam technology was first tested in bead-on-plate experiments using different filler wire materials. Based on the results of these tests, a process for joining steel and aluminum in a double-flanged configuration is now being developed. The <b>double</b> flanged <b>seams</b> are joined using zinc- or aluminum-based filler wires. Microsections of selected seams show {{that it is possible to}} achieve good base material wetting while limiting the growth of IMCs to acceptable measures.

40|$|N WESTERN EUROPE {{flexible}} structures, {{in particular}} pneumatic con-structions, are today predominatly {{made on the}} basis of PVC-coated polyester fabrics. For this purpose 4 standard types of fabric are currently available, the technical data of which are shown in Table 1. This table includes apart from the strength at room temperature, also the strength at 70 ° C. This elevated temperature was chosen because temperature measurements conducted on air-supported structures in West Germany have always given membrane temperatures below 70 °C so that 70 ° C represents an upper limit for test purposes. Which of the 4 materials will be selected depends on the loads to be expected, resulting from the design of the structure and the environmental influences to which it will be exposed. It has been found that in West Germany the most commonly used materials is type II. In addition to the materials presented here, there have, of course, been developed other materials for special structures requiring, for instance, extremely high translucence.
