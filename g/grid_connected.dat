25|$|Solar cells produce {{direct current}} {{electricity}} from sunlight {{which can be}} used to power equipment or to recharge a battery. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for <b>grid</b> <b>connected</b> power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, boats, recreational vehicles, electric cars, roadside emergency telephones, remote sensing, and cathodic protection of pipelines.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{power in}} Japan has been {{expanding}} {{since the late}} 1990s. The country is a leading manufacturer of solar panels {{and is in the}} top 5 ranking for countries with the most solar photovoltaics (PV) installed. In 2009 Japan had the third largest solar capacity in the world (behind Germany and Spain), with most of it <b>grid</b> <b>connected.</b> The solar insolation is good at about 4.3 to 4.8 kWh/(m²·day). Japan is the world's fourth largest energy consumer, making solar power an important national project. By the end of 2012, Japan had installed 7,000 MW of photovoltaics, enough to generate 0.77% of Japan's electricity. Due to the new feed-in tariff (FIT), Japan installed more than 5,000 MW in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Net {{zero-energy}} building: Based {{on scientific}} analysis within the joint research program “Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings” a methodological framework {{was set up}} which allows different definitions, in accordance with country’s political targets, specific (climate) conditions and respectively formulated requirements for indoor conditions: The overall conceptual understanding of a Net ZEB is an energy efficient, <b>grid</b> <b>connected</b> building enabled to generate energy from renewable sources to compensate its own energy demand (see figure 1).The wording “Net” emphasizes the energy exchange between {{the building and the}} energy infrastructure. By the building-grid interaction, the Net ZEBs becomes an active part of the renewable energy infrastructure. This connection to energy grids prevents seasonal energy storage and oversized on-site systems for energy generation from renewable sources like in energy autonomous buildings. The similarity of both concepts is a pathway of two actions: 1) reduce energy demand by means of energy efficiency measures and passive energy use; 2) generate energy from renewable sources. However, the Net ZEBs grid interaction and plans to widely increase their numbers evoke considerations on increased flexibility in the shift of energy loads and reduced peak demands.|$|E
500|$|Pei's design {{placed the}} rigid shoebox {{at an angle}} to the {{surrounding}} street <b>grid,</b> <b>connected</b> at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like filigree. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. [...] "I can imagine only 60percent of the space in this building," [...] he said during the early stages. [...] "The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else." [...] As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon Ross Perot made a donation of US$10million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} coordinated {{converter}} control strategy for multi-terminal dc (MTDC) grids in hybrid AC/DC power systems. Previous works {{have shown the}} possibility of providing frequency containment reserve (FCR) from offshore wind farms to ac grids through MTDC grids using frequency and dc voltage droop control. However, due to the characteristics of dc voltage droop control, the frequency support would come both from offshore wind farms and all other ac <b>grids</b> <b>connected</b> to the MTDC. This paper proposes a coordinated MTDC converter control strategy that maximizes {{the share of the}} FCR contribution from an offshore wind farm and reduces the contribution of other ac grids. A hybrid AC/DC power system consisting of offshore wind farm and two asynchronous <b>grids</b> <b>connected</b> through an MTDC grid is used as a test system. Using the test system, different scenarios are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coordinated control strategy...|$|R

[...] Tidal energy developers that have tested at the site include: Alstom (formerly Tidal Generation Ltd); ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest; Atlantis Resources Corporation; Nautricity; OpenHydro; Scotrenewables Tidal Power; Voith.
