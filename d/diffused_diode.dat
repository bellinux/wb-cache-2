40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Changes in the diode {{characteristics}} {{of three different}} types of diodes were studied. These were point-contact, bonded and zinc-diffused diodes. The parameters in which measurable changes were observed were the forward resistance, the reverse breakdown voltage, the forward "knee" of the diode curve and the constant of proportionality relating the reverse-bias capacitance to voltage. Of the three diodes tested, the bonded diodes, {{appeared to be the}} most stable. The forward resistance increased with time under load conditions for all types of diodes. In the zinc-diffused diodes large initial changes were observed, similar to those observed by Shibata. (19) The final rates of deterioration for all three diodes were about the same. This suggests that the mechanism of deterioration in this portion of the curves may be the same for all three types of diodes. For the final portions of the deterioration curves of the <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes,</b> the absolute value of load current is related to changes in resistance by Δ R = K √tI where K is a constant. Difficulty in determining the actual cross sectional area of the diodes prevented relating these changes to current density. In the worst case the proportionality constant relating voltage to reverse -bias capacitance varied from v⁻¹/². ³ to v⁻/³. ⁷ for <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes.</b> This indicates that the type of junction changed from a step to a PIN type. The voltage at the forward "knee" of the diode curve increased for the bonded diodes while it decreased for the point-contact and the <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes.</b> An increase in junction barrier height may be responsible for the variation in the bonded diodes while an increase in surface recombination states may be responsible for the decrease in the point-contact case. The spreading of the pn junction by diffusion of an electrically active element is a possible cause of the change in <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The RoA {{product of}} PbSe photodiodes has been {{investigated}} experimentally and theoretically over a wide temperature region from 30 to 300 K. The photodiodes were made from PbSe bulk material by diffused and MBE techniques. Good agreement between experimental and theoretical results has been obtained. Evidence is presented that the RoA product is limited by depletion rather than diffusion (Auger recombination) at high temperatures, and at low temperatures by tunneling. Minority carrier lifetimes {{of the order of}} nanoseconds near room temperature are derived from a fit to experimental data, about 50 % shorter for MBE <b>diodes</b> than for <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes.</b> Majority carrier concentration profiles near the p-n junction at low temperatures are obtained based on the band to band tunneling model roughly 70 % higher for MBE diodes than that for <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes,</b> which is in reasonable accordance with Hall data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{degradation}} of <b>diffused</b> SiC PIN <b>diodes</b> during forward-biased operation was studied by first fabricating PIN diodes by diffusion of aluminum or boron into 4 H-SiC substrates with n-type 10 - 15 µm thick epilayers doped by nitrogen up to 5 x 1015 cm- 3. The formed diodes {{were subjected to}} degradation testing under an applied current density of 200 A/cm 2 at room temperature. The majority of the Al <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes</b> demonstrated a voltage drift, ΔVf, of more than 2 V, while B-doped diodes showed no significant change in forward voltage. The EBIC mode of SEM was employed to monitor nucleation and expansion of stacking faults...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of doping density vs. depth from capacitance-voltage measurements on <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes</b> in epitaxial material is derived for the gen-eral case. These calculations extend the useful {{range of the}} capacitance-voltage technique and allow profiling of epitaxial doping in depth {{through the use of}} deep-diffusion test diodes. Experimental comparison of the deep-diffusion a d shallow-diffusion characterization techniques hows that the deep-diffusion technique xtends the depth capability of capacitance-voltage m asurements with accuracy comparable to the shallow-junction measurements (5 - 15 %). The use of epitaxial material for microwave devices requires a more complete characterization this type of material than has been common in the past.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} the influence of a nonuniform doping concentration to the temperature response curve of diode temperature sensors is presented, which is the first effort in this field important for <b>diffused</b> <b>diodes</b> used as the temperature sensors. The current-voltage characteristic, from which the temperature response curve can be obtained, has been calculated using the model of a one-dimensional exponentially graded p-n junction with uniformly doped base region and the diffusion current of the minority carriers through the p-n junction. We show that depending on the doping gradient both contributions to the current coming from the electron and hole current components appear to be of the same order of magnitude. That is in contrast to the prediction of the widely used asymmetrical step junction model. It follows from numerical calculations that an effective shift of the temperature response curve due to nonuniformly doped emitter region in the temperature equivalent can reach the value of about 20 K. The limiting temperature Tm in the temperature response curve that restricts its extent into the high temperature range has been analyzed depending on the excitation current, the doping concentration of the base, and the p-n junction depth...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{a common}} disease that increases the incidence of cerebrovascular embolic events and cardiac dysfunction. Foci for atrial fibrillation have been mapped and found {{to be for the}} most part located within the ostia of the pulmonary veins. Since 2002 microwave and radiofrequency energy sources have been used to create pulmonary vein isolation lesions. This abstract summarizes the safety and efficacy of performing vein isolation lesions with laser as the energy source. Description - The large pig model was utilized for creation of isolation lesions around the pulmonary veins. The Optimaze E 360 Surgical Ablation Handpiece from Edwards Lifesciences was utilized, it contains a 4 centimeter <b>diffusing</b> <b>diode</b> laser (980 nm). All six of the pig models tolerated the procedure with a 40 -day normal post procedure growth pattern. Evaluation - Upon reoperation one pig developed ventricular fibrillation with resection of adhesions. All five remaining pigs were fully tested and demonstrated complete electrical isolation. Gross pathology revealed intact well defined ablation lesions with an otherwise completely normal cardiac structure. All lesions were fully transmural at each histological sectioned point. Conclusions - Laser technology {{in the form of the}} Optimaze E 360 Surgical Ablation Handpiece from Edwards Lifesciences, is able to reliably and consistently produce well defined electrical isolation scars around the pulmonary veins. This device is also amenable to performing the isolation procedure using a minimally invasive approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the generation of powerful microwave voltage oscillations in a <b>diffused</b> silicon <b>diode</b> is studied. A reverse current 2 kA in amplitude is passed through a 0. 5 -cm 2 diode with a structure thickness of 320 μm, a p-n junction depth of 220 μm. At an average diode voltage of ∼ 300 V and a microwave pulse duration of ∼ 200 ns, the maximum voltage swing reaches 480 V. The oscillation frequency lies in the range 5 to 7 GHz; {{the power of the}} microwave pulse component is ∼ 300 kW. A theoretical consideration shows that voltage oscillations are caused by periodically repeating processes of breakdown and structure filling with plasma followed by its removal by the reverse current. The frequency and voltage swing are controlled by the current density and dopant-concentration gradient {{in the vicinity of the}} p-n junction. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|R

Units have been fabricated with breakdown voltages from 6 to greater than 200 v, with areas from 5 x 10 - ~ cm " to 5 cm 2. Design problems associated with high and low voltage diodes are discussed. Reverse saturation currents at half the breakdown voltage are often in the order of 10 - ~ amp/cmE Impedance after breakdown is shown to be a function of the breakdown voltage and the magnitude of the avalanche current.

40|$|The hole {{diffusion}} length in n-InGaAs is extracted for two samples of different doping concentrations using {{a set of}} long and thin <b>diffused</b> junction <b>diodes</b> separated by various distances {{on the order of}} the {{diffusion length}}. The methodology is described, including the ensuing analysis which yields diffusion lengths between 70 - 85 um at room temperature for doping concentrations in the range of 5 - 9 x 10 ^ 15 cm- 3. The analysis also provides insight into the minority carrier mobility which is a parameter not commonly reported in the literature. Hole mobilities on the order of 500 - 750 cm 2 /Vs are reported for the aforementioned doping range, which are comparable albeit longer than the majority hole mobility for the same doping magnitude in p-InGaAs. A radiative recombination coefficient of (0. 5 - 0. 2) x 10 ^- 10 cm^- 3 s^- 1 is also extracted from the ensuing analysis for an InGaAs thickness of 2. 7 um. Preliminary evidence is also given for both heavy and light hole diffusion. The dark current of InP/InGaAs p-i-n photodetectors with 25 and 15 um pitches are then calibrated to device simulations and correlated to the extracted diffusion lengths and doping concentrations. An effective Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of between 90 - 200 us provides the best fit to the dark current of these structures. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{management}} {{is important for}} many microelectronic devices due to the performance losses that accompany heat generation, and is often accomplished {{through the use of}} an external thermoelectric cooler. Such coolers operate on the principle of the Peltier effect: when carriers move across a junction between two materials in which they transport a different amount of energy, heat is exchanged with the surrounding lattice to make up the difference. An alternative solution is to optimize the thermoelectric behavior of the device itself so that cooling is achieved internally. For the fundamental case of the p-n <b>diode,</b> <b>diffusing</b> minority carriers must pull a large amount of heat energy out of the lattice near the junction in order to move against the built-in field. Under optimal conditions for the diode’s dimensions and doping, this bias-dependent heat exchange term can be large enough to cause a significant drop in the junction temperature [1]. As shown in Figure 1, a range of current bias exists for which thermoelectric cooling dominates Joule heating. Figure 2 demonstrates the large temperature differences that can be achieved in materials that have high mobility and low thermal conductivity. Such cooling can be enhanced using heterojunctions and can be an important design consideration for devices such as diode lasers...|$|R
