5|$|King {{transferred}} to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 13January 1917, and was posted to Britain to join No.4 Squadron AFC (also referred to as No.71 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, by the British) as an air mechanic on 18April. He was assigned to a training squadron for <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> in August. On 15October, he gained his wings and officer's commission. Allocated to No.4 Squadron in November 1917, King was posted to France for active duty on 21March 1918. The same day, the Germans launched Operation Michael, the opening phase of the Spring Offensive.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations for <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E
5|$|Even as a boy, Frank {{had wanted}} to become a pilot. World War II had begun on 1 September 1939 and he volunteered for {{military}} service in the Luftwaffe. Following his basic military training, he took <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> at the pilot school in Zeltweg. Here he qualified to fly the Bücker Bü 131, Bü 133 and Bü 181, the Klemm Kl 35, the Arado Ar 66, Ar 68 and Ar 96, the Focke-Wulf Fw 58, and the Junkers W 34 and Junkers Ju 52. In October 1940 he transferred to Nachtjagdschule 1 (1st Night Fighter School) at Schleißheim near Munich, formerly the Zerstörerschule 1 (ZS 1—1st Destroyer School).

5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock. Val Hancock entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1925 and {{graduated}} as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in the military was engineering, {{and it was only}} when he found that there was no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E
5|$|Malley {{joined the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 12October 1915.

5|$|No. 5 Service Flying Training School (No.5 SFTS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flight {{training}} unit that operated during World WarII. It {{was one of}} eight Service Flying Training Schools established by the RAAF to provide intermediate and advanced <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No.5 SFTS was formed at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, in October 1941, and disbanded in February 1946. Its staff and equipment were employed to re-establish No.1 Flying Training School, which transferred to RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, the following year. Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty was also formed from No.5 SFTS's facilities, to look after surplus aircraft at the base prior to their disposal, and disbanded in December 1948.|$|E

5|$|Rawlinson {{was living}} in the Melbourne suburb of Ivanhoe and had been working as a clerk for two-and-a-half years when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 19July 1938. He {{underwent}} <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> as an air cadet at No.1 Flying Training School, Point Cook, and was granted a short-service commission as a pilot officer on probation from 22June 1939. On 7July he was posted to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron, which operated Hawker Demon biplane fighters out of RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. He spent much of the remainder of the year learning instrument flying on the Link Trainer, and undertaking a parachute training course.|$|E
5|$|<b>Flying</b> <b>instruction</b> in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{underwent}} {{major changes}} following {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, {{in response to a}} vast {{increase in the number of}} aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, No.1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS). The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} two courses each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary <b>flying</b> <b>instruction</b> and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E

50|$|Instrument rating {{refers to}} the {{qualifications}} that a pilot must have in order to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR). It requires additional training and instruction beyond what is required for a private pilot certificate or commercial pilot certificate, including rules and procedures specific to instrument <b>flying,</b> additional <b>instruction</b> in meteorology, and more intensive training in flight solely by reference to instruments.Testing consists of a written exam and a practical test (known more commonly as the check ride). The check ride is divided into an oral component to verify that the applicant understands the theory of instrument flying and an actual flight to ensure the pilot possesses the practical skills required for safe IFR flight.|$|R
50|$|A force under Colonel Parsons {{was sent}} from Kassala to Al Qadarif which was retaken from Mahdist forces on 22 September. A {{flotilla}} of two boats under General Hunter was sent up the Blue Nile on 19 September to plant flags and establish garrisons wherever seemed expedient. They planted the Egyptian and British flags at Er Roseires on 30 September, and at Sennar {{on the return}} journey. Gallabat was reoccupied on 7 December, although the two Ethiopian flags that had been raised there after the Mahdist evacuation were left <b>flying</b> pending <b>instructions</b> from Cairo. Despite the easy recovery of these key towns there remained {{a great deal of}} fear and confusion in the countryside across the Jezirah, where bands of Mahdist supporters continued to roam, pillaging and killing for several months after the fall of Omdurman.

40|$|Test {{pilot school}} {{graduates}} {{must have a}} solid understanding of aircraft flying qualities and handling qualities. The USAF Test Pilot School has traditionally used classroom in-struction followed by in-flight demonstration of test techniques to provide graduates with this understanding. Flying qualities simulation has traditionally seen little use at test pi-lot schools because high-quality simulators are exclusively designed to re-create particular aircraft. This type of simulator, while valuable for pilot training, adds little to a TPS curriculum except a reduction of fidelity and elimination of motion cues–it can only show how a particular aircraft behaves. Recent advances in desktop computer technology and electrically-driven inceptors have allowed the authors at the USAF TPS to create a han-dling qualities simulator that can used as a flying qualities laboratory, a handling qualities research device, and a force multiplier for increasingly valuable curriculum sorties. Built by the authors with off-the-shelf hardware, USAF-owned visual display technology, and open-source software, the TPS flying qualities simulation laboratory can provide everything from complex demonstrations on variable stability platforms to unsupervised operation of almost unlimited aircraft types. It can also be linked with control rooms for test team training. This low-cost platform is revolutionizing <b>flying</b> qualities <b>instruction</b> at the USAF TPS and may be a valuable addition to other academic institutions. I...|$|R
50|$|The {{commanding}} officer of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School (USAF TPS) is known as its Commandant. The commandant manages the school which is a military unit that operates in a distinctly academic atmosphere. The position is usually held by a colonel selected by the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) commander although this authority may be delegated to {{the commander of the}} Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC). The commandant oversees all <b>flying</b> training, academic <b>instruction,</b> budgeting, and curriculum administration at the school. The commandant also chairs a board of officers that selects the school's students. The selection board consists of flight test squadron commanders with a majority of the board members being TPS graduates. Every three years, the commandant conducts a review of the school's curriculum with participation from flight test squadrons, the U.S. Naval TPS, and operational squadrons.|$|R
50|$|Though the Radio School was {{the primary}} World War II-era mission, it was not {{intended}} to be Scott's only mission. The Air Corps had also planned for Scott to become a major air terminal due to its centralized location in the United States. In 1940, a $1 million project began to construct four mile-long concrete runways. Though not fully completed until November 1942, the portions that were complete provided a capability to give advanced <b>flying</b> school graduates <b>instruction</b> in instrument and night flying, navigation, photography, and administrative flights. By late 1943, the Radio School students were in the air as well, practicing code transmission under actual flight conditions. Unfortunately, airfield operations had to be sharply curtailed in May 1944, after an accidental tool-spark set fire to Hangar 1—Scott's only hangar. Repairs were not completed until May 1945.|$|R
