40|$|Summary. Economic {{development}} requires {{knowledge in}} today’s knowledge-based economy. The achievement {{of economic development}} in one area depends directly on {{the efficiency of the}} attainment, accumulation and application of knowledge and information. These processes rely heavily on the involvement of human resources with technological knowledge and technical skills. Correspondingly, knowledge creation ability and the efficiency of knowledge creation and application determine <b>industrial</b> <b>clustering</b> and economic sustainability. Current surveys of industrial clusters in Taiwan have ascertained that clusters of traditional industries do not necessarily lead to innovation although, empirically, an industrial cluster is a prerequisite for innovative activity. Recent studies have addressed the effects of the spatial proximity among firms and advanced research institutes in the Hsinchu area. According to their results, <b>industrial</b> <b>clustering</b> positively influences innovation by technological companies. Based on available results, this study considers how interaction between technological communities and <b>industrial</b> <b>clustering</b> influence the innovative activities in a sample area. Additionally, this study analyses social networking within the technological community and the relationship to <b>industrial</b> <b>clustering</b> in the Hsinchu area.

Using theoretical insights from the resource-based view and density dependence theory, we demonstrate that both serial and non-serial innovator firms benefit from rising levels of <b>industrial</b> <b>clustering</b> {{in their efforts to}} internationalize; however, non-serial innovators experience decreasing returns with increasing levels of clustering. In addition, our analysis indicates that overall serial innovator firms benefit more from <b>industrial</b> <b>clustering</b> in terms of internationalization than non-serial innovator firms.
