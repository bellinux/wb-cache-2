40|$|Key words: {{ultrasonic}} linear motor; precision positioning; mechanical drift. Abstract: During {{the experiment}} of cell poking, it is {{required that the}} point of a probe is aimed at the cell {{with the help of a}} precision motion platform, and then, controlled by this motion platform, the tip of the probe pokes into the cell.

40|$|Electrical {{machines}} {{are subject to}} different types of failures. Early detection of the incipient faults and fast maintenance may prevent costly consequences. Fault diagnosis of wind turbine is especially important because they are situated at extremely high towers and therefore inaccessible. For offshore plants, bad weather can prevent any repair actions for several weeks. In {{some of the new}} wind turbines synchronous generators are used and directly connected to the grid without the need of power converters. Despite intensive research efforts directed at rotor fault diagnosis in induction machines, the research work pertinent to damper winding failure of synchronous machines is very limited. This dissertation is concerned with the in-depth study of damper winding failure and its traceable symptoms in different machine signals and parameters. First, a model of a synchronous machine with damper winding based on the winding function approach is presented. Next, simulation and experimental results are presented and discussed. A specially designed inside-out synchronous machine with a damper winding is employed for the experimental setup. Finally, a novel analytical method is developed to predict the behavior of the left sideband amplitude for different numbers and locations of the broken bars. This analysis is based on the magnetic field theory and the unbalanced multiphase circuits. It is found that due to the asymmetrical structure of damper winding, the left sideband component in the stator current spectrum of the synchronous machine during steady state asynchronous operation is not {{similar to that of the}} induction machine with broken bars. As a result, the motor current signature analysis (MCSA) for detection rotor failures in the induction machine is usable to detect broken damper bars in synchronous machines. However, a novel intelligent-systems based approach is developed that can identify the severity of the damper winding failure. This approach potentially can be used in a non-invasive condition monitoring system to monitor the deterioration of a synchronous <b>motor</b> <b>damper</b> winding as the number of broken bars increase over time.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a further {{investigation}} of the possibilities to utilize the permanent magnet synchronous machine technology in small scale pumped hydro power, as {{a continuation of the}} specialization project, fall 2014. The focus of this thesis is how the pumped storage plant will operate during four different fault situations. A theoretical survey is done to get {{a better understanding of how}} voltage and frequency deviations in the synchronous machines connected grid affect in generator operation. Available design criteria standards for synchronous generators are reviewed, and a summary of these are formed. The fault period during a short circuit of a synchronous machine has been set in focus, and the different torque contributions during and after the short circuit fault have been investigated. The simulation models are made in Matlab Simulink SimPowerSystems(MSPS), and the corresponding control circuits for each of the simulation cases are developed here. Both simulation models are established from existing blocks in the simulation program, one with an electrical machine equipped with rotor damper windings and one without. Each of the simulation cases are performed on both simulation models, and the results and conclusions follow each of the four cases. A full short circuit simulation case is done in both motor and generator operation. For generator operation the results show that the generator that is equipped with damper windings have a smaller rate of rise of the rotational speed increase during the fault, than the generator without the damper windings. The damper windings contributes with a speed reducing torque, which acts as an advantage in the generator mode of operation. For motor operation the same effect is seen, that the <b>motor</b> with <b>damper</b> windings has a larger speed reducing torque, and that the rotational speed has a steeper speed reduction during the fault than for the model without <b>damper</b> windings. In <b>motor</b> operation this effect leads to that the simulation model without damper windings is able to withstand a longer short circuit on the machine terminals, than the model with damper windings, because its speed deviation after the fault is smaller. In <b>motor</b> operation the <b>damper</b> windings speed reducing torque is considered as a disadvantage. For the simulation case during minor voltage and frequency variations, both of the simulation circuits are able to withstand the tested simulation case. This shows that the requirements for this simulation case are not the most demanding to meet with a permanent magnet synchronous machine. In the "fault-ride-through" test does none of the simulation circuits operate stable after the main test, with 85 % voltagedrop and a 0, 40 seconds time duration at the lowest voltage plateau. The FIKS requirements that are the background for this simulation case are considered more demanding to fulfill with a permanent magnet synchronous machine configuration. Since the simulation models consist of the electrical machine, connected directly to the grid, an insertion of passive elements as transmission lines or/and transformers between the grid and the electrical machine would add a damping effect to the system, and possibly better simulation results. The main conclusion is that damper winding are considered as a advantage both during three phase short circuit and after a fault in generator operation. In motor operation the result is more complex, where the damper winding contribute with a negative contribution during a three phase short circuit, and with a positive effect after a fault...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of power electronics, inverter-driven {{induction}} motor are finding increased use in industries because of applications that demand variable speed operations {{and because of the}} potential savings in energy usage. However, these drives sometimes produce unacceptably high levels in vibration and acoustic noise. A literature survey has revealed that while there has been intensive research on the design of inverters to minimize acoustic noise radiation from these drives, the vibro-acoustic behaviour of an induction motor structure has received relatively little attention. The primary objective of this research project, therefore, is to develop a general strategy/algorithm for estimating the acoustic noise radiated from inverter-driven induction motors. By using a three-phase, 2. 2 kW induction motor, the vibration modes due to various structural components (such as the rotor, the stator/casing, the endshields and the base plate) of the motor structure were analysed by experimental modal testing. Results indicate that the vibration modes due to the rotor are only important at low frequencies. It has been found that the power injection method gives more accurate measurement of the <b>damping</b> of a <b>motor</b> structure than the modal testing and the time decay methods. If a point force excitation is used, then it is more accurate to measure the sound radiation efficiency than the power conversion efficiency for motor structures. The effect of three different inverter designs (an ideal ‘almost sinusoidal’ controller and two commercially available PWM inverters) on the radiated acoustic power were assessed for both no-load and load conditions using sound intensity measurements conducted in an anechoic room. The results indicate that although the sound power level due to aerodynamic and mechanical noise increases at a rate of 12 dB per doubling of the motor speed, the electromagnetic noise dominates at low motor speeds and is still a significant noise source even at high motor speeds. For inverters with low switching frequencies, the radiated sound power level is almost 15 dB higher than the ideal case at low speeds and is relatively insensitive to the motor speed. For inverters that implement the random modulation technique, the change in the total sound power level with the level of the random modulation is very small but the tonal nature of the noise is greatly reduced. The vibration behaviour of a motor structure was modeled using the finite element method (FEM) and validated using the experimental modal testing results. It has been found that it is essential to model the laminated stator as an orthotropic structure. While the details of other structural components (such as the endshields, the teeth in the stator and the windings) are not so important, it is essential that they are incorporated into the structural model as simplified structures to account for their mass, stiffness and boundary conditions imposed on the motor structure. Based on this structural model, the radiated acoustic power for various operating conditions has been predicated using the boundary element (BEM) and the electromagnetic force calculated from an electromagnetic finite element model. The predicted results agree reasonably well with experimental measurements. Despite the success of the FEM/BEM approaches, they can be prohibitively expensive (in terms of computer resources required) to apply to large motors and high frequencies. Thus the feasibility of using a statistical method, namely, the statistical energy analysis (SEA), to estimate the radiated acoustic sound power from an inverter-driven induction motor has been examined. In order to carry out this analysis, analytical expressions for calculating the natural frequencies and radiation efficiency of finite length circular cylindrical shells (which are simplified models of the stator and casing of a motor structure) were firstly derived. The internal loss factors and coupling loss factors of the motor structure were determined experimentally using the power injection method. Then by introducing an equivalent surface mobility of circular cylindrical shells for the electromagnetic force, the vibration response and the acoustic noise radiated from each part of the motor structure were estimated. Results indicate that SEA method is potentially an efficient and effective tool in estimating the noise radiated from inverter-driven induction motors...|$|R
40|$|The master {{thesis is}} a further {{investigation}} of the start-up procedure of a permanent magnet synchronous motor operated by variable frequency drive without position feedback via a long cable and transformers; as proposed in the specialization project, fall of 2013. The challenge is how to avoid large saturation in the transformers and motor while achieving the maximum possible starting torque with high cable resistance. In order to model and simulate the electrical system, the simulation software Simulink is used. A theoretical review is conducted {{in order to understand}} how to model system components, and how to start-up a permanent magnet synchronous motor while avoiding saturation in the transformer. Using the attained theoretical background, two permanent magnet synchronous motor Simulink models (with and without damper windings), an accurate pump load Simulink model, and three scalar control schemes which includes transmission system components for their control algorithms have been produced. In addition, a vector control scheme using field oriented control and extended Kalman filter for position estimation has been evaluated. A study case comprising of a permanent magnet synchronous motor operated by a variable frequency drive without position feedback via a long cable and transformers has been defined. The purpose of the study case is to study the defined control schemes, the permanent magnet synchronous motor's start-up procedure, and the electrical system's steady state behaviour. This include investigation of input parameter effects on the start-up procedure. The simulation results using the implemented pump load Simulink model shows that accurate load modelling affects the start-up procedure, as additional torque is required due to more rotational friction components. The simulation results of the study case show that the three proposed scalar control methods all are able to start-up the motor successfully, regardless of the initial rotor position. However, stability is not guaranteed at certain speed ranges due to the rise of small system disturbances. It has been shown that stability all through out the entire applied frequency range can be guaranteed by adding damping to the system. This is can be done by either adding transmission system components, <b>motor</b> <b>damper</b> windings, or a stabilization loop via frequency modulation. has been shown that cable length and applied frequency determines the accuracy of the transmission system voltage drop compensation algorithms of the proposed scalar control schemes. Increase in applied frequency and cable length increases the inaccuracy of the voltage drop compensation algorithms due to the ignored cable capacitance. Assuming that the maximum allowed voltage deviation from the required motor voltage during steady state is 0. 1 pu, the longest cable length that can be used with the proposed scalar control schemes is 40 km. An exception is the open-loop scalar control scheme using constant voltage boosting, which can be used for cable lengths up to 20 km, due to its inaccurate calculation assumptions. Additionally, {{it has been shown that}} the breakaway torque and the reference frequency ramp slope used by the controllers directly affect the torque oscillations during start-up. Additional torque oscillations can be experienced if the breakaway torque is too high or if the reference frequency ramp slope is too low due to the lack of torque build up, which consequently makes the start-up time higher. The vector controller gave the best performance during load step tests due to its precise control of the rotor field. However, due to the requirement of rotor position feedback, position estimation is required. The investigated position estimation technique, extended Kalman filter is able to estimated speed and position with very little error. However, the initial rotor position is required by the extended Kalman filter algorithm in order to predict states properly. Simulation results show that the vector control scheme offers the lowest possible start time due to its high performance. However, due to the requirement of initial rotor position of the sensorless vector controller, it can not be used during start-up, due to inaccuracies of predicting rotor position at zero speed. This leaves either the partial and delayed open-loop scalar control scheme or the closed-loop scalar control scheme to be the most viable start-up control schemes; as both control schemes offer comparably low start-up times, start-up currents and voltage boosting; which will consequently affect the dimensioning of the transformer. The vector controller can then be implemented after the start-up procedure using the selected scalar control scheme, in order to obtain the optimal controller performance. </p...|$|R
