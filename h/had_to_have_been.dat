5|$|Although other {{contemporary}} vessels {{like the}} American North Carolina-class battleships carried 40.6cm main guns, the Bismarcks used 38-cm naval guns as the Germans had experience with them; a 40.6cm weapon would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> designed from scratch. Bismarck was also authorized {{prior to the}} breakdown of the London Naval Treaty and the invocation of the 45,000-ton, 406mm main gun escalator clause (which the United States did invoke with the North Carolinas); building 40.6cm battleships would doubtless have seemed provocative, especially to the United Kingdom. As it was, the 38cm main battery of the Bismarck class compared well to their contemporaries, out-ranging most of the 38cm and 40.6cm guns of contemporary navies (with the exception of the Italian 38.1cm and French 38cm guns, of which the Italian gun suffered from exceptional bore erosion and the French gun from unusually poor accuracy).|$|E
5|$|Leutnants Rüdenberg and Bellen had {{returned}} to base, as had {{the rest of the}} Jasta 10 pilots. The only one with news was Heldmann, who reported Voss headed toward British lines while pursued by a British SE.5. Timm and Rueser waited anxiously for his return as the sun set. The fact that Voss was missing in action was communicated to wing headquarters; telephone queries were made of all friendly airfields within range. Late that night, a German frontline unit reported seeing six British machines shoot down a lone German aircraft that fell within the British trenches. Heldmann refused to believe Voss was killed in aerial combat; he claimed Voss <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot after crawling from the wreckage.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1954, a {{conversion}} {{proposal for the}} South Dakota-class ships was ordered by the Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board. The request was made for the ships' speed to be increased to at least 31 knots. To do so, the design staff decided to remove the after turret and use the weight and space gained to install either a set of improved steam turbines or a set of gas turbines. Either system would have to produce at least 256,000shaft horsepower (190 MW)—the minimum requirement to achieve 31knots on the South Dakota hull. Unfortunately, this would have necessitated alterations to the hull form, particularly {{in the rear of}} the ship. Larger propellers were also required, and all four shafts would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completely rebuilt to accommodate the changes. Estimates for the project ran as high as $40,000,000 per ship, and this did not include the cost of reactivating the ship and upgrades to its electrical and combat systems. As a result, the conversion program was halted.|$|E

5|$|The rugby {{competition}} {{took place}} in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium. The original plan was to stage the rugby matches at the São Januário Stadium. However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project. The Organising Committee considered Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shared with the athletics competitions. It was later announced that the rugby competition will take place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared with the modern pentathlon. In April 2016 concerns were raised by the World Rugby head of competitions and performance, Mark Egan, about progress of construction at the temporary 15,000-seater stadium.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the film}} was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations {{included}} the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Sirkeci railway station which also {{was used for the}} Belgrade and Zagreb railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at Pinewood Studios with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were shot in Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were shot in Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent {{of the film}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. The Gypsy camp was also to be filmed in an actual camp in Topkapi, but was actually shot in a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was shot in Spain, as Britain did not allow filming with wild rats, and an attempt filming white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers.|$|E
25|$|The Territorial Force War Medal {{was only}} awarded {{soldiers}} in the Territorial Force.

25|$|The {{period of}} {{reckoned}} service required {{to qualify for}} the award was ten years, of which at least five years of actual service <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in an Auxiliary or Volunteer Air Force of the United Kingdom or the Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates, India or Burma. The award could also be made to any Princes or Princesses of the Blood Royal.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} {{period of service}} was twenty years and the medal could be awarded upon the recommendation by an individual's present or, if retired, former commanding officer. Service <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> consecutive, with allowance being made for special circumstances. Officer recipients who were subsequently awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration would have to surrender the medal.|$|E

25|$|The {{qualifying}} {{period of service}} was also twenty years, except in India, where it was eighteen years.

25|$|The {{decoration}} {{could be}} awarded to part-time Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officers after {{twenty years of}} commissioned service, not necessarily continuous, as an efficient and thoroughly capable officer. Wartime service counted as double time, while half of the time served as a rating or in the ranks could be reckoned as qualifying service for the decoration. In any event, a minimum of seven years <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in any capacity before becoming eligible for the award of the decoration.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the Cowboys {{launched}} their official Hall of Fame during their 20th anniversary celebrations.

50|$|After the {{decision}} not to develop the independent ZIRCON, the possibility of cooperating with France on space-based intelligence was considered by the Cabinet, along with other discussions with France about co-developing an air-launched nuclear missile.

25|$|The {{duration}} of the Second World War in Europe was from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, while in the Pacific Theatre it continued until 2 September 1945. The War Medal 1939–1945 was instituted by the United Kingdom on 16 August 1945 and was awarded to all full-time personnel {{of the armed forces}} and merchant marines for serving for 28 days, irrespective of where they were serving, between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945 inclusive, the full {{duration of}} the Second World War. In the Merchant Navy, the 28 days <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> served anywhere at sea.|$|E
25|$|A Barony was {{an area of}} land, {{not always}} contiguous, granted by the Crown to a Tenant. Baronies became a unit in {{administration}} and law, however the actual size was variable and they merged or separated from time to time. The holder or Baron had power to hold courts which dealt with civil and criminal cases of less than major importance. Some crimes were reserved for royal courts, namely murder, rape, robbery with violence, fire raising and treason. To come {{under the jurisdiction of}} a baronial court, the crime <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> committed within the barony or concerned its people or property.|$|E
25|$|Justice Douglas {{asserted}} {{that there should}} be no distinction made between prospective relief and retrospective relief, as the drain on the state's treasury is the same in either case. He also strongly contended that Illinois had waived its immunity by entering the federal program, because the Court had recently found other states to have waived immunity by joining similar programs. Therefore, Douglas reasoned that Illinois <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aware of the possibility that entering the program would waive its own immunity, and its decision to participate in light of that danger showed a willingness to be held liable.|$|E
50|$|First Trick Clubs: This rule is {{borrowed}} {{from a common}} variation of Hearts rules. Whoever possesses the lowest Club, usually 2, 3 (if deuces are high), must open the play.

50|$|During {{the later}} {{years of his}} reign, Hadrian {{actually}} governed the empire from the villa. Hadrian started using the villa as his official residence around AD 128.

25|$|Literary sources {{offer no}} {{evidence}} for Bernward's construction work on the cathedral. If the doors were located {{in the western part}} of the building, they would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> moved pretty soon after, since the cathedral was drastically altered by his successors Gotthard, Azelin and Hezilo. A later period of drastic reconstruction of the western part of the building occurred in 1842-50. Later, the westwork was largely rebuilt after taking severe damage in an air raid during the Second World War. The modern plan of Wilhelm Fricke (which is not uncontroversial) is not based on the alleged layout of Bernward's time, but on the westwork of Minden Cathedral and the alleged appearance of Hildesheim cathedral's westwork under Bishop Hezilo (1054–61).|$|E
25|$|However, {{this claim}} has been challenged. Any order to assassinate Wilson would have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> relayed {{to them by}} Rory O'Connor (then in charge of British IRA operations) and the last {{assassination}} attempt contrived against Wilson had been set to be executed in 1921, not 1922. Coogan has suggested that Reginald Dunne, who had the confidence of both Michael Collins and Rory O'Connor, undertook the shooting as a last-ditch effort to provoke the British Government into retaliating, thereby uniting {{both sides of the}} Nationalists. Hart believes the assassins “acted alone in the (grossly mistaken) belief that Wilson was responsible for Catholic deaths in Belfast”. The killers had only decided to attack the previous evening, and even on the day Sullivan had been at work until 1pm; the killers had no getaway plan.|$|E
