5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss <b>die-casting</b> machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E

A third factory was opened in 2007 to include high pressure <b>die-casting</b> and machining, and Triumph announced that they were expanding to increase capacity to over 130,000 motorcycles. Triumph Motorcycles (Thailand) Limited is a 100% UK owned company and now employs about 1000 staff.|$|E

25|$|One {{day while}} visiting the C. E. Lipe Machine Shop, where the H. H. Franklin Manufacturing Company <b>die-casting</b> {{business}} was located, {{a member of}} the group introduced Wilkinson to Herbert H. Franklin, who took a ride in Wilkinson's second prototype. Franklin was impressed and discussed the idea with Alexander T. Brown, {{one of the members of}} the New York Automobile Club. Between them it was agreed that Wilkinson should drop all previous experiments and start anew. Brown and Franklin invested $1,100 so that Wilkinson could build a third prototype, which went on to become Franklin's first production model.|$|E
500|$|Injection {{moulding}} BrE or Injection molding AmE, is {{a manufacturing}} process for producing parts by injecting material into a mould. Injection moulding {{can be performed}} {{with a host of}} materials mainly including metals, (for which the process is called <b>die-casting),</b> glasses, elastomers, confections, and most commonly thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Material for the part is fed into a heated barrel, mixed, and forced into a mould cavity, where it cools and hardens to the configuration of the cavity. After a product is designed, usually by an industrial designer or an engineer, moulds are made by a mould-maker (or toolmaker) from metal, usually either steel or aluminium, and precision-machined to form the features of the desired part. Injection moulding is widely used for manufacturing a variety of parts, from the smallest components to entire body panels of cars. [...] Advances in 3D printing technology, using photopolymers which do not melt during the injection moulding of some lower temperature thermoplastics, can be used for some simple injection moulds.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”Scatter {{behavior}} of fatigue life in <b>die-cast</b> AM 60 B alloy was investigated. For comparison, those in rolled AM 60 B alloy and <b>die-cast</b> A 365 -T 5 aluminum alloy were also studied. Scatter {{behavior of}} pore size was also investigated to discuss dominant factors for fatigue life scatter in <b>die-cast</b> materials. Three-parameter Weibull function was suitable {{to explain the}} scatter behavior of both fatigue life and pore size. The scatter of fatigue life in <b>die-cast</b> AM 60 B alloy was almost comparable to that in <b>die-cast</b> A 365 -T 5 alloy, while it was significantly large compared {{to that in the}} rolled AM 60 B alloy. Scatter behavior of pore size observed at fracture nucleation site on the fracture surface was comparable to that observed on the specimen cross-section and also to that of fatigue life. Therefore, the dominant factor for large scatter of fatigue life in <b>die-cast</b> alloys would be the large scatter of pore size. This speculation was confirmed by the fracture mechanics fatigue life prediction, where the pore observed at fatigue crack nucleation site was assumed as the pre-existing crack...|$|R
