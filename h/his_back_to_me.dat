Hitler turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{went to the window}} and started drumming his fingers on the pane [...] Still, I went on, voicing our complaints. Hitler suddenly turned around, went to a small table from which he took a water glass and furiously smashed it on the floor. In the face of such diplomatic behavior, I had to consider my mission terminated".|$|E
2500|$|Priapus is also {{mentioned}} in Vladimir Nabokov's Invitation to a Beheading: [...] "Or when you, with eyes closed tight, devouring a spurting peach and then, having finished, but still swallowing, with your mouth still full, you cannibal, your glazed eyes wandered, your fingers were spread, your inflamed lips were all glossy, your chin trembled, all covered with drops of the cloudy juice, which trickled down onto your bared bosom, while the Priapus who had nourished you suddenly, with a convulsive oath, turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> who {{had entered the}} room at the wrong moment." ...|$|E
60|$|Holmes {{was sitting}} with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I had given him no sign of my occupation.|$|E
6000|$|His vanity {{suddenly}} {{took the}} alarm--I was leading him rather too undisguisedly. He handed <b>his</b> book <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "You will find," [...] he said loftily, [...] "that I {{have put it}} all down there." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{turned to}} the mantelshelf, and filled his pipe with <b>his</b> broad <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "you---- You'll be {{interested}} in the war. I hope---- I hope you'll have a good time there...." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{pushed out}} of the brake after him, and was {{astonished}} to find him swinging cheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers that looped down from the foliage overhead. <b>His</b> <b>back</b> was <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am hurt," [...] {{said the}} voice, and I descended into the lane forthwith, and so came upon Melmount sitting near the ditch with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|On {{returning}} {{to my side}} of the table, I expected to see him resume his writing. He crossed the room to the window and stood (with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me)</b> looking out.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had cleared}} the platter, {{he got out}} a single pipeful of tobacco, {{just as in the}} morning, turned round a stool into the chimney corner, and sat awhile smoking, with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I tell you, James,' said Bedford, {{contracting}} {{his brows}} till they almost met ever his arched nose, 'I tell you, <b>his</b> look brings <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> my mother's, {{the last time}} she greeted my father!' ...|$|R
50|$|His {{returned}} to blues music with High & Lonesome (1995), an early success for St. George Records, an independent record label. His energetic style, accompanied by Studebaker John, belied <b>his</b> years. Come <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> Baby (1996), with featured sidemen John Primer, Willie Kent and Jake Dawson (guitarist), was also well received.|$|R
60|$|He almost {{snatched}} the letter {{out of my}} hand; he turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> on <b>me</b> <b>to</b> read it {{by the light of}} the moon. The letter was short enough to be soon read. I could have repeated it at the time. I can repeat it now.|$|R
60|$|The man was far {{too busy}} to pay any {{attention}} to me. He was kneeling in a corner with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> putting something in his bag. I seized the opportunity to steal softly from the room.|$|E
60|$|Arthur was {{standing}} with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> talking to Isobel. Certainly her welcome was flattering enough. I realized with a sudden gravity that I had not heard her laugh like this since {{she had been in}} England. Arthur continued talking in a low, earnest tone.|$|E
60|$|When we were alone, {{there was}} but one course to take; I made my confession. It is {{impossible}} {{to tell you how}} my father received it--for he sat down at his library table with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The first thing he did was to ask me to help his memory.|$|E
500|$|After an {{excellent}} domestic season for Somerset, including 184 in a 40-over match against Gloucestershire (his highest List A score), Trescothick released <b>his</b> autobiography, Coming <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me,</b> on 1 September 2008, {{explaining that he}} had suffered from anxiety attacks {{since the age of}} 10, and that playing domestic cricket meant that, at all times, he was only ever three hours away from his family. He said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There--you {{see it is}} real. The villagers {{thought the}} brass balls were magic stuff and as {{perishable}} as smoke. They were afraid to touch them. You are a curious lot--your race. But come along; I have business. I will put you to bed." [...] Said and done. Then he was gone; but <b>his</b> voice came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> through the rain and darkness saying, [...] "Yes, tell Seppi, but no other." ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} motion-masters I ever beheld, sweeping through his green bath in harmonious curves, now turning <b>his</b> black glistening <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> now exhibiting <b>his</b> fair white chest, in every movement active and graceful, turned out to be our old homely friend the flounder, whom we have all gobbled up out of his bath of water souchy at Greenwich, without having the slightest idea that he was a beauty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harry, [...] "I'm open {{to make a}} {{guess at}} him. Just as the {{schooner}} went about that night I had {{a look at her}} helmsman. He had <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but it was moonlight, and I could see that one shoulder hunched up in a kind of curious manner." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{schoolmaster}} {{was sitting}} at his high desk, with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> apparently haranguing the pupils, who were all gathered together in front of him, with one exception. The one exception was a sturdy white-headed boy, standing apart from all the rest on a stool in a corner--a forlorn little Crusoe, isolated in his own desert island of solitary penal disgrace.|$|E
6000|$|He {{conducted}} me cautiously and tenderly up the stairs, {{lighting the}} way and protecting me with friendly warnings, then {{pushed the door open}} and bowed me in and went his way, mumbling hearty things about my wonderful eye for points of a dog. Mr. Daly was writing and had <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He glanced over his shoulder presently, then jumped up and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|I have safely arrived here, {{just in time}} to add a line to that effect, and {{get this}} off by to-morrow's English mail from New York. Catarrh rather better. Everything triumphant last night, except no sleep again. I suppose Dolby to be now on <b>his</b> way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> join <b>me</b> here. I am much mistaken if the {{political}} crisis do not damage the farewells by almost one half.|$|R
6000|$|... "This was the way. I was out by myself--all alone, mind--among the cliffs, {{looking for}} eggs; but I had my spear with me, {{the big one}} that Cheenbuk made for me just before {{he went off to}} the Whale River. Well, just as I was going to turn round one of the cliffs, I caught sight of a walrus--a big one--monstrous; like that," [...] he said, drawing an {{imaginary}} circle with both arms, [...] "fat, brown, huge tusks, and wide awake! I knew that, because <b>his</b> <b>back</b> was <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and he was turning his head about, looking at something in the other direction. I was astonished, for though they climb up on the cliffs a good height to sun themselves on the warm rocks, I had never seen one climb so high as that.|$|R
5000|$|... "Some Memories Just Won't Die" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bobby Lee Springfield, and {{recorded}} by American country music artist Marty Robbins. It was released in April 1982 as the first single from <b>his</b> album Come <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me.</b> The song reached #10 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and #1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada. [...] On June 6, 1983, at the 17th annual Music City News Country Awards in Nashville, the song was named [...] "Single of the Year" [...] for 1982, giving Robbins a posthumous honor.|$|R
60|$|I laughed, and as Bartot was {{compelled}} to turn <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to regain his seat, this time {{at the table with}} his companion, I raised my glass, looking her full in the face, and drank. Then I slipped the note from underneath the wine card into my pocket. She made the slightest of signs, but I understood. I was not to read it until I was alone.|$|E
60|$|And, besides, {{there were}} the scares. On the second day out, for instance, coming off the deck in the {{afternoon}} (I had straw slippers on my bare feet) I stopped at the open pantry door {{and spoke to the}} steward. He was doing something there with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> At the sound of my voice he nearly jumped out of his skin, as the saying is, and incidentally broke a cup.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, las' Monday I 'uz pass'n by one o' dem {{places in}} fourth street whah deh sticks up runaway nigger bills, en he'ps to ketch 'em, en I seed my marster! I 'mos' flopped down on de groun', I felt so gone. He had <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> en 'uz talkin' to de man en givin' him some bills--nigger bills, I reckon, en I's de nigger. He's offerin' a reward--dat's it. Ain't I right, don't you reckon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|As he talked, the {{tones of}} his {{resonant}} voice, {{the motions of}} his hands, the poise of <b>his</b> head, brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a boyish feeling of subordination. I laughed, but I submitted to his domination, entirely willing that he should play {{the part of the}} commander for the last time. It was amusing, but it had its pathetic side for my mother's silence was significant of her weakness. She said nothing--not a word, but with Zulime sitting beside her, she was content, so happy she could not find words in which to express her satisfaction. Her waiting was at an end! ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was waiting}} for us, in fact, at the public-house; and asked me how I found myself, like an old acquaintance. I did not feel, at first, that I knew him {{as well as he}} knew me, because he had never come to our house since the night I was born, and {{naturally}} he had the advantage of me. But our intimacy was much advanced by his taking <b>me</b> on <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> carry <b>me</b> home. He was, now, a huge, strong fellow of six feet high, broad in proportion, and round-shouldered; but with a simpering boy's face and curly light hair that gave him quite a sheepish look. He was dressed in a canvas jacket, and a pair of such very stiff trousers that they would have stood quite as well alone, without any legs in them. And you couldn't so properly have said he wore a hat, as that he was covered in a-top, like an old building, with something pitchy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{on our own}} heads. Boy, {{never be}} so foolish as to trust a long shot. It makes a great smoke and some noise, but it's a terrible {{uncertain}} manner of throwing old iron about. In such a business as this, I would sooner trust Tom Coffin and <b>his</b> harpoon <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>me,</b> than the best broadside that ever rattled out of the three decks of a ninety-gun ship. Come, gather your limbs together, and try if you can walk on terra firma, Master Coffin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop here," [...] said I; [...] "you {{are safe}} here"; and I started off at once for the Spotted Dog, for I knew the {{landlord}} had {{a horse and}} dog cart. I ran, for I perceived {{that in a moment}} everyone upon this side of the hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware {{of what was going on}} behind his house. A man stood with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> talking to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} what you are saying," [...] {{returned}} my lord, putting on his hat and turning <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "It is a strange thing you should take a pleasure to annoy me. A friend - but that is a different affair. It is a strange thing. I am a man that has had ill-fortune all my life through. I am still surrounded by contrivances. I am always treading in plots," [...] he burst out. [...] "The whole world is banded against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Timothy?" [...] said he at once. He thinks Timothy {{was a real}} boy, and is very {{jealous of}} him. He turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and stood alone and wept passionately, while I waited for him. You may be sure I begged his pardon, and made it all right with him, and had him {{laughing}} and happy again before I let him go. But nevertheless what I said was true. David is not my boy, and he will forget. But Timothy would have remembered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} do," [...] said Lady Ongar. [...] "He has {{told me that you}} do, and what he says is always true. It was here, on this spot, that I gave him <b>back</b> <b>his</b> troth <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and told him that I would have none of his love, because he was poor. That is barely two years ago. Now he is poor no longer. Now, had I been true to him, a {{marriage}} with him would have been, in a prudential point of view, all that any woman could desire. I gave up the dearest heart, the sweetest temper, ay, and the truest man that, that-- Well, you have won him instead, and he has been the gainer. I doubt whether I ever should have made him happy, but I know that you will do so. It was just here that I parted from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When Lord Avon {{had left}} him, the captain {{remained}} {{for some time}} in a kneeling attitude, with his face sunk upon a chair. Then he rose, and paced slowly {{up and down the}} room, his chin sunk upon his breast. Every now and then he would pluck at his hair, or shake his clenched hands in the air; and I saw the moisture glisten upon his brow. For a time I lost sight of him, and I heard him opening drawer after drawer, as though he were in search of something. Then he stood over by his dressing-table again, with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>His</b> head was thrown a little back, and he had both hands up to the collar of his shirt, as though he were striving to undo it. And then there was a gush as if a ewer had been upset, and down he sank upon the ground, with his head in the corner, twisted round at so strange an angle to his shoulders that one glimpse of it told me that my man was slipping swiftly from the clutch in which I had fancied that I held him. I slid my panel, and was in the room in an instant. His eyelids still quivered, and it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as my gaze met his glazing eyes, that I could read both recognition and surprise in them. I laid my knife upon the floor, and I stretched myself out beside him, that I might whisper in his ear one or two little things of which I wished to remind him; but even as I did so, he gave a gasp and was gone.|$|R
6000|$|But I {{will not}} weary you {{with more of}} my {{experiences}} that day and the next. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the operation; at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. The doctors were coming at eleven, and I did not get up. It seemed scarce worth while to trouble about washing and dressing, and though I read my newspapers and the letters that came by the first post, I did not find them very interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison, my old school-friend, calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer's error in my new book, with one from Langridge venting some vexation over Minton. The rest were business communications. I breakfasted in bed. The glow of pain at my side seemed more massive. I knew it was pain, and yet, if you can understand, I did not find it very painful. I had been awake and hot and thirsty in the night, but in the morning bed felt comfortable. In the night-time I had lain thinking {{of things that were}} past; in the morning I dozed over the question of immortality. Haddon came, punctual to the minute, with a neat black bag; and Mowbray soon followed. Their arrival stirred me up a little. I began to take a more personal interest in the proceedings. Haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside, and, with <b>his</b> broad <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> began taking things out of his bag. I heard the light click of steel upon steel. My imagination, I found, was not altogether stagnant. [...] "Will you hurt me much?" [...] I said in an off-hand tone.|$|R
