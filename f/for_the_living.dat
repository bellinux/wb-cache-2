5|$|Moira {{explains}} {{that while some}} ghosts in the house only wish <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> to suffer the same fates they did, other ghosts are innocent and {{do not wish to}} see any more bloodshed. The Harmons realize the house is a danger to those living in it and resolve to protect future residents by scaring them away. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, a new family that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|E
5|$|In October 1918, with victory near, Downes {{was confronted}} by his most serious medical crisis. Damascus {{contained}} over 3,000 sick and wounded Turkish soldiers, {{many of them in}} appalling condition. Downes appointed the DADMS of the Australian Mounted Division, Major W. Evans, as Principal Medical Officer of Damascus, and gave him orders to organise the medical arrangements, bury the dead and provide care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>living.</b> The task was made more difficult by the poor communications and transport shortages, which hampered the delivery of supplies and evacuation of the hospitals; by shortages of medical units; and by the actions of Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence, who was more concerned with establishing the political authority of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca over Damascus. At this point the Desert Mounted Corps itself began to experience epidemic diseases, particularly of bronchopneumonia, cholera and malaria, putting the medical services under enormous pressure. Through extraordinary measures, including the diversion of lighthorsemen and motor vehicles to medical units, Downes managed to evacuate the sick to Beirut, and the crisis abated.|$|E
5|$|The {{capybara}} and {{the lesser}} capybara {{belong to the}} subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae. Paleontological classifications have yet to incorporate this new taxonomy and continue to use Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also {{in a state of}} flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense.|$|E

25|$|However, this oft-quoted saying of Tetzel was by {{no means}} {{representative}} of contemporary Catholic teaching on indulgences, but rather a reflection of Tetzel's capacity to exaggerate.

25|$|Moose are an old genus. Like its relatives, Odocoileus and Capreolus, {{the genus}} Alces {{gave rise to}} very few species that endured {{for long periods of}} time. This differs from the Megacerines, such as the Irish elk, which evolved many species before going extinct. Some scientists, such as Adrian Lister, grouped all the species into one genus, while others, such as Augusto Azzaroli, used Alces <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> species, placing the fossil species into the genera Cervalces and Libralces.|$|E
25|$|The djed pillar {{was often}} used as amulets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and the dead.

The Egyptian Book of the Dead lists a spell which when spoken over a gold amulet hung around the mummy's neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and be able to sit up. It was also painted onto coffins.|$|E
