25|$|However, if no {{possible}} arrangement of ground conditions {{leads to the}} port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (it just is not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not think of splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E
25|$|When the Old Scots Navy {{merged with}} Royal Navy {{there was some}} dispute over the {{seniority}} of the Scottish captains. It was finally agreed that their time would count from when they received their commissions as captains from Queen Anne. This meant that four years at sea did not count and the dispute continued for some time. The Scottish vessels were renamed Edinburgh and Glasgow since the Royal Navy already had vessels named Royal William and Royal Mary. Ships under these names still operate in the Royal Navy today. A third Royal Scots Navy ship was allowed to retain her name of Dumbarton Castle. Their absorption into the English navy was unpopular with many Scots seamen. One hundred of Gordon's men mutinied at Leith having got it into their heads {{that they would be}} sent to the West Indies or elsewhere outside of home waters. They were used to serving in Scottish and continental waters and <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not relish service abroad.|$|E
