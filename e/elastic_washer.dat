40|$|The paper proposes {{additionally}} {{to transmit}} bidimensional periodic circulation motion to a blanket {{occurring in the}} sawing plane surface with the purpose to intensify the sawing process of diamond mono-crystals with simultaneous quality improvement of sawed semi-finished products. An industrial sawing section modernization of the лелЪ- 2 -machine tool {{has been carried out}} in accordance with the above-mentioned approach. The purpose of the paper is an experimental determination of force value which is exerted on <b>elastic</b> <b>washer</b> by boom support screws in relation to conditions and excitation mode of a vibrating system of the modernized sawing section. The obtained data make it possible to determine optimal excitation parameters of forced vibrations. </p...|$|E

Ten healthy, castrated, Makoyee sheep with no previous history of gastrointestinal dysfunction were chosen. The surgical technique was performed in two stages. In the first, a 5 -cm vertical incision {{was made in the}} mid paralumbar fossa. The incision was continued through the subcutaneous. Then the muscular layers of the abdominal wall were divided in the grid technique. The dorso- lateral portion of the dorsal sac of rumen was anchored to the skin by application of four interrupted horizontal mattress suture at 4 points circumferentially using No. 1 silk. In the second, the exposed rumenal wall was incised longitudinally at the mid part of the stay sutures. A rubber-sheep cannula was inserted into the opening and then fixed with an external <b>elastic</b> <b>washer.</b> To augment the cannula stability, the inner flange was also reinforced with a tough rubber washer. All the sheep had normal behavior and appetite during the experiment. In the follow up period no local inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tissue flap necrosis, wound dehiscence; and suture abscess encountered in the surgical site. Neither evidences of anorexia, toxemia, septicemia and peritonitis were detected. No sign of intra peritoneal infection was observed on inspection of carcasses. The sheep did not lose weight significantly and the cannulas remained permanent fixed in position in 9 cases. This modified ruminal cannulation technique could be considered as a useful alternative with less failure and no more adverse consequences. Furthermore, the technique might be recommended to veterinary scientists who deal with experimental studies on sheep nutrition and husbandry. ]]...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{three-dimensional}} model was proposed {{to analyze the}} response of bolted composite joints with and without lateral clamping forces from initial loading to ultimate failure. The effects of the clamping force, bolt stiffness, washer size on the response and failure of the joints were the major concern of the study. The model consists of a progressive failure analysis and a finite element stress analysis. For a given stress state in a joint, the progressive failure analysis predicts damage accumulated in composites {{by a set of}} failure criteria and estimates associated material degradation based on predicted modes of failure. To account for three-dimensional bearing damage in joints, the model assumed that the material suffering from bearing damage became incompressible under lateral bolt constraints provided by the washers. In the stress analysis, the commercial finite element code ABAQUS was adopted to provide three-dimensional stresses and strains which are needed for the pro-gressive failure analysis. A 3 -D composite brick element was used, and slip/friction/ contact conditions were applied between the elastic bolt and a composite plate, and between the composite plate and the <b>elastic</b> <b>washers</b> or side plates. In order to rein-force the incompressibility condition for bearing-damaged material, the condition was imposed through a penalty method in the framework of finite element analyses. The proposed model was implemented in a code, namely 3 DBOLT, in order to interface with the ABAQUS code. The code provides a user-friendly input deck, automatically generates a joint mesh, and produces output and graphics for displaying the stresses, strains, and deformations of the joints and for simulating the failure progression in joints during loading...|$|R
