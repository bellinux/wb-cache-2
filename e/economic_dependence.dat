5|$|Saint and Dayuma, in {{conjunction}} with SIL, negotiated {{the creation of an}} official Huaorani reservation in 1969, consolidating the Huaorani and consequently opening up the area to commerce and oil exploration. By 1973, over 500 people lived in Tihueno, of which more than half had arrived in the previous six years. The settlement relied on aid from SIL, and as a Christian community, followed rules foreign to Huaorani culture like prohibitions on killing and polygamy. By the early 1970s, SIL began to question whether their impact on the Huaorani was positive, so they sent James Yost, a staff anthropologist, to assess the situation. He found extensive <b>economic</b> <b>dependence</b> and increasing cultural assimilation, and as a result, SIL ended its support of the settlement in 1976, leading to its disintegration and the dispersion of the Huaorani into the surrounding area. SIL had hoped that the Huaorani would return to the isolation in which they had lived twenty years prior, but instead they sought out contact with the outside world, forming villages of which many have been recognized by the Ecuadorian government.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{increasing}} role on {{the world}} stage strained his relationship with the USSR, now under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. Asserting Cuba's independence, Castro refused to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, declaring it a Soviet-U.S. attempt to dominate the Third World. Diverting from Soviet Marxist doctrine, he suggested that Cuban society could evolve straight to pure communism rather than gradually progress through various stages of socialism. In turn, the Soviet-loyalist Aníbal Escalante began organizing a government network of opposition to Castro, though in January 1968, he and his supporters were arrested for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow. However, recognising Cuba's <b>economic</b> <b>dependence</b> on the Soviets, Castro relented to Brezhnev's pressure to be obedient, and in August 1968 he denounced the leaders of the Prague Spring and praised the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Influenced by China's Great Leap Forward, in 1968 Castro proclaimed a Great Revolutionary Offensive, closing all remaining privately owned shops and businesses and denouncing their owners as capitalist counter-revolutionaries. The severe lack of consumer goods for purchase led productivity to decline, as large sectors of the population felt little incentive to work hard. This was exacerbated by the perception that a revolutionary elite had emerged consisting of those connected to the administration; they had access to better housing, private transportation, servants, and the ability to purchase luxury goods abroad.|$|E

40|$|A {{new methods}} of {{selecting}} efficient project portfolios {{in the presence of}} hybrid uncertainty has been presented. Pareto optimal solutions have been defined by an algorithm for generating project portfolios. The method presented allows us to select efficient project portfolios taking into account statistical and economic dependencies between projects when some of the parameters used in the calculation of effectiveness can be expressed {{in the form of an}} interactive possibility distribution and some in the form of a probability distribution. The procedure for processing such hybrid data combines stochastic simulation with nonlinear programming. The interaction between data are modeled by correlation matrices and the interval regression. <b>Economic</b> <b>dependences</b> are taken into account by the equations balancing the production capacity of the company. The practical example presented indicates that an interaction between projects has a significant impact on the results of calculations. (original abstract...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} minimal {{interacting}} generalization of the geometric Brownian motion model, which {{turns out to}} be formally equivalent to a model describing the dynamics of networks of analogue neurons. For sufficiently strong interactions, such systems may have many meta-stable states. Transitions between meta-stable states are associated with macroscopic reorganizations of the system, which can be triggered by random external forcing. Such a system will exhibit intermittent dynamics within a large part of its parameter space. We propose market dynamics as a possible application of this model, in which case random external forcing would correspond to the arrival of important information. The emergence of a model of interacting prices of the type considered here can be argued to follow naturally from a general argument based on integrating out all non-price degrees of freedom from the dynamics of a hypothetical complete description of <b>economic</b> <b>dependences.</b> PACS numbers: 02. 50. −r, 05. 40. −a, 89. 65.

40|$|Thai {{economic}} conditions considerably {{depend on the}} performances of tourism sectors. More {{than half of the}} Thai industries are directly and indirectly interdependent with tourism sectors. Given these large <b>economic</b> <b>dependences</b> upon tourism, any internal or external changes that affect Thai tourism could have substantial economy-wide impacts on the resource allocation, the industry outputs, the income distribution and key macroeconomic variables. So far, no empirical studies in Thailand consider both positive and negative economy-wide effects of tourism on the economy and the environment. This research, thus, applies the computable general equilibrium (CGE) approaches to investigate the nationwide economic and environmental impacts of tourism in Thailand, specifically on social welfare, industry outputs, labor market, income distribution and usages of land, forest and water. The research finds that tourism expansion in Thailand can stimulate real GDP and improve current account deficits. Tourism expansion, however, can cause an appreciation in real exchange rates, deteriorate trade balance and increase domestic inflation rates...|$|R

25|$|Therefore, {{even before}} the {{decision}} to organize the revolt, Lithuania attempted to maximize its influence and attract supporters in the region. Lithuania restricted its trade to demonstrate region's <b>economic</b> <b>dependence</b> as it did not produce enough food. The economic situation was further complicated {{by the beginning of}} hyperinflation of the German mark, which the region used as its currency. The Lithuanian cause was also supported by industrialists, who expected cheap labor and raw materials from Lithuania. Lithuanians also engaged in intense propaganda. They established and financed pro-Lithuanian organizations and acquired interest in local press. Many of these activities were coordinated by Lithuanian envoy Jonas Žilius, who received 500,000 German marks for such purposes. Banker Jonas Vailokaitis donated US$12,500 for the cause and pledged another $10,000 if needed. Additional support was provided by Lithuanian Americans, including Antanas Ivaškevičius (Ivas) and Andrius Martusevičius (Martus). For several weeks before the revolt, the local press reported on alleged Polish plans for the region. This was designed to strengthen the anti-Polish sentiment and paint Lithuania as a more favorable solution. It seems that these actions had the intended result and public opinion shifted towards Lithuania.|$|E
