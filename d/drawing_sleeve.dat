60|$|Hugh <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> {{across his}} lips, and gruffly {{answered}} yes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes--certainly,' growled Dennis, <b>drawing</b> his <b>sleeve</b> {{across his}} thirsty lips. 'No malice, brother. Drink with Muster Gashford!' ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> {{across his}} face, without any pretence of concealing why; and then cleared his voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I--don't know," [...] {{said the}} boy, <b>drawing</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his face, {{which had the}} effect of {{covering}} it with sooty streaks.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sleeve</b> <b>drawing</b> was by Wyatt's wife Alfreda Benge.|$|R
60|$|The poor fellow {{stopped a}} while, and again <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his forehead. It was {{impossible}} {{to look at him}} and believe for a moment that he was a madman.|$|R
60|$|Jack Brace smacked {{his lips}} in anticipation, thanked Adams in advance, and <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his mouth in preparation, while his host set a cocoa-nut-cup {{filled with a}} whitish {{substance}} before him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! But {{judging from}} the looks on you,' {{retorted}} Riderhood, completely ridding himself of his grass, and <b>drawing</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his mouth, 'you've made ekally sure afore, and have got disapinted. It has told upon you.' ...|$|R

60|$|As if {{seeing that}} it must be done, and eager to have the hard task soon over, Nat <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his eyes and gave two more quick hard strokes that reddened the hand, yet hurt the giver more.|$|R
60|$|And then C. Vincent Vesey <b>drew</b> {{back one}} <b>sleeve</b> from his snowy cuff, {{and the water}} came down at Lodore.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not sleeping!' he repeated, with assumed confusion. 'What can I say {{for having}} in your {{presence}} given utterance to thoughts--but they were sincere--they were sincere!' exclaimed the secretary, <b>drawing</b> his <b>sleeve</b> in a hasty way across his eyes; 'and why should I regret your having heard them?' ...|$|R
60|$|His vitals were {{tortured}} by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one; {{and as it}} tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallow countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his face, {{but there was no}} damming that trickle.|$|R
60|$|As I put {{my glass}} to my lips, he glanced with {{surprise}} {{at the end of}} his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his eyes and forehead.|$|R
60|$|His vitals were {{tortured}} by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper than the iron one; {{and as it}} tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his face, {{but there was no}} damming that trickle.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then hot water--that will be good," [...] she said, as {{she began}} gently <b>drawing</b> his coat <b>sleeve</b> over a puffed and {{helpless}} hand.|$|R
60|$|Vincent's {{right arm}} was {{accordingly}} <b>drawn</b> through the <b>sleeve</b> and the coat turned down {{so as to}} enable Dan to lay the wet pad on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|His voice {{died away}} {{as he saw}} the triumph in his wife's face, and, <b>drawing</b> down his <b>sleeves</b> again, he took up his coat and stood eyeing her in genuine perplexity.|$|R
5000|$|Op. 34 Eight folktales by Thor Ling (shepherd <b>draws</b> on his <b>sleeve,</b> High {{up in the}} mountains, All my love, All of {{the herbs}} are sprouting, it is the gentle summer… 1888) ...|$|R
50|$|His skewed {{sense of}} humour and {{observation}} {{led to the}} issue of Mike Absalom in 1971 (produced by Campbell-Lyons), before Hector and Other Peccadillos (1973) garnered a larger audience. The former album featured a Roger Dean <b>drawn</b> record <b>sleeve</b> designed as a guide to Notting Hill Gate. The latter included session work by Ray Fenwick. His live work encompassed both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm a man,' {{said the}} Deputy, giving her back the letter, and {{pocketing}} the coins, one by one, 'as earns his living by {{the sweat of}} his brow;' here he <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his forehead, as if this particular portion of his humble gains {{were the result of}} sheer hard labour and virtuous industry; 'and I won't stand in your way. Go where you like.' ...|$|R
60|$|The emotion which Dick scorned to show on his {{own account}} was freely {{manifested}} for another, as he sniffed audibly, and, boy-like, <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his eyes. But Phil, with the delicate perception of a finer nature, felt that the truest kindness he could show his friend was to distract his thoughts from himself, to spare him any comments, and lessen the embarrassment which would surely follow such unwonted confidence.|$|R
50|$|The Model 31 was a gas-operated, {{air-cooled}} {{machine gun}} with a tilting bolt action. It was fed by top mounted, semi-circular, thirty round magazines, with cooling air <b>drawn</b> through the <b>sleeve</b> to fins along the barrel.|$|R
5000|$|He {{has also}} drawn adverts for Milky Way, Wenlock & Mandeville, Lego, Nesquik, and Real Construction. He <b>drew</b> the record <b>sleeve</b> for Kaiser Chiefss single [...] "The Angry Mob" [...] and Count Arthur Strongs Christmas CD.|$|R
60|$|There {{was such}} an {{abundance}} of sympathy in Clym's tone that Eustacia slowly <b>drew</b> up her <b>sleeve</b> and disclosed her round white arm. A bright red spot appeared on its smooth surface, like a ruby on Parian marble.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you mind}} talking, Pip," [...] said he, after again <b>drawing</b> his <b>sleeve</b> {{over his eyes}} and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well remembered,--and he {{was all the more}} horrible to me that he was so much in earnest; [...] "you can't do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain't looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn't {{prepared}} for this as I wos. But didn't you never think it might be me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Some fine {{instinct}} that Rome {{must have}} bequeathed to us caused nearly every one {{to turn and}} look at them--there was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena. Two or three Give and Takes with tight coat <b>sleeves</b> <b>drew</b> nearer.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a map of}} {{the world}} showing trade routes from India and South America, [s. d. ]. The Pacific Ocean is {{depicted}} at center, while all of the continents except for some of Europe and Africa can be seen at left and right. Some countries and cities are indicated, while a few arrows are drawn from the top of South America and from the southern tip of India. Lines of longitude and latitude are also <b>drawn.</b> Photo <b>sleeve</b> reads: "Copied April 1930 "...|$|R
6000|$|Mr Codlin sat {{smiling in}} the chimney-corner, eyeing the {{landlord}} {{as with a}} roguish look he held the cover in his hand, and, feigning that his doing so was needful {{to the welfare of}} the cookery, suffered the delightful steam to tickle the nostrils of his guest. The glow of the fire was upon the landlord's bald head, and upon his twinkling eye, and upon his watering mouth, and upon his pimpled face, and upon his round fat figure. Mr Codlin <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his lips, and said in a murmuring voice, 'What is it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I shot him, {{and put him}} out of his misery. I patted him fust, and said, 'Good-by;' then I {{laid his}} head easy on the grass, give a last look into his lovin' eyes, and sent a bullet through his head. He hardly stirred, I aimed so true, and when I seen him quite still, with no more moanin' and pain, I was glad, and yet wal, I don't know as I need by ashamed on't I jest put my arms raound his neck and boo-hooed like a great baby. Sho! I didn't know I was sech a fool;" [...] and Silas <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his eyes, as much touched by Daisy's sob, as by the memory of {{faithful}} Major.|$|R
60|$|The great hush {{and quiet}} {{that had fallen}} like a benediction on every {{sleeping}} thing around him; the deep and passionless repose that seemed to drop from the bending boughs of the venerable trees; the cool, restful, earthy breath of the shadowed mold beneath him, touched only by a faint jessamine-like perfume as of a dead passion, lulled the hurried beatings of his heart and calmed the feverish tremor of his limbs. He allowed himself to sink back against the wall, his hands tightly clasped before him. Gradually, the set, abstracted look of his eyes faded and became suffused, as if moistened by that celestial mist. Then he rose quickly, <b>drew</b> his <b>sleeve</b> hurriedly across his lashes, and began slowly to creep along the wall again.|$|R
60|$|Brother Gimblet {{undertook}} {{the sacred}} function, after having <b>drawn</b> his <b>sleeve</b> across his mouth, and muttered, 'Well! I don't know as I see {{my way to}} hitting any of you quite {{in the right place}} neither.' He said this with a dark smile, and then began to bellow. What we were specially to be preserved from, according to his solicitations, was, despoilment of the orphan, suppression of testamentary intentions {{on the part of a}} father or (say) grandfather, appropriation of the orphan's house-property, feigning to give in charity to the wronged one from whom we withheld his due; and that class of sins. He ended with the petition, 'Give us peace!' which, speaking for myself, was very much needed after twenty minutes of his bellowing.|$|R
60|$|Ah Fe's face {{instantly}} discharged {{itself of}} all expression. A wet sponge {{could not have}} more completely obliterated all pencilled outline of character or thought from his blank slate-coloured physiognomy than did Gabriel's simple question. He returned his questioner's glance with ineffable calmness and vacancy, patiently <b>drew</b> the long <b>sleeves</b> of his blouse still further over his varnished fingers, crossed them submissively and Orientally before him, and waited apparently for Gabriel to become again intelligible.|$|R
50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is <b>drawn</b> into the <b>sleeve</b> instead of creating a bulge.|$|R
50|$|Brandon Jacobs {{released}} his debut solo E.P, ‘Dreams…Wishes & Fairy Tales’, on 5 May 2008. It {{was released on}} CD with 100 individually hand <b>drawn</b> and numbered <b>sleeves</b> on his own record label, Modern Pop Records. A full page write up was featured in the May edition of Artrocker Magazine, {{as well as an}} opening support slot for The Long Blondes at the Kentish Town Forum, having been asked to play by long term friend, guitarist Dorian Cox.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{wife has}} told you tales of me, I suppose. She's told you I knock her about, I daresay. I don't care what she tells you or any o' {{the people that}} she works for. But this I'll say: I never touched her but she touched me first. Look here! that's marks of hers!" [...] and, <b>drawing</b> up his <b>sleeve</b> he showed a scratch on his sinewy tattooed forearm. [...] "I've not come here about her; that's no {{business}} of anyone's." ...|$|R
