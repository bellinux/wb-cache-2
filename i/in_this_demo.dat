His last contributions to Inearthed were the lyrics of the songs from their second demo, Ubiquitous Absence of Remission which was the first time they worked with producer Anssi Kippo at Astia-studios (Lappeenranta, Finland). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>demo,</b> keyboards were incorporated into the band's songs for the first time. In order to achieve this, both Laiho and Raatikainen played the keyboards separately, and subsequently mixed the recorded track with the other instruments. Laiho, who had previously only composed the melodies of the songs, assumed the role of the band's lyricist.|$|E
500|$|Their {{milestones}} {{served as}} wake-up {{calls for the}} game's direction. A May 1998 [...] "proto-mission" [...] milestone {{was to have a}} basic but functional demo of the crucial game systems and two maps (the White House and Hong Kong) ready. The team worked on the riskiest parts of the game first such that the core game would be functioning, albeit not polished. The demo revealed that the size of their maps caused speed problems and would have to be divided into smaller maps. It also {{was one of the first}} signs that maps needed to be cut. The team forgot to prototype the non-player character artificial intelligence <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>demo.</b> A year later, in May 1999, they reached a milestone for finished game systems and the first two missions completed. While the player could start the game and character, use augmentations, acquire inventory, complete objectives, and save the game, their poor quality and comments from Newell led Spector to nickname milestone the [...] "Wow, these missions suck" [...] milestone. They felt that their first demos showed their potential, but they were not nearly close to reaching it. This milestone also helped them estimate the work required for missions and the portions that worked best, which led to a trim of their 500-page design manual to the best 270 pages. Spector recalled Smith's mantra here: [...] "less is more".|$|E
