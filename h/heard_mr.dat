500|$|The Truax case {{involved}} a Mr. William Truax {{who owned a}} restaurant called [...] "English Kitchen," [...] in Bisbee, Arizona. A Mr. Michael Corrigan and others were former cooks and waiters at the restaurant. Corrigan and others allegedly instituted a boycott of the restaurant, after a dispute arose over the terms and conditions of employment. A strike was allegedly ordered by a local union with respect to certain union members employed at the restaurant. The restaurant’s business was allegedly harmed, and Mr. Truax sued various parties {{on a variety of}} grounds. The lawsuit was thrown out by the trial court before the case could be heard, on the theory that Mr. Truax was incorrect as a matter of law. Mr. Truax appealed and the case eventually ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the trial court should not have thrown out the lawsuit, but should have <b>heard</b> <b>Mr.</b> Truax’s case. The case was sent back to the trial court so that a trial could take place. Truax was not a tax case. No issues involving taxation were presented to or decided by the Court.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} met with {{positive}} reviews by music critics. During a review of Saxobeats, Celeste Rhoads from AllMusic saw [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] as a club sensation along with [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] (2009) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Rodrigo of Yam Magazine wrote, [...] "One day, I <b>heard</b> <b>Mr.</b> Saxobeat by accident and I was instantly hooked. Thanks to its insanely catchy saxophone riffs and Stan's voice, Mr. Saxobeat is a very fun, upbeat song that you can smile and dance to {{no matter where you}} are. Plus, the song works like a charm for parties." [...] McCall of The Star-Ledger associated the song with the revival of the saxophone in music. The Hollywood Reporter Shirley Halperin listed the saxophone sequences in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] in her list of [...] "12 Awesome Sax Solos". Johnston, writing for Village Voice, said [...] "the way they're employed" [...] sounded like Pitbull's [...] "I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)" [...] (2009). In his book Stars of 21st Century Dance Pop and EDM: 33 DJs, Producers and Singers ... author James Arena listed it in his [...] "range of sounds that make up the world of the twenty-first century dance music". At the 2011 Romanian Music Awards, [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] won Best Song and was nominated for Best Dance Song.
