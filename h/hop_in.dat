5|$|Rainbow {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, who generally praised Carey's embrace of R and hip <b>hop</b> <b>in</b> her music. The album debuted at number {{two on the}} Billboard 200, with first week sales of 323,000. It was her first album in years to not reach number one. Rainbow was certified triple-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of three million copies within the United States. Outside the US, the album debuted atop the charts in France, and within the top five in Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, and Switzerland. In Europe, Rainbow was certified Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), denoting shipments of one million copies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|The project {{suffered}} a setback on 12 March 1969, when the rotor on prototype #3 (s/n 66-8828) struck the fuselage and caused the aircraft to crash, killing the pilot, David A. Beil. The accident occurred {{on a test}} flight where the pilot was to manipulate the controls to excite 0.5P oscillations (or half-P <b>hop)</b> <b>in</b> the rotor; 0.5P is a vibration that happens once per two main rotor revolutions, where P is the rotor's rotational speed. The accident investigation noted that safety mechanisms on the controls had apparently been disabled for the flight. The investigation concluded that the pilot-induced oscillations {{had set up a}} resonant vibration that exceeded the rotor system's ability to compensate. After the investigation, the rotor and control systems were modified to prevent the same problem from occurring again.|$|E

40|$|<b>Hopping</b> {{dynamics}} <b>in</b> glass {{has been}} known for quite a long time. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>hopping</b> dynamics <b>in</b> smectic-A (SmA) and hexatic smectic-B (HexB) liquid crystals (LC) has been observed only recently. The <b>hopping</b> <b>in</b> SmA phase occurs among the smectic layers (one-dimensionally), while <b>hopping</b> <b>in</b> HexB phase occurs inside the layers (two-dimensionally). The <b>hopping</b> dynamics <b>in</b> SmA and HexB liquid crystal phases is investigated by parallel soft-core spherocylinders, while three-dimensional <b>hopping</b> dynamics <b>in</b> inherent glassy states is investigated by systems of Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) spheres. The temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients of <b>hopping</b> <b>in</b> SmA phase can be described by the Arrhenius equation characteristic of activation process. In HexB LC phase, the diffusion coefficients saturate at higher temperatures. In a system of WCA spheres, the values and temperature dependence of diffusion coefficients depend on the observed states...|$|R

Too Short had experimented with looping sounds from classic P-Funk records over bass-heavy tracks during this period. However, unlike Bay Area Mobb music, Southern California-born G-funk used more portamento synthesizers and less live instrumentation. Too Short's lazy, drawl-heavy delivery was also a major influence on later G-funk rappers like Snoop Dogg.|$|E
