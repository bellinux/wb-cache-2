500|$|Game Director and creator David Jaffe {{confirmed}} the game {{would be a}} cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, [...] "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" [...] of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, nothing we can <b>do</b> <b>will</b> help you like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|E

Later that same day, the band released a statement addressing {{what happened at the}} show via their Facebook page, stating that bands that tour as heavily as they <b>do</b> <b>will</b> [...] "inevitably have a few derailments, but the train always keeps on moving", implying that all shows will proceed as planned and that Moody will remain as the band's frontman. As of yet, Ivan Moody has checked himself in rehab and will sit out the current tour. Tommy Vext will be filling in for Moody as he seeks treatment.|$|E

500|$|That year he led {{a three-week}} labor strike, refusing to sign a {{contract}} with the Associated General Contractors, [...] despite pressure from within his union. The union international ultimately signed the contract without Lynch's approval, causing him to file suit against them. He would later remark, with regard to his political career, [...] "Nothing I ever <b>do</b> <b>will</b> be as volatile as being union president during those times." [...] This debacle forced him to miss the first three weeks of classes at Boston College Law School, where he had enrolled. Despite the setback, he graduated with a J.D. in 1991. After graduating he joined the law office of Gabriel O. Dumont, Jr., representing labor unions and unemployed workers.|$|E
500|$|Lewis did {{not share}} the desire of some members to keep the CCF [...] "ideologically pure", and adhered to the Bundist belief that [...] "it was better {{to go along with}} the masses in a not totally correct {{direction}} than to separate oneself from them and remain 'purist'." [...] However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. [...] Lewis criticized the British Columbia CCF for such comments, saying [...] "... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. [...] If what we say and <b>do</b> <b>will</b> blunt or harm our purpose... then we are saying and doing a false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true... When, in heaven's name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Malley was {{characterized}} a [...] "hapless naif". On {{the topic of}} O'Malley's longtime crush on Meredith in the second season, Knight said: [...] "What's {{going to be very}} interesting to see is what he's going to do with Meredith. It's getting close to time. Whatever he chooses to <b>do</b> <b>will</b> inform who he is the rest of his life." [...] After their sexual encounter occurred onscreen, Knight {{said in an interview with}} Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune: [...] "George wasn't really paying full attention. He was letting his own feelings override his respect for Meredith. A person really clued in would get that there wasn't anything coming back, but he was so in his head about it and caught up in his own feelings that he wasn't listening. It's not just that he loves her...it's a kind of selfish love he had for her." [...] He also added that, [...] "I think George has a lot of growing up to do. Part of that is making horrible, stupid mistakes. He's been pretty sheltered." ...|$|E

500|$|While the {{definition}} of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend {{their lives on the}} ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the snow petrel, the nests of which have been found [...] inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites. The marbled murrelet nests inland in old growth forest, seeking huge conifers with large branches to nest on. Other species, such as the California gull, nest and feed inland on lakes, and then move to the coasts in the winter. Some cormorant, pelican, gull and tern species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, swamps and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and agricultural land. In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors. Some seabirds, principally those that nest in tundra, as skuas and phalaropes <b>do,</b> <b>will</b> migrate over land as well.|$|E
500|$|As Hannah Arendt pointed out, however, (following the {{utilitarian}} John Stuart Mill on this point): a bad conscience {{does not}} necessarily signify a bad character; in fact only those who affirm a commitment to applying moral standards will be troubled with remorse, guilt or shame by a bad conscience and their need to regain integrity and wholeness of the self. Representing our soul or true self by analogy as our house, Arendt wrote that [...] "conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home." [...] Arendt believed {{that people who are}} unfamiliar with the process of silent critical reflection about what they say and <b>do</b> <b>will</b> not mind contradicting themselves by an immoral act or crime, since they can [...] "count on its being forgotten the next moment;" [...] bad people are not full of regrets. Arendt also wrote eloquently on the problem of languages distinguishing the word consciousness from conscience. One reason, she held, was that conscience, as we understand it in moral or legal matters, is supposedly always present within us, just like consciousness: [...] "and this conscience is also supposed to tell us what to do and what to repent; before it became the lumen naturale or Kant's practical reason, it was the voice of God." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December {{outbreaks}} of violence were occurring in Ireland, and Fitzwilliam wrote to Grey on 12 December that [...] "one administration after another {{has lost the}} confidence of Ireland, and ours I fear will do so too; we shall do nothing till the hour of necessity is come, and then what we shall <b>do</b> <b>will</b> be done too late for any advantageous effect". When the Cabinet unsuccessfully put forward proposals for Catholic Emancipation, the King demanded that they pledge never again propose Emancipation. They refused and the government fell.

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to Civil War was generally positive. Online retailer Interpunk.com called the album [...] "worth {{every second of}} the interminable wait. From the opening note of the first track it's blatantly apparent that the guys in D4 haven’t lost a step". Reviewer Jason Lymangrover of Allmusic commented that the album [...] " [...] strong to their melodic punk roots, but [...] a new, more mature side of the band. The fiery pep is still intact here, but the carefree days of 'He's a Shithead (Yeah, Yeah)' have been replaced with thoughtful lyrics dealing with social injustices...it's their most glossy, most consistent, most calm, and surprisingly, their most socially relevant album, despite their approach toward middle age on a teen-oriented punk playground." [...] Chris Fallon of Absolutepunk.net also praised the album, calling it [...] "a new stitch in a damaged American flag; it's the healthy new dose of oxygen we are severely in need of in a crippled music industry starved of substance." [...] He particularly praised the band's songwriting and use of melody, stating that [...] "The record is audibly more melodic than previous releases, {{with a focus on}} pop-infused choruses and hooks, all while still containing that raw focal point the band has continually reached for on past albums." [...] Maximum Rocknroll magazine coordinator Justin Briggs wrote in the December 2008 issue, [...] " [...] While nothing they ever <b>do</b> <b>will</b> knock Midwestern Songs of the Americas from the position of 'DILLINGER FOUR's best album,' which is an impossible feat among impossibilities in itself, Civil War has tracks that I'd definitely put on a 'Best of DILLINGER FOUR' mixtape - quite a few, actually.
