There were moments when I was almost overcome by surges of self-commiseration and of impotent anger: for instance, I was once driven out of a shop by an incensed German grocer whom I had asked to settle a long-standing account. Yet the days passed, the daily grind absorbed my energies, and when I was not collecting, or tediously going over the stock in the dim recesses of the store, I was running errands in the wholesale district, treading the burning brick of the pavements, dodging heavy trucks and drays and perspiring clerks who flew about with <b>memorandum</b> <b>pads</b> in their hands, or awaiting the pleasure of bank tellers. Save Harvey, the venerable porter, I {{was the last to}} leave the store in the evening, and I always came away with the taste on my palate of Breck and Company's mail, it being my final duty to [...] "lick" [...] the whole of it and deposit it in the box at the corner. The gum on the envelopes tasted of winter-green.|$|R
