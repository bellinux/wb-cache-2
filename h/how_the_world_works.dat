He and his daughter Bella used to watch My Little Pony, which she eventually grew out of, and when searching for the series to watch again, came across Friendship Is Magic and started watching it with her. He also liked the show's positive messages about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> pointing to [...] "The Cutie Map" [...] as an example. On an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, Thornton also claimed that while his daughter's favorite character is Twilight Sparkle, his favorites were Fluttershy (who he said was his favorite because [...] "she talks like Marilyn Monroe") and Rainbow Dash.|$|E
500|$|The city's {{historical}} and cultural attractions have been lauded by numerous national newspapers, including the Boston Globe and The New York Times. Omaha {{is home to the}} Omaha Community Playhouse, the largest community theater in the United States. The Omaha Symphony Orchestra and its modern Holland Performing Arts Center, the Opera Omaha at the Orpheum theater, the Blue Barn Theatre, and The Rose Theater form the backbone of Omaha's performing arts community. Opened in 1931, the Joslyn Art Museum has significant art collections. Since its inception in 1976, Omaha Children's Museum has been a place where children can challenge themselves, discover <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works</b> and learn through play. The Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, one of the nation's premier urban artist colonies, was founded in Omaha in 1981, and the Durham Museum is accredited with the Smithsonian Institution for traveling exhibits. The city is also home to the largest singly funded mural in the nation, [...] "Fertile Ground", by Meg Saligman. The annual Omaha Blues, Jazz, & Gospel Festival celebrates local music along with the Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame.|$|E

In Inside Bay Area, Esther Fields opined that [...] "...ot {{only does it}} {{challenge}} modern assumptions about <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works,</b> but it also points the way toward {{a new way of}} understanding your place in the cosmos...and shows how we are on the brink of world changes as great as those of the time of Galileo and Copernicus." [...] Anthroposophist Frederick Dennehy opined in Lilipoh magazine that [...] "Tarnas’ deeply radical hypothesis is that the disenchantment of the modern universe is unreal – the result of a “simplistic epistemology” and moral positioning totally inadequate to the depths, complexity and grandeur of the cosmos." ...|$|E

He loved physics but did not think he had a strong enough talent for the mathematics that would be required.

After a close {{encounter}} with the first humans, Achimi received advice from an ant who told him <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>worked.</b> He said that if he wanted comfortable but short life, he would have to live with and serve humans. If he wanted a long and free life, he could live wild but would always be hungry. Achimi chose freedom. The ant also told her that he could mate with his mother and sister. Achimi returned home and did so. When Itherther found out, the father and son fought. Defeated, Itherther ran away.|$|R
2500|$|André Téchiné {{was born}} on 13 March 1943 at Valence-d'Agen, {{a small town in}} the [...] Midi-Pyrénées region, {{department}} of Tarn-et-Garonne, France. [...] His family, of Spanish ancestry, owned a small business making agricultural equipment. [...] He grew up in the south west French country side and in his adolescence acquired a passion for films. From 1952 to 1959 he [...] went to a Catholic boarding school in Montauban. [...] He was allowed to leave the school only on Sunday afternoons when he would go to the cinema, although he often had to return before the screening ended. From 1959 he attended a secular state school, which exposed him to a different culture, with Marxist teachers, a cine club and a film magazine, La Plume et l'écran, to which he contributed. [...] "Films were my only opening to the world," [...] Téchiné explained in an interview. [...] "They were my only possibility of escaping my family environment and my boarding school. It was probably dangerous because, through movies, I learned <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works</b> and how human relations work. But it was magical, and I was determined to follow the thread of that magic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and {{frequently}} enthralled with objects and patterns. According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants to understand <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>works.</b> His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses {{a big heart}} and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is [...] "a talented theoretician with an ego problem" [...] and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a pragmatist. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of Occam's razor) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as [...] "audience visions" [...] or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, [...] "those cute little analogies.") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes equations, often covering several chalkboards with a staccato clacking and {{the aid of a}} red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted—he has to write what is in his head. Like his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive ("one part exuberance, two parts obsession"), {{especially when it comes to}} work, but he's rather naïve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times.|$|E

Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and she fell asleep. When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied to him and said she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return every once in a while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely. He returns to see that the cottage has disintegrated; he builds a new one for another poor fisherman's family, beside the lot of the old one.|$|R
