5|$|Long's {{tenure in}} Congress was uneventful, since the Congress was under Democratic Party {{control for the}} six years he served. In {{addition}} to lobbying the administration for patronage appointments, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> joint committee examining interests of shipbuilding and shipowners, {{as well as on}} conference committees dealing with pensions and Navy financing.

Putnam was elected mayor of Springfield three times—in 1937, 1939, and 1941. He ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1946, but lost the Democratic nomination to Paul A. Dever.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> empty barrel, meditating on {{the chances}} of his {{submitting}} to the king after all, when the door opened, and in strode one with a drawn sword in one hand, {{and a pair of}} leg-shackles in the other.|$|R
50|$|Elsegood would {{continue}} to be <b>a</b> regular <b>on</b> the Manly wing in both 1995 and 1996, though he missed Manly's Grand Final loss to the Sydney Bulldogs in 1995 while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> extended bench for Manly's 20-8 win over St George in the 1996 Grand Final but did not get to play on the day.|$|R
60|$|Two {{hours after}} the {{foregoing}} conversation occurred Peter the Great was seated in a dark little back court in a low coffee-house {{in one of the}} darkest, narrowest, and most intricate streets of Algiers. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> empty packing-box. In front of him was seated a stout negress, in whom an Ethiopian might have traced some family likeness to Peter himself.|$|R
25|$|Although he {{was never}} chosen {{to sit in the}} Assembly's Council of State, Barebone was an active member. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{committee}} on tithes set up on 19 July 1653, and he {{was also one of the}} first members of the committee established on 19 August to consider law reform.

25|$|On 12 April 2006, Rajkumar {{returned}} to his Sadashivanagar residence after his regular 20-minute walk and had a general medical check-up by 11:30a.m. (IST). At 1:50 pm (IST), as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sofa, he asked {{a member of his}} family to slow the fan down and immediately collapsed. His personal physician Ramana Rao was called for, who rushed within three minutes, and performed external cardiac massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Rajkumar was then taken to MS Ramaiah Memorial Hospital and was administered intracardiac injections. Efforts to revive him failed and was pronounced dead at 2:05 pm (IST).|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} distant desert isle and ate cold ham {{and wished}} {{he were in}} Schoenstrom.|$|R
25|$|Millis {{returned}} to the University of Chicago. One of his students at this time was Oliver Cox, an African American who later was a noted economist. In 1937, he was appointed {{a member of the}} Illinois Commission on Unemployment and President Roosevelt appointed him to a Railway Labor Act fact-finding board in a dispute between the Chicago Great Western Railway and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. His railway panel found that the railroad should not impose a 15 percent wage reduction on the workers. Roosevelt appointed him to a second railways panel in 1938 to arbitrate a dispute between the million members of the Railway Labor Executives' Association (an umbrella group representing 18 railway labor organizations) and the Association of American Railways (which represented all long-haul railroads in the U.S.). In 1940, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> third arbitration panel which resolved a long-running wage dispute between American Railway Express and its unions.|$|E
500|$|Gerry {{was from}} an early time a vocal {{opponent}} of Parliamentary efforts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. [...] In 1770 <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Marblehead committee that sought to enforce importation bans on taxed British goods. [...] He frequently communicated with other Massachusetts opponents of British policy, including Samuel Adams, John Adams, Mercy Otis Warren, and others.|$|E
500|$|Vane {{was also}} active in {{domestic}} affairs. [...] <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> committee that disposed of Charles I's art collection, and made many enemies {{in his role}} on the committees for Compounding and Sequestration. [...] These committees, on which Vane had also sat in the 1640s, {{were responsible for the}} distribution of assets seized from royalists and other government opponents, and for negotiating with those who had failed to pay taxes and other government charges. [...] Some of the enemies he made while engaged in this work would one day sit in judgment against him.|$|E
60|$|It was a water-turkey, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> placidly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> limb {{close to}} the water's edge, and about a boat's length ahead of us.|$|R
60|$|Kenneth made no {{sign that}} <b>he</b> heard. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> like <b>a</b> man in a dream. His eyes that saw nothing were bent upon Gregory's pale, flabby face.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> also <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} Royal Commissions in Britain {{and became a}} baronet in 1872 {{and a member of}} the Imperial Privy Council in 1886.|$|R
500|$|On 2 December 1803 Daoíz {{was ordered}} by General Godoy to be {{seconded}} to the Royal Bronze Foundry. There <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> committee, headed by Brigadier Maria Vicente Maturana, {{to decide the}} design and oversee the production of new light guns for the horse artillery. [...] Daoíz agreed to wed a noblewoman from Utrera in 1807, the marriage ceremony taking place in spring the next year. In 1807 Daoíz was commander of the Spanish artillerymen that attended {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Fontainebleau, an agreement between Spain and France to split up Portugal into three smaller states, and was part of the Franco-Spanish force that invaded Portugal to enforce that treaty. He moved with his regiment to Madrid in 1808 and took command of a battery of the 2nd company (some sources say 3rd company) at the former palace of the Duke of Monteleón. He became known to the men under his command as [...] "el Abuelo" [...] ("the grandfather") due to his relative age and good temperament.|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Clifford {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts legislature, where <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{committee}} that revised the state's statutes. [...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom I wished to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. He was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{generally}} late in rising, {{as he worked}} late into the night. After attending prayers {{with others in the}} morning, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hard desk seat or bench and worked throughout the day till late into night, till around 2 am. He was unperturbed by the activities of others around him.|$|E

2500|$|In recent years, he {{has adopted}} the persona of an [...] "expatriate con man and {{medicine}} show huckster {{from the early}} 20th century," [...] and he has headlined such venues as the World Steam Expo.

2500|$|In 1876, Robinson {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives, where he served most of four terms.

2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading ( [...] , aliyah), Amalek attacked Israel at Rephidim.

When Moses grew weary, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone, while Aaron and Hur supported his hands, and Joshua overwhelmed Amalek in battle. The seventh open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E
6000|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tressel which {{answered}} {{the purpose of}} a chair, and placing the lantern beside him, proceeded in the most friendly tone: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> log {{and took}} out an old corncob pipe. When it was filled and lighted he leaned back contentedly against a {{friendly}} stump.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now at {{this time}} Mr. Coon had a very plain tail. It was all of one color, a grayish white, not at all pretty. Mr. Coon used to think {{a great deal about}} that tail and wish and wish that it was handsome. Sometimes he used to envy Mr. Fox his {{beautiful}} red tail with its black and white tip. One day, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old log with his chin in his hands, thinking about his tail, who should come along but Old Mother Nature.|$|R
2500|$|Ellsworth excelled as a telegrapher. Not {{only could}} he read {{extremely}} fast code messages, {{but he also}} could imitate the sending style of other telegraphers (each of whom was slightly different), and he quickly mastered the [...] "fist" [...] of the Union Army's telegraphers in Kentucky and Tennessee. He gained his nickname [...] "Lightning" [...] during Morgan's first Kentucky Raid, when <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> railroad cross tie in knee deep water near Horse Cave, Kentucky, calmly tapping away at his telegraph key during a thunderstorm.|$|E

I then realised what theatre was all about – the falsehood of that old man made me arrive at a state where inhibitions and convictions, all became so fluid and beautiful. And this vision has remained with me always" ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} Poovantanthoppe, (present-day Swamithope), he {{undertook a}} penance. The penance {{consisted of three}} stages, each spanning two years. A tradition describes his postures during the six-year tavam as follows: {{during the first two}} years, he stood inside a six feet deep pit; during the next two years, he squatted on the ground; and during the last two years, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> raised platform. His appearance was squalid, [...] "long and entangled plait of hair" [...] and frayed clothes. He spoke less and subsisted on frugal meals.|$|E
60|$|Immediately after, there {{walked into}} the parlour a bowed, mean-looking, dirty little old man, who, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chair, paid some {{doubtful}} compliments to Peggy.|$|R
