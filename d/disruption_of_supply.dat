40|$|Output decline {{has been}} {{a feature of the}} {{transition}} economies in the initial post-communist period, including in those countries that belonged to the former Soviet Union. However, explanations for the decline and its persistence have not been easy to find, and mostly they have focussed upon domestic factors in each economy. The theory of disorganization introduced the idea that disrupted supply chains following the demise of central planning might have a role in the explanation of output decline. This paper extends that idea to distinguish between supply from domestic sources, and supply from abroad. Using data for Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the paper finds - contrary to expectation - that the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> from hard currency markets was more significant in explaining output decline in these countries than <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplies</b> from CIS partners. This suggests that institutional weaknesses in the areas of international banking, trade insurance, and the like, have been very important factors. trade, transition economies, CIS, disorganization, output decline. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{drinking}} water systems, production and distribution included, should be designed in adequate manner to keep functioning in hazardous or emergency situations. As time passes systems loose their ability to fulfil their function and maintenance, corrective and preventive, becomes necessary. Decisions on design {{as well as on}} maintenance are often taken based on previous experiences, as there may be a lot of uncertainties. To cope with decision making under uncertainties risk management is introduced. In {{the first part of this}} report a risk management approach is introduced. This approach is a cyclic process consisting of the following phases: risk analysis, risk evaluation and prioritisation, risk control, and evaluation of risk control measures. Performance and costs are two key concepts in asset management. The level of performance can be divided in the level of delivery of water and the level of customers’ services. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the level of delivery are the main focus in the second part of this report. The term SSM was introduced to make the level of performance of delivery towards customers measurable. SSM is a Dutch term that stands for minutes of insufficient delivery per customer per year. Activities, which could lead to SSM incidents, were registered. These activities were divided into activities, which lead to <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> (in transport, distribution and connection mains), and activities leading to pressure and quality incidents. In a pilot study, of which the results are discussed, it became clear that the average SSM value for 2005 was about 36 : 20 min. After this a case study was conducted looking more in depth at the SSM data of 2 companies who participated in the pilot. The objective of this case study was to look more in depth at the main activities causing SSM and possible ways to reduce SSM. For both companies a list of top 3 causes, as well as suggestions for reducing SSM are included in the conclusions. The general conclusion was that the main causes of SSM were activities leading to disruptions in distribution mains. Recommended was that improved maintenance reducing the occurrence of leakages could decrease SSM. In the last chapter SSM is looked at in the broader perspective of risk management, in which decisions are based upon uncertainties. Something is first said about larger production incidents, such as calamities and disasters. These incidents lead in certain situations to high values of SSM, which hold some ground for including these incidents in the future when talking about the SSM approach. Another factor decisions are often based on is an economic optimum. A start is made to find an appropriate economic optimum for a single main. The economic optimum was between corrective maintenance and costs for replacement and renovation. Based on the outcome of this calculation some recommendations are done.

40|$|P. 4 The Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU) has overall primary {{responsibility}} for Drug Law Enforcement. It has a national and international remit and works in collaboration with Revenue’s Customs Service, the Irish Navy and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The GNDU carries out long term strategic and short term tactical investigations into the activities of Organised Crime Gangs (OCGs) based both here and on the European continent from where drug traffickers ply their trade {{to the detriment of}} Irish communities. The GNDU liaises with other European Police Forces and has strategic partners in the United Kingdom, Spain, Holland and Belgium; countries where OCGs affecting the Irish jurisdiction tend to be the most proactive. In 2014 the Garda National Drugs Unit arrested 60 persons in connection with drug trafficking offences with € 698, 234, 000 of controlled drugs seized which included Cocaine, Heroin, Herbal Cannabis, Cannabis Resin and Ecstasy. In total 43 significant seizures were made. Major investigations carried out by the Garda National Drugs Unit in 2014 are detailed in the report. Test Purchase Operations: Targeting mid range and low level drug dealers nationwide. As a result of these tactical investigations, 55 dealers were arrested in respect of 251 criminal offences. National Drugs Strategy 2009 - 2016 : The strategic objective of the National Drugs Strategy 2009 - 16 is to continue to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. An Garda Síochána is committed to tackling the supply of drugs at all levels in keeping our commitment to the National Drugs Strategy. Garda Policy is reflected in the National Drugs Strategy and as part of the delivery of drug policy, An Garda Síochána have the responsibility for the implementation of 15 Actions under the Strategy. In response to the issue of Drug Related Intimidation under Action 5 of the National Drug Strategy 2009 – 2016, An Garda Síochána has developed a clear policy as recommended un-der the Strategy in conjunction with the National Family Support Network. A framework has been developed ‘the Drug Related Intimidation Reporting Programme’ and is now in place on a National level. An Inspector has been nominated in every Garda Division throughout the country to act as the single point of contact (SPOC) to ensure that there is an appropriate and effective response to this is-sue. An Garda Síochána will ensure a confidential, safe and effective means of dealing with reports of intimidation and providing families with sufficient support. An Garda Síochána continue to meet our obligations under the National Drugs Strategy 2009 - 16. The work of the Garda National Drugs Unit in 2014 has had a major impact on the drug trafficking community both here and abroad. The arrest and prosecution of individuals involved in drug trafficking activities and the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> routes has severely impacted on those intent on destroying the fabric of Irish society through the illicit drugs trade.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the place of}} metaphor in biomedical knowledge about two major public health problems: cancer and coronary heart disease (CHD). Specifically, it considers why cancer is constituted by biomedicine in obviously metaphorical concepts that are also highly pejorative. Conversely, the metaphorical dimension of the biomedical knowledge concerning CHD is less obvious and less negative in its connotations. This thesis posits that the difference in linguistic styles associated with cancer and CHD can {{be accounted for by}} whether knowledge about them confirms or challenges the knowledge and value system of modernity. Cancer, as construed by biomedicine, appears to confound some important tenets of the epistemology and knowledge of modernity. In particular, it confounds the idea that the body is a machine and that nature is an inert order obeying objective laws. It thus suggests that the universe, including that of bodies, is not entirely subject to rational understanding and control. Women having irrational bodies and an affinity with unruly nature are primary sites for cancer. It is therefore hardly surprising that cancer's metaphors express a fear that order based on masculine rational agency is fragile. By contrast, biomedical knowledge about CHD appears to confirm key aspects of modernist knowledge. Specifically, it suggests that the (masculine) body can be understood as a machine that exists as part of a wider domain of nature that is inert and is fuelled by objective laws. Unlike cancer, which is depicted as mysterious and arcane, CHD is presented as an ailment with causes that are well understood and treatment that is effective, thus affirming the truth of rationality and technology. Coronary heart disease is construed overwhelmingly as a disease affecting men exercising their capacity for rational agency, free from the 'dictates' of an irrational body. Coronary heart disease is depicted as a <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and demand rather than as a threat to social order itself. In Durkheimian terms, sacred things can be pure and beneficent or they can take impure and threatening forms. Cancer expresses the impure, threatening dimension of sacredness in exposing threats to the knowledge and order of modernity. Conversely, coronary heart disease is profane, in those terms, since it offers apparent confirmation of the knowledge and order of modernity. Cancer makes us aware of deeply held values by making us conscious of threats to them but the knowledge of CHD is so congruent with the knowledge system of modernity, that it does not provoke us to examine that framework; it merely affirms our routine and mundane view of the world. These findings suggest that biomedicine can be regarded as a secular religion because it acts as a cosmology. Knowledge of the body and its ailments is set within a wider conceptual framework and value system recognizing and naming sources of order and danger. This further suggests that while biomedicine may be rightly regarded as a technical and instrumental body of knowledge, it is nevertheless fuelled by and intertwined with deeply held values and convictions that are beyond the domain of rationality. The unexamined, a-rational elements of biomedicine have been virtually ignored within public health and explain some of its limitations in defining and responding to familiar public health problems.

It also describes the basic principles of emergency planning as part of preparatory measures for dealing with crisis situations, including crisis situations with the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> food <b>supplies</b> with large-scale consequences. My thesis also contains a general overview of the economic measures for crisis situations, which includes regulatory measures. The regulatory measures are a central subject of my thesis research. The objective of my thesis was to create a proposal of the methodological approach in dealing with the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> food <b>supplies.</b> A presumptive hypothesis was subsequently formed for this objective. This thesis is classified as a theoretical type of qualifying work. This type of thesis is accompanied by a formative evaluation as a minimum. An essential basis for the work on this thesis was a relevant and rich source base. This platform was used for performing a comparison of published literary sources, current legislation, methodological proposals and procedures related to this issue.
