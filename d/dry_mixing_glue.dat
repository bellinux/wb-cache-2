Use industrial <b>dry</b> building <b>mixes</b> has changed shape of civil works {{all over the world}} thanks to intensive studying of influence of nanomodification on concrete properties. In Western Europe manufacture and application of <b>dry</b> <b>mixes</b> in building has mass character. On one inhabitant the manufacture of <b>dry</b> <b>mixes</b> in Germany is about 30 kg a year, and in Finland and Sweden about 20 kg; in Poland this figure makes about 23 kg. In Russia volume of consumption of <b>dry</b> <b>mixes</b> is much more low – a little more than 2 kg a year. Modern manufacture of <b>dry</b> <b>mixes</b> in Russia is in a formation stage, but certain successes are already reached. Perspective direction of the solution of an actual problem of competitive building materials release is use of nanomodification process of <b>dry</b> building <b>mixes</b> on a cement-sandy basis.

The mix has been created {{on the basis of}} Portland cement, UFAPORE foaming agent, mineral additives (RSAM sulfoaluminate additive, MK- 85 micro-silica and basalt fiber), plasticizing and accelerating “Citrate-T” additive and   redispersible Vinnapas- 8034 H powder. It has been established that foam concrete with  density of 400 – 800 kg/m 3, durability of 1, 1 – 3, 4 MPa, low water absorption (40 – 50 %), without shrinkable cracks has been formed while adding water of Water/Solid = 0. 4 – 0. 6 in the <b>dry</b> <b>mix,</b>  subsequent mechanical swelling and curing of foam mass.

40|$|Buruli ulcer is a {{neglected}} tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. This skin disease {{is the third}} most common mycobacterial disease and its rapid diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{is considered to be}} the most sensitive method for the laboratory confirmation of Buruli ulcer. However, PCR remains expensive and involves reagents unsuitable for use in tropical countries with poor storage conditions, hindering the development of reliable quantitative PCR (qPCR) diagnosis. We aimed to overcome this problem by developing a ready-to-use <b>dry</b> qPCR <b>mix</b> for the diagnosis of M. ulcerans infection. We compared the efficiency of three different <b>dry</b> qPCR <b>mixes,</b> lyophilized with various concentrations of cryoprotectants, with that of a freshly prepared mixture, for the detection of a standard range of M. ulcerans DNA concentrations. We evaluated the heat resistance of the <b>dry</b> <b>mixes,</b> comparing them with the fresh mix after heating. We also evaluated one of the <b>dry</b> <b>mixes</b> in field conditions, by analyzing 93 specimens from patients with suspected Buruli ulcers. The <b>dry</b> <b>mix</b> was (i) highly resistant to heat; (ii) of similar sensitivity and efficiency to the fresh mix and (iii) easier to use than the fresh <b>mix.</b> <b>Dry</b> qPCR <b>mixes</b> are suitable for use in the diagnosis of M. ulcerans infection in endemic countries. The user-friendly format of this mix makes it possible for untrained staff to perform diagnostic tests with a limited risk of contamination. The possibility of using this mix in either vial or strip form provides considerable flexibility for the management of small or large amounts of sample.

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Medicine in Pharmaceutical Affairs Johannesburg, 2014 Aim The {{first step in a}} wet granulation process is <b>dry</b> <b>mixing.</b> This step has the objective of ensuring that all the raw materials are mixed such that the end product is homogeneous. <b>Dry</b> <b>mixing</b> in a high shear mixer instead of a blender saves cost. However, the mixing parameters have not been well researched. <b>Dry</b> <b>mixing</b> parameters that are currently used, have been established through experience, trial and error and in-process testing. Alexander and Muzzio (2006) confirms this by stating that there are currently no mathematical techniques to predict blending behaviour of granular components without prior experimental work; therefore, blending studies start with a small-scale, try-itand- see approach. Even though they are referring to blending, the same is also true for <b>dry</b> <b>mixing.</b> Both processes are the mixing of powders. Therefore the aim of this research was to develop parameters for <b>dry</b> <b>mixing,</b> based on experimental work. Methods Using a Saral rapid mixer and wet granulator (Saral Engineering Company, India), experiments were performed according to a 24 two-level Plackett-Burman Design method, {{to determine the effects of}} different blades (mixer/impeller and chopper) speeds and mixing times on the homogeneity of the mixtures containing different ratios of two powders that have different densities and particle sizes.

Thus, the need to use alternative materials should be widely used and practiced among the construction and development to pro-long the material for future generation supply. In this study, the use of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) powder is to minimize the sand extinction. The objective of this study is to determine the best replacement of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) which it is considered as the industrial waste in the design mix of ratio 1 : 2. 5 and the relationship between percentage of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) replacement and compressive strength of the design mix of ratio 1 : 2. 5.

The gelation of the system was enhanced by a crosslinker, 1 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) - 3 -(ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC). The gelation time of the bioadhesives was analyzed using rheological measurements. The results indicated that the type of gelatin was a critical factor in determining the gelation time of the biological <b>glues.</b> The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> had greater bonding strength and smaller gelation times as the molecular weight of gamma-PGA or gelatin increased. The swelling ratio decreased and the denaturation temperature increased upon raising the EDC concentration, indicating a greater degree of crosslinking at higher EDC concentrations. The <b>mixed</b> <b>glues</b> crosslinked with various concentrations of EDC (1. 7 - 2. 5 %) showed no cytotoxicity to fibroblasts. In addition, no significant inflammatory response was observed in the rat subcutaneous implantation. The bioadhesives based on gelatin/gamma-PGA remained at the site for 7 days while the fibrin glue had almost completely degraded.

With regards to mechanical behavior, the enhancements reported are much lower than the theoretical predictions. One of the main challenges being tackled is achieving a uniform dispersion. Solvent mixing has been used extensively. Concerns, however, arose that unevaported solvents could negatively affect the mechanical properties. In this thesis, solvent and <b>dry</b> <b>mixing</b> for dispersing MWNT powders within the polymer prior to fabrication by melt processing are compared.

It was found that <b>dry</b> <b>mixing</b> produced composites with the highest yield strength at 0. 5 wt % CNT, whereas solvent mixing produced a similar enhancement at CNT contents of 1 wt %.

40|$|<b>Dry</b> {{building}} <b>mixes,</b> {{stored in}} the air, absorb water vapor and CO 2 gas and ageing because properties of binding materials, mostly Portland cement, deteriorate after its prehydration and carbonation. In this paper the ageing singularities of <b>dry</b> cement <b>mixes</b> for finishing purposes and additives for retarding this process has been determinated. Ordinary and quickly hardening Portland cements absorb H 2 O and CO 2 more than white cement – about 70  % – 75  % and 30  % – 38  % per month of innitial mass, respectively. White cement is more resistant to prehydration and carbonation, because it contains less C 3 A, C 4 AF and alkali, characterized initial activity. <b>Dry</b> <b>mixes</b> with white cement, although slower, but still worse after stored.
