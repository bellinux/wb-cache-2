5|$|The {{domestic}} cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus) is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They {{are often}} called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship {{and for their}} ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E

5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data sequentially, the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially with data related to the same file. If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block. It will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the read-erase-modify-write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection.|$|E

25|$|No {{downtime}} for refueling. LFTRs have liquid fuels, {{and therefore}} there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{shut down and}} take apart the reactor just to refuel it. LFTRs can thus refuel without causing a power outage (online refueling).|$|E
25|$|As long {{as these}} two {{criteria}} are satisfied, the data replicas converge (with additional constraints) after all operations are executed at all sites. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> enforce a total order of execution {{for the sake}} of achieving convergence. Their approach is generally to first identify and prove sufficient conditions for a few transformation functions, and then design a control procedure to ensure those sufficient conditions. This way the control procedure and transformation functions work synergistically to achieve correctness, i.e., causality and admissibility preservation. In their approach, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> satisfy transformation properties such as TP2 because it does not require that the (inclusive) transformation functions work in all possible cases.|$|E
