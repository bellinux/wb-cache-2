25|$|The {{government}} {{also wanted to}} include Autonomous Republic of Adjara in the service area of UWSCG in 2010. However, this was opposed by the German state-owned development bank KfW that provided substantial funding for {{water supply and sanitation}} in Batumi on behalf of the German government. Adjara was thus excluded. In 2014 the government made a second attempt to included Adjara in the service area of the United Water Company through a decree issued by the Prime Minister, but this attempt was also foiled. De jure water and wastewater management in Adjara remains decentralized, but actually the government in Tbilisi is involved in all important decisions so that de facto it is as centralized as in other regions of Georgia. On the one hand, the Batumi water company remains financially weak, with non-revenue water as high as 90%, significant amounts of unpaid bills. As a result, tariff revenues were only 0.7 million Laris (USD 0.4m) in 2014, while operating costs stood at 10 million Laris (USD 5.7m), of which 45% were for salaries, according to an audit by the state auditor. On the other hand, there have been many notable improvements in service quality in Batumi. For example, a separate stormwater drainage system has been built, preventing flooding that had previously been frequent. 70% of customers now receive water 24 hours a day, and a modern wastewater treatment plant has been commissioned in 2012. The plant functions properly, so that the quality of coastal waters has improved substantially, benefiting tourism and making it possible to eat again locally caught fish. Both the investments costs and the energy consumption of the trickling <b>filter</b> <b>plant</b> are extremely low, for which the Austrian engineering company working on the plant was honored with an innovation award by the International Water Association (IWA), a professional association.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the design of an {{extensive}} system of filters vegetation that serves a town with 1, 400 inhabitants. In this work I present methods of water purification in rural / urban and viable solutions to implement <b>filters</b> <b>planted</b> with macrophytes based on biological treatment. Depending on the throughput rates of the village wastewater system parameters are established extensive <b>filters.</b> Sewage <b>plants</b> are lower in rural areas usually experiencing considerable seasonal and even daily variations in terms laden with pollutants and sewage flow. The adoption of such methods would bring many benefits to rural areas locally to reduce without the consumption of energy costs if the topography makes it possible plant location and thus decreasing the risks of environmental pollution with the possibility of effective treatment of wastewater. These sewage treatment plants in rural and urban areas must be manageable and exploitable. Ensuring good quality and quantity, purified water is considered a valuable especially in rural areas being reused in agriculture...|$|R
