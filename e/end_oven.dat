40|$|In {{microelectronics}} packaging applications {{a variety}} of thermosetting polymer materials is applied. Such materials are dispensed in a liquid form and are heated {{with the intent to}} cure them. Conventional processes often take several hours to bring the material up to temperatures which result in a significant rate of cure. An alternative approach to curing thermosetting polymers is the use of microwave energy, which has been shown to cure encapsulant materials in substantially shorter times. A recent innovation is the open-ended microwave oven proposed by Sinclair et al [...] This paper deals with the implementation of the open-ended microwave oven into a precision placement machine. Two test products for encapsulation and flip-chip serve as objective for microwave-assisted assembly. An integrated system setup including the open <b>ended</b> <b>oven</b> is presented. Modifications on the open-ended microwave oven are described and a concept for the development of an embedded microwave curing system is presented. Tests on curing encapsulant materials dispensed over a commercially available QFN were performed to determine post-process functionality of the package, with no evident detrimental effects...|$|R

5000|$|An oven bag, cooking bag or {{roasting}} bag is a bag {{used for}} the roasting of meat or other food in an oven. They may be made of plastic or culinary parchment. A bag helps to keep the food being cooked moist by trapping the moisture in the bag and preventing it from escaping into the oven; as such, it serves a similar purpose to basting. The plastic used for manufacture of the oven bag must be chosen {{so that it will}} not melt at the temperature during cooking and thus spoil the food.

The individual quasi-tubular particles are irregularly flattened in cross section, and some may be plugged at the <b>ends.</b> Conventional <b>oven</b> drying at 105 ~ results in partial unrolling and incomplete flattening of the quasi-tubular particles of some of the clusters.

5000|$|The works was {{situated}} by the dam marking the upper tidal {{limit of the}} river, where Swalwell Juniors F.C. now stands. The CPP which washed and blended the coal prior to the coking process stood at the north-eastern end of the site, along with large storage bunkers. A conveyor fed blended coal from these bunkers into another bunker {{on top of the}} ovens which in turn fed the charging car. The ovens themselves were parallel to the A694, which passes the site, and stood on the area of land now occupied by the two football pitches. There were several railway sidings for both coal and coke between the ovens and the road. The pusher was {{on the opposite side of}} the ovens, and the coke was shoved out on the side nearest the road. The quenching tower was at the north-eastern end of the battery of ovens, near the CPP, and the chimney was at the opposite <b>end.</b> Between the <b>ovens</b> and the river were the power plant with its associated boilers and chimneys, as well as the by-products plant. The latter [...] "scrubbed" [...] the gas produced in the ovens, extracting chemicals such as tar and ammonia, which were piped into storage tanks. The gas was then stored in a tall gas holder to the south-east of the site, near the river.|$|R
60|$|The Indians, {{along the}} lower Columbia {{as far as}} the Cascades and on the lower Willamette, died off very fast during the year I spent in that section; for besides {{acquiring}} the vices of the white people they had acquired also their diseases. The measles and the small-pox were both amazingly fatal. In their wild state, before the appearance of the white man among them, the principal complaints they were subject to were those produced by long involuntary fasting, violent exercise in pursuit of game, and over-eating. Instinct more than reason had taught them a remedy for these ills. It was the steam bath. Something like a bake-oven was built, large enough to admit a man lying down. Bushes were stuck in the ground in two rows, about six feet long and some two or three feet apart; other bushes connected the rows at one end. The tops of the bushes were drawn together to interlace, and confined in that position; the whole was then plastered over with wet clay until every opening was filled. Just inside the open <b>end</b> of the <b>oven</b> the floor was scooped out so as to make a hole that would hold a bucket or two of water. These ovens were always built on the banks of a stream, a big spring, or pool of water. When a patient required a bath, a fire was built near the oven and a pile of stones put upon it. The cavity at the front was then filled with water. When the stones were sufficiently heated, the patient would draw himself into the oven; a blanket would be thrown over the open end, and hot stones put into the water until the patient could stand it no longer. He was then withdrawn from his steam bath and doused into the cold stream near by. This treatment may have answered with the early ailments of the Indians. With the measles or small-pox it would kill every time.|$|R
40|$|The {{innovation}} {{consists of}} a thermodynamic system for extracting in situ oxygen vapor from lunar regolith using a solar photovoltaic power source in a reactor, a method for thermally insulating the reactor, a method for protecting the reactor internal components from oxidation by the extracted oxygen, a method for removing unwanted chemical species produced in the reactor from the oxygen vapor, a method for passively storing the oxygen, and a method for releasing high-purity oxygen from storage for lunar use. Lunar oxygen exists in various types of minerals, mostly silicates. The energy required to extract the oxygen from the minerals is 30 to 60 MJ/kg O. Using simple heating, the extraction rate depends on temperature. The minimum temperature is approximately 2, 500 K, {{which is at the}} upper <b>end</b> of available <b>oven</b> temperatures. The oxygen is released from storage in a purified state, as needed, especially if for human consumption. This method extracts oxygen from regolith by treating the problem as a closed batch cycle system. The innovation works equally well in Earth or Lunar gravity fields, at low partial pressure of oxygen, and makes use of in situ regolith for system insulation. The innovation extracts oxygen from lunar regolith using a method similar to vacuum pyrolysis, but with hydrogen cover gas added stoichiometrically to react with the oxygen as it is produced by radiatively heating regolith to 2, 500 K. The hydrogen flows over and through the heating element (HE), protecting it from released oxygen. The H 2 O 2 heat of reaction is regeneratively recovered to assist the heating process. Lunar regolith is loaded into a large-diameter, low-height pancake reactor powered by photovoltaic cells. The reactor lid contains a 2, 500 K HE that radiates downward onto the regolith to heat it and extract oxygen, and is shielded above by a multi-layer tungsten radiation shield. Hydrogen cover gas percolates through the perforated tungsten shielding and HE, preventing oxidation of the shielding and HE, and reacting with the oxygen to form water vapor. The water vapor is filtered through solid regolith to remove unwanted extraction byproducts, and then condensed to a liquid state and stored at 300 to 325 K. Conversion to usable oxygen is achieved by pumping liquid water into a high-pressure electrolyzer, storing the gaseous oxygen at high pressure for use, and diverting the hydrogen back to the reactor or to storage. The results from this design effort show that this oxygen-generating concept can be developed in an efficient system with low specific mass. Advantages include use of regolith as an oxygen source, filter, and thermal insulator. The system can be tested in Earth gravity and can be expected to operate similarly in lunar gravity. The system is scalable, either by increasing the power level and output of a standard module, or by employing multiple modules...|$|R
