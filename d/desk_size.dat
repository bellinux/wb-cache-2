The study reported investigates the effect of spaciousness impressions on self-disclosure during interviews on intimate lifestyle-related topics comprising substance intake, sexuality, and emotions. To influence perceived spaciousness, <b>desk</b> <b>size</b> (interpersonal space) and room size (architectural space) were manipulated. The results show that room size in particular affects self-disclosing behavior with increases in architectural space positively affecting self-disclosure. However, the effects obtained varied considerably across the different topics, and decreases in interpersonal space hampered self-disclosure on sexuality-related topics. Furthermore, nonverbal measures revealed that readjustments of posture, interpersonal distancing, and refrains from establishing eye contact are used to counteract space intrusions...|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} research {{focuses on}} repurposing the large amounts of plastic bag waste present in Ghana. Much of this waste originates from water sachets, made from non-biodegradable plastic. The water sachets allow for potable water to be easily stored, accessed and transported. Ghana creates approximately 270 tons of plastic waste per day, with 85 % of that plastic waste due solely to water. Less than 2 % of this waste is currently being recycled. Water sachets have been the main supply of drinking water in Ghana for a decade, leading to an immense build-up of discarded plastic throughout the nation. Professor Chris Martin of the Iowa State University College of Design proposed recycling waste plastic from Ghana into chairs for schools in the area. This project was initially started by a senior design team in Materials Engineering and then continued by this research team in multidisciplinary senior design. The work over the semester focused on developing a simple and appropriate molding process for <b>desk</b> <b>sized</b> pieces in Ghana. Further work will focus on a heating implement and finalizing a desk design or similar application for the molding process...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{the interaction between}} the development of postural control and the development of the executive function of attention in 13 children and 6 adults in dual-task conditions. Participants performed an attentionally demanding cognitive task and a postural task simultaneously. The authors equalized the attentional load of the cognitive task across age groups. Comparative changes in the center of pressure in dual- and single-task conditions indicated that dual tasks interfered with postural performance in the wide stance (WS) and the modified Romberg stance (RS). Children at 4 – 6 years of age (but not children at ages 7 – 12 years of age or adults) experienced postural control interference in both stance positions, but interference was greater in the RS (p =. 018). For all participants, cognitive task performance in RS was unchanged from that in WS. The knowledge gained from {{the results of this study}} will contribute to the design and implementation of academic and preacademic programming for young children. Their performance of an intentionally demanding cognitive task would be enhanced by the provision of appropriately <b>sized</b> <b>desks</b> and chairs or their use of an alternate, less demanding position.

They hoped for the desks and chairs which height were higher than the proper size ones. 3) The desks and chairs of height at minus one level and proper size in JIS were bad evaluations from the consciousness investigation, such as "ease of use", "calm", "comfort", "likes and dislikes". On the other hand, the height at plus one, plus two and plus three level were good evaluations. Children hoped for higher desks and chairs from the viewpoint of consciousness. 4) The number of children who felt tiredness by lowering of the height of the desks and chairs had increased, and children felt a lot of tiredness in order of the back, the neck, the foot, the arm, and the waist...|$|R

The newscasts also premiered a new graphics package, though opting to keep the standard Sinclair grey and black lower third. All other graphics were changed to a new, high-tech Sinclair standard package. Only two Sinclair stations (WZTV and WGME) use this new package. WGME's new High Definition set includes two video display monitors on {{either end of the}} set for anchor stand up reporting, a 12 monitor video wall which can display 3 video feeds (2x2 each), 2 videos feeds (2x3 each), one large panoramic video feed (2x6 which they use for a graphic of the Portland skyline), or 12 individual video feeds (one per monitor). WGME also has a small anchor desk at the video wall for their FOX 23 broadcasts, [...] "Good Day Maine" [...] and [...] "News 13 on FOX" [...] at 10PM. Their main anchor desk is larger than the Fox 23 anchor desk, though includes a similar style of a light box base with wood carved around it, as well as over the light box. The anchor desk includes a large monitor behind the anchors which shows a skyline image of Portland, ME, or during weather tosses, the [...] "News 13" [...] logo with clouds behind it in blue and red colors. The entire set includes an array of light panels and light boxes. Behind the anchors on top of the light boxes are square black panels that zig-zag behind the anchor TV monitor. The set includes a wood style from a brand native to Maine. The weather office is now open and fully visible to the viewers. The weather office is to the viewer's right, which includes a similar <b>sized</b> <b>desk</b> as to the FOX 23 anchor desk, for the meteorologist to open and close weathercasts with. Behind the desk includes 9 computers to operate the weather graphics and forecasting system which are on a raised platform so that viewers can see the station's other meteorologists working on severe weather reports live. Above these computers are another four monitors which can either broadcast a single video feed (1×4) for a panoramic view of the Portland Skyline, or can be individually manipulated to show weather graphics above the meteorologist. The set also includes a larger green screen to the viewer's right of the weather set.|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigated}} {{the bottom line of}} hotel guest room design from two different angles; qualitative research on mass purchasers and quantitative research on individual hotel guests. The outcome of the researches support the findings of the literature studies that preceded the two filed researches. Finding out the necessary and sufficient hotel guest room condition from the viewpoint of the hotel guests was the main objective of this survey. The study result provides insights into the complexity and trade-offs in designing hotel guest room product offerings for various sub-segments of the mid-range urban hotels. Hotel guest room is the core product of the hotel industry, and an important marketing variable at the same time. Information on guest’s hotel guest room format choice will enable hoteliers and developers target specific customer groups with strategies premeditated to meet their need and preferences. 5 sessions of the semi-structured interviews with event organizers were conducted in order to collect mass purchasers’ views and experiences on hotels. Interview sessions with event organizers confirmed the general idea that hotel guests are not much interested in sustainability issue, even though they do know the importance of the matter. It has also found that hotel guests are not particularly opposing to the notion; the findings of the survey analyses indicate that a moderate guest room configuration can satisfy hotel guests. A typical guest room had been analyzed and divided in to 8 functional areas, that became 8 attributes of the survey questionnaire. The most important factors for the hotel guests were a proper management and a pleasant service, not the most luxurious guest room features. These findings assert {{that it is possible to}} perform a leaner and greener hotel development and the need of businesses’ leading on the making the hotel industry more sustainable and socially responsible. Discrete choice questions found the desk to be the most important factor for 3 star hotels. Window, bed, desk, and living found to be significantly important for 4 star hotels. In general, all the attributes except the bath were significantly important. When all the 8 attributes were presented together, the desk type found to be the most important factor followed by the bed arrangement. The most likely choice of 3 star hotel guests is consist of operable full height window, twin bed with design features, bath and separated toilet, single armchair with ottoman, small closet, extendable desk, small TV, and full height mini-bar. They find all the attributes almost equally important and the importance of the bed appeared to be rather lower than anticipated. The importance value of desk attribute is exceptionally high (25. 8 %). closet and entertainment had lower importances. The most likely choice of 4 star hotel is the room with operable full height window and balcony, a double bed with design features, a small shower stall, a large closet and luggage, double armchair, a medium <b>size</b> <b>desk,</b> swivel TV, and a full height mini-bar. Window, closet, & mini-bar found to be the least influential features, while bed and desk to be the most influential ones. The Conjoint questions 1 & 2 investigated on which part hotel guests put more value; size of the guest room or the view to the outside. When size and window were presented together, the room size accounted 70 % of vignette ratings, and the window showed 30 % of importance value. Interestingly, desk shows the highest importance value of all. During the qualitative research, significance of the desk was discussed many times. The outcome of the survey supports the discussion. Desk attribute carries 22. 9 % of importance and the most frequently chosen level was the medium <b>size</b> <b>desk.</b> Utilities and importances of attributes change significantly in relation with the demographic characteristics of the respondent. Characteristics of travel also found to have a significant correlation with the guest’s hotel guest room preference. Travel characteristics in this context refer the duration of each stay, room share, purpose of travel. However, no significant correlation between income/education level and the respondent’s preferences has found. Large difference among importance values were witnessed on the survey data analysis. For instance, entertainment showed 9. 6 % of importance while desk showed 22. 9 % importance. In other words, a desk that meets a guest’ expectation is much more likely to satisfy the guest than an impressive entertainment area arrangement. Likewise, poor condition or choice of desk design can disappoint a guest much more than an entertainment area that doesn’t meet the guest’ expectation. Design and layout of the hotel’s facilities affect its revenue operation potential, as well as guest satisfaction. The customer trade-offs identified with this research serve as an important input for conceptualization of a hotel property development. The research suggests the starting point of a competitive concept composition. Developers can refer to the sub-group studies and generate a customized guest room model. As an example, a hotel concept planning is presented. Hotel concept planning as such will be a valuable input for hotel developers, hoteliers, and valuers. Importance values imply which function should be fortified, which not. The data from this study can present a good direction for hotel businesses on performing renovations; on which part the focus should be set in relation with their guest characteristics. The knowledge obtained by this study will enable managers to select innovative offerings that are most beneficial to the firm and that will truly have an impact on customer’s choices. By understanding customer trade-offs, service firms will have a better market orientation with a resulting improvement in the firm performance. Real Estate & HousingArchitectur...|$|R
