[...] Upon cellular interaction and cross-signaling with their cognate follicular (Fo B) B cells, TFH cells trigger the formation and maintenance of germinal centers through the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and the secretion of IL-21 and IL-4. [...] TFH cells also migrate into these seeded germinal centers, predominantly composed of rapidly dividing and mutating B cells.

We have raised mAbs against rapidly shed molecules released from the cell surface of activated human leukocytes. Five mAbs, DREG- 55, - 56, - 110, - 152, and - 200, define an 80 - to 85 -kDa molecule involved in human lymphocyte recognition of peripheral lymph node (PLN) high endothelial venules (HEVs).

These studies suggested membrane lectins with specificity for galactosyl and mannosyl residues may be responsible for the binding of CFU-C to supporting stroma. To determine if CFU-C possesses <b>homing</b> <b>receptors</b> with these specificities, we induced agglutination in marrow cell suspensions with these neoglycoprotein probes.

40|$|Leukocyte {{adhesion}} to the endothelial venules in the pancreatic islets {{is thought}} {{to be one of the}} initial steps in the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Moreover, leukocyte attachment to the inflamed vessels within pancreatic sections could be inhibited by anti-L-selectin and anti-VLA- 4 antibodies. Interestingly, anti-L-selectin or anti-VLA- 4 antibody did not appear to influence the autoimmune response to a panel of pancreatic beta-cell autoantigens.

Using a panel of CD 4, Th 1 cell lines and clones, we compared the lymphocyte homing patterns of a Chlamydia-specific, protective clone (P-MoPn), a nonprotective clone (N-MoPn), and a keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) -specific cell line (KLH- 1). T cells were labeled with the fluorescent dye PKH- 26, adoptively transferred into Chlamydia-infected mice, and monitored at different time points throughout the course of a genital infection. We found that clones P-MoPn and N-MoPn migrated to similar extents to the genital tract and in significantly greater numbers than the KLH-specific T-cell line. Both clones and the KLH- 1 line expressed similar levels of the adhesion molecules α 4, β 1, CD 44, and CD 11 a.

Also, clones P-MoPn and N-MoPn but not the KLH- 1 line migrated to the mesenteric lymph node, suggesting a mucosal recirculation pattern. Moreover, blocking α 4 β 7 adhesion interaction in vivo significantly reduced the recruitment of P-MoPn but not KLH- 1 to the genital tract.

To investigate the possibility that homing receptors also play a role in the biology of lymphoid malignancies, the authors studied over 300 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by immunohistologic staining with Hermes- 1 and - 3, antibodies that define two distinct epitopes on the gp 85 - 95 putative <b>homing</b> <b>receptor</b> molecules. Furthermore, they directly compared expression of the Hermes- 3 antigen with clinical extent of disease in 57 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma. They found that staining of the various subtypes of lymphoma was heterogeneous, and in general correlated with patterns of expression seen in benign lymphoid populations. Essentially all normal lymphoid populations examined, except germinal center B cells and most cortical thymocytes, bear a high level of <b>homing</b> <b>receptor</b> antigen. Similarly, nearly all peripheral T-cell lymphomas, diffuse small cell lymphomas of B lineage, and plasma cell tumors were positive for <b>homing</b> <b>receptor</b> antigen (95 %, 97 %, and 100 %, respectively). Small noncleaved cell, follicular, and diffuse large cell lymphomas of B lineage, tumors having morphologic or immunologic features resembling germinal center cells, frequently failed to express Hermes-defined epitopes (81 %, 41 %, 25 % Hermes- 3 -, respectively). Antigen expression in T-lymphoblastic lymphomas strongly correlated with immunophenotypic subtypes: only 8 % of CD 4 +/CD 8 + were Hermes- 1 + versus 86 % of CD 4 -/CD 8 - and 43 % of CD 4 +/CD 8 -. Hermes- 3 expression by cases of diffuse, large cell lymphoma which showed generalized lymph node involvement (a pattern strongly suggestive of HEV-mediated spread; 100 % Hermes- 3 +, mean intensity 3. 4) was higher than that of cases with localized or multifocal, contiguous involvement (consistent with lymphatic spread; 69 % Hermes- 3 +, mean intensity 2. 2), but these differences did not achieve statistical significance.

The neoplastic B cells in the gastric tumor were alpha 4 beta 7 -, CD 62 L+, whereas the intestinal secondary was alpha 4 beta 7 +, CD 62 L-. Incubation of isolated tumor cells from the stomach by H. pylori generated T-cell-dependent proliferation of neoplastic B cells and induced expression of alpha 4 beta 7 integrin similar to the intestinal tumor. These observations indicate that reversal of <b>homing</b> <b>receptor</b> profile in the gastric tumor by antigen specific stimulation may be responsible for secondary intestinal dissemination. In normal stomach and normal MALT, alpha 4 beta 7 and CD 62 L expression reflected the differentiation of the B cell. Plasma cells were alpha 4 beta 7 +, CD 62 L-, whereas a subset of memory B cells were alpha 4 beta 7 -, CD 62 L+. <b>Homing</b> <b>receptor</b> expression in MALT lymphoma B cells was heterogeneous, however, in line with their memory B-cell phenotype in the majority of cases, the neoplastic B cells were alpha 4 beta 7 -, CD 62 L+.

Mycobacterium leprae specifically up-regulated the skin <b>homing</b> <b>receptor,</b> CLA, but not α 4 /β 7, the intestinal <b>homing</b> <b>receptor,</b> which decreased on T cells of patients with tuberculoid leprosy after antigen stimulation (2 · 2 -fold median decrease; range 1 · 6 – 3 · 4, n = 3). Our data indicate that CLA expression is regulated during the course of leprosy infection and suggest that T-cell responsiveness to a microbial antigen directs antigen-specific T cells to the site of infection...|$|E
40|$|Clinically, the IFN-α treated animals {{exhibited}} minimal disease, {{compared to}} the control group. These findings have been histologically confirmed. Using a variety of monoclonal antibodies, {{we were not able}} to demonstrate any differences for panCD 44 expression. The similar expression pattern of panCD 44 in the retina between control and IFN-α treated mice indicates that this expression may be not influenced by the applied IFN-α dosage. The panCD 44 <b>homing</b> <b>receptor</b> may be important for the regulation of EAU induction by CD 45 + and CD 3 + T-cells. Differences have been observed for CD 45 + infiltration between control and IFN-α treated animals. This may be an important hint to characterize their function by markers others than CD 8 and CD 4 specific antibodies, especially for their T-cell receptor (TCR) expression (α/β versus γ/δ). To identify further differences between IFN-α treated and control mice our analyses will be extended to antigen presenting cells (APC), especially to dendritic cells (DC) capable to regulate the Th 1 /Th 2 balance. Additionally, these analyses will be extended to cell adhesion molecules and/or <b>homing</b> <b>receptor</b> expression kinetics regulated by chemo-and cytokines. EAU induction experiments are presently performed with an increased IFN-α dosage correlating with the surface (m 2) of human beings to clarify our results...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that central–memory T cells (T CM cells), which express lymph node <b>homing</b> <b>receptors</b> CCR 7 and CD 62 L, are largely devoid of effector functions but acquire characteristics of effector–memory T cells (T EM cells) (i. e., CCR 7 � T helper [Th] 1 or Th 2 cells) after stimulation with T cell receptor agonists or homeostatic cytokines. Here {{we show that}} three chemokine receptors identify functional subsets within the human CD 4 � T CM cell pool. T CM cells expressing CXCR 3 secreted low amounts of interferon �, whereas CCR 4 � T CM cells produce...|$|R
40|$|Although several <b>homing</b> <b>receptors</b> {{are known}} to be {{differentially}} expressed by Tregs in lymphoid tissues compared with those found in peripheral tissues, it remains unclear whether these cells traffic between the two locations. In this issue of the JCI, Tomura et al. report steady-state Treg migration from the skin to draining LNs in mice. Furthermore, they report that not only does skin inflammation exacerbate LN-directed Treg homing, it also triggers reverse circulation of Tregs from LNs to skin, whereby these cells contribute to regulation of the immune response. These results now form a new framework for our understanding of Treg homing...|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, SEM images {{showed that}} there were <b>homing</b> <b>receptors</b> on microvilli-like tips on leukocytes that would allow white blood cells {{to get out of}} the blood vessel and get into tissue. Since the 1990s the {{identity}} of ligands involved in leukocyte extravasation have been studied heavily. This topic was finally able to be studied thoroughly under physiological shear stress conditions using a typical flow chamber. [...] Since the first experiments, a strange phenomenon was observed. Binding interactions between the white blood cells and the vessel walls were observed to become stronger under higher force. Selectins (E-selection, L-selection, and P-selectin) were found to be involved in this phenomenon.|$|R
