40|$|Prosthesis is used {{to provide}} an {{individual}} who has an amputated limb {{with the opportunity to}} perform functional tasks, particularly ambulation (walking). The basic components of these lower limb prostheses are the <b>foot-ankle</b> <b>assembly,</b> pylon (shank), socket and suspension system. The pylon, which commercially made from Stainless Steel or Titanium {{is used to}} connect the socket to the ankle-foot assembly. Today, transtibial amputees have an equal number of options available in the market to fit sprinting, skiing, golf and swimming sport. However, these high-tech prostheses can cost several thousand dollars in the West and amputees from low-income countries just could not afford to buy them. Referring to the ISPO consensus conference on appropiate technology in developing countries 1995, most rehabilitation research has targeted low cost foot-ankle assemblies 1. However, in this study, the commercial pylon (shank) will be replaced by using the bamboo...|$|E
40|$|Familiarity {{with the}} {{characteristics}} of current prosthetic <b>foot-ankle</b> <b>assemblies</b> will enable physical therapists to participate more effectively {{in the management of}} individuals with lower limb amputation. The {{purpose of this article is}} to inform therapists of the distinctions among various prosthetic devices, including their advantages and disadvantages. All foot-ankle prosthetic components support the wearer, absorb shock, and simulate toe extension passively. Articulated assemblies, such as the single-axis and multiple-axis feet, plantar flex easily after heel-strike; however, they have an unattractive gap at the ankle. Nonarti-culated components, such as the solid-ankle cushion heel foot, have various keel designs; energy-storing variants provide springiness for walking and running. Foot selection should reflect consideration of the patient's physical and psycho-logical attributes and financial resources. Training should be structured to enable the wearer to make use of all features of the component. More laboratory and clinical research on prosthetic feet should be conducted to provide objective data on foot function.
