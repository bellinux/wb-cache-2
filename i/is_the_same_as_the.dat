5000|$|The {{middle school}} uses a unique grading system. D, P, A, N, and W. [...] D stands for {{distinguished}} and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> an A+. P stands for Proficient and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> a A-. A stands for apprentice and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> a C. N stands for Novice and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> a D. W stands for warning and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> an F.

5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph {{can be described}} by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a {{directed graph}} that has no cycles.|$|E
5|$|Angle brackets, , {{indicate}} {{that there is a}} sequence of runes that cannot be interpreted with certainty. Other special signs are þ and ð, where the first one is the thorn letter which represents a voiceless dental fricative as th in English thing. The second letter is eth which stands for a voiced dental fricative as th in English them. The ʀ sign represents the yr rune, and ô <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Icelandic O caudata ǫ.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme rates {{depend on}} {{solution}} conditions and substrate concentration. To find {{the maximum speed}} of an enzymatic reaction, the substrate concentration is increased until a constant rate of product formation is seen. This {{is shown in the}} saturation curve on the right. Saturation happens because, as substrate concentration increases, {{more and more of the}} free enzyme is converted into the substrate-bound ES complex. At the maximum reaction rate (Vmax) of the enzyme, all the enzyme active sites are bound to substrate, and the amount of ES complex <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> total amount of enzyme.|$|E
50|$|All letters <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> Braille of {{the rest}} of the Nordic {{languages}} (excluding Sami languages, which is different). That is to say, ö in Icelandic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> ö in Swedish or ø in Danish; ð in Icelandic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> ð in Faroese. The differences, if any, are only in letters for punctuation. <b>The</b> base alphabet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> in French Braille.|$|R

5|$|In verses 8 through 14, the {{gathered}} gods acknowledge Devi's answer. They accept, states Devi Upanishad, {{that she is}} the Shakti, the Maha-vidya (the great knowledge), the Vedas, the power of Vishnu, she is the inspirer, she is the reason that gods were born, she is the love in the universe, the primordial source of universe, the bearer of thunderbolt, the cave, the wind, the cloud, the enchanting, the power of Self.

5|$|It is {{possible}} to take individual higher education courses in Commerce from the Business School in Kambsdalur and in Tórshavn. The alumni can work {{at the same time}} and take one course each semester. After three years they will have achieved 60 ECTS which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> first part of the HD education. They can also take the second part of the HD education from the Business College, and they can also combine it with courses from the Aarhus University via distant education. If they wish to study further for at MBA they must take it from a university in Denmark, i.e. the Aarhus University.|$|E
5|$|Multiple X-ray {{sources have}} since been {{detected}} in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory. Robin Barnard et al. hypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays. The spectrum of the neutron stars <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> hypothesized black holes but can be distinguished by their masses.|$|E

50|$|In brief, XLA is {{described}} in two steps: (1) give the 16 binary connectives the right geometry, the right shape value anatomy; and (2) add the transformational physiology, namely, apply the algebra of simple symmetry groups to the 16 iconic letter shape symbols. Change comes with a whisper. This whisper presents a triple isomorphism. <b>The</b> mental operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> logical operations. Said the other way around, <b>the</b> logical operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mental operations. Said again in a different order, <b>the</b> logical operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> mental operations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> symmetry operations. Here we have {{a prime example of}} cognitive ergonomics at its best. The single act of performing any one automatically performs the other two.|$|R

5|$|Since all PID bytes include four 0bits, {{they leave}} the bus in the full-bandwidth Kstate, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> low-bandwidth Jstate. It is {{followed}} by a brief pause, during which hubs enable their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the Jstate. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows, beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.|$|E
5|$|The air pistol range <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{air rifle}} range, giving each shooter a table, a 1metre wide firing point, and a 10-metre {{distance}} between the firing line and the target line. The current rules require ranges to be built indoors, with specified minimum requirements for artificial lighting. Many of the top-level competitions are held at temporary ranges installed in versatile sporting facilities or convention centres.|$|E
5|$|The duality between Eulerian and bipartite planar graphs can be {{extended}} to binary matroids (which include the graphic matroids derived from planar graphs): a binary matroid is Eulerian {{if and only if}} its dual matroid is bipartite. The two dual concepts of girth and edge connectivity are unified in matroid theory by matroid girth: the girth of the graphic matroid of a planar graph <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> graph's girth, and the girth of the dual matroid (the graphic matroid of the dual graph) is the edge connectivity of the graph.|$|E

5|$|The {{gravitational}} attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The {{same effect}} on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{time it takes to}} orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the solar terminator.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{a matrix}} A is {{the maximum number}} of linearly {{independent}} row vectors of the matrix, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> maximum number of linearly independent column vectors. Equivalently it is the dimension of the image of the linear map represented by A. The rank–nullity theorem states that the dimension of the kernel of a matrix plus the rank equals the number of columns of the matrix.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{missions}} {{in which the}} player controls a motor vehicle. Though the game engine <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> third-person mode, these missions are based on being in a vehicle. They usually involve getting to a certain location in a certain time period, often while avoiding pursuers while heading to the end point. Weapons {{can not be used}} while in a vehicle. While the PDA is not available in these mission types, a map of the city is. Cell phone calls are also sometimes received in these missions.|$|E

Effectively, that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21. Irrespective of state laws on underage consumption, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard prohibit the consumption of alcohol by underage personnel when stationed in the United States. Marines under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment.
