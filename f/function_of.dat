Method. The participants consisted of children aged 8 – 13, who, based on screening were labelled as high-anxious (n= 172) or median-anxious (n = 72). The high-anxious children {{were randomly assigned to}} a child-focused, parent-focused or non-intervention group. The Family System Test (FAST), a spatial placement technique, was used to determine cohesion, hierarchy and family structure of the participants, at pre-test and at 1 - and 2 -year follow-ups. Results. (1) Family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving an intervention did not improve more, than family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving no intervention; (2) Family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving a parent-focused intervention did not improve more, than family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children receiving a child-focused intervention; (3) Family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> median-anxious children was not better at all measurements, than family <b>functioning</b> <b>of</b> high-anxious children...|$|R
