Deficiencies in the existing standard with respect to spacecraft charge and discharge phenomena, the technical ramifications for generating a new standard, and the upgrading of MIL-STD- 1541 with requirements supplied {{as a result of}} the SCATHA program are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} QCD sum {{rules in the}} {{presence}} of external <b>elctromagnetic</b> fields is used to calculate the Ω magnetic moment μ_Ω^- and Σ^ 0 -Λ transition magnetic moment μ_Σ^ 0 Λ, with the susceptibilities obtained previously from the study of octet baryon magnetic moments.

40|$|We use QCD {{spectral}} sum {{rules to}} extract the Sigma_c and Lambda_c magnetic moments. The <b>elctromagnetic</b> field is treated as the external field. We adopt {{the value of the}} susceptibility chi=- 4. 5 GeV^{- 2 }, which is determined from an overall analysis of the octet baryon magnetic moments. Our result for Sigma_c is in agreement with the quark model prediction, while slight deviation exists from the Lambda_c. Comment: Latex file, two postscript figure...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic dipole {{absorption}} cross-sections of transitional nuclei with large-amplitude shape fluctuations are calculated in a microscopic way by introducing {{the concept of}} Instantaneous Shape Sampling. The concept bases on the slow shape dynamics {{as compared to the}} fast dipole vibrations. The <b>elctromagnetic</b> dipole strength is calculated by means of RPA for the instantaneous shapes, the probability of which is obtained by means of IBA. Very good agreement with the experimental absorption cross sections near the nucleon emission threshold is obtained. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Electromagnetic fields having various {{frequency}} {{are around}} us {{and the necessity of}} the study on EMC problems or on the effect of electromagnetic field on a human being has been more and more increasing. Authors have already contributed those problem by electromagnetic field of extremely low frequency like 50 Hz. However,this paper deals with the electromagnetic field and the evaluation of its induced current within a human body by a mobile phone as a problem of high frequency like 1 GHz and aims mainly at the study of evaluation method to those high frequency. Simulations by recent 3 D Finite Element Method are useful and applied both for <b>elctromagnetic</b> and heat transfer problems...|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I {{argue that the}} global {{privatisation}} of <b>elctromagnetic</b> spectrum marks this period as historically unique. I also put forward conceptual categories for understanding the nature of an emergent cybereconomy. They correspond to classical conceptions of property, value and labour, but in no way treat these categories as singular, simple or unproblematic. From a perspective informed largely by Marx’s critique of classical political economy, I frame {{the creation of a}} global cyberspace as the enclosure, or “privatisation”, of conscious activity. I argue that a full and formally defined cyberspace, at least as it is currenty conceived of, must prefigure the eventual alienation of human social existence at its most fundamental and definitive level: consciousness...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The papaer {{describes}} {{the measurement of}} the circuit impedance looking in to the pins of a automotive electronic control unit (ECU). The pins are categorised for circuit function as being inputs or outputs, with the ECU powered up or powered down and resulting data {{for each of the}} four categoris converted into a passive RLC equivalent form. These generalised end impedances are then used as part of a transmision line modl of the vehicle wiring system, in order to predict its absorbtion of radio frequency (RF) curent when illuminated by a radiated <b>elctromagnetic</b> field. It is found that the majority of impedances can be represented by RC models, with significant differences between the cases of ECU powered uo and powered down...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{fields of}} a massless charged {{particle}} are {{described by a}} gauge potential that is almost everywhere pure gauge. Solution of quantum mechanical wave equations {{in the presence of}} such fields is therefore immediate and leads to a new derivation of the quantum electrodynamical eikonal approximation. The <b>elctromagnetic</b> action in the eikonal limit is localised on a contour in a two-dimensional Minkowski subspace of four-dimensional space-time. The exact S-matrix of this reduced theory coincides with the eikonal approximation, and represents the generalisatin to electrodynamics of the approach of 't Hooft and the Verlinde's to Planckian scattering.

40|$|A {{maximum torque}} per ampere (MTPA) control based on virtual signal {{injection}} for interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with fast dynamic response is proposed in this paper. A small {{square wave signal}} is mathematically injected into current angle for accurately tracking MTPA points. The extracted derivative of <b>elctromagnetic</b> torque is utilized to compensate the initially set current angle to the real MTPA operation current angle. Due {{to the absence of}} bandpass and lowpass filters which are essential in the sinusoidal injected signal scheme, this method shows good dynamic response. By incorporating a modified equation for the torque after signal injection, the steady-state accuracy is also enhanced. The d- and q-axes current references are obtained through the current vector magnitude and optimal current angle instead of using the torque equation with nominal motor parameters, which guarantees the accuracy of the output torque. The proposed scheme is parameter independent and no real signal is injected to the current or voltage command. Thus, the problems of high-frequency signal injection method are avoided. A prototype is set up and experiments are carried out to verify effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{in order}} to develop the cast product of Al alloy having a {{globular}} microstructure by using the <b>elctromagnetic</b> (EM) stirrer, which was specially designed and manufactured to induce a various fluid flow type of melt during solidification, a morphlogy and size of primary solid phase of the solidifying slurry was investigated with respect to EM stirring condition such as an induced magnetic flux density (MFD) and a frequency of input current. The magnetic flux density of EM stirrer was measured by using a gaussmeter and its distribution and magnetic force within Al melt was simulated in ANSYS program. The induced MFD was increased with decreasing a frequency of input current at the same input voltage due to the increased penetrating depth of magnetic field. But, the magnetic force related directly with a stirring strength of melt was increased with the frequency. Both a roundness and size of primary α phase of Al alloy was decreased with increasing a frequency of input current and MFD within the experimental range. Therefore, the primary α phase was refined and globularized at the higher frequency and MFD...|$|E
40|$|The {{terahertz}} (THz) {{portion of}} the <b>elctromagnetic</b> spectrum bears an amazing scientific potential in astronomy. High resolution spectroscopy in particular heterodyne spectroscopy of molecular rotational lines and fine structure lines of atoms or ions is a powerful tool, which allows obtaining valuable information about the observed object such as temperature and dynamical processes as well as density and distribution of particular species. Two examples are the HD rotational transition at 2. 7 THz, and the OI fine structure line at 4. 7 THz. These lines are main targets to be observed with GREAT, the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahetz Frequencies, which will be operated on board of SOFIA. As part of the receiver development for about 2. 5 THz. The front-end of the receiver is integrated in a pulse tube cooler (PTC). It consists of a quantum cascade laser (QCL) as local oscillator and a phonon-cooled NbN hot electron bolometric mixer. The QCL is mounted on {{the first stage of}} the PTC and operates at a temperature of about 50 K while the HEB is mounted on the second stage of the PTC (temperature about 5 K). The performance of the QCL in terms of output power, beam profile, and frequency stability as well as the noise temperature of the HEB mixer will be presented. The influence of the PTC on the receiver performance as compared to a receiver where the mixer is cooled with liquid helium will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of {{processes}} in the propagation of electromagnetic fields. We do not aim at one particular problem, actually very different kinds of topics are analyzed here. We deal with direct problems as well as with inverse ones, low frequency electromagnetism is discussed and consequently the wave propagation problem in high frequency domain is studied. Study of electromagnetic materials and their behavior is of a huge interest for the technological world. Its importance originates from the increasing requirements for high performance devices as motors, transformers, radars, [...] . To improve character of electromagnets, new models, accurate numerical schemes and their rigorous analysis are needed to be worked out. In the first part we aimed at a time dependent eddy current equation of the magnetic field when a non-perfect contact of two different materials is considered on the boundary. The second part concerning the problems in the high-frequency domain includes the stuyd of <b>elctromagnetic</b> waves and propagation of energy through matter. These problems are mostly posed on an unbounded domain. To solve these problems we use the method of Artificial Boundary Condition (ABC) - widely used for wave problems since 1977. The third part of the thesis {{is devoted to}} the inverse problems in low-frequency electromagnetism. For a design of the material characteristics of the magnetic circuit, such as the electromagnetic loss P, the permeability µ and the electrical conductivity sigma, is essential. In this thesis, the missing material constant {{turns out to be a}} measure for the electromagnetic losses. The end of each part is devoted to numerical examples confirming the theoretical results. All the computations are performed using The Finite Element Toolbox ALBERT...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{various aspects}} of "electricity hypersensitivity" (EH). An empirical investigation {{of a group of}} persons suffering from EH was carried out, a part of the group being treated psychologically according to cognitive- behavioural principles in a controlled outcome study. The major findings concern an explanatory-model of EH, the the assessment of characteristics of EH-sufferers and the effects of the psychological treatment of EH. The explanatory model for the development and maintenance of EH can be summarized as follows. Persons suffering from symptoms for which they lack an explanation search for an explanation within and outside the medical system. If they consider EH to be a possible explanation, they test the hypothesis that this is the case through exposing themselves to electromagnetic fields and concomitantly performing self-observations in a manner making it probable that the experiencing of their symptoms will be intensified. They then attribute the intensification of their symptoms to electricity. Once their belief in their suffering from EH is established, they gradually develop a cognitive schema regarding EH, one that is self-validating. Belief in EH can lead to the experiencing of a variety of secondary symptoms. The characteristics of EH-sufferers on various psychometric measures appear to resmble much more those of a normal population than of a psychopathologic one. Certain characteristics suggest particular vulnerability to adverse stress-effects, which in turn could result in a proneness to develop EH. There was found to be a significant reduction in the degree of EH-suffering of patients trated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) as compared with controls (patients offered CBT treatment later). A conservative assessment of the treatment results indicated 50 % of those treated to be "cured" or at least reliably improved in the sense of their physical symptoms having disappeared or diminished and their no longer considering the symptoms they had or have to be due to their exposure to <b>elctromagnetic</b> fields. The treatment principles employed are described and questions of the adequate assessment of EH and the adequacy of outcome predictors are discussed, as are the characteristics of EH-sufferers. Suggestions are made for empirical testing of the explanatory-model advanced. It is argued that EH can be regarded as a variant of disorders that develop in connection with perceived environmental threats...|$|E
