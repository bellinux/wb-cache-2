5|$|Talks {{began on}} 30 April 1634, and the Treaty of Polyanovka {{was signed in}} May, {{putting an end to}} hostilities. The treaty {{confirmed}} the pre-war status quo, with Russia paying a large war indemnity (20,000 rubles in gold), while Władysław agreed to surrender his claim to the Russian throne and return the royal insignia to Moscow. Jasienica notes that from the Russian perspective it was likely that Władysław's abnegation of his claim was more <b>important,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the subsequent increase in internal stability, than the loss of disputed borderland. Despite not winning militarily, the Russians may have scored a diplomatic triumph. Other authors, such as Hellie, support this interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E

25|$|Water vapor is {{the most}} {{abundant}} greenhouse gas and also the most <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of its contribution to the natural greenhouse effect, despite having a short atmospheric lifetime (about 10 days). Some human activities can influence local water vapor levels. However, on a global scale, the concentration of water vapor is controlled by temperature, which influences overall rates of evaporation and precipitation. Therefore, the global concentration of water vapor is not substantially affected by direct human emissions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wider}} {{catchment}} the geology is more varied, {{ranging from the}} Precambrian rocks of the Charnwood Forest, through to the Jurassic limestone that forms the Lincolnshire Edge and the eastern watershed of the Trent. The most <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the river are the extensive sandstone and limestone aquifers that underlie many of the tributary catchments. These include the Sherwood sandstones that occur beneath much of eastern Nottinghamshire, the Permian Lower Magnesian limestone and the carboniferous limestone in Derbyshire. Not only do these provide baseflows to the major tributaries, the groundwater is an important source for public water supply.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{well-known}} sequences {{of the film is}} the scene of a train robbery at night time. Cinematographer Roger Deakins used various cinematographic techniques to give the train more of a presence when it was in pitch darkness.

On his final expedition he located a suitable port for the region, at present day Port Albert. The route established then by McMillan remains essentially the same major north-south route through Gippsland to this day. This route follows the Great Alpine Road south through the Tambo Valley to Bruthen, then east to Bairnsdale and Sale along the Princes Highway, then south from Sale to Port Albert.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} large river systems in New Guinea, {{including}} the Fly, Sepik and Mamberamo, which all {{are rich in}} fishes. The Fly River Basin, the most species rich river of the island, has 105 fish species, while the Sepik River Basin has 57 species. Among New Guinea's lake systems, the most <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of endemic fishes are Kutubu (13 endemics), Ajamaru (4 endemics), and Sentani (4 endemics). The gudgeons Oxyeleotris caeca from the upper Kikori River system in Papua New Guinea and O. colasi from the Lengguru area in Western New Guinea are the only described species of cave-adapted fish from the island.|$|E
25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over the bed, and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of mass balance. However, the bed material load (the bed load plus the portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from the bed) is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with the bed. As the bed load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|E

25|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism {{plays an}} important role in genome wide association studies because they act as primary biomarker. SNPs are currently the marker of choice due to their large numbers in virtually all populations of individuals. The location of these biomarkers can be tremendously <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of predicting functional significance, genetic mapping and population genetics. Each SNP represents a nucleotide change between two individuals at a defined location. SNPs are the most common genetic variant found in all individual with one SNP every 100–300 bp in some species. Since there is a massive number of SNPs on the genome, there is a clear need to prioritize SNPs according to their potential effect in order to expedite genotyping and analysis.|$|E
25|$|However {{the fuss}} about the reprint {{was little more}} than a storm in a teacup. Far more <b>important,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of publicising Wagner's anti-Jewish feelings, was his stream of essays and {{newspaper}} articles over the following years, up to and including that of his death in 1883, which directly or indirectly criticised Jewish individuals or the Jews as a whole. These coincided with the growth of antisemitism—in the sense of a movement to withdraw the civic rights extended to Jews during the 19th century, and particularly on the unification of Germany in 1870—as a significant force in German and Austrian politics. Antisemitic leaders indeed made approaches to Wagner requesting his support; although he never offered such support officially, neither did he dissociate himself from their policies.|$|E
25|$|Much Christian art {{borrowed}} from Imperial imagery, including Christ in Majesty, {{and the use}} of the halo as a symbol of sanctity. Late Antique Christian art replaced classical Hellenistic naturalism with a more abstract aesthetic. The primary purpose of this new style was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favor of geometric simplification, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. Icons of Christ, Mary and the saints, ivory carving, and illuminated manuscripts became important media – even more <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of modern understanding, as nearly all of the few surviving works, other than buildings, from the period consist of these portable objects.|$|E

25|$|The eye {{has limited}} {{bandwidth}} {{to the rest}} of the visual system, estimated at just under 8 Mbit/s. This manifests itself in a number of ways, but the most <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion. This illusion starts to work at about 16 frame/s, and common motion pictures use 24 frame/s. Television, using power from the electrical grid, tunes its rate in order to avoid interference with the alternating current being supplied – in North America, some Central and South American countries, Taiwan, Korea, part of Japan, the Philippines, and a few other countries, this is 60 video fields per second to match the 60Hz power, while in most other countries it is 50 fields per second to match the 50Hz power.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 15th century, {{growth in the}} Yuan name {{consistently}} outstripped that of the general population, but this rate has fallen below average {{over the past six}} centuries. This period has seen a resurgence of the Yuan name in northern provinces, so much so that Sichuan and Hebei are now the most <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of absolute population. The Yuan name is most populous as a percentage of local populations in the Yangtze Delta region, in northwestern Jiangxi and in the border region between Shaanxi and Sichuan. In 1994, for example, there were 97,400 Yuan in Shanghai, ranked 30th by population - slightly higher than the national average. In northeast China, Heilongjiang is home to concentrations in the southeast of the province as well as a lengthy strip along the Russian border. Generally speaking, the name is relatively absent in the farthest geographical extremes of China, namely southern Yunnan, Guangxi, and the island province of Hainan.|$|E
25|$|Venlafaxine is well absorbed, with {{at least}} 92% of an oral dose being absorbed into {{systemic}} circulation. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme to desvenlafaxine (O-desmethylvenlafaxine), which is just as potent a SNRI as the parent compound, meaning that the differences in metabolism between extensive and poor metabolisers are not clinically <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of efficacy. Side effects, however, are reported to be more severe in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. Steady-state concentrations of venlafaxine and its metabolite are attained in the blood within 3 days. Therapeutic effects are usually achieved within 3 to 4 weeks. No accumulation of venlafaxine has been observed during chronic administration in healthy subjects. The primary route of excretion of venlafaxine and its metabolites is via the kidneys. The half-life of venlafaxine is relatively short, so patients are directed to adhere to a strict medication routine, avoiding missing a dose. Even a single missed dose can result in withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
