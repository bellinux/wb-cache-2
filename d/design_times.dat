This led to very short <b>design</b> <b>times</b> (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.|$|E

Reuse reaches from the selecting cells from a library up to adapting already designed objects. In this paper, we present a new model for the reuse of design objects in CAD frameworks. Based on experiences in other disciplines, mainly in software engineering and case-based reasoning, we developed a feature-based model to describe design objects and their similarities. Our model considers generic modules as well as multi-functional units. We discuss the relationships of the model to the design process and to the configuration hierarchy of complex design objects. With the prototype system RODEO, we examined our model and demonstrated the integration in a common ECAD framework. 1. Introduction The complexity of designs increases rapidly.

30|$|To {{reduce the}} gap between the VLSI {{technology}} capability and the designer productivity, design reuse based on IP (intellectual properties) is commonly used. In terms of arithmetic accuracy, the generated architecture can generally only be configured through the input and output word lengths. In this paper, a new kind of method to optimize fixed-point arithmetic IP has been proposed. The architecture cost is minimized under accuracy constraints defined by the user. Our approach allows exploring the fixed-point search space and the algorithm-level search space to select the optimized structure and fixed-point specification.
