This control must be capable of accepting commands from a satellite telemetry system, verify that the correct commands have been sent and control the frequency to the requirements of the system. Several modifications must be performed to the rubidium vapor <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> to allow it to be compatible with the digital frequency control.

Introduction I N our laboratory the last absolute measurement of the frequency of a CO 2 laser stabilized on the absorption of OsO 4 was performed more than ten years ago [1], with a claimed uncertainty of 2 Δ 10 Γ 12, and confirmed by international comparison a few years later [2]. This laser was subsequently used as a <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> for the measurement of several frequencies in the near infrared [3], in the visible range [4] and in the ultraviolet [5].

40|$|The {{radiofrequency}} {{circuit of}} traditional miniature rubidium atomic <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> (RAFS) uses saturated output, which can stabilize the amplitude, {{but not the}} waveform, of the radiofrequency signal. This would lead to insufficient microwave power stability. In this study, an improved circuit for stabilizing power amplitude in miniature rubidium atomic <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> was described. The circuit took the bias voltage of step recovery diode (SRD) as a reference to achieve automatic gain control (AGC) through controlling the gain of the variable gain amplifier (VGA).

40|$|Because the GPS carrier-phase {{observation}} measurement is {{very precise}} in frequency transfer, {{it can be}} used to estimate performance of a remote frequency reference with respect to the national <b>frequency</b> <b>standard.</b> TL has already set up a prototype system for this purpose. The stability and accuracy of a DUT (device under test) at a remote site with traceability to TL’s <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> could be obtained after data processing. The prototype system includes the master site (herein at TL) and the remote site. At the remote site, the equipped GPS receiver runs with a DUT as its frequency reference. By performing the time difference (differences between two epochs) on carrier-phase observations, the DUT’s frequency offset with respect to the GPS <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> can be estimated. At the master site, the GPS receiver is referenced to TL’s <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> and the time difference and carrier-phase single difference (differences between two receivers at TL and the remote site) are performed at postprocessing. The frequency offset of the DUT relative to TL’s <b>frequency</b> <b>standard</b> can be estimated in this way. Observations from the remote site could be sent to TL via the Internet. As for the system arrangement, the IGS (International GPS Service) site TWTF at TL serves as the master site and a single-frequency GPS receiver is adopted at the remote site to cost down expenses of system set up. Data analysis is done by the lab-developed software. A common-clock short-baseline test (using TL’s <b>frequency</b> <b>standard)</b> and a 270 -km baseline test (using a high-performance 5071 A cesium clock as the remote frequency reference) were carried out to find the system’s performance.
