Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy turnstone, red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the <b>hoary</b> <b>redpoll,</b> common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur.

50|$|The Arctic redpoll (Acanthis hornemanni), {{known in}} North America as the <b>hoary</b> <b>redpoll,</b> is a bird {{species in the}} finch family Fringillidae. It breeds in tundra birch forest. It has two subspecies, A. h. hornemanni (Greenland or Hornemann's Arctic redpoll) of Greenland and {{neighbouring}} parts of Canada, and A. h. exilipes (Coues's Arctic redpoll), which breeds in the tundra of northern North America and Eurasia. Many birds remain in the far north; some birds migrate short distances south in winter, sometimes travelling with common redpolls.|$|E

2500|$|No {{fewer than}} 287 {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} on the island. In spring (May through mid-June) and fall (August through October), many rare birds, including Siberian vagrants, may be spotted on the island. [...] The cliffs of Saint Paul, Saint George and Otter Island support large numbers of breeding seabirds, including critical nesting habitat for the very range-restricted red-legged kittiwake. [...] The auk family is well represented here, with horned and tufted puffin, thick-billed and common murre, parakeet, crested and least auklets and ancient murrelet occurring as breeders, and several other species occurring as vagrants or seasonal visitors. [...] Breeding ducks include long-tailed duck, northern pintail, and green-winged teal. [...] Breeding shorebirds include semipalmated plover, the Pribilof subspecies of rock sandpiper, least sandpiper and red-necked phalarope. [...] Breeding landbirds are few, but include insular subspecies of gray-crowned rosy finch and Pacific wren, snow bunting, Lapland longspur, and the occasional <b>hoary</b> or common <b>redpoll,</b> or common raven.

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of redpolls is unsettled, with several different very closely related forms of redpolls {{which have been}} considered as anything from one to five species. Some studies favour three species, but this is certainly not definite. Global lists currently support either two species (Common and <b>Hoary</b> <b>Redpoll)</b> or a single species (Common Redpoll). Most recently, genomewide analyses found differences in gene expression but no genetic divergence, suggesting that plumage forms have originated recently, within a single interbreeding lineage, and do not represent species boundaries.|$|E
50|$|Holbøll {{served as}} Royal Inspector of Colonies and Whaling in North Greenland (1825-1828), then Inspector of South Greenland (1828-1856). While in this post he became {{interested}} in natural history. His main contribution was to send large amounts of faunistic collections to the zoologists in Copenhagen. For example, professor Johannes Theodor Reinhardt described the North American form of the red-necked grebe and named it Podiceps holboellii (now Podiceps grisegena holboellii). Holbøll himself also wrote a treatise on Greenlandic birds. In the paper, he described the <b>hoary</b> <b>redpoll</b> (Linota hornemanni, now known as Carduelis hornemanni), which he named for the botanist Jens Wilken Hornemann. Hornemann had previously received plant collections from Holbøll and named a new species Arabis holboellii (now known as Boechera holboellii).|$|E

40|$|On 5 February 1982 I {{observed}} and photographed a <b>Hoary</b> <b>Redpoll</b> (Carduelis hornemanni) at the bird feeders of Mike Manning. Mike lives approximately 3 {{miles north of}} Ames, Dodge Co., Nebraska (R- 7 -E, T 18 -N, sec. 28). This bird was first seen, by Mike, on 3 February, in a mixed flock of approximately 300 American Goldfinches (Carduelis tristis), 50 Pine Siskens (Carduelis pinus), and 6 Common Redpolls (Carduelis flammea). The bird was seen repeatedly by me, Mike Manning, Bob Manning, and John Manning. Normally the flock would start feeding about 7 : 30 AM and feed on and off until nearly 3 : 30 PM...|$|E

40|$|As far as {{the birds}} are concerned, this was an uneventful winter, {{with only a few}} rarities. Highlights include the second pile-up of rare gulls at L. McConaughy, and a Common Redpoll influx. Best of the rarities (all subject to Records {{committee}} scrutiny and pending its acceptance) were a 5 th record Red-necked Grebe at L. McConaughy; a first-record Mew Gull at L. McConaughy; Iceland, Lesser Black-backed, and Great Black-backed Gulls at L. McConaughy; a Cassin’s Finch at Crawford; White-winged Crossbills at Norfolk and North Platte; and a <b>Hoary</b> <b>Redpoll</b> at Wakefield. Out-of-season reports were record-early Blue-winged Teal in Dixon Co, Franklin 2 ̆ 7 s Gull in Lancaster Co, record-late Bonaparte 2 ̆ 7 s Gulls at Sutherland Res, and 2 nd-record wintering Great-tailed Grackles at Lincoln...|$|E
40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} unremarkable {{except for the}} occurrence of good numbers of several species at {{the western edge of}} the state, notably Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Pygmy Nuthatch, and Bohemian Waxwing. There were a couple of sightings of Mountain Chickadee and one of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch for good measure. All of the winter finches on the Nebraska list (except for <b>Hoary</b> <b>Redpoll)</b> appeared, most notably Pine Grosbeak, represented by two birds. One of these was in the southwest (Kansas had several reports) but the other was in the east, suggesting either multiple points of origin, or, as suggested by some in Kansas, northern rather than western origin. Also in good numbers were Red-breasted Nuthatches, but Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows were scarce. Black-capped Chickadees remained in very low numbers in southern Nebraska west of the Missouri River Valley. Of interest was the discovery of wintering Marsh and Winter Wrens along the central Niobrara Valley; perhaps this is a regular occurrence, but who 2 ̆ 7 s been looking? This phenomenon may be linked to other occurrences that would be expected in a warmer winter: several species of ducks that are generally not seen in midwinter were found on the Scottsbluff and Gering Sewage Lagoons, sapsuckers were in good numbers, catbirds and Brown Thrashers put in unexpected winter appearances, and a Loggerhead Shrike was far to the north. Notable sightings were several, ranging from huge counts to birds rare in winter but expected at other times to bona fide rarities, although the last is a matter of one 2 ̆ 7 s definition of rare. Best sightings in these categories were probably the 2, 000, 000 Snow Geese reported (half the North American population), 4 Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, a financially savvy Sharp-tailed Grouse, a first-documented Dec Osprey, 3 rd-latest Least Sandpipers, Great Black-backed and lceland Gulls, first winter record for White-winged Dove, 9568 crows and 10, 216 robins at Calamus Res, White-winged Crossbill, and, of course, 2 Pine Grosbeaks...|$|E
