40|$|BACKGROUND: Delivering {{drugs in}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> is {{essential}} {{to the success of the}} strategy of artemisinin-based combination therapy. This prevents one drug being taken without the protection of the other, reducing the chance of emergence and spread of drug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. A lower tablet burden should also facilitate adherence to treatment. A new <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of mefloquine plus artesunate has been developed. This was compared with the conventional regimen of separate tablets for the treatment of uncomplicated multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria. METHODS: On the north-western border of Thailand 500 adults and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomized to receive either the new <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> or separate tablets. They were followed up weekly for 63 days. RESULTS: The day 63 polymerase chain reaction-adjusted cure rates were 91. 9 % (95 % CI 88. 2 - 95. 6) in the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> group and 89. 2 % (85. 0 - 93. 4) in the loose tablets group (P= 0. 3). There was a lower incidence of early vomiting in the group receiving the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination.</b> CONCLUSION: This new <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of mefloquine and artesunate was efficacious, well tolerated and convenient to administer...|$|R

METHODS: A retrospective, non-randomized, and descriptive clinical study was performed with 182 eyes diagnosed with POAG. Patients were divided into three groups:a group with <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of dorzolamide/timolol only, a second group with prostaglandin analogs plus <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of dorzolamide/timolol, and a third group with the addition of brimonidine to the same <b>fixed</b> <b>combination.</b> IOP data were gathered retrospectively and the differences between groups were calculated. RESULTS: IOP was reduced satisfactorily in all three groups; however, a progressive IOP reduction was noted in the group with the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> plus prostaglandin analogs. In this group, a progressive, significant and more homogeneous response of the reduction was noted in comparison with the other groups. CONCLUSION: IOP reduction was efficacious in all three groups. The addition of prostaglandin analogs showed progressive IOP reduction, progressive response and absence of long-term drift. Brimonidine did not show a significant additive effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The LOTHAR study {{evaluated}} {{medium and}} long term (one year) efficacy, tolerability and metabolic effects of the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of amlodipine and losartan compared to amlodipine or losartan alone. METHODS: Brazilian multicenter, randomized, double-blind and comparative trial performed with 198 patients in stage 1 and 2 essential hypertension. RESULTS: The <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> has a high antihypertensive efficacy that is sustained {{in the long term}} with very low percentage of loss of blood pressure control. This percentage is incidentally lower than that of the two monotherapy comparative regimens. In the long term, more than 60 % of the patients treated with the <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> remained with DBP ≤ 85 mmHg, and the antihypertensive effect, when assessed by ABPM persisted for 24 hours with a trough-to-peak ratio of 76. 7 %.

The <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> did not change glucose and lipid metabolism in the medium or in the long term. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we can say that the combination of amlodipine and losartan - the first <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker available in the pharmaceutical market, is an excellent option for the treatment {{of a wide range of}} hypertensive patients...|$|R

Several studies show that the use of perphenazine with fluoxetine (Prozac) in patients with psychotic depression is most promising, although fluoxetine interferes with the metabolism of perphenazine, causing higher plasma levels of perphenazine and a longer half-life. In this combination the strong antiemetic action of perphenazine attenuates fluoxetine-induced nausea and vomiting (emesis), as well as the initial agitation caused by fluoxetine.

Material and methods. Patients (n= 75) with moderate hypertension (HT) accompanied by type 2 diabetes (DM) were studied. The patients were randomized in groups A, B or C. Patients of group A (n= 25) received a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of the original perindopril+indapamide, patients of group B (n= 30) — a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of the generic enalapril+indapamide, patients of group C (n= 20) — a <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of the original enalapril+hydrochlorothiazide. Office BP was examined within the 4, 8 and 12 weeks, EDVD and MAU were determined initially and after 12 weeks of therapy. CER was also calculated. Results. The maximal antihypertensive effect was observed in group C (systolic BP (SBP) decreased in 46. 6 ± 1. 3 mm Hg), followed by group A (SBP decreased in 43. 1 ± 0. 8 mm Hg) and B (SBP decreased in 40. 0 ± 0. 8 mm Hg). The groups were distributed as follows (in descending order) : according to EDVD rise - group A (Δ 4. 52 %), C (Δ 3. 14 %) B (Δ 3 %); according to MAU prevalence rate reduction - group A (from 48 % to 8 %), B (from 40 % to 23 %) and C (from 40 % to 25 %). The “C” combination provided the lowest cost of BP reduction (12. 33 rubles/mm Hg) and correction of MAU prevalence rate (1 514 rubles/case).

Objective: To assess efficacy, tolerability {{and safety of}} the preservative-free <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of tafluprost 0. 0015 %/timolol 0. 5 % in a real-life setting. Methods: Intraocular pressure (IOP) was recorded for each eye at baseline (any previous therapy or untreated) and 4 – 16 weeks after changing medical treatment to or initiating treatment with the preservative-free <b>fixed</b> <b>combination</b> of tafluprost 0. 0015 %/timolol 0. 5 %.
