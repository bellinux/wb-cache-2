40|$|A new {{approach}} to designing a broadband and highly efficient class-E power amplifier based on nonlinear shunt capacitance analysis is proposed. The nonlinear shunt capacitance method accurately extracts optimum class-E power amplifier parameters, including an <b>external</b> <b>shunt</b> capacitance and an output impedance, at different frequencies. The dependence of the former parameter on the frequency is considered to select an optimal value of <b>external</b> <b>shunt</b> capacitor. Then, upon determining the latter parameter, an output matching network is optimized to obtain the highest efficiency across the bandwidth of interest. An analytical approach is presented to design the broadband class-E power amplifier of a MOSFET transistor.

40|$|Many superconducting {{technologies}} such as rapid single flux quantum computing (RSFQ) and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) rely on the modulation of nonlinear dynamics in Josephson junctions for functionality. More recently, however, superconducting devices have been developed based on the switching and thermal heating of nanowires for use in fields such as single photon detection and digital logic. In this paper, we use resistive shunting to control the nonlinear heating of a superconducting nanowire and compare the resulting dynamics to those observed in Josephson junctions. We show that interaction of the hotspot growth with the <b>external</b> <b>shunt</b> produces high frequency relaxation oscillations with similar behavior as observed in Josephson junctions due to their rapid time constants and ability to be modulated by a weak periodic signal. In particular, we use a microwave drive to pull and mix the oscillation frequency, resulting in phase locked features that resemble the AC Josephson effect.

40|$|Approximately 5, 000 {{people in}} the United States have life {{maintained}} by chronic hemodialysis [1].

Yet, infection, clotting, thrombosis, and bleeding with an <b>external</b> <b>shunt</b> still remain a substantial cause of morbidity [3]. A surgically created subcutaneous arteriovenous fistula obviates many of these complications [4]. A side-to-side fistula between the radial artery and the cephalic vein was advocated originally, but symptoms and signs of arterial insufficiency in the digits distal to the fistula developed in some patients [5]. The digital perfusion abnormalities resulted from a decrease in antegrade flow in the radial artery beyond the fistula and retrograde flow of blood out of the hand via the radial artery distal to the fistula site [6]. Perfusion of the fistula hand was entirely from the ulnar artery, {{and most of the}} blood entering the digits via the palmar arches was “stolen” from the hand by the low resistance fistula [7].
