500|$|As MP for Bristol South East, Benn helped organise the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott {{against the}} colour {{bar of the}} Bristol Omnibus Company against {{employing}} Black British and British Asian drivers. Benn {{said that he would}} [...] "stay off the buses, even if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a bike", and Labour leader Harold Wilson also told an anti-apartheid rally in London he was [...] "glad that so many Bristolians are supporting the [...] campaign", adding that he [...] "wish them every success".|$|E

6000|$|Harry coughed, while Lee said hoarsely: [...] "I {{thank the}} Lord for it; lass, thou hast acted cruelly, but we'll {{say no more}} of that. I've left all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> thee, and now I'm only glad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The only fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{with you}} Westerners is that you're rather apt to overrate yourselves. I suppose they let young Crestwick {{in a good}} deal deeper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, {{you are so}} hard on your brothers! It is {{the only}} fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with you. You are the sweetest temper in the world, but you are so tetchy with your brothers." ...|$|E

60|$|But the glider {{brought me}} up smartly. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out {{how these things}} went down the air, {{and the only way}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out is <b>to</b> go down with one. And for a time I wouldn't face it.|$|R

5000|$|... "Jeremy Flint is very talented, and a {{beautiful}} dummy player and defender. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a fault in his game it would be slowness {{and the fact that}} he is easy to play against. Otherwise he approaches world class." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is a nice}} boy," [...] I said. [...] "I don't {{really think}} I know a nicer boy than Dick; and clever, {{when you come to}} {{understand}} him. There is only one fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with Dick: I don't seem able to get him to work." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot imitate you," [...] said Gwendolen, {{recovering}} {{her tone}} of artificial vivacity. [...] "To be middling {{with me is}} another phrase for being dull. And the worst fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with the world is, that it is dull. Do you know, I am going to justify gambling in spite of you. It is a refuge from dullness." ...|$|E

[...] "But you mustn't put a spoke i' the wheel about the washin,' if we can't get a school near enough. That's the fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> wi' you, Bessy; {{if you see}} a stick i' the road, you're allays thinkin' you can't step over it.

6000|$|... "Poor little Minette," [...] Pierre Leroux said. [...] "You are {{too hard}} upon her altogether, Cuthbert. The girl is a born actress {{and would make}} her fortune on the stage. She can represent, by the {{instinct}} of art, passions which she has never felt. She can be simple and majestic, a laughing girl and a furious woman, a Christian martyr and a bacchanal, simply because she has mobile features, intelligence, sentiment, emotion, and a woman's instinct, that is all. She is a jolly little girl, and the only fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with her {{is that she has}} the bad taste to prefer that gloomy American to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS. Yes, {{if you are}} to {{be judged}} as you judge others. From the {{conventional}} point of view, there's nothing {{to be said for}} you, Julia--nothing. That's why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> some other point of view to save my self-respect when I remember how I have loved you. Oh, what I have learnt from you!--from you, who could learn nothing from me! I made a fool of you; and you brought me wisdom: I broke your heart; and you brought me joy: I made you curse your womanhood; and you revealed my manhood to me. Blessings forever and ever on my Julia's name! (With genuine emotion, he takes her hand to kiss it again.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Moss, [...] "I don't think I {{should like}} my husband if he hadn't got any wits of his own, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{head-piece}} for him. It's a deal {{easier to do}} what pleases one's husband, than to be puzzling what else one should do." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....I guess I've {{been lucky}} {{that most of}} the time I've been in the same {{direction}} as the director. I try to work with directors whose work I like and find interesting.

5000|$|When Vladimir Lucien was {{questioned}} about the overall message behind his first published book, Sounding Ground, he was wary of ascribing {{too much to}} [...] "essentialism thinking".

6000|$|... "I {{have liked}} it well enough hitherto, but this last {{adventure}} has sickened me. Oh! it was dreadful. Had I {{not been very}} strong I could never have endured it; a nervous woman would have been driven mad. Yes, I have liked it well enough; I have always looked upon it as a preparation for life. I think that the society of nature is the best education for the society of man, since until you understand and are in sympathy with the one, you cannot really understand the other. Now I should {{like to go to}} Europe and see the world and its civilisations, for I know from what stuff they were evolved. But perhaps I never shall; at any rate, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> my dear father first," [...] and she sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he began}} apologetically, [...] "she didn't ask me; but one morning--and it WAS cold--I found {{her on the}} station shivering, not able to keep still; so I {{asked her if she}} was well wrapped up. She said: 'I think so.' So I said: 'Have you got warm underthings on?' And she said: 'No, they were cotton.' I asked her why on earth she hadn't got {{something}} thicker on in weather like that, and she said because she HAD nothing. And there she is--a bronchial subject! I HAD to take her and get some warm things. Well, mother, I shouldn't mind the money if we had any. And, you know, she OUGHT to keep enough to pay for her season-ticket; but no, she comes to me about that, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the money." ...|$|E
60|$|And here I {{must ask}} you to learn with me {{a little piece of}} Roman history. I say, to learn with me, because I don't know any Roman history except the two first books of Livy, and little bits here and there of the {{following}} six or seven. I only just know enough about it {{to be able to make}} out the bearings and meaning of any fact that I now learn. The greater number of modern historians know, (if honest enough even for that,) the facts, or something that may possibly be like the facts, but haven't the least notion of the meaning of them. So that, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out everything that I want in Smith's dictionary, like any schoolboy, I can usually tell you the {142} significance of what I so find, better than perhaps even Mr. Smith himself could.|$|E
5000|$|Since I {{was little}} I sang and {{took part in}} all I could ... until one day, when I was about eight, I was chosen Queen of the Los Mochis Carnival after my mom entered me in the pageant. ...

6000|$|Well, {{he put on}} {{the best}} of his coats--a blue; and I thought it my duty to ask him whether he'd want his frock again: he was good natured and said, [...] "Take it and be hanged to you." [...] Half-past eleven o'clock came, and I was sent to look out at the door, if there were any {{suspicious}} charicters (a precious good nose <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a bailiff out, I can tell you, and an i which will almost see one round a corner); and presenly a very modest green glass coach droave up, and in master stept. I didn't in corse, appear on the box; because, being known, my appearints might have compromised master. But I took a short cut, and walked as quick as posbil down to the Rue de Foburg St. Honore, where his exlnsy the English ambasdor lives, and where marridges are always performed betwigst English folk at Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that a workman's wife charing is a better institution. No. 1, a pet of Miss Nugent's, was a nice creature, but the London air did for her at once. No. 2, also from Micklethwayte, instantly set up a young man, highly respectable, and ready to marry on the spot, as they did, though their united ages don't amount to thirty-nine. No. 3 was a Cockney, and couldn't stay because the look-out was so dull; and No. 4 gossiped with her kind when I thought her safe in the Temple Gardens with Billy, whereby he caught the whooping-cough, and as she also took the liberty of wearing my fur cloak, and was not particular as to accuracy, we parted on short notice; and I got this woman to come in every day to scrub, help make the bed, etc. It is much less trouble, and the only fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with her is an absolute incapability of discerning blacks. I believe she thinks I have a monomania against them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is able to}} sit up, but {{of course}} she cannot walk yet. However, she is very well able to get on without me now, for her {{daughter}} has come home for her vacation. And I am thankful to be back, Mrs. Doctor, dear. Matilda's leg was broken and no mistake, but her tongue was not. She would talk the legs off an iron pot, that she would, Mrs. Doctor, dear, though I grieve to say it of my own sister. She was always a great talker and yet {{she was the first}} of our family to get married. She really did not care much about marrying James Clow, but she could not bear to disoblige him. Not but what James is a good man--the only fault <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> with him is that he always starts in to say grace with such an unearthly groan, Mrs. Doctor, dear. It always frightens my appetite clear away. And speaking of getting married, Mrs. Doctor, dear, is it true that Cornelia Bryant is going to be married to Marshall Elliott?" ...|$|E
