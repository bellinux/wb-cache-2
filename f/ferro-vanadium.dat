5000|$|A. B. Frenzel {{discovered}} vanadium-bearing sandstone near Placerville in {{the late}} 1890s. The ore was in strataform bodies in the Entrada Sandstone (Jurassic) east of the town. The principal mineral was roscoelite, with minor montroseite and carnotite. By the fall of 1899, development was described as [...] "of the most superficial character," [...] although Frenzel had driven one tunnel 18 feet into the rock. [...] By 1901-1902, Frenzel was excavating several thousand tons intended for shipment to Europe. [...] Most of the Placerville ore was less than 3% vanadium, too low grade to pay for shipment to Europe, so in 1905 the Vanadium Alloys Co. built an ore-processing mill southeast of Placerville to recover the metal as <b>ferro-vanadium,</b> which it sold. [...] At least five mines were active at one time, and by 1919 the two ore mills at Placerville were producing 30% of the world's vanadium. [...] Through 1940, the mines produced about 3.7 million pounds of vanadium. Although carnotite was recognized as a minor constituent of the ore since its discovery, the amount was small, and no assays were made of the uranium content of the ore until World War II. [...] Beginning about 1950, the small uranium content of the ore was also recovered from the ore.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermo-reactive {{diffusion}} (N and V) on AISI 1020 steel {{has been}} obtained by an initial gas nitriding followed by vanadizing. Vanadizing {{was performed by}} pack method in the powder mixture consisting of <b>ferro-vanadium,</b> ammonium chloride and alumina at the temperatures of 800, 900 and 1000 oC for 1 - 4 hours. The properties of the diffusion layers, namely microstructure and phase composition, have been studied. The influence of temperature and treatment time on thickness of vanadized layer and its phase composition has been determined. By increasing the temperature and treatment time with V on the steel substrate, the depth of vanadium nitride formed on steel samples changed between 5. 16 µm to 16. 77 µm. The micro-hardness value of vanadium nitride layers is 1855. 8 ± 74. 24 HV 0. 025. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the presence phases formed in the vanadium nitride layers on the steel samples are VN and V 2 N...|$|E
