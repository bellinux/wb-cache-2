5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the <b>estimated</b> <b>position</b> of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the <b>estimated</b> <b>position</b> of the Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies {{settled down to}} rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's <b>estimated</b> <b>position.</b> These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{computer}} model of atmospheric radar backscatter {{is used to}} investigate and compare various Spaced Antenna (SA) analysis techniques. These techniques include the Full Correlation Analysis (FCA) and radar Interferometry techniques. The results illustrate that the interferometric velocities increase with increasing turbulence, predicting the model input velocity only for zero turbulence. On the other hand, the FCA True velocity proves to be an excellent estimate of the model input velocity at all values of turbulence. Maps illustrating the interferometry <b>estimated</b> scattering <b>positions</b> superimposed upon the actual model scatterer <b>positions</b> reveal the <b>estimated</b> <b>positions</b> to be inaccurate.

500|$|As {{the weather}} grew worse Bartlett ordered {{supplies}} {{and equipment to}} be transferred onto the ice, both to lighten the ship and as a precaution should it be necessary to abandon the vessel in a hurry. Food supplies were augmented by seal hunts—two or three seals a day was the average bag, according to McKinlay—and by a single polar bear that had wandered near the ship in mid-November. On 15 November Karluk reached 73°N, the most northerly point of its drift, and then began moving south-west, {{in the general direction}} of the Siberian coast. By mid-December the <b>estimated</b> <b>position</b> was [...] from Wrangel Island. Despite the bleak outlook—Bartlett was privately convinced that Karluk would not survive the winter— a determined effort was made to celebrate Christmas, with decorations, presents, a programme of sports on the ice, and a banquet. By then they were just [...] north of Herald Island, a rocky outpost east of Wrangel Island; on 29 December land was visible in the distance, though whether this was Herald Island or Wrangel Island was not clear. The sighting of land briefly raised morale, but in the New Year the ice began breaking up and forming pressure ridges. Over the next few days, wrote McKinlay, [...] "the twanging, drumming, ominous ice sounds got louder and nearer." ...|$|E

2500|$|The sailing {{orders were}} {{rendered}} useless by the weather, but the miscalculation of the Armada's position contributed greatly to its destruction. The navigators {{were unaware of}} the effect of the eastward flowing Gulf Stream, which must have hindered the fleet's progress - perhaps by as much as 30km a day. The paymaster of the San Juan Bautista, Marcos de Aramburu, recorded a log of his progress from late August onwards, {{when the rest of the}} fleet was within sight. The inference from his observations is that his ship's <b>estimated</b> <b>position</b> as it turned for home was entirely wrong, some 480km to the west: its real position lay in the east, perilously close to the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. This single deficiency [...] "made the difference between safety and disaster".|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the TSSG <b>estimate,</b> target <b>positions</b> and tracks are also computed from the TSSG.
