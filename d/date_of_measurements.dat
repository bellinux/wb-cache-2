30|$|Some S. asper subsp. asper plants {{appeared}} in mulched containers {{on the last}} measuring date (23 October). This was probably (Fig.  2 c) caused {{by the loss of}} resistance to puncturing on the film that became very rigid and/or by the damage caused to the mulch structure by E. montanum plants. When mulch started to degrade, it also became partially vulnerable to root penetration of some weed species whose seeds were naturally disseminated on the mulch. This was particularly evident with of Chamaesyce maculata (L.) Small, Erigeron sumatrensis Retz., Oxalis corniculata L., and Taraxacum officinale Weber, that reached a maximum frequency higher than one plant per container. Chamaesyce maculate and E. sumatrensis are considered alien plants of the Italian vascular flora. The time of the first appearance of most of these weed species was after 29 July. On 23 October, the number of live C. maculate plants was significantly higher in NIS–NC and NIS–M containers than in the other treatments. Similar, results were also found for O. corniculata (L.). On the last <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements,</b> IS–M containers had the higher number of E. sumatrensis than the other treatments.

40|$|The {{application}} of methods based on measurements of photosynthesis efficiency {{is now more}} and more popular and used {{not only for the}} evaluation of the efficiency of herbicides but also for the estimation of their phytotoxicity to the cultivated crop. These methods enable to determine also dif­fe­ren­ces in the sensitivity of cultivars and/or hybrids to individual herbicides. The advantage of these methods consists above all in the speed and accuracy of measuring. In a field experiment, the sensitivity of several selected grain maize hybrids (EDENSTAR, NK AROBASE, NK LUGAN, LG 33. 30 and NK THERMO) to the herbicide CALLISTO 480 SC + ATPLUS 463 was tested for a period of three years. The sensitivity to a registered dose of 0. 25 [*]l .  ha− 1 + 0. 5 [*]% was measured by means of the apparatus PS 1 meter, which could measure the reflected radiation. Measurements of sensitivity of hybrids were performed on the 2 nd, 3 rd, 4 th, 5 th and 8 th day after the {{application of}} the tested herbicide, i. e. in the growing stage of the 3 rd– 5 th leaf. Plant material was harvested using a small-plot combine harvester SAMPO 2010. Samples were weighed and converted to the yield with 15 [*]% of moisture in grain DM. The obtained three-year results did not demonstrate differences in sensitivity of tested hybrids to the registered dose of the herbicide CALLISTO 480 SC + ATPLUS 463 (i. e. 0. 25 [*]l .  ha− 1 + 0, 5 [*]%). Recorded results indicated that for the majority of tested hybrids the most critical were the 4 th and the 5 th day after the application; on these days the average PS 1 values were the highest at all. In years 2005 and 2007, none of the tested hybrids exceeded the limit value 15 (which indicated a certain decrease in the efficiency of photosynthesis). Although in 2006 three of tested hybrids showed a certain decrease in photosynthetic activity (i. e. EDENSTAR and NK AROBASE on the 3 rd day and NK LUGAN on the 2 nd– 4 th day after the application), no visual symptoms of damage of plants were found out. It could be concluded that the herbicide CALLISTO 480 SC + ATPLUS 463 (when applied in the registered dose of 0. 25 [*]l .  ha− 1 + 0. 5 [*]%) did not damage hybrids under study and did not show any statistically significant effect on the grain yield. This means that the manufacturer’s statement that this herbicide, if applied in the registered dose of 0. 25 [*]l .  ha− 1 + 0. 5 [*]%, is very tolerant to grain maize seedlings in the growth stage of 3 – 5 leafs, was correct. The most suitable <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> of differences in sensitivity to and/or potential phytotoxicity of the preparation CALLISTO 480 SC + ATPLUS 463 seemed to be the fourth day after the application because the measured average PS 1 values were the highest in all hybrids under study. When evaluating the pooled three-year yields of grain (converted to 15 % of moisture content) by means of variance analysis, a statistically significant effect of the year and the hybrid on the grain yield was found out. On the other hand, however, there was no statistically significant difference in the grain yield between control and the variant treated with the registered dose of the herbicide CALLISTO 480 SC + ATPLUS 463, i. e. 12. 08 [*]t .  ha‑ 1 and 11. 50 [*]t .  ha− 1, respectively (grain moisture content 15 %).

40|$|Aleatico grapevine is {{a variety}} {{cultivated}} along Tuscany coasts and in Elba Island (Italy), {{from which a}} typical dessert wine ‘Aleatico passito’ is produced after partial post-harvest dehydration of berries. The research project was focused on this variety because {{the knowledge of the}} morphological traits and technological characteristics of Aleatico as well as the response of this grape variety to different environmental conditions and climatic changes, including reduced rainfall and water stress, is scarce. Therefore, to obtain a high quality wine that recently received the Denomination of Controlled and Guaranteed Origin and to be more competitive on the market, it is quite useful to conduct thorough studies on this variety and on its responses to different water regimes, especially in terms of secondary metabolites biosynthesis (phenolic compounds and flavours) during ripening. Field trials were carried out, in 2008 and 2009, at ‘La Bulichella’ Winery (Suvereto, Livorno, Italy) in order to study physiological responses (midday stem water potential, gas exchanges and sap flow) and berry composition of non irrigated (WS) and irrigated (IR) Aleatico plants. The climatic trends for the 2008 and 2009 seasons showed that in the 2009 season relative humidity was higher (30 - 80 %) in comparison with 2008 (10 - 40 %). Global radiation in 2009 was also higher against to 2008. The air temperature frequently exceeded 26 °C during 2008 season, while in 2009 this occurred and was concentrated during {{the second part of the}} season. Relative humidity and air temperature measured at the grape level did not markedly differ from those of the meteorological station. These climatic conditions influenced the midday stem water potential and the gas exchanges that reached lower values in 2009 than in 2008. In particular, in 2008 the photosynthetic activity and conductance of IR plants leaves increased during véraison and maintained higher values than in 2009, during which both parameters were decreasing, apart from the partial recovery due to water supply on August 15 th. In 2009 at harvest berry weight was reduced of about 20 % in WS plants. An effect of similar magnitude was detected for skin weight, while seed weight was not affected. The sugar accumulation process resulted more pronounced in WS berries and this was paralleled by higher titratable acidity values both at véraison and harvest. In 2009 the total phenolic content of the berries was influenced by water stress only at the end of the trial, with a reduction of the seeds phenolic compounds. The incidence of seeds on total phenolic content was higher than that of skins, confirming that this behaviour is a varietal characteristic. Accumulation of anthocyanins (Anth) on whole wine grape bunches attached to the vine was studied using a non-destructive fluorescence-based sensor, extremely useful for a rapid and non-invasive determination of phenol compound-related parameters in the vineyard. The very same 50 - 60 bunches were monitored during the seasons at a weekly frequency from véraison to harvest. For each <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements,</b> chlorophyll fluorescence signals under different excitation wavelengths were collected to derive Anth, flavonols (Flav) and chlorophyll (Chl) indices. The ANTHR, that is the Anth index based on a single fluorescence signal excited with red (R) light, and the FLAV index increased and decreased with time from véraison to harvest, respectively. The Chl index was monotonically decreasing, while the ANTHRG, based on two fluorescence signals excited with red (R) and green (G) light, followed a biphasic behavior increasing to a maximum at about complete véraison and then decreasing to harvest. All the indices suggested an early ripening process in 2009 compared to 2008, in agreement with other standard indicators such as véraison occurrence, technological maturity and berry development. Calibration of the fluorescence sensor was performed in 2008 by destructive HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds in berry skin extracts. Starting from complete véraison, the ANTHRG index was found to be fairly inversely correlated (r 2 = 0. 875) to the Anth surface-based concentration (mg/cm 2) through an exponential function. On the contrary, the Flav index was uncorrelated to the Flav content, because of the interference of Anth on the fluorescence signals. The ANTHRG non-destructive index was able to detect differences in the Anth accumulation between seasons in accordance with the standard destructive analysis of Anth berry skin content. Water stress imposed in 2009 increased Anth accumulation in berries due to a reduction of berries in size but also to an increased Anth biosynthesis. This effect was observed by both destructive and ANTHRG non-destructive measurements. In order to study at molecular level the expression of specific genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and water stress-related responses in Aleatico berries, a research stage at the Wine Research Centre of the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) was carried out. The transcript accumulation of several putative water stress-sensitive genes was preliminary analyzed by qRT-PCR to identify possible common biomarkers in leaves and in berries. Among these genes, Dehydrin 1 a showed significant changes in transcription in WS samples. Considering genes involved in the Anthocyanins pathway, the expression of UFGT (flavonoid 3 -O-glucosyltransferase) and FLS 1 (flavonol synthase) appeared to be up-regulated by WS. A similar response was also observed for two genes involved in the anthocyanin hydroxylation and methoxylation processes. Taken together results indicate that the variety Aleatico appears to be tolerant to water stress condition and this information could be useful also for setting up targeted post-harvest dehydration strategies to produce dessert wines and to allow its cultivation in territories where irrigation is not available or saving water when the irrigation must be used in severe dry conditions...|$|E

This database is the main tool of Coriolis project which is a global data assembly center of in situ data: such as US-GODAE centre of Monterey in California.The latest version of CORA product is v3.3, it covers the years 1990 up to 2011 and has been released in July 2012. Observations are profiles distributed on measured levels (pressure or depth) and organized by <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and type <b>of</b> platform.Main users of CORA dataset are ocean modelers who needs to constraint and initialize their model. [...] is a privileged partner of CORA dataset since feedbacks from models assimilation (meteorology) are used to check suspicious profiles found thanks to innovation computing. CORA is free of access and can be download via CORIOLIS website in netCDF file format. The main different of CORA dataset with other available datasets is that CORA gives the data on the levels where measurements have been done rather than standard levels such in World Ocean Atlas or ENACT3. In addition data in CORA are retrieved from Coriolis database where each profile is visually checked by specialist operators if suspicious.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between management behaviour and the subsequent market response in the German IPO market. When applying two forms for earnings management, issuers that overperform {{in the long run}} manage earnings less aggressively. Over shorter measurement horizons, however, the performance is sensitive to the starting <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>measurement</b> period. The market takes a considerable time to respond to the fundamental message conveyed by management behaviour towards earnings management {{at the time of the}} IPO. Within the first four months, IPO returns are essentially driven by factors other than fundamentals. This sheds light on the dynamics of IPO performance and the efficiency of the IPO aftermarket. ...|$|R

40|$|Cortisol is {{secreted}} by {{the central}} hypothalamo- pituitary-adrenal axis and affects many target organs and issues, particularly in response to stressor demands and infections. Recent data reporting cortisol synthesis in hair follicles have shown {{the existence of a}} parallel 'peripheral' HPA-axis. However although there is evidence from in vitro studies and single-observation comparisons between groups that cortisol from hair follicles reflects endocrine changes associated with stressor demands, there are no reports to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> repeated <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> in vivo cortisol responsivity in hair to transitory stressors. This issue was investigated with three males who underwent one minute cold pressor test (CP). Cortisol response in hair to stressor demand appears to be (a) swift but transitory, (b) localised {{to the site of the}} demand and (c) independent of central HPA-axis activity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cooling {{may reduce}} infarct size and improve {{neurological}} outcomes {{in patients with}} ischaemic stroke. In phase II trials, cooling awake patients with ischaemic stroke {{has been shown to}} be feasible and safe, but the effects in functional outcomes has not yet been investigated in an adequately sized randomised clinical trial. Methods/design: The EuroHYP- 1 trial is a multinational, randomised, superiority phase III clinical trial with masked outcome assessment testing the benefits and harms of therapeutic cooling in awake adult patients with acute ischaemic stroke. The outcomes dealt with here include the primary outcome the Rankin score (mRS) at day 91 +/- 14 days after randomisation. The secondary and exploratory outcomes at day 91 +/- 14 days unless otherwise stated encompassing: (1) death or dependency, defined as mRS score[*]>[*] 2; (2) death; (3) National Institutes of Health Stroke Score; (4) brain infarct size at 48 +/- 24 hours; (5) EQ- 5 D- 5 L score, and (6) WHODAS 2. 0 score. Other outcomes are: the primary safety outcome serious adverse events; and the incremental cost-effectiveness, and cost utility ratios. The analysis sets include (1) the intention-to-treat population, and (2) the per protocol population. The sample size is estimated to 800 patients (5 % type 1 and 20 % type 2 errors). All analyses are adjusted for the protocol-specified stratification variables (nationality of centre), and the minimisation variables. In the analysis, we use ordinal regression (the primary outcome), logistic regression (binary outcomes), general linear model (continuous outcomes), and the Poisson or negative binomial model (rate outcomes). Discussion: Major adjustments compared with the original statistical analysis plan encompass: (1) adjustment of analyses by nationality; (2) power calculations for the secondary outcomes; (3) to address the multiplicity problem using of a fixed-sequence testing procedure starting with the primary outcome followed by the secondary outcomes ordered according to falling power; (4) assignment of worst possible score to patients who are not alive at the planned <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> the continuous scores; (5) improved imputations; (6) outline of a supplementary exploratory analysis <b>of</b> the temperature <b>measurements</b> and time to death; and (7) substantial reduction of sample size.
