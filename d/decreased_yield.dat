25|$|Root-knot {{nematodes}} are plant-parasitic nematodes {{from the}} genus Meloidogyne. They exist in soil {{in areas with}} hot climates or short winters. About 2000 plants worldwide are susceptible to infection by root-knot nematodes and they cause approximately 5% of global crop loss. Root-knot nematode larvae infect plant roots, causing the development of root-knot galls that drain the plant's photosynthate and nutrients. Infection of young plants may be lethal, while infection of mature plants causes <b>decreased</b> <b>yield.</b>|$|E

50|$|Idaeovirus is a genus of positive-sense ssRNA {{viruses that}} {{contains}} one species: Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV). Although the genus {{does not belong}} to any family or order, it has been proposed {{as a member of the}} family Bromoviridae due to similarities to members of that family. RBDV has two host-dependent clades: one for raspberries; the other for grapevines. Infections are a significant agricultural burden, resulting in <b>decreased</b> <b>yield</b> and quality of crops. RBDV has a synergistic relation with Raspberry leaf mottle virus, with co-infection greatly amplifying the concentration of virions in infected plants. The virus is transmitted via pollination with RBDV-infected pollen grains that first infect the stigma before causing systemic infection.|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{limiting}} factors for maize (Zea mays L.) production worldwide. Over-fertilization of N may <b>decrease</b> <b>yields</b> and increase NO 3 − contamination of water. However, low N fertilization will <b>decrease</b> <b>yields.</b> The objective is to optimize the use of N fertilizers, to excel in yields and preserve the environment. The knowledge of factors affecting the mobility of N in the soil is crucial to determine ways to manage N in the field. Researchers developed several methods to use N efficiently relying on agronomic practices, the use of sensors and the analysis of digital images. These imaging sensors determine N requirements in plants based on changes in Leaf chlorophyll and polyphenolics contents, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Dark Green Color index (DGCI). Each method revealed limitations and the scope of future research is to draw N recommendations from the Dark Green Color Index (DGCI) technology. Results showed that more effort is needed to develop tools to benefit from DGCI...|$|R

Our studies reported in this paper show the reorientation of /{ 100 } square cross-sectional Cu nanowires {{into a series of}} stable ultra-thin pentagon Cu nanobridge structures with diameter of ∼ 1 nm under a high strain rate tensile loading. The strain rates used for the present studies range from 1 × 10 ^ 9 to 0. 5 × 107 s^- 1. The pentagonal multi-shell nanobridge structure is observed for cross-sectional dimensions < 1. 5 nm. From these results we anticipate the application of pentagonal Cu nanowires even with diameters of ∼ 1 nm in nano-electronic devices. A much larger plastic deformation is observed in the pentagonal multi-shell nanobridge structure as compared to structures that do not form such a nanobridge. It indicates that the pentagonal nanobridge is stable. The effect of strain rate on the mechanical properties of Cu nanowires is also analyzed and shows a <b>decreasing</b> <b>yield</b> stress and <b>yield</b> strain with <b>decreasing</b> strain rate for a given cross-section. Also, a <b>decreasing</b> <b>yield</b> stress and <b>decreasing</b> <b>yield</b> strain are observed for a given strain rate with increasing cross-sectional area. The elastic modulus is found to be ∼ 100 GPa and is independent of strain rate effect and independent of size effect for a given temperature...|$|R
50|$|Two main {{approaches}} {{are used to}} synthesize glyphosate industrially. The first is to react iminodiacetic acid with phosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid (sometimes formed in situ by addition of phosphorus trichloride) via a modified Mannich reaction. Oxidation then leads to the desired glyphosate product. Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site, such as by reaction of chloroacetic acid with ammonia and calcium hydroxide to produce the calcium iminodiacetate salt and then acidification of the product.The chloroacetic acid approach is less efficient than other iminodiacetic acid approaches, owing {{to the production of}} calcium chloride waste and <b>decreased</b> <b>yield.</b> When hydrogen cyanide is readily available as a by-product (say), an alternative approach is to use iminodiacetonitrile, HN(CH2CN)2, and diethanolamine is also a suitable starting material.|$|E
50|$|Several {{techniques}} {{exist for}} the creation of apomorphine from morphine.

The method then deviates by including a water scavenger, which is essential to remove the water produced by the reaction that can react with the product and lead to <b>decreased</b> <b>yield.</b> The scavenger can be any reagent that will irreversibly react with water such as phthalic anhydride or titanium chloride.
