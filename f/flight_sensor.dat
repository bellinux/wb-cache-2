For this reason we compare five 3 D sensors, including the struc-tured light sensors Microsoft Kinect and ASUS Xtion Pro Live {{and the time of}} <b>flight</b> <b>sensors</b> Fotonic E 70 P, IFM O 3 D 200 and Nippon Signal FX 6, using the same settings. The sensor noise, absolute error and point detection rates are compared for different depth values, environmental illumination and different surfaces. Also simple models of the noise de-pending on the measured depth are proposed. It is found that the struc-tured light sensors are very accurate for close ranges. The time of <b>flight</b> <b>sensors</b> have more noise, but the noise does not increase as strongly with the measured distance.

40|$|Abstract — Pixel array based 3 D range sensors like stereo {{cameras and}} time of <b>flight</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{commonly}} used for spatial mapping. Analogous to a laser range finder beam, each pixel measures distances within its conical field of view. However, unlike laser range finders, these sensors use incoherent visible or near visible light for range measurement. This, combined with their relatively long maximum ranges, means that the convenient thin beam assumption {{can no longer be}} used to update an occupancy grid map using a probabilistic sensor model. We present an analysis of a scenario where a pixel beam is intersected by more than one object and where a unimodal probabilistic distribution assumption causes spurious objects to appear in the detected scene. This adversely affects pathplanning based on such maps because perfectly good escape routes are blocked off. A two step multimodal Gaussian mixture model based procedure is presented which is able to detect multiple obstacles per pixel and hence ameliorate the problem. The results of experiments done using a time of <b>flight</b> based <b>sensor</b> are presented. I...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{measurement}} of the column water vapor in the atmosphere are compared {{with respect to their}} usefulness for imaging spectrometer campaigns. First, in situ measurements of 26 radiosonde launches are integrated with height to obtain the water vapor column. Second, simultaneous ground irradiance measurements using a sun photometer are inverted to column water vapor amounts. An exact calibration of the solar radiometer is performed to increase the measurement accuracy. The results obtained by the radiometric method differ from the in situ measurements within the relative accuracy of the balloon-borne humidity sensors. The largest differences are attributed to dusty, highly humid atmospheric conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Chromium {{and iron}} are two heavy {{elements}} in the solar wind with similar masses. The MTOF (Mass Time Of <b>Flight)</b> <b>sensor</b> of the CELIAS investigation on the SOHO spacecraft easily allows these two elements to be resolved from one another. Taking {{the ratio of the}} densities of these two elements- as opposed to considering their absolute abundances- minimizes the effects of uncertainties in instrument efficiency. Measurements of the abundance ratio are presented here. The First Ionization Potential (FIP) of chromium is 6. 76 eV, while the FIP of iron is 7. 87 eV. Since Cr and Fe have similar FIPs the ratio of their abundances should not be biased by the FIP effect which is well known in different solar wind flows. Therefore the Cr/Fe ratio from the MTOF data should give a good measure of the photospheric abundance ratio. We also compare the ratio measured in this work to the meteoritic value...|$|E
