5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the term <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved {{in the opposite direction}} of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film would look like and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E

After practicing 18 months in Boston, she returned to Rhode Island in 1890, residing in Providence, where she was engaged in writing and lecturing on legal topics. Although she was successful in court practice, her physical frailty left her unable to endure its strain. For that reason, she never applied for admission to the Rhode Island bar, her standing at the Boston bar being sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work she wanted to do.

25|$|By late 1965, British Eagle {{placed an}} order for two Boeing 707-320Cs. The aircraft, which were to be {{delivered}} in early 1967, were primarily intended for passenger and freight charters to the Far East and Australia. To avoid paying the 14% tax the British Government had imposed on imported, new foreign aircraft to protect competing British models, the airline needed to persuade the Board of Trade {{that there was no}} equivalent home-grown alternative. It also cited the Board's earlier decision to approve BOAC's application for an import duty waiver on two new Boeing 707-336Cs as a precedent. Despite being offered a mixed-traffic version of the Super VC10 and acknowledging that aircraft's superior passenger appeal, British Eagle favoured the 707-320C because of its greater payload and range. This made the 707 a more attractive aircraft <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> charter operations envisaged.|$|E
25|$|By early 2003, as Israel and the United States {{refused to}} {{negotiate}} with Yasser Arafat, {{it was thought that}} Abbas would be a candidate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> leadership role envisaged by both countries. As {{one of the few remaining}} founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature. Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority. According to Gilbert Achcar, the United States imposed Abbas on Arafat, the democratically elected leader, though the majority of Palestinians thought of the former as a Quisling.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the five}} {{geographical}} {{divisions of the}} Tamil country in Sangam literature, the Marutam region was the most fit for cultivation, as it had the most fertile lands. The prosperity of a farmer depended on getting the necessary sunlight, seasonal rains and the fertility of the soil. Among these elements of nature, sunlight was considered indispensable by the ancient Tamils, because if rains fail other methods of irrigation could be put to use and if the soil wasn't naturally fertile, artificial manuring would enrich the soil. They differentiated the lands {{on the basis of}} fertility and accordingly cultivated the crops that were best suited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> soil. They were Vanpulam (hardland), Menpulam (fertile land), Pinpulam (dry land) and Kalarnilam or Uvarnilam (salty land). Vanpulam in Mullai and Kurinji regions did not yield rich produce, whereas in Menpulam the yield was very good. Dry crops were cultivated on Pinpulam, because of the limited irrigation facilities. The Kalarnilam was unfit for cultivation. Some of the types of soil known to the people of this age were the alluvial soil, red soil, black soil, laterite soil and sandy soil and they knew what crops could be grown on each type of soil.|$|E

In his review for UGO, Keith Uhlich wrote, [...] "The best to say about Del Toro's Cannes-honored performance is that it's exhausting—all exterior, no soul, like watching an android run a gauntlet (one that includes grueling physical exertions, tendentious political speechifying, and risible Matt Damon cameos)". Slant magazine gave Che two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is that, despite his desire to sidestep Hollywood bio-hooey, the director is unable to turn his chilly stance into an ideological perspective, like Roberto Rossellini did in his demythologized portraits of Louis XIV, Garibaldi and Pascal".|$|E
500|$|These {{and similar}} {{techniques}} {{became part of}} the vocabulary of the sound comedy film, though as special effects and [...] "color", not as the basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive, non-naturalistic design achieved by Clair. Outside of the comedic field, the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by Melodie der Welt and Le Million would be pursued very rarely in commercial production. Hollywood, in particular, incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre-based moviemaking, in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling. As accurately predicted in 1928 by Frank Woods, secretary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, [...] "The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama.... The talking scenes will require different handling, but the general construction of the story will be much the same." ...|$|E

500|$|Stanley Schmidt was an {{assistant}} professor of physics when he became editor of Analog, and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. [...] He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected [...] "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales—humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. [...] Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled [...] "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by G. Harry Stine and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. [...] The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. [...] This continuity led to criticisms within the field, Bruce Sterling writing in 1984 that the magazine [...] "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It is a situation screaming for reform. [...] Analog no longer permits itself to be read." [...] The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it, commenting in 1985: [...] "I reserve Analog <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> science fiction I've described here: good stories about people with problems in which some piece of plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".|$|E
