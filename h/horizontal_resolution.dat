25|$|While {{for years}} Dish Network has used {{standard}} MPEG-2 for broadcasting, {{the addition of}} bandwidth-intensive HDTV in a limited-bandwidth world {{has called for a}} change to an H.264/MPEG-4 AVC system. Dish Network announced as of February 1, 2006, that all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. Dish Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to H.264 in order to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, Dish Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing <b>horizontal</b> <b>resolution</b> and/or data rate of HD video is known as HD Lite and is practiced by other TV providers as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{transmission}} {{consists of}} horizontal lines, scanned {{from left to}} right. The color components are sent separately one line after another. The color encoding and order of transmission can vary between modes. Most modes use an RGB color model; some modes are black-and-white, with only one channel being sent; other modes use a YC color model, which consists of luminance (Y) and chrominance (R–Y and B–Y). The modulating frequency changes between 1500 and 2300Hz, corresponding to the intensity (brightness) of the color component. The modulation is analog, so even though the <b>horizontal</b> <b>resolution</b> is often defined as 256 or 320 pixels, they can be sampled using any rate. The image aspect ratio is conventionally 4:3. Lines usually end in a 1200Hz horizontal synchronization pulse of 5 milliseconds (after all color components of the line have been sent); in some modes, the synchronization pulse lies {{in the middle of}} the line.|$|E

25|$|If the {{computer}} controlling the display knows the exact position {{and color of}} all the subpixels on the screen, it {{can take advantage of}} this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only {{one or two of the}} subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; if it passes through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the <b>horizontal</b> <b>resolution</b> of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).|$|E

Radio transmissions from the CERTO beacon are processed by the ground receivers to produce two-dimensional maps of the electron densities in the ionosphere.

The CERTO radio-based technique has the advantage of higher spatial resolution than provided by the EUV-based techniques, but requires ground-based receivers aligned under the satellite orbit. The two techniques together on the same satellite provide substantial improvements over each technique separately.
