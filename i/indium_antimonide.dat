40|$|Topological {{insulators}} (TIs) are a novel {{class of}} materials with nontrivial surface or edge states. Time-reversal symmetry (TRS) protected TIs {{are characterized by}} the Z 2 topological invariant and their helical property becomes lost in an applied magnetic field. Currently there exist extensive efforts searching for TIs that are protected by symmetries other than TRS. Here we show, a topological phase characterized by a spin Chern topological invariant is realized in an inverted electron-hole bilayer engineered from <b>indium</b> arsenide-gallium <b>antimonide</b> (InAs/GaSb) semiconductors which retains robust helical edges under a strong magnetic field. Wide conductance plateaus of 2 e 2 /h value are observed; they persist to 12 T applied in-plane magnetic field without evidence for transition to a trivial insulator. In a perpendicular magnetic field up to 8 T, there exists no signature to the bulk gap closing. While the Fermi energy remains inside the bulk gap, the longitudinal conductance increases from 2 e 2 /h in strong magnetic fields suggesting a trend towards chiral edge transport. Our findings are first evidences for a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator protected by a spin Chern invariant. These results demonstrate that InAs/GaSb bilayers are a novel system for engineering the robust helical edge channels much needed for spintronics and for creating and manipulating Majorana particles in solid state.

The thermal impacts on the performance of nanoscale-gap thermophotovoltaic (nano-TPV) power generators are investigated using a coupled near-field thermal radiation, charge, and heat transport formulation. A nano-TPV device consisting of a tungsten radiator, maintained at 2000 K, and cells made of <b>indium</b> gallium <b>antimonide</b> (In 0. 18 Ga 0. 82 Sb) are considered; the thermal management system is modeled assuming a convective boundary with a fluid temperature fixed at 293 K. Results reveal that nano-TPV performance characteristics are closely related to the temperature of the cell. When the radiator and the junction are separated by a 20 nm vacuum gap, the power output and the conversion efficiency of the system are respectively 5. 83 × 105 Wm− 2 and 24. 8 % at 300 K, whereas these values drop to 8. 09 × 104 Wm− 2 and 3. 2 % at 500 K.

50|$|<b>Indium</b> gallium {{arsenide}} <b>antimonide</b> (InGaAsSb) is a compound III-V semiconductor. (InxGa1−xAsySb1−y) The addition of GaAs {{allows for a}} narrower bandgap (0.5 to 0.6 eV), and therefore better absorption of long wavelengths. Specifically, the bandgap was engineered to 0.55 eV. With this bandgap, the compound achieved a photon-weighted internal quantum efficiency of 79% with a fill factor of 65% for a black body at 1100 °C. This was for a device grown on a GaSb substrate by organometallic vapour phase epitaxy (OMVPE). Devices have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). The internal quantum efficiencies (IQE) of these devices are approaching 90%, while devices grown by the other two techniques exceed 95%. The largest problem with InGaAsSb cells is phase separation. Compositional inconsistencies throughout the device degrade its performance. When phase separation can be avoided, the IQE and fill factor of InGaAsSb approach theoretical limits in wavelength ranges near the bandgap energy. However, the Voc/Eg ratio {{is far from the}} ideal. Current methods to manufacture InGaAsSb PVs are expensive and not commercially viable.|$|R

40|$|Infrared {{detectors}} {{are very}} important technological tools for many different applications. Infrared detectors have existed {{as far back as}} the late 1700 s but received a tremendous push 200 years later during World War II. Both thermal and photon based infrared detectors have had significant advancements with many different varieties becoming available with varying degrees of sensitivity, speed, and wavelength sensitivity. One of the best performing technologies is based on Mercury Cadmium Telluride. However, it still has limitations with regard to low operating temperature, material yield and processing difficulties. A newer material technology known as type-II <b>indium</b> arsenide/gallium <b>antimonide</b> strain-layered superlattice has received much attention for its potential superior performance from lower dark current, mature III-V material fabrication techniques, and design versatility. However, superior dark current performance has yet to be realized due to large Shockley-Read-Hall generation-recombination current. To overcome this, researchers have taken advantage of the versatile bandstructure of the superlattice material and have created heterostructure designs to reduce dark current. These designs include the nBn, CBIRD, pMp, and pBiBn. These designs have enabled detectors have dark current behavior to be within a factor of 2 of HgCdTe based detectors. The more basic of these designs, the nBn, has been utilized in InAs detectors, InAsSb detectors, HgCdTe detectors, and both mid and long-wave superlattice detectors with success. However, questions and optimization remain regarding dark current and photocurrent behavior, band alignment, and photoconductive gain. Mid-wave InAsSb nBn detector designs with different barrier composition and doping conditions have been investigated to help elucidate effects on dark current and photoresponse. Mid-wave superlattice nBn detectors with different absorber doping conditions have been studied as well. Dark current was found to be decreased by lightly doping the barrier layer n-type. variations of the nBn design, such as the pBn and pBp have been implemented with long-wave superlattice detectors and their bias and temperature dependent dark current and photoresponse have been studied. Also, the photoconductive gain of a long-wave pBp detector have been measured and found to be slightly less than unity. Nanoscience and MicrosystemsDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|The {{inherent}} low conductivity {{of metals}} and low skin depth at terahertz (THz) frequencies and above decrease antennas radiation efficiency at such high frequencies. In {{addition to the}} high surface impedance, due to the small dimensions of metallic antennas at THz frequencies and above can further reduce the radiation efficiency. Nevertheless, attention has been drawn to metallic antennas {{that are designed to}} operate at optical frequencies due to their ability to create substantial field confinement and enhancement at their terminals. In this thesis, a highly conductive nanomaterial, Bundled Carbon Nanotubes (BCNTs) is examined to overcome the low efficiency of metallic antenna at THz frequencies. Due to their axial current, BCNTs are modeled by a 2 D anisotropic resistive sheet having a tensor surface resistivity. Using a numerical method, the radiation efficiency of antennas consisting of BCNTs and gold are compared and it is concluded that BCNTs should be packed up about 1, 000 times more than the current density of BCNTs to outperform gold at 2 THz. Efficient nanoantennas near infrared (IR) frequencies are also studied to enhance the performance of uncooled IR detectors and thermophotovoltaics (TPVs) power transducers. A gold bowtie dipole antenna topology loaded with a low bandgap <b>indium</b> gallium arsenide <b>antimonide</b> (InGaAsSb) p-n junction is investigated for this purpose. Through optimized arrangements, it is shown that a large array of flexible load bowtie nanoantennas can produce an efficient TPV system that can absorb 95 % of the incident power. Similarly, a focal-plane array of nano-bowtie antennas used as an uncooled IR detector is demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of the detector by a factor equal to the field enhancement factor, approximately 23 when compared to a detector made from a thick layer of the same material, InGaAsSb. Finally, a more advanced antenna topology using a cross tapered-bowtie antenna for detecting circularly polarized (CP) IR signals is designed and its perfect CP property is verified experimentally for the microwave range.
