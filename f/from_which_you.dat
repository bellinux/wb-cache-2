500|$|Critics have judged Mom & Me & Mom and Angelou's other autobiographies [...] "in {{light of}} the first", and Caged Bird {{generally}} receives the highest praise. [...] Marjorie Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor, considers the book a sequel to Caged Bird.' [...] Many of the events described in Angelou's previous autobiographies are revisited in this one, some with more detail than others, such as her period of homelessness, which was described in Caged Bird, and her serious beating by her jealous boyfriend, which was first disclosed in Letter to My Daughter (2008), Angelou's third book of essays. [...] According to Fiona Sturges, who reviewed Mom & Me & Mom in the British publication The Independent, [...] "As in her previous books, these tales are told with clear-sightedness and an absence of self-pity, and they are no less grim for their familiarity. Angelou has never been one for florid prose, and here she maintains a precise and economical style which makes these bleak moments more vivid, like a film <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> can't look away". [...] Sayers states that major dramatic events, such as the incident when Angelou was beaten, [...] "are delivered without much amplification or further reference".|$|E

He said that a system of passes would be arranged to address the issue of idle time caused by delays. He entreated the men that if the situation could not be resolved, it must [...] "bring want and suffering upon all; suffering <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> and your families cannot hope to be exempt." [...] He asserted that, although 90 percent of rail workers had accepted the reduction, the whole business of the railroad and city had been halted due to the 10 percent rejecting them, and resolving to not allow the rest of the men to continue work. He said the rescinding of the wage cuts were [...] "entirely out of the question" [...] and requested the men either return to work, or allow those who would to resume working. As The Sun reported: [...] "A vote was taken, and the proposition of the company was rejected unanimously." ...|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> can hear the screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to find yourself in predicaments <b>from</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E
