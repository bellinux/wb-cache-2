In this thesis, fate of POPs during the processes leading to bio pellets production at the municipal wastewater treatment plant Sentralrenseanlegg Nord-Jæren (SNJ) was examined. Fate of POPs and HMs in anaerobic digesters was determined based on modeling of PAH’s partitioning between sludge particles and water phase using the software AQUASIM. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the distribution of POPs and HMs in the processes of centrifugation and drying. Analyses of samples of spiked sludge, dewatered sludge, reject water, and dried sludge were done externally by Eurofins. Modeling of partitioning of PAHs between sludge and surrounding aqueous phase showed an approxumate setting of equilibrium within the first 10 hours after which almost all of the PAHs were found sorbed to the sludge. Experimental work showed that during the processes of dewatering THC (total hydrocarbon), PAH, PCB, and HM were all tightly bound to sludge whereas BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) was found to follow the reject water.

40|$|Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea {{has been}} an issue for decades and the {{pollution}} constantly continues with oxygen deficient bottoms and a damaged marine life as a result. One of the main causes of eutrophication are elevated levels of the nutrient phosphorus. Phosphorus leaks to the sea from various human activities such as agriculture, animal farming and sewage. In Sweden, the onsite wastewater treatment systems are a big problem since they load the Baltic Sea with nearly as much phosphorus as all Swedish municipal wastewater treatment plants. The need for a reduced impact on the Baltic Sea is major and the <b>individual</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> systems must therefore be looked over. While phosphorus is a contributing factor to eutrophication, {{it is one of}} the most important nutrients for all life. Phosphorus builds up our DNA, helps transport of various substances in and out of our cells and provides energy to the cell's processes. We would simply not be able to survive without phosphorus. We ingest phosphorus through the food we eat, which in turn is dependent on fertilizers containing phosphorus. Phosphorus is mined from phosphate ore and the majority of it is used to produce fertilizers. Unfortunately, phosphate ore is not a finite resource and in the last few years it has been realized that the economically extractable phosphorus is a dwindling resource. To be able to produce food for the world's growing population, we need to find ways to recycle phosphorus. In individual drainage systems there is a large potential to catch up phosphorus and then reuse it on agricultural land. This thesis deals with the problems of onsite wastewater treatment systems and suggests measures to improve their status. Ways to recycle phosphorus in combination with having a well-functioning drainage is being investigated and difficulties about the regulations are being discussed. To recover phosphorus and at the same time reduce the burden on the environment should be seen as an incredibly important action, since our sea’s health is acute but lack of the nutrient could have devastating consequences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Compared to {{the limited}} water supply in the Middle East, Lebanon is {{perceived}} to be a water rich country. Yet, it faces a growing water supply problem due to many factors including increases in demand, inadequate investment in infrastructure, and deterioration of water quality. Being the foremost water resource in Lebanon, the Litani River {{is at the center of}} several major water supply and irrigation schemes. However, the river water quality is severely impacted by the current practice of releasing untreated sewage into its water body, specifically in its upper basin which is home to about half a million inhabitants. This problem has prompted government and non-government agencies to consider the installation of several <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities. This paper reports on the development of an integrated Decision Support System (DSS) for the Upper Litani Basin to be used by decision makers to assess the current status and explore potential solution alternatives. The DSS was developed based on the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model. The GIS-based interface of WEAP facilitated disaggregate representation of <b>individual</b> communities, <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants, water supply intakes and return flows and the river system. For a given simulation run which could span several years, the DSS calculates and routes sewage loads from each community to the river system or treatment plants.

40|$|In this paper, the {{potential}} impacts in the techno-environmental {{performance of a}} municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant with integrated mixed-microbial-culture polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production are presented for the first time. A life cycle assessment was conducted based on mass and energy balances. The techno-environmental performance was evaluated for five <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> configurations: a reference case and four alternative processes producing PHA-rich biomass using influent municipal wastewater as the only organic carbon source. The integration of PHA-rich biomass production into a municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant with sludge digestion sustains the overall conversion yield for total products of biogas and PHA-rich biomass (around 0. 26 gCOD products per influent gCOD treated). PHA production integration has {{the potential}} to improve the overall environmental performance with respect to the reference case. Even when no benefits were accounted for substitutions related to the biogas and PHA-rich biomass, similar or improved environmental performances were estimated for all four alternatives for global warming potential, acidification potential, terrestrial eutrophication potential, and photo-oxidant formation potential. When benefits were accounted from substitutions of electricity and heat co-generated from biogas and of PHA-rich biomass by pure-culture PHA-rich biomass from sugar fermentation, gains were even higher due to the diversion of carbon from biogas to PHA-rich biomass. Freshwater and marine eutrophication potentials were dependent on effluent specifications. Case-by-case process configurations influence the mass and energy balance and trade-offs of process integration. The production and export of PHA-rich biomass decreased the aeration requirements for COD and nitrogen removal; however, increased demands for heat, power and chemicals were incurred for the generation of volatile fatty acids from primary solids fermentation. The choice of nitrogen-removal approach (nitrification-denitrification vs. anammox) also impacted energy consumption. Using influent wastewater as the sole carbon supply, the energy balance and PHA production were sensitive to the efficiency of primary treatment and available flux of volatile fatty acids into PHA production. Other regional inputs of organic residuals may improve carbon recovery in the treatment facility. The improved environmental performance of the treatment configurations motivates the idea that <b>individual</b> municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants may become suppliers of renewable raw materials of higher value than that of biogas and/or energy and heat today...|$|R

40|$|A Professional Project Report Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Water Resources, Policy Management Concentration, Water Resources Program, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico,December 2005 On-site {{wastewater}} treatment systems (OWTS) have been utilized to provide treatment and disposal for the Chical Area of the Pueblo of Isleta for over 30 years. The OWTS technology used here primarily consists of septic tanks and absorption fields. The groundwater below the Chical Area {{is a highly}} valued resource by the Isleta Pueblo, but the hydrogeology makes it vulnerable to contamination from OWTS. Most of these systems have been installed with the assistance from the Indian Health Service. However, Isleta has not developed a plan or management program to ensure that these OWTS are properly sited, constructed, operated or maintained. Over this time, the number of septic systems has increased and the trend continues due to unregulated housing development on the irrigated lands in the Chical Area. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports nationally that septic systems are utilized by 25 % of existing homes and 33 % of new homes. The more alarming statistics are that up to 30 % fail annually and over 50 % are over 30 years old (EPA, 2003). All homes in the Chical Area utilize septic systems and many existing systems are over 30 years old. In 2003, the EPA published its Voluntary National Guidelines for Management of Onsite and Clustered (Decentralized) Wastewater Treatment Systems (Management Guidelines). The intent of these guidelines is, "to improve the performance of decentralized wastewater systems through better management. " This guidance is applicable to tribal government and their communities to improve OWTS management programs. Implementation of these guidelines will help insure that <b>individual</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> systems function properly to protect public health, the environment, and water resources. The objective of this professional project report was to identify and recommend an OWTS management plan for the Chical Area and the Pueblo of Isleta. Five Conceptual Models from the EPA. Management Guidelines were reviewed and those management components found applicable were integrated to form the Chical Area OWTS Management Plan. Recommended management components include: 1) inventorying and evaluating OWTS performance and creating a data base; 2) OWTS are properly sited, designed, and constructed; 3) OWTS are periodically inspected and repaired when necessary; 4) professionally trained personnel perform system operation and maintenance service; and 5) {{the design of the}} OWTS is determined by performance criteria.

40|$|The Green Drop Certification Programme, {{launched}} in 2008 alongside the Blue Drop Certification Programme, aims {{to provide the}} Department of Water Affairs with a national overview of how municipalities and their <b>individual</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> works (WWTW) are complying with licence conditions set by the National Water Act (NWA) (No. 36 of 1998; DWAF 1998) and the Water Services Act (No. 108 of 1997; DWAF 1998). By publishing the results of each municipality’s performance, the programme aims to ensure continuous improvement in the wastewater treatment sector through public pressure. The programme has been identified by this project as a necessary linking tool between the NWA and the Water Services Act to ensure protection and sustainable use of South Africa’s natural water resources. It does this through assisting municipalities to improve their wastewater treatment operations which in theory will lead to discharged effluent that is compliant with discharge licence conditions. These discharge licences form part of the NWA’s enforcement tool of Source Directed Controls (SDC) which help a water resource meet the ecological goals set for {{it as part of}} Resource Directed Measures (RDM). The link between meeting the required SDC and achieving the RDM goals has never been empirically tested. This project aimed to determine the present ecological condition of the Uie River, a tributary of the Sundays River which the Sundays River Valley Municipality (SRVM) discharges its domestic effluent into. It then determined whether the SRVM’s WWTW was complying with the General Standard licence conditions and what the impact of the effluent on the river was through the analysis of monthly biomonitoring, water chemistry and habitat data. Lastly, the project examined the effectiveness of the Green Drop Certification Programme in bringing about change in the SRVM’s wastewater treatment sector, which previously achieved a Green Drop score of 5. 6 percent. It wanted to examine the underlying assumption that a WWTW which improves its Green Drop score will be discharging a better quality effluent that will help a water resource meets the RDM goals set for it. The Kirkwood WWTW did not have a discharge licence at the time of assessment and was thus assessed under the General Standard licence conditions. It was found that the Kirkwood WWTW was not complying with the General Standard discharge licence conditions in the Uie River. This was having a negative impact on the river health, mainly through high concentrations of Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN-N), orthophosphate and turbidity. The SRVM should see an improvement in its Green Drop score for the Kirkwood WWTW. However, the municipality showed no implementation of necessary programmes. Implementation of these programmes would help the SRVM meet the General Standard licence conditions (part of SDC) which would help the Uie River meet the RDM goals set for it...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{mathematical}} modelling of {{wastewater treatment plants}} has become a widely used tool for planning, designing, optimising and evaluating wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). While wastewater models can provide insights into plant upgrades, new plant designs, optimised operational regimes and enable discharge effluent limits to be met, they are not been widely applied, particularly in informing {{the development of new}} technologies or optimising small-scale WWTPs. This is frequently due to the significant resources necessary to develop calibrated models for <b>individual</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> processes. The pumped flow biofilm reactor (PFBR), a batch biofilm technology, is a recent example of a new technology targeted at urban areas of about 5000 persons or less. This biofilm-based passive aeration system has been shown to have potential as an energy efficient and low maintenance alternative for the treatment of municipal wastewater. However, the modelling of biofilm-based PAS can present challenges, particularly where new technologies are not easily simulated using existing commercial modelling software. As a relatively new technology a predictive model for the PFBR system has yet to be developed. Indeed for novel passive aeration systems in general, it can be time consuming and difficult to develop new models that accurately describe performance. Nevertheless, if the modeller is concerned only with simulating Â¿macroÂ¿ plant performance (e. g. key effluent concentrations and cycle analysis), {{it may be possible to}} model these technologies using 2 ̆ 7 surrogate 2 ̆ 7 unit process systems (e. g. using an activated sludge process to model a biofilm process). While in practice biofilm systems may have been modelled as activated sludge systems, there has been limited research conducted on how such models can be systematically developed and what the merits or otherwise are of using activated sludge models as surrogates for biofilm systems. The present investigation serves to investigate the possibility of (1) modelling the PFBR using an activated sludge object in GPS-X in order to quickly study the PFBR (2) predicting effluent results and contaminant concentration changes (nitrogen and organic carbon) during individual treatment cycles using the activated sludge object (3) modelling different operational scenarios and thus optimising operational efficiency and (4) modelling the PFBR using AQUASIM in order to study the cycle performance, biofilm thickness and biofilm composition of the PFBR. The PFBR was modelled and calibrated at laboratory and field scale. In each case, after calibration, the models were verified using independent data. The models resulted in good predictions of effluent results and contaminant concentration changes (nitrogen and organic carbon) during individual treatment cycles and could thus be used for process optimisation; or eventually real time process simulation. In all cases there was limited data available due to minimal on site monitoring. This is typical of small scale systems and thus the study demonstrates that even limited monitoring, if strategically targeted, can lead to good model calibration. The work done in this study has demonstrated that it is possible to model a novel wastewater technology using 2 ̆ 7 surrogate 2 ̆ 7 processes in existing software. This has the potential to provide substantial benefits as such simulations can in turn can lead to cost savings during technology development and on-site operation. The calibrated model can enhance the understanding of the technology in question and thus lead to better design and more cost-effective wastewater treatment systems. The use of 2 ̆ 7 surrogate 2 ̆ 7 unit processes as described in this research could be applied to other technologies to provide rapid performance simulation. Thus the study demonstrates simple approaches to modelling novel technologies where new technologies are not easily modelled using existing commercial modelling software...|$|E
40|$|In Ireland {{many people}} live in homes that are rurally located and not {{connected}} to public wastewater treatment systems. Where this is the case, {{the treatment of the}} wastewater produced must be undertaken by a private on-site wastewater treatment system (OSWTS). Properly built and maintained private on-site wastewater treatment systems can treat effluent in an ecologically sound manner and return the water to the environment. Nevertheless, inappropriately designed, installed and maintained systems can lead to the contamination of ground and surface water resources (Gray 1994; Daly, 2001; Flynn & Kroger, 2003; Gray, 2004; Gill et al, 2005; EPA, 2008; Daly & Craig, 2009 & Gormley, 2009). Such contamination can lead to significant threats to human health as well environmental degradation. The very high dependence by Ireland on these OSWTS’s for domestic wastewater treatment means that it is imperative that the performance and management of the systems is effective and robust. Unfortunately however there is evidence that a huge proportion of OSWTS’s are poorly managed, maintained and operated (EU, 2008; IOWA 2012 & GSI, 2013). This poor performance and management of OSWTS’s has resulted in significant prosecutions and fines for Ireland by the EU with clear and unambiguous conditions set down for what Ireland needs to do to avoid further sanctions. The existing legislation in Ireland for OSWTS’s and some recent amendments {{as a consequence of the}} prosecutions by the EU have made it very clear that the ultimate responsility lies with the homeowner for their wastewater treatment system. Provision is made in the legislation for a new inspection reigeme that will seek to identify pollution from OSWTS’s and attempt to mitigate the contamination of ground and surface waters in accordance with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This new inspection reigeme and the revisions to the legislation are required for Ireland to comply with the directions of the ECJ ruling (C 188 - 08) in relation to OSWTS’s and so that the daily fines being imposed against Ireland are suspended. There has been little time available on foot of the ECJ (2008) ruling to educate homeowners on how they should be properly managing and maintaining their OSWTS’s to ensure that they operating effectively and efficiently. Existing research has identified that even where homeowners are aware of their responsibilities towards their OSWTS that they tend not to care with an ‘out of sight out of mind attitude (Gray, 2004). Clearly therefore the issue facing Ireland is not just a knowledge deficiency towards OSWTS’s but also a beahavioural change issue where people tend not to care about how their OSWTS performs. This thesis will examine the evolution of legislation in Ireland relating to OSWTS’s and how circumstances have led to the prosecution of Ireland (ECJ, 2009) for non compliance with the relevant EU Directives. Comprehensive literature reviews will outline existing research undertaken on the contamination of water resources by OSWTS in Ireland and also on techniques that could be utilised to educate homeowners on what they need to do to ensure that their <b>individual</b> <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> system is compliant with the relevant legislation. The research will adopt a number of research methods such as questionnaires and interviews to collect the data that is required to determine the knowledge that homeowners require about their OSWTS and this will shape the homeowner knowledge model that is to be developed. The publication of the research findings will inform the wastewater industry and the legislature of the key areas where homeowners are deficient in knowedge and understanding towards their OSWTS. These findings will also shape the knowledge model that will seek to address the knowledge and behavioural defieiciences that have led to Ireland being in the precarious position that it now finds itself in from the pollution, contamination and health threats associated with poorly performing and managed OSWTS’s. The implication of having relevant information and a clear understanding of where Ireland currently stands in relation the homowners and their interaction with their OSWTS’s will be of benefit to a whole range of sectors such as academia, industry, local authorities and the EPA. An accurate diagnosis of the problems relating to homeowner knowledge and behaiviour towards OSWTS’s will provide a framework to develop a lasting solution that will help in addressing pollution, groundwater contamination and the associated health risks from poorly constructed, managed and functioning OSWTS’s...|$|E

In the experimental part we performed a simulation of the activity of the SBR reactor of the Central <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> Plant Zagorje ob Savi on the laboratory's SBR reactors. With the laboratory's SBR reactors we first established how the ventilation time of the SBR reactors influence the effects of the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> and then we compared the effects of the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> of the laboratory's SBR reactors with the effects of the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> of the real SBR reactor of the Central <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> Plant Zagorje ob Savi. With the Automatic Methane Potential Test System II (AMPTS II) device we established the biomethane potential of the biological excess sludge of the Central <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> Plant Zagorje ob Savi for two different organic loads, in a mesophilic temperature zone at 38 °C and in a thermophilic temperature zone at 55 °C. On the basis of the obtained results of the biomethane potential test we analysed the expediency of setting up an anaerobic digester.

30|$|In {{the current}} new approach, a biofilm-type <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> reactor was {{constructed}} to treat synthetic wastewater under stepwise increasing doses of STM (0, 0.1, 1, 5, 25 and 50  mg L− 1) {{over a period}} of 618  days, with a control system (no antibiotics) operated in parallel. Streptomycin {{is one of the first}} broad-spectrum antibiotics to be utilized for the control of infectious human and plant diseases. Although STM resistance mechanisms have been proposed in many clinical bacteria, plant and animal pathogens (De Leon Door et al. 2013; Sundin et al. 1995; Sundin 2002; Um et al. 2016), the resistance spectra in wastewater communities are still poorly understood. In additions, the culture-based wastewater bacterial responses against stepwise increasing doses of STM have not been studied. In this study, wastewater bacterial strains were isolated from six different STM exposures, and the impacts of antibiotic concentrations on wastewater bacterial diversity and the characteristics of antibiotic resistance were assessed using bacterial enrichment method, sequencing and, MIC assay. The presence and distribution of 11 antibiotic genetic determinants from <b>individual</b> <b>wastewater</b> bacterial isolates were determined by the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results of this new culture-based stepwise increasing STM approach will enable us to better understand the risks accompanying antibiotic <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|R
40|$|Energy {{saving and}} {{consumption}} reduction Abstract. Experimental research and engineering validation show concentrated activated sludge reflow stead of traditional reflow way still meets the national discharge standard, though the <b>treatment</b> efficiency of <b>wastewater</b> plant is slightly declined and further show concentrated activated sludge reflow process used in energy saving and consumption reduction of small-sized <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant is feasible. Research background Data {{reported by the}} Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People’s Republic of China(MOHURD) shows that 3513 <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants have been put into operation in China by September 2013 [1]. It is estimated daily <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> ability of China has reached about 149 million m 3, annual electricity power consumption has reached more than 13 billion KWH and electricity power consumption cost {{accounts for more than}} half of operation cost of <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities[2].

The {{idea is to}} utilize interactive multiobjective optimization which enables the designer to consider the design with respect to several conflicting evaluation criteria simultaneously. This is especially important because the re-quirements for <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants are {{getting more and more}} strict. By combining a process simulator to simulate <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> and an interactive multiobjective optimization software to aid the designer during the design process, we obtain a practically useful tool for decision support.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Thesis was to {{calculate}} and visualize performance indicators for the secondary treatment step in municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants. Performance indicators are a valuable tool to communicate process conditions and energy efficiency to both management teams and operators of the plant. Performance indicators should be as few as possible, clearly defined, easily measurable, verifiable and easy to understand. Performance indicators have been calculated {{based on data from}} existing <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants and qualified estimates when insufficient data was available. These performance indicators were then evaluated and narrowed down to a few key indicators, related to process performance and energy usage. Performance indicators for the secondary treatment step were calculated for four municipal <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants operating three different process configurations of the activated-sludge technology; Sternö <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (Sweden) using a conventional activated-sludge technology, Ronneby <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (Sweden) using a ring-shaped activated-sludge technology called oxidation ditch, Headingley <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (Canada) and Kimmswick <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant (USA), both of which use sequencing batch reactor (SBR) activated-sludge technology. Literature reviews, interviews and process data formed the basis of the Master Thesis. The secondary treatment was studied in all the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants. Performance indicators were calculated, to the extent it was possible, for this step in the treatment process. The results showed that all the <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatments</b> plants, studied in this master thesis, were well below regulatory requirements of effluent concentrations of organic matter and nutrients. This gap between legislated requirements and performance provides an opportunity for improving energy efficiency and maintaining discharge requirements. The removal of organic matter was consistently high at all <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants studied but the removal of nitrogen was slightly lower during the colder months. The results further showed that the discharge of nitrogen from <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants is the largest stress on the recipient. Data regarding the energy usage was almost nonexistent and energy for aeration was therefore calculated when possible since it is aeration that accounts for the largest fraction of energy usage in a <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant. Sternö wastewater-treatment plant proved to be more energy efficient than Rustorp <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on {{independent}} chemical analyses, on-site analyses and field sampling. It includes seven selected <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants at mountain lodges. At each plant the author conducted three sets of winter analyses and two sets of summer analyses. The research includes 200 hours of field work in the mountains. Before conducting the analyses {{it was necessary to}} catalogue all <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants at Slovenian Alpine Association's mountain lodges and on this basis choose a representative sample of <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants for further research. The thesis interfer widely with Slovenian environment with exact, analytical review of Slovenian legislation about small <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants. The results are generally applicable to all small <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants while mountain-related are stressed separately. The thesis monitored 20 parameters at inflow and outflow of <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants all around Slovenia. Propositional improvements for concrete plants are made on this data. The great amount of data acquired in the research is of great help for further scientific research. The thesis also includes proposals and questions for improvement of Slovenian legislation, proposals for <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plants producers as well as proposals to improve and to make on-site samplings and measures uniform.
