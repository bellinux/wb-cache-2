40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to characterise low cycle fatigue of high – {{chromium}} martensitic 9 %Cr cast steel for advanced steam power plants. Design/methodology/approach: The research on fatigue life {{within the scope of}} small amount of cycles to failure at room temperature was carried out on high - chromium, martensite GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 cast steel. Fatigue tests were performed for the assumed five levels of controlled amplitude of total strain εac i. e. 0. 25; 0. 30; 0. 35; 0. 50 and 0. 60 %. The loads applied in the performed experiment oscillated sinusoidally with the stress ratio R = - 1 and frequency f = 0. 2 Hz. Fatigue tests were run by means of Instron 8501 <b>hydropulser.</b> Tests pieced for fatigue tests were round and threaded. Findings: The investigated cast steel is strongly weakened during low cycle fatigue. The period of stabilization was not revealed during the cyclic loading of GP 91 cast steel. Moreover, it has been proved that the course of weakening process of the cast steel does not depend on the level of strain. In the examined cast steel’s weakening process three stages can be distinguished which are characterized by a different weakening speed. Research limitations/implications: The present study is focused on the influence of low cycle fatigue on the fatigue life of GX 12 CrMoVNbN 91 cast steel at room temperature. The investigated cast steel is characterized by the lack of stabilization period, which makes the research results considerably difficult to work out. Originality/value: The fatigue characteristics of GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 cast steel is presented within the scope of small amount of cycles to failure. Fatigue life of the investigated cast steel was described using the equations of Ramberg-Osgood and Manson-Coffin-Basquin...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{characterize}} the low cycle fatigue of high - chromium martensitic GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 cast steel {{from the perspective of}} the strain and energy criterion. Design/methodology/approach: The tests of fatigue strength within the scope of small amount of cycles to failure at room temperature and elevated temperature (400, 550 and 600 °C) were carried out on GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 cast steel. The fatigue tests were run for five assumed levels of controlled amplitude of total strain εac (0. 25; 0. 30; 0. 35; 0. 50 and 0. 60 %). The loading applied in the experiment oscillated sinusoidally with the stress ratio R = - 1 and frequency f = 0. 2 Hz. The fatigue tests were performed by means of Instron 8501 <b>hydropulser.</b> Tests pieces for the fatigue tests were round and threaded. Findings: The examined cast steel during low cycle fatigue is subject to intense weakening. The period of stabilization was not revealed during the cyclic loading of the cast steel, neither at room temperature, nor elevated one. Moreover, it has been proved that the extent of changes in the cyclic properties is influenced by the level of strain and temperature. Practical implications: Obtained results of the tests are indispensable for the formulation of necessary characteristics of high-temperature creep resisting steels and cast steels. Originality/value: The paper presents the fatigue characteristics of GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 - 1 cast steel within the scope of small amount of cycles to failure. The fatigue characteristics of the examined cast steel was developed for both: room temperature and elevated temperature - 400, 550 and 600 °C. Fatigue life of the investigated cast steel was described using the equations of Ramberg-Osgood and Manson-Coffin-Basquin, and presented {{from the perspective of the}} energy criterion...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic pulse {{tools are}} one of the {{well-known}} tools to create vibrational forces in drill-strings. It is known that these vibrational forces applied behind the bit can affect the drilling rate in medium strength formations. This thesis investigates the action of these types of tools behind the bit through the series of Distinct Element Method (DEM) simulations. Two types of hydraulic pulse tools are evaluated and characterized in this thesis. The Valved-flow tool (AGT) and the <b>Hydropulse</b> tool. A unique simulation scenario was designed to simulate these tools in the DEM environment. Then this scenario combined with simulation of drilling process to simulate the drilling with the AGT and the <b>Hydropulse</b> tool. Results of the simulations showed significant increase in drilling performance when the AGT was used in the process. Simulation results of the two types of tools were analyzed and compared to each other. The results showed that the AGT tool with accompanying shock tool has better performance than the integrated <b>Hydropulse</b> tool and drilling bit. The shock tool produces axial compliance in the drill-string. Results of additional simulations revealed the effect of compliance on drilling performance. These results showed that if the AGT is deployed without accompanying shock tool, it can have strong negative effect on drilling rate. On the other hand, the results suggested the use of shock tool in <b>Hydropulse</b> tool assembly since the drilling performance improved when shock tool was used in combination with the <b>Hydropulse</b> tool. It was observed from the iii simulation results that the drilling performance of the <b>Hydropulse</b> tool was increase by more than 100...|$|R

40|$|Process {{waste streams}} from the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) may require {{treatment}} for cesium, strontium, and transuranic (TRU) element removal {{in order to}} meet criteria for incorporation in grout. The approach planned for cesium and strontium removal is ion exchange using a zeolite exchanger followed by filtration. Filtration using a pneumatic <b>hydropulse</b> filter is planned to remove TRU elements which are associated with process solids and to also remove zeolite bearing the cesium and strontium. The solids removed during filtration are recycled to the melter feed system to be incorporated into the HWVP glass product. Fluor Daniel, Inc., the architect-engineering firm for HWVP, recommended a Pneumatic <b>Hydropulse</b> (PHP) filter manufactured by Mott Metallurgical Corporation for use in the HWVP. The primary waste streams considered for application of zeolite contact and filtration are melter off-gas condensate from the submerged bed scrubber (SBS), and equipment decontamination solutions from the Decontamination Waste Treatment Tank (DWTT). Other waste streams could be treated depending on TRU element and radionuclide content. Laboratory and pilot-scale filtration tests were conducted to provide a preliminary assessment of the adequacy of the recommended filter for application to HWVP waste treatment...|$|R
