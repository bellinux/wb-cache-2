50|$|As {{the film}} is drawn upwards, it is cooled by a ring of air blowers so that the melt first becomes an {{amorphous}} viscoelastic solid, and then a semicrystalline solid, at {{what is known as}} the frost line. After solidification, the blown <b>film</b> <b>tube</b> continues to be cooled as it is pulled up by several sets of rollers, deflating the film to form lay-flat tubing. The flat film is then wound on a spool before further processing or shipping. The height of the film line is often 10 times the diameter of the blown tube or more; film lines in excess of 30 meters are possible.|$|E
40|$|The aim {{with this}} master`s thesis {{project was to}} examine what effect {{structured}} heating surfaces have on the mass and heat transfer properties of falling film evaporation. Based on a literature study, some alternative surface structures that could be of interest for falling film evaporation of black liquor were selected for further investigation. A new structure was also selected to be tested. Tubes of copper and PVC were utilized {{as a basis for}} the experimental investigation. Five different copper test tubes were studied: one smooth, two equipped with dimples located in a row or diagonal towards each other, one spirally threaded and one spirally winded with a copper thread. Two test tubes of PVC were studied: one smooth and one equipped with the new structure. The tests were carried out by attaching the different test tubes one by one to the lower edge of a vertically placed falling <b>film</b> <b>tube.</b> Ordinary tap water was utilized as the testing fluid. A divider placed {{at the top of the}} falling <b>film</b> <b>tube</b> allowed an evenly distributed film to be formed that flowed therafter down over the falling <b>film</b> <b>tube</b> wall and the test tube. Since the test tubes were not provided with a heating element, the mass transport was measured from the test tubes to the falling film. This result was then used to estimate the heat transfer through calculations. As mass transport medium benzoic acid was chosen which was applied on the test tubes dissolved in a small amount of acetone. The mixture of dissolved benzoic aid in acetone was sprayed with a spurt bottle on the test tube surface, where the acetone was evaporated and left behind a relatively even layer of benzoic acid. For each test run, four samples of the falling film were taken out at fixed time points after that the falling film had passed over the benzoic acid covered test tube. The mass concentration of benzoic acid was then determined with the help of spectrophotometry. The different test tubes mass flux were determined from the measured mass concentrations and utilized film flow after that the benzoic acid covered surfaces had been calculated for each trial run. These mass fluxes were then divided by the solubility of benzoic acid in water to estimate the mass transport coefficients which were in turn used to estimate the heat transport coefficients (heat transition number) based on the Chilton-Colburn analogy. The results indicate that all the tested surface modifications should be able to enhance the mass and heat transport in a falling film of water comperad to a smooth surface. The new structure and the spirally threaded structure achived the highest enhancements (113 and 114 %) of the estimated heat transport coefficients compared to the reference smooth tube structure. The heat transport coefficient enhancements for the other structures tested were 69 % (structure with dimples located diagonally towards each other), 65 % (structure with a spirally winded copper thread), and 44 % for the structure with dimples located in a row towards each other...|$|E

The contribution discuses the long-term operation of LiBr-H 2 O absorption units with consideration of corrosion, slit forming processes and production of incondensable gases. The one-stage experimental absorption chiller with exactly same design of desorber-condenser and absorber-evaporator was build up at the Brno University of Technology in 2008. This experimental absorption unit operates with LiBr-H 2 O working pair. Design of the unit keeps two-cylinder conception, which is common for large-scale absorption units. Heat transfer between the working fluid and the heating/cooling water is realized with utilizing of falling film cooper pipe registers. The cooling capacity of the absorption chiller was designed 6 kW on temperature level 9 °C. The contribution introduces design of the one-stage experimental absorption unit, building, operation experiences {{and the results of}} a carried out measurements.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{efficiency}} of an infection control protocol in dental radiology during radiographic exposure and processing, since the prevention of infectious diseases should be a matter of concern of the professional in all procedures. The areas selected for material collection were the <b>film,</b> <b>tube</b> head, dental chair, lead apron, buttons, protective barrier, darkroom bench and processing solutions (developer solution, water and fixer solution). Material was collected from each area both before and after establishment of the infection control protocol. Ten RODAC plates were employed for each site, adding up to 140 plates (70 before and 70 after), besides 60 Petri plates (30 before and 30 after) containing blood agar as the culture medium. The processing solutions were dropped on the Petri plates, whereas the material collected from the other areas was directly collected on the RODAC plates. All plates were incubated at 37 ºC for 48 hours and after this period the number of colonies in each plate was counted.

40|$|Loss of {{tritiated water}} (Trio) from aqueous samples can occur either as bulk water loss to a desiccating {{environment}} without concomitant changes in specific activity or through water vapor exchange between the radiolabeled sample and a humidfIed environment, the latter decreasing the specific {{activity of the}} labeled sample without affecting sample volume. THO is lost from liquid scintillation (LS) vials {{as a function of}} vial composition. One half of the label is lost from 20 ml borosilicate glass vials in around 230 days whereas polyethylene vials lose half the THO in 90 days (20 nil vials) or 27 days (3 ml vials) and polyethylene-film tubes (Filnevare®) lose the same amount in under 4 days. Trio moves directly through the wall of the <b>film</b> <b>tube</b> and appears to diffuse through the polyethylene in contact with the solvent as well as through the air space above the scintilla-tor. The closure seams of the tube do not constitute a sig-nificant pathway for TIlO loss.

40|$|The {{chemical}} compositions {{were determined}} for juice and condensate samples collected at various {{locations in the}} Robert evaporator sets at two Australian sugar factories. The purpose of the investigations was primarily to determine the magnitude of sucrose degradation {{and the consequences of}} those degradation reactions, such as reduced pH of condensate. Robert evaporators are used almost exclusively in Australian sugar factories. One of the factories involved in the trials incorporates a cogeneration facility and undertakes extensive vapour bleeding from large vessels at the first and second effects. The second factory undertakes no bleeding of vapour and the residence time for juice in {{the front end of the}} evaporators is much shorter than in the evaporator set at the cogeneration factory. Boiling temperatures are also lower at the front end of the set. The sucrose degradation results have been compared with the predictions using the Vukov expression (as a function of juice pH, juice brix, temperature and residence time). Average sucrose losses of 0. 85 % and < 0. 05 % were measured for the cogeneration factory and for the second factory, respectively. Predicted losses for the conditions at the cogeneration factory were ~ 1. 16 % and for the second factory < 0. 05 %. A sucrose loss of 1 % across the evaporators would likely cause a 1. 6 % reduction in sugar production compared with a factory operating with a 0. 1 % sucrose loss at the evaporators. Subsequent modelling was undertaken to predict the sucrose losses that would be expected if Kestner or falling <b>film</b> <b>tube</b> evaporators (both providing shorter residence times than Robert evaporators) were used as replacements for Robert evaporators at the first effect. The expected changes in sucrose losses from supplying juice at higher pH to the evaporators and using process steam at lower saturation temperature were also considered...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{behaviors}} of artificial elastic tubes are studied {{to see if}} the fibre orientation in these vessels is optimal by comparison with those of human artery. By optimal we mean that the strengths of stretching and inflation in the vessels are equally good. Artificial thin <b>film</b> <b>tubes</b> have many applications in the food and fruit packing industry. In this paper, the wall of thin-film elastic tubes is considered as a fibre-reinforced membrane with two families of fibres and a uniform matrix material. Their mechanical properties are determined using a structure-based constitutive law. The constitutive parameters are inversely estimated from two separate uniaxial tensile tests in the circumferential and longitudinal directions. The inflation model for the elastic tubes and human common carotid artery are developed to investigate their breaking characteristics, and to explore the optimal fibre orientations. Results show that the fibre orientation has an important effect on the break behavior of the elastic tubes, and the tubes investigated are much weaker in the circumferential direction.
