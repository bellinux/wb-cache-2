[ [...] . ] I want to {{make trouble}} because I {{want to make}} things even more {{complicated}} than they are around here, and then maybe I {{can get out of}} this whole mess – this family and everything.

Albee’s wit and sharp irony dominate the play, managing to “engage, to upset, to trouble” audiences and readers.

I was raised in a pretty {{conservative}} home in Orange County, CA, and I always figured that when my first election rolled around, I would vote for a Republican. However, when the time came, I found myself really drawn to Obama, and ultimately, I cast my first vote ever for him (and I'm glad I did.) Lately, I've really been wondering why I felt so drawn to Obama. Is it the way he looks? Talks? Is it his personality? Is it what he stands for? His politics? Or am I just a mindless lemming who jumped on the Obama train without thinking? The more I think about it, the more I realize how much the media influenced the way many Americans, including myself, perceived the Presidential candidates. This is a small study of how magazine covers in particular created this sort of influence. The project certainly isn't perfect, but I really had fun making it and I hope you enjoy. Thanks, Hannah Milliken Class of 2012 Cornell University 1 _ 5 w 0 r 03 o...|$|R
