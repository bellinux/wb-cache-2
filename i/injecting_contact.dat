These characteristics are superior to the TIPS-PEN only transistors. Using channel scaling measurements and scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, the sharp turn-on in current in the blends is attributed to a contact resistance that originates from a thin insulating layer between the <b>injecting</b> <b>contacts</b> and the semiconductor channel. ...|$|R

40|$|Positron {{lifetime}} spectroscopy measurements {{have been}} carried out for semi-insulating GaAs with applied electric fields in the samples directed towards, and away from the positron <b>injecting</b> <b>contact.</b> The lifetime spectra have been decomposed into two components, the longer of which (≈ 400 ps) is characteristic of open volume defects at the metal-semiconductor interface through which positrons are injected. The interesting feature of these experiments is the large increase in the intensity of this interface component as the field is directed towards the contact. We show that this increase is caused by a significant fraction of implanted positrons drifting under the influence of a strong electric field produced by a layer of space-charge formed adjacent to the positron <b>injecting</b> <b>contact.</b> The general trend of the intensity variation is well explained by the proposed model. Experiments involving the application of an ac bias to the samples strengthen the suggestion that the space charge region is largely formed from ionized EL 2 donors. The results of the present work indicate that semi-insulating GaAs possesses properties that make it a suitable material for the fabrication of a high efficiency (≈ 10 %) room-temperature field-assisted positron moderator. The extraction of positrons from the GaAs substrate into the vacuum through a thin metalization is discussed based upon available positron affinities for the GaAs and various elemental metals.

We demonstrate that accounting for the series resistance of the device is essential to determine Jph. Without such correction, the results are, even qualitatively, incorrect. We show that in solar cells with forward bias applied Jph is reduced by recombination of photogenerated charge carriers with injected charge carriers. Self-selective contacts or band bending are not necessary to explain the effects. Without <b>injecting</b> <b>contacts</b> Jph is symmetric around the compensation voltage. A simple analytical model shows that under high forward bias Jph scales inversely with 1 + ¿¿pre, in which ¿pre represents the extent of Langevin recombination and ¿ is a positive constant. Under conditions where Langevin recombination is very low or when electron and hole mobility are a very different, photogenerated charge carriers can affect the space-charge field and modify the injection of charge carriers.

Quantum-chemical calculations at the density functional theory level predict that the Alq 3 radical anion is formed upon reaction with the alkali metals. In this case, up to three metal atoms can react with a given Alq 3 molecule to form the trivalent anion. The anion formation results in a splitting of the N 1 s core level and {{formation of a new}} feature in the previously forbidden energy gap. Virtually identical spectra are observed in the Al/LiF/Alq 3 system, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} radical anion is also formed when all three of these constituents are present.

In the absence of LiF or similar material, the reaction of Al with Alq 3 appears to be destructive, with the deposited Al reacting directly with the quinolate oxygen. We proposed that in those circumstances where the radical anion is formed, it and not the cathode metal are responsible for the electron injection properties.

The dominating ion neutralization process on the cathode controls the formation of ""Helmholtz"" inner layers at the metal cathode+oxide+gas interface. The presence of a positive ion monolayer over the cathode electrode will tend to reduce the field threshold required for electronic field emission and affect the overall current-voltage characteristics.
