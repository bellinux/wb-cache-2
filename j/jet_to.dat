5|$|August 6, 2015: Hurricane Guillermo {{interacted with}} a longwave trough in the {{subtropical}} <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> its northeast to spawn a rare dry-season atmospheric river, which {{went on to}} send moisture toward the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing a rare lightning storm to that area that night. Since the storm was dry and hardly brought any rain, the NWS issued a Red Flag Warning for that area.|$|E
5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi Stuff {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each to claim a jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.|$|E

5|$|As the Martians ravage Las Vegas with Art Land, a Las Vegas developer, {{being among}} their victims, Byron Williams, a casino {{employee}} and former world champion boxer, leads {{a small group}} of survivors consisting of Barbara Land (Art's wife), Tom Jones, a beautiful waitress named Cindy, and a gambling lawyer to an airfield in the hopes of flying a small <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> safety. They barely make it, losing the lawyer in the process, but discover a large group of Martians stationed there as they are preparing to take off. Byron creates a diversion by challenging them to a fistfight. While he succeeds in killing the Ambassador, he is outnumbered and overwhelmed, but Tom, Barbara and Cindy escape.|$|E
5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled knapsack and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E

5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, JAL debuted a Boeing777–300 (JA8941) with {{a special}} Oneworld livery to promote the airlines's entry to the global airline alliance. Previously this {{aircraft}} carried the Shingo Katori and the Saiyuki television livery. In 2008, JAL repainted a single Boeing 777–200 to have a green rather than red arc on its tail, along with a green origami airplane on the fuselage, and named it the Eco <b>Jet,</b> <b>to</b> highlight the company's efforts to reduce {{the environmental impact of}} commercial aviation. In 2009, JAL repainted JA8941 again, as well as a JTA 737-400 (JA8933) to promote Kobukuro and their new album Calling as well as a live concert tour in Okinawa and around Japan. This livery was released officially on 30 July 2009. It has since then been replaced {{with a special}} Doraemon livery.|$|E

5|$|Raven, {{thinking}} McCoy is {{attracted to}} her in her natural form, tells him {{not to use the}} cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E
