40|$|Nowadays {{governments in}} the {{developed}} world are restricting tobacco consumption and courts are acting againstobacco companies. The impression is that only consumers are addicts and only companies are responsible for spreading tobacco consumption. However, governments are also dependent on tobacco and also responsible for encouraging its use. This article deals with the period when tobacco started to be a mass consumption product in many countries, mainly in the form of cigarettes. By that time, the tobacco industry was organised either under a <b>fiscal</b> <b>monopoly</b> or under a highly taxed competitive market. So to understand how smoking became an universally consumed product, it is necessary to review the role of governments in this process. This role became more evident when the state became involved in any or all of the stages of tobacco businesses (plantation, purchase, production and/or retailing), usuall...|$|R

This is consistent with what is found in economic literature about addiction and market structure: for oligopoly or monopoly, if marginal cost is increasing, supply of an addictive good may be as high or higher than for perfect competition. This paper concludes that brand advertising is essential for market share mechanisms but its relation with the expansion of tobacco market is not as clear as it could be found on policies banning tobacco advertising or in Business and economic history literature. The lack of branding development in the Spanish case is just a consequence of the fact that tobacco industry was organized in Spain under a <b>fiscal</b> <b>monopoly,</b> and it was the lack of competence of the monopoly that make the Spanish products non-competitive, {{and as a matter of}} fact, the opportunities for a traditional tobacco producer of exporting or becoming a foreign direct investor were lost in Spain. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} how a firm-level tax (or subsidy) calculated on {{the average}} wage relative to a pre-set norm may promote employment. We assume a monopoly union setting wages at the firm level to maximize {{that part of the}} wage bill exceeding the reservation wage. The fiscal device affects union perception of labour demand and induces it to quote a lower wage and obtain a higher corresponding level of employment. Empirical tests are performed over a sample of 43 Polish firms in 1990 and 1991. They support our model assumptions as well as the ‘employment-enhancing’ effect of the tax in Polish firms. <b>fiscal</b> incentives; <b>monopoly</b> unions; Poland; wage norm...|$|R
40|$|The general EC {{competition}} provisions, or the anti-competitive {{agreements are}} contained in the new 81 - 86 (former art. 85 - 90) of the Treaty on the EU of 25 March 1957 (The Treaty of Rome). The EU competition regulations apply solely to the anti-competitive agreements which may infringe free trade between member states, and, as such, they concern undertakings. The EU competition rules are binding in all spheres of economic activity, except for the exceptional cases where the Treaty excludes their application. Those exclusions, however, are few. One of the general exclusions is provided in the new art. 86 clause. 2 (former art. 90 clause 2) of the Treaty. It applies to those undertakings which have been given by the state the status of undertakings rendering services of general economic interest, or undertakings that constitute an element of a state monopoly, bringing a certain revenue. The notion of a state monopoly bringing revenues, or a <b>fiscal</b> <b>monopoly,</b> does not pose any major interpretation problems. However, the notion of services of general economic interest is already a specific concept that has been introduced to the community law. Moreover, it should be stressed that services of general economic interest constitute one of the prinicipal rules of the Community. Similar, or derivative, notions to those above are public utility, public services and universal services. Services of general interest is a broader concept, {{to be found in}} large network-type sectors such as transport, postal services, communication or energy. Recognition of a certain type of services as services of general economic interset entails certain public service obligations imposed on the providers of those services...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{dramatic}} growth and institutional reforms {{have taken place in}} the Chinese economy and society, which has been accompanied by accelerated urbanization. This paper examines the rationale behind the local government’s pursuit of urbanization and its deep relationship with fiscal reform, local land management, and the political performance evaluation system of local cadres by central officials. The findings reveal that, rather than being a natural consequence of economic development and a complex outcome of population urbanization and land urbanization, China’s urbanization in recent decades can be identified as a local government-led development deriving from the municipalities’ <b>fiscal</b> incentives, land <b>monopoly</b> authority incentives, and political incentives. While urbanization seems to be an inevitable trend of economic development, it is actually driven by an unsustainable accumulation regime that prioritizes the needs of local land fiscal income, real estate development, and GDP growth...|$|R
40|$|How did {{manufacturers}} {{cope with}} {{innovation in the}} mercantilist age? In most sectors, innovation itself was conceived mainly as product innovation, even when new production processes were involved. In this perspective, also the discussed complementarity between mercantilist import-substituting imitation, and process and product innovation becomes clearer. The case of ceramics production in the Venetian Republic is particularly interesting, showing clearly that import substitution was the main drive of change in a manufacture which never attained in Venice the strategic importance of glass, silk and wool. Art historians have reconstructed a history of ceramics production sites at a local level, providing {{a detailed description of}} product typologies, useful to study their evolution, origin and diffusion. These studies show clearly that the decay of urban ceramic guilds {{in the second half of}} 17 th century pushed political authorities to grant privileges to private manufacturers producing fine majolica, then porcelain and in the late 18 th century earthenware, both in Venice and in some centres of its mainland. These studies indicate also a series of sources (pleas, privilege patents, trials, notarial acts, and the pieces preserved in museums and private collections), which are used here for an historical analysis of the institutional and informal devices allowing local production to adapt to European market trends and innovations. The logic of privilege allowance emerging from this analysis shows the political authorities of the Republic struggling to find a mechanism allowing private manufacturers to develop durable technical expertise in order to face the continuous waves of innovation in European ceramics typologies and production. Temporary <b>monopolies,</b> <b>fiscal</b> exemptions and restrictions to workforce mobility were the main institutional tools used to build up an industrial policy which could cope with product innovation as apprenticeship and cooptation did in the guild framework...|$|R

The assessment reveals {{that over the}} last several years, Spain has made major progress not only in macroeconomic and fiscal adjustment, but also in modernizing and strengthening its fiscal institutions and in disseminating information about the government’s operations. As a result, it now fully meets or exceeds the IMF Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency standards in many areas.
