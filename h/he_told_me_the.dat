500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that? <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{time later}} Blake said to Millicent, [...] "You heard what <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> dear? <b>The</b> secret {{must still be}} kept; I can't speak." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>the</b> massacre, when {{five hundred}} Poles {{were shot down}} by Cossacks in the market-place, merely because they sung their {{national}} hymn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I know it," [...] {{answered}} Ferris in a heartsick, hopeless voice. [...] "He knew it, too. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so <b>the</b> {{day before}} he died." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nicole Krauss {{includes}} {{a reference to}} Lorca in her novel Great House (2010): [...] "It was then that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> desk had been used, briefly, by Lorca." [...] (p.11) The desk is the central metaphor for memory and the burden of inheritance, used throughout the novel. Also see page 13. Krauss also refers to Neruda the poet.|$|E
2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he had on her life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> stories of the classics and, long before I could understand them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E
60|$|Tob. Why, truly, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> {{party that}} owned {{the water was}} with child.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old John Sprague {{has just}} gotten back from Grass Valley," [...] said Ellen. [...] "I stopped {{in to see}} him. Shore <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>the</b> village gossip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Strange, he must {{be somewhere}} around. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of <b>the</b> robbery {{and then he said}} that they were coming after him. Then the message was {{suddenly}} cut off.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He knows little, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>the</b> Black Police {{would have}} arrived {{here before the}} people knew--had not someone in the Wind-Vane Offices learnt. He said a girl." ...|$|R
60|$|He had an {{engagement}} that evening; but later on <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story--that is, {{so far as}} he then knew it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was desperately}} afraid, before <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> truth, {{that he had}} other views--views that might have proved fatal to my dearest hopes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story once, and I {{always liked}} to hear it, {{because it was}} {{pleasant}} {{to see how well}} he had succeeded." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never had}} any reason to doubt the exact truth of what <b>he</b> thus <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he cried}} out: 'That was not me, but my brother, and I have slain him, because <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> by <b>the</b> {{way that he}} had claimed you for his wife!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Colonel Sahib himself. Not {{in those}} many words, but plainly {{enough for one}} who is not {{altogether}} a mud-head. Yea, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>the</b> te-rain when {{we went down to}} Lucknow.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{company had}} not a leg to stand upon, {{and at his}} {{instigation}} I sat down and wrote an insulting letter to the chairman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{that was}} old Johnson," [...] he answered. [...] "Don't you be frightened of that; he lives here." [...] And then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> poor thing's history.|$|E
6000|$|Now, I saw in my dream, {{that this}} old gentleman, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story, did himself {{seem to be}} greatly {{affected}} therewith. He moreover went on, and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what proof have I? Was {{that what}} {{you were going to}} say? None. But I had the {{information}} from <b>the</b> man himself. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>the</b> train that night going to London.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He knows {{less than}} a buffalo. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> on <b>the</b> steamer that he was driven {{out of his own}} land by Demah-Kerazi which is a devil inhabiting crowds and assemblies," [...] said Abdul.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, after a fashion. He said {{enough for}} <b>me</b> to guess <b>the</b> rest. <b>He</b> never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> lady's name. She was very beautiful, I understand, and very heartless. Oh, she used him very badly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was then that <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> names of all the tenants. He used to scold me because I did not {{understand}} the nature of their leases." ...|$|E
60|$|And so I cornered Bridger in a {{place where}} they have {{artificial}} palms and wine; and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story which is here in my words and on his responsibility.|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> more {{quiescent}} and amused you {{can keep}} him, the more chance of a fair recovery there will be. I am glad he thinks of dining with the party to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard it}} from Peter the Great, who aided you on <b>the</b> occasion. And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>the</b> Dey has often since then offered to do you some good turn, but that you have always declined." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes indeed. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> on <b>the</b> way up {{yesterday}} of {{an adventure}} {{he had had}} with the Malays, and as only three out of a boat-load of nine escaped, {{it must have been}} a pretty sharp business.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Von Ragastein and I {{exchanged}} {{the most}} intimate confidences in his camp," [...] Dominey said, [...] "as Doctor Schmidt there knows. I told him my history, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his. <b>The</b> letters and papers I took from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|The old sailor did {{not speak}} {{for a minute or}} two; and then, after a sharp puff at his pipe, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} story, of which I have but slightly altered the wording: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> truth after all, {{poor little}} dear! Ah, first {{thoughts}} are best, and a body's heart'll guide them right, {{if they will}} but hearken to it." [...] And then she told Sir John all.|$|E
6000|$|... “Then I {{suppose you}} applauded his decision. In fact, I wonder whether {{he arrived at}} it quite unassisted? The last time Clay {{mentioned}} the matter <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> young fool didn’t seem able to make up his mind.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{came up to}} {{the fence}} and {{extended}} a handful of strawberries, for his gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At <b>the</b> same time <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of <b>the</b> burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{paid them}} well," [...] he answered. [...] "At least I didn't do it myself. My servant comes from these parts, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>the</b> place and {{arranged}} everything. I am {{hoping to be}} able to buy it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I have no torngak. He was my grandmother's. And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>the</b> Kablunet {{was a great}} angekok, {{and would}} have a torngak of his own soon. Moreover, he said the games must begin at once--so come along, Ippegoo." ...|$|R
