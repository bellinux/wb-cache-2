Her father believed that biography {{could tell the}} history of a culture as well as serve a pedagogical function.

500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> better than anybody".|$|E

At a {{reception}} {{at the start of}} the tour, British judge and cricket enthusiast Lord Birkett said [...] "If I know the English as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> every Mother in the land will pray for him."

60|$|P.P.S.--I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> saw Roche {{sleeping}} {{with his head}} on the lady's shoulder, in the coach. I couldn't swear it, and the light was deceptive. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Reuniting {{at their}} parents' {{suburban}} D.C. home, Marvin's brother Frankie discussed {{the events of}} his tenure at Vietnam, detailing experiences that sometimes left the two brothers consoling each other in tears. Then after Frankie explained witnessing violence and murder before he was to depart back to the states, he recalled Marvin sitting propped up in a bed {{with his hands in}} his face. Afterwards, Marvin told his brother, [...] "I didn't know how to fight before, but now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I just have to do it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet.

6000|$|... "I {{know the}} Laning girls, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> meet Miss Stanhope once--at a {{football}} game. I'll {{be glad to}} meet them again. But tell me about yourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Can you not {{understand}} that a man may be in great doubt as to the exact words {{that he may have}} spoken at such a time?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Such {{stories are}} not very quickly told; {{and in this case}} it was {{necessary}} to understand him very accurately. At length <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> understand him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{that because}} he might have jumped off if I hadn't been up there to prevent him--I mean if we had had a smash. I didn't {{want him to get}} out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Isabel I {{wanted to}} see. Didn't I leave a card? No; <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> felt so--almost at home, that <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> of a card." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; I do--or <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> What {{it comes}} to, {{in a few}} words, is that {{somebody}} you were fond of {{has gone out of}} your life. Is that it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In future advise {{that other}} friend of yours, the devil," [...] I {{answered}} angrily, and pulled my arm away at last. [...] "Don Juan, you have presumed, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not seek your advice. It is yourself {{that stands in}} need of advice this moment more than any man in Spain." ...|$|R

50|$|Of {{these early}} experiences, Kirk {{especially}} liked working on Matinee Theatre:I did thirty-seven {{of those in}} the next five years. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> more than any other actor.

60|$|He {{says that}} I afford him a curious {{psychological}} study, and <b>I</b> humbly <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not, as you know, take sufficient interest in dress {{to be able}} to describe the new fashions.
