60|$|The prayer which ensued {{was in a}} {{different}} tone. It was poured forth by the same person who had officiated as chaplain at the table; {{and was in the}} tone of a Boanerges, or Son of Thunder--a denouncer of crimes--an <b>invoker</b> of judgments--almost a prophet of evil and of destruction. The testimonies and the sins of the day were not forgotten--the mysterious murder of Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey was insisted upon--and thanks and praise were offered, that the very night on which they were assembled, had not seen another offering of a Protestant magistrate, to the bloodthirsty fury of revengeful Catholics.|$|E
60|$|More {{than a month}} elapsed before Belturbet had {{sufficiently}} {{recovered from}} his attack of nervous prostration to take an interest once more in {{what was going on}} in the world of politics. The Parliamentary Session was still in full swing, and a General Election was looming in the near future. He called for a batch of morning papers and skimmed rapidly through the speeches of the Chancellor, Quinston, and other Ministerial leaders, as well as those of the principal Opposition champions, and then sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief. Evidently the spell had ceased to act after the tragedy which had overtaken its <b>invoker.</b> There was no trace of angel anywhere.|$|E
60|$|On {{the night}} {{arranged}} I turned up about eight, {{and found the}} leader sitting alone in almost total darkness in a small back room. He {{was dressed in a}} black gown, like an inquisitor's dress in an old drawing, that left nothing of him visible: except his eyes, which peered out through two small round holes. Upon {{the table in front of}} him was a brass dish of burning herbs, a large bowl, a skull covered with painted symbols, two crossed daggers, and certain implements shaped like quern stones, which were used to control the elemental powers in some fashion I did not discover. I also put on a black gown, and remember that it did not fit perfectly, and that it interfered with my movements considerably. The sorcerer then took a black cock out of a basket, and cut its throat with one of the daggers, letting the blood fall into the large bowl. He opened a book and began an invocation, which was certainly not English, and had a deep guttural sound. Before he had finished, another of the sorcerers, a man of about twenty-five, came in, and having put on a black gown also, seated himself at my left band. I had the <b>invoker</b> directly in front of me, and soon began to find his eyes, which glittered through the small holes in his hood, affecting me in a curious way. I struggled hard against their influence, and my head began to ache. The invocation continued, and nothing happened for the first few minutes. Then the <b>invoker</b> got up and extinguished the light in the hall, so that no glimmer might come through the slit under the door. There was now no light except from the herbs on the brass dish, and no sound except from the deep guttural murmur of the invocation.|$|E

60|$|Consider some of {{the things}} it charges against her, and {{remember}} who it is it is speaking of. It calls her a sorceress, a false prophet, an <b>invoker</b> and companion of evil spirits, a dealer in magic, a person ignorant of the Catholic faith, a schismatic; she is sacrilegious, an idolater, an apostate, a blasphemer of God and His saints, scandalous, seditious, a disturber of the peace; she incites men to war, and to the spilling of human blood; she discards the decencies and proprieties of her sex, irreverently assuming the dress of a man and the vocation of a soldier; she beguiles both princes and people; she usurps divine honors, and has caused herself to be adored and venerated, offering her hands and her vestments to be kissed.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{the man at}} my left swayed himself about, {{and cried}} out, [...] "O god! O god!" [...] I asked him what ailed him, {{but he did not}} know he had spoken. A moment after he said he could see a great serpent moving about the room, and became {{considerably}} excited. I saw nothing with any definite shape, but thought that black clouds were forming about me. I felt I must fall into a trance if I did not struggle against it, and that the influence which was causing this trance was out of harmony with itself, in other words, evil. After a struggle I got rid of the black clouds, and was able to observe with my ordinary senses again. The two sorcerers now began to see black and white columns moving about the room, and finally a man in a monk's habit, and they became greatly puzzled because I did not see these things also, for to them they were as solid as the table before them. The <b>invoker</b> appeared to be gradually increasing in power, and I began to feel as if a tide of darkness was pouring from him and concentrating itself about me; and now too I noticed that the man on my left hand had passed into a death-like trance. With a last great effort I drove off the black clouds; but feeling them to be the only shapes I should see without passing into a trance, and having no great love for them, I asked for lights, and after the needful exorcism returned to the ordinary world.|$|E
5000|$|Four terms always {{associated}} with the command pattern are command, receiver, <b>invoker</b> and client. A command object knows about receiver and invokes a method of the receiver. Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command, the receiver object to execute these methods is also stored in the command object by aggregation. The receiver then does the work when the execute (...) method in command is called. An <b>invoker</b> object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution. The <b>invoker</b> does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about command interface. <b>Invoker</b> object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a client object, the client decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the <b>invoker.</b> The client decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the <b>invoker</b> object.|$|E

5000|$|... 4th edition {{introduced}} implements. Magic implements fill {{a similar}} role to magic weapons, although no power requires an implement, if a character wields an appropriate magical implement while activating a {{power with the}} implement keyword, that power can benefit from the enhancement bonus and other properties of the implements. Rods are used by <b>invokers</b> and warlocks. Staffs, which also function as weapons, are used by druids, <b>invokers,</b> sorcerers and wizards. Totems are used by druids and shamans. Wands are used by bards, warlocks and wizards. Holy symbols are used by Avengers, Clerics and Paladins; unlike other implements, a character can benefit from a holy symbol by wearing it rather than needing to wield it. Orbs are used by wizards and musical instruments are used by bards. Sorcerers can use daggers as implements, and swordmages can use any weapon in the light and heavy blade groups, and certain paragon paths such as Wizard of the Spiral Tower can use specific weapon types as implements. Additionally, some magic weapons, such as Holy Avengers (for paladins), Pact Blades (for warlocks) and Songblades (for bards), function as implements. The July 2008 Playtest version of the Artificer uses orbs, rods, staffs and wands as implements.|$|R
5000|$|A service <b>invoker</b> makes service requests. It is a {{pluggable}} in-memory interface that abstracts {{the location}} of a service producer as well as the communication protocol, used between the consumer and producer when going across computer memory, from the SOP runtime environment such as an SVM. The producer can be in-process (i.e. in-memory), outside the process on the same server machine, or virtualized across a set of networked server machines. The use of a service <b>invoker</b> in SOP is the key to location transparency and virtualization. Another significant feature of the service <b>invoker</b> layer is the ability to optimize bandwidth and throughput when communicating across machines. For example, a [...] "SOAP Invoker" [...] is the default service <b>invoker</b> for remote communication across machines using the web service standards. This <b>invoker</b> can be dynamically swapped out if, for example, the producer and consumer wish to communicate through a packed proprietary API for better security and more efficient use of bandwidth.|$|E

This paper describes the design and implementation of ElasticRMI, a middleware system that (1) enables application developers to dynamically change the number of (server) objects available to handle remote method invocations with respect to the application’s workload, without requiring major changes to clients (<b>invokers)</b> of remote methods, (2) enables flexible elastic scaling by allowing developers to use a combination of resource utilization metrics and fine-grained application-specific information like the properties of internal data structures to drive scaling decisions, (3) provides a high-level programming framework that handles elasticity at the level of classes and objects, masking low-level platform specific tasks (like provisioning VM images) from the developer, and (4) increases the portability of ElasticRMI applications across different private data centers/IaaS clouds through Apache Mesos [5]...|$|R
40|$|Though often {{criticized for}} its {{inherent}} synchronization overhead and coupling, the {{remote method invocation}} (RMI) paradigm {{remains one of the}} most popular abstractions for building distributed applications. Many authors have suggested ways to overcome its drawbacks focusing mostly on the <b>invoker’s</b> perspective, for example by multiplexing invocations to replicated server objects, through “future ” return values, or even by prohibiting return values altogether. The more global perspective, and in particular the invokee side, has conversely only received little attention. In this paper we take a fresh look at the RMI paradigm, elaborating on argument passing semantics. We identify three lazy ways of passing arguments by value, di↵ering by the moment at which the transfer of the arguments synchronizes with the execution of the method body. We present a preliminary library implementation of our argument passing semantics in Java RMI, and illustrate their individual benefits through examples. We characterize analytically and empirically application scenarios which benefit from lazy argument passing...|$|R

40|$|While most antigens {{capable of}} {{inducing}} antibody responses can, under appropriate conditions, also induce delayed reactivity, some substances are preeminently <b>invokers</b> of delayed hypersensitivity while they induce antibody synthesis poorly {{or not at}} all. Generally these are small molecular entities, or larger molecules that may be only partially recognized as "foreign " by the responder. Examples of the first are arsenobenzoate-N-acetyl tyrosine (1) and small synthetic peptide copolymers of tyrosine and glutamic acid (2). In both of these cases, expanding their molecular size and complexity decreases their efficacy as inducers of delayed reactivity, while improving their capacities to induce antibodies. Examples of the second kind are gelatin (3), slightly altered homologous serum proteins (4), and a peptide derived from adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (5), all of which induce good delayed reactivity and poor antibody synthesis. Delayed contact hypersensitivity resulting from the spontaneous conjugation of applied chemicals (haptens) with autologous epidermal protein carriers (6, 7) illustrates this point also; antibody production is a minor response in these cases...|$|R
50|$|Imprecatory Bible {{passages}} {{have presented}} {{a variety of}} interpretive and ethical issues for scholars throughout various times in various situations. Even so, some Biblical scholars agree that their intent is to purposely alarm, and that <b>invokers</b> of imprecations in the Psalms did so for purposes of self catharsis, and to lead group catharsis during temple worship (see Solomon's Temple), noting that this probably helped provide ontological security to the Psalms's principal audience, the Israelites, who were a minority within their larger Mesopotamian world. Scholars also widely agree that imprecatory passages are never imprecatory in total, but are contextualized within messages of hope or promised mercy and blessing. More so than anything, particularly for passages from the Nevi'im, the intent is to provoke group or national repentance from evil acts and turn the hearers toward God. Liturgical reforms by the Roman Catholic Church after the Second Vatican Council led to the removal {{of some of the}} imprecatory psalms from the Divine Office, or the more problematic passages edited for liturgical use.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Service {{oriented}} applications feature {{interactions among}} several participants over the network. Mechanisms such as correlation sets and two-party sessions {{have been proposed}} in the literature to separate messages sent to different instances of the same service. This paper presents a process calculus featuring dynamically evolving multiparty sessions to model interactions that spread over several participants. The calculus also provides primitives for service definition/invocation and for structured communication in order to highlight the interactions among the different concepts. Several examples from the SOC area show the suitability of our approach. 1 Introduction Service Oriented Computing (SOC, for short), an emerging paradigm in distributed computing, envisages systems as a combination of services, possibly provided by different organisations. Typically, a service can be concurrently requested by many <b>invokers</b> (e. g., users or other services) so that many service instances can be carried on {{at the same time}} (e. g., several customers booking flights from the same airline). Hence, it is important to guarantee that the interactions taking place in different instances do not interfere, and messages are routed to intended recipients. Emerging standards like WS-BPEL [18] and WS-CDL [20] exploit the idea of correlation sets which allow messages to be routed to specific instances of services depending on a pre-defined subset of the invocation parameters (e. g., requests are routed according to usernames). Though correlation sets guarantee a good expressiveness, we argue that they make analysis harder because the emerging patterns of interaction rely on data values. Also, unrelated sessions can interfere with each other if they know (or use by chance) the &quot;right &quot; values...|$|R

40|$|First paragraph: The occult {{sciences}} were {{woven into}} the fabric of everyday life in nineteenth-century Britain. By no means the exclusive preserve of late Romantic all-male secret societies or, subsequently, of the urban bourgeoisie who formed the core membership of occult organizations such as the Theosophical Society or the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Campbell, Dixon, Wunder), they were available to the wider public in the fortunes told at local fairs, in the clairvoyant mirrors advertised in magazine classified columns, in the public lectures devoted to the speculative histories of alchemy and Rosicrucianism, in the dreamscrying techniques shared by word of mouth, and, perhaps most of all, in the pages of popular novels which, as the century progressed, became increasingly suffused with occult plots and tropes. The designation ‘occult science’ was liberally applied in this period to a dizzying gamut of old and new magical practices, including divination, geomancy, clairvoyance, palmistry, alchemy, tarot reading, ceremonial magic, astral projection, kabbalah, necromancy, angel invocation, demonology, astrology, and many others (Hanegraaff 234). These eclectic forms of what Wouter Hanegraaff terms ‘rejected knowledge’ offered to reveal to their users a mysterious, hidden world that lay beyond normal sensory perception, one that no microscope could ever penetrate and in which the supernatural intermediaries and forces increasingly ousted by scientific naturalism were still very much alive and open to supplication. Yet it would be inaccurate to regard these speculative entities and their occult <b>invokers</b> as simply the antithetical and much-maligned others to the secular science of the era. Not content with their de facto banishment from the realm of scientific rationalism, many nineteenth-century occult practitioners, as this chapter will demonstrate, worked relentlessly to insist on the affinities, complicities, and uncanny parallels between their own esoteric knowledge base and the emerging worldview of secular scientific naturalism...|$|R

60|$|For let {{the truth}} be spoken. The action of Germany, however cruel, sanguinary, and faithless, {{was nothing in}} the nature of a stab in the dark. The Germanic Tribes had told the whole world in all {{possible}} tones carrying conviction, the gently persuasive, the coldly logical; in tones Hegelian, Nietzschean, warlike, pious, cynical, inspired, {{what they were going to}} do to the inferior races of the earth, so full of sin and all unworthiness. But with a strange similarity to the prophets of old (who were also great moralists and <b>invokers</b> of might) they seemed to be crying in a desert. Whatever might have been the secret searching of hearts, the Worthless Ones would not take heed. It must also be admitted that the conduct of the menaced Governments carried with it no suggestion of resistance. It was no doubt, the effect of neither courage nor fear, but of that prudence which causes the average man to stand very still in the presence of a savage dog. It was not a very politic attitude, and the more reprehensible in so far that it seemed to arise from the mistrust of their own people's fortitude. On simple matters of life and death a people is always better than its leaders, because a people cannot argue itself as a whole into a sophisticated state of mind out of deference for a mere doctrine or from an exaggerated sense of its own cleverness. I am speaking now of democracies whose chiefs resemble the tyrant of Syracuse in this, that their power is unlimited (for who can limit the will of a voting people?) and who always see the domestic sword hanging by a hair above their heads.|$|R
