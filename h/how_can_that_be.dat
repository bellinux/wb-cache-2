2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he. It came into my head that he was not. – Why then said Obtuse Angle you said that he was. Did I say so Law I did not think I said that – Did not he said Obtuse Angle Yes said Scopprell. But I meant said Aradobo I I I can't think Law Sir I wish you'd tell me, how it is." [...] Northrop Frye refers to this incident as [...] "farcical conversational deadlock." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You talk {{as though}} {{everything}} were possible between us. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> I have no joy in my husband, nor he in me--but I am married. We {{are not in}} America." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>how</b> <b>can</b> it <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Bill-Man speaks our tongue?" [...] {{demanded a}} little weazened old hunter,--"Bill-Man, upon whom never {{before our eyes}} have rested?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ELLIE. I don't {{understand}} <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be.</b> Are {{you trying}} to make me feel that I need not be grateful to you, so that I may choose freely? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Villain!" [...] exclaimed the Dey, [...] "didst thou not {{say that}} the story should be a true one? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> when thou speakest of gifts which do not and never did exist?" ...|$|E

6000|$|We, {{in these}} days, are {{accustomed}} to draw a sharp line between {{the good and the}} bad, the converted and the unconverted, the children of God and the children of this world, those who have God's Spirit and those who have not, which we find nowhere in Scripture; and therefore when we read of such a man as Balaam we cannot understand him. He is a bad man, but yet he is a prophet. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> He knows the true God. More, he has the Spirit of God in him, and thereby utters deep and wonderful prophecies; and yet he is a bad man and a rogue. <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> ...|$|E

50|$|Henshall's writings, {{especially}} his Book of the Black Bass (1881), were the best, most comprehensive and scientifically authoritative works on bass {{for more than}} sixty years (and <b>how</b> often <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be</b> said of a popular fishing book?), and he championed a good cause, alerting thousands of fly fishers to the sporting possibilities of the basses just as those fish were finding homes in new waters {{in many parts of}} the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "The murderer discovered! Good God! <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> {{who could}} attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one {{might as well}} try to {{overtake}} the winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he was free last night!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why," [...] I said, [...] "but <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be?</b> You are an old man, and {{the time}} you talk of must reach back three men's lives.

He halted at a little runlet among the fields, and {{considered}} the hoof-pitted bank.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. But, again, {{this word}} PURE {{is set in}} {{opposition}} to that which is hurtful and destructive: 'I am pure from the blood of all men,' that is, I have hurt nobody (Acts 20:26). 'The wisdom that is from above is first pure,' it is not hurtful (James 3:17). Do you count them pure with the wicked balances? <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> since they are hurtful?

60|$|Passing {{the love}} of woman? <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> we of these days shall say. What love can pass that, saving the {{boundless}} love of him who stooped from heaven to earth, that he might die on the Cross for us? No. David, when he sang those words, knew not the depth of woman's love. And we shall have a right so to speak. The indefeasible and Divine right which is bestowed by fact.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done, papa," [...] said Eleonora. [...] "We have never exactly made an engagement; {{we do not want}} to marry at once, and we could not help loving each other if we tried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't see <b>how</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{when the}} Awkward Man never saw or heard of Miss Reade until {{she came to}} Carlisle in the spring," [...] said Felicity incredulously, [...] "and he's had that locked room for years." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{some one}} will say, <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>that</b> <b>be,</b> {{when so many}} of the old Hebrews seem to have known nothing about the next life? Moses, for instance, always {{promises}} the Children of Israel that if they do right, and obey God, they shall be rewarded in this life, with peace and prosperity, fruitfulness and wealth; but of their being rewarded in the next life he never says one word--which last statement is undeniably true.|$|E
