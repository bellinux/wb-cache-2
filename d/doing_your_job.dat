2500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Morrison {{performed}} a series of concerts at the Dominion Theatre, London, opened by Herbie Armstrong with an acoustic set. Paul Charles, who managed Morrison's business affairs at the time, commented that [...] "The idea [...] was [...] 'come into town, do one show, get all the press down, get the radio and TV and record-company people' [...] My logic was, 'Look, with Van it's not just a rock & roll tour. It's not just here's the hits, here's the new record, please buy it, whatever.' It was a performance. ... A certain number of people would come back every night, [...] Van will not have a set-list that he adheres to religiously ... So I thought, 'Here's a way. Van is not having any singles. Van doesn't do TV. How can we get attention to him doing what he does?' Well, the best thing that he does is perform live. I think we did four [...] the first time. We ended up doing eleven [...] We got a lot of coverage, {{we got a lot of}} attention, without him having to do something he didn't like." [...] Morrison's love of live performing was reignited by this set of concerts and he commented at the time that it was [...] "more like appearing in a play, going to the theatre and <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> every day - which I prefer to touring because that's very fragmented and disorientating." [...] According to Johnny Rogan, these performances [...] "are still regarded by many as his most memorable since the glory days of the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. A concert on 3 to 4 April 1982 at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany, was broadcast in many European countries as a TV/radio simulcast in the Rockpalast TV series by German TV station WDR. Seven of the songs that were performed were from Beautiful Vision.|$|E

50|$|A {{grand jury}} convened on January 30, 2004 to {{investigate}} the shooting; {{this was also the}} day of Stansbury's emotional funeral. Meanwhile, the controversy over NYPD Commissioner Kelly's initial statements on the shooting grew, with Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (the NYPD's union) stating: Commissioner Kelly gave a message to the 23,000 New York City police officers that said basically this: Take all the risks of <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job,</b> go up on all those roofs, patrol all those subway platforms, walk the streets day and night, take the risks to yourself, take the risks to your family, but then when the worst happens, when there's a tragedy, that you will not have the backing of the New York police commissioner.|$|E
5000|$|After {{finishing}} {{fourth in}} the 2008-09 Ford Ranger One Day Cup season, Bailey wanted improvement from his team. [...] "I keep {{going back to the}} people who have played quite a number of Shield games, it's time that they stepped up and were counted," [...] he said. [...] "People have said these guys have potential, but at some point the group has got to deliver. I'm included, along with Travis Birt, Rhett Lockyear, Luke Butterworth, Brendan Drew, Brett Geeves, Jason Krejza, Xavier Doherty. It's time that we started performing week-in, week out." [...] If the team was consistent, he believed they will contend in all three competitions. Coach Tim Coyle said, [...] "The challenge is to make the transition period as short as possible knowing, yes, we have got some new personnel, but to settle these people in really quickly and if we are developing a different game style and plan that we make sure we get that into our game very quickly. Hopefully the transition might only be a couple of months. We can't afford a transition period to take two years you won't be <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} there was wide {{controversy}} in the tabloids about {{a large number of}} Facebook pages being set up calling Moat a [...] "legend" [...] and [...] "hero", many of which were taken down, and legal threats were made over them. This issue along with Mark McGowan's stage play The Re-enactment of the Assassination of Raoul Moat were discussed on British national talk show The Wright Stuff under the topic [...] "waste of cash?"; the host claimed that he [...] "hates the Facebook culture promoting Moat as a hero" [...] and McGowan was described as the most [...] "self-promoting, publicity-seeking sicko out there." [...] McGowan later apologised in The Londonist for any distress that may have caused by The Re-enactment of the Assassination of Raoul Moat, but still defended it to the BBC, saying [...] "Moat was a bad man, he killed people. That's inappropriate, more than inappropriate, you can't go round expressing anger in that way, it's just wrong. There's no way in the world that I'd want to hurt anyone, but being an artist, that's always difficult. Being a witness to your times is very challenging, it's difficult not to affect people if you are <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job.</b> One of the things that people have a problem with is art as a form of representation of a contemporary issue. The role of art is to challenge." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kenny said {{he would}} work on a quick {{formation}} of a new government, calling the verdict a [...] "democratic revolution." [...] He also said his top priority will be renegotiating the bailout. Despite his attempts to renegotiate the bailout, which was a condition in coalition talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel response was read as a blow to these attempts when she said [...] "We can't {{get to a point where}} Ireland pays lower interest rates than Portugal. and Greece had tapped an aid programme agreed to conditions that they must fulfil. If the Irish government now has a problem with interest rates, our job is to figure out what we can do - or whether we can do anything." [...] Pressure continued to mount on Kenny's attempt to reconfigure the loan terms of the bailout as Merkel was scheduled to attend a European People's Party leaders' meet that Kenny, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and European Union President Herman Van Rompuy (of Belgium's CD&V) were also attending. Host Finnish Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen, facing an election of his own, also opposed lowering Ireland’s average loan rate of 5.8%. In response to talking about indebted states cannot expect concessions having agreed to additional measures to boost competitiveness and stabilise their finances, he said: [...] "You can't be rewarded by others for <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> well. The concession is that those countries' credibility in the markets will improve." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is likely}} during our first {{jobs in the}} justice system when we realize the {{adjective}} “important” is a somewhat relative term {{as it relates to}} the issues that we face. Far from what we learned in college or law school—and further still from the topics typically reported in the media—often the most important issues we face will be found in the most common of cases. There is a saying in city government that the public’s idea of how well you are <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>job</b> is only as good as how well you administer the water bills. That is because every household gets one, and, for many citizens, it represents the only contact that they may ever have with their local government. The same is true in criminal justice. Most people will never face a felony trial, but a relatively large number of them will be summonsed into court on lesser charges such as misdemeanor and traffic offenses. For any particular defendant, a court appearance required by summons may be his or her singular personal experience with the justice system; how we guide that defendant through the system is perhaps one of the most important issues we may ever face and says a lot about how we administer justice. Doing this well promotes judicial-branch legitimacy by increasing the defendant’s overall sense of procedural fairness, lessens system costs associated with any particular case, and avoids the compounding array of negative consequences associated with a single yet preventable incident such as the defendant’s failure to appear for court...|$|E
