25|$|Within the United States, social {{location}} {{affects the}} way women perceive menopause and its related biological <b>effects.</b> <b>Research</b> indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status. The paradigm within which a woman considers menopause influences the way she views it: Women who understand menopause as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who {{view it as a}} life transition or a symbol of aging.|$|E
30|$|Finally {{mentioned}} here is media <b>effect</b> <b>research,</b> which analyses short-term impacts of certain media content {{on the social}} world [59]. In opposition to media ecology and mediatization approaches, media <b>effect</b> <b>research</b> concentrates on media contents instead of media technologies. Accordingly, media <b>effect</b> <b>research</b> sees media contents {{as a source of}} societal change.|$|R

25|$|Urine {{samples taken}} from 10 {{children}} {{in the capital of}} Fukushima Prefecture were analyzed in a French laboratory. All of them contained caesium-134. The sample of an eight-year-old girl contained 1.13 becquerels/liter. The children were living up to 60kilometers away from the troubled nuclear power plant. The Fukushima Network for Saving Children urged the Japanese government to check the children in Fukushima. The Japanese non-profit Radiation <b>Effects</b> <b>Research</b> Foundation said that people should not overreact, because there are no reports known of health problems with these levels of radiation.|$|E
25|$|In its Corps of Engineers Civil Works mission, CRREL {{researchers}} developed {{innovative ways}} to avoid ice jams and databases to address the widespread occurrence of such problems. A substantial ice engineering facility was built to support modeling of these problems. A remote-sensing and GIS (geographic information system) facility and organization were established to better employ the resources of satellite imagery and mapping of information to address problems worldwide. Another major facility, the Frost <b>Effects</b> <b>Research</b> Facility, was built to study problems associated with airfields and roadways, subject to freeze-thaw. An automated loading machine was acquired to simulate the passage of vehicle and aircraft tires on pavements. In building technology, researchers helped develop statistical means to identify snow and icing loads throughout the United States and standards for measuring heat loss, roof moisture detection, and frost-protected shallow foundations.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was {{planning}} on stopping funding for the ABCC's work in Japan. However, James V. Neel made an appeal and the AEC decided to fund them $20,000 a year, for three years, to continue research. In 1956, Neel and William J. Schull published their final draft of The Effect of Exposure to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This monograph gave {{a detailed description of}} all the data they had collected Despite their efforts, trust in the ABCC was declining, so the ABCC became the Radiation <b>Effects</b> <b>Research</b> Foundation (RERF), and with the new name and administrative organization, funding for the research on survivors was to be provided equally by the United States and Japan. The RERF was established on 1 April 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Johns Hopkins University human {{geneticist}} James F. Crow examined Neel's {{research and}} {{confirmed that the}} number of birth defects was not significantly higher in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many members of the ABCC and its successor Radiation <b>Effects</b> <b>Research</b> Foundation (RERF) were still looking for possible birth defects or other causes among the survivors decades later, but found no evidence that they were more common among the survivors. Despite the insignificance of birth defects found in Neel's study and the detailed medical literature, up to 1987, historians such as Ronald E. Powaski frequently wrote that Hiroshima experienced [...] "an increase in stillbirths, birth defects, and infant mortality" [...] following the atomic bomb.|$|E

2500|$|Support {{for video}} game {{regulation}} {{has been linked}} to moral panic. Even so, governments have enacted, or have tried to enact, legislation that regulates distribution of video games through censorship based on content rating systems or banning. In 2005, David Gauntlett claimed that grant funding, news headlines, and professional prestige more commonly go to authors who, in good faith, promote anti-media beliefs. [...] Tom Grimes, James A. Anderson, and Lori Bergen reiterated these claims in a 2008 book examining sociological effects on the production of media <b>effects</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Radiation <b>Effects</b> <b>Research</b> Foundation {{puts the}} number of deaths (within two to four months), in Hiroshima at 90,000 to 166,000 persons, and in Nagasaki at 60,000 to 80,000 persons. They noted that deaths caused by the atomic bombings include those that {{occurred}} on the days of the bombings due to the overwhelming force and heat of the blasts, as well as later deaths attributable to radiation exposure. The total number of deaths is not known precisely because military personnel records in each city were destroyed; entire families perished, leaving no one to report deaths; and unknown numbers of forced laborers were present in both cities ...|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish Protection Agency's (SEPA) {{comprehensive}} health <b>effects</b> <b>research</b> concluded [...] "inconclusively" [...] on health effects in October 2009. The authors stress, {{that even though}} no conclusive evidence of non-occupational health effects from incinerators {{were found in the}} existing literature, [...] "small but important effects might be virtually impossible to detect". The report highlights epidemiological deficiencies in previous UK health studies and suggests areas for future studies. The U.K. Health Protection Agency produced a lesser summary in September 2009. Many toxiocologists criticise and dispute this report as not being comprehensive epidemiologically, thin on peer review and the effects of fine particle effects on health.|$|E

50|$|Whether a {{skill is}} learned {{explicitly}} (with attention) or implicitly, each {{plays a role}} in the offline consolidation <b>effect.</b> <b>Research</b> suggests that explicit awareness and understanding of the skill being learned during the acquisition process greatly improves the consolidation of procedural memories during sleep. This finding is not surprising, as it is widely accepted that intention and awareness at time of learning enhances the acquisition of most forms of memory.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{substantial}} {{research on}} pediatric pain assessment and management, {{health care professionals}} do not adequately incorporate this knowledge into clinical practice. Organizational context (work environment) is {{a significant factor in}} influencing outcomes; however, the nature of the mechanisms are relatively unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess how organizational context moderates the <b>effect</b> of <b>research</b> use and pain outcomes in hospitalized children. Methods A cross-sectional survey was undertaken with 779 nurses in 32 patient care units in 8 Canadian pediatric hospitals, following implementation of a multifaceted knowledge translation intervention, Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ). The influence of organizational context was assessed in relation to pain process (assessment and management) and clinical (pain intensity) outcomes. Organizational context was measured using the Alberta Context Tool that includes: leadership, culture, evaluation, social capital, informal interactions, formal interactions, structural and electronic resources, and organizational slack (staff, space, and time). Marginal modeling estimated the <b>effects</b> of instrumental <b>research</b> use (direct use of research knowledge) and conceptual research use (indirect use of research knowledge) on pain outcomes while examining the effects of context. Results Six of the 10 organizational context factors (culture, social capital, informal interactions, resources, and organizational slack [space and time]) significantly moderated the <b>effect</b> of instrumental <b>research</b> use on pain assessment; four factors (culture, social capital, resources and organizational slack time) moderated the <b>effect</b> of conceptual <b>research</b> use and pain assessment. Only two factors (evaluation and formal interactions) moderated the <b>effect</b> of instrumental <b>research</b> use on pain management. All organizational factors except slack space significantly moderated the <b>effect</b> of instrumental <b>research</b> use on pain intensity; informal interactions and organizational slack space moderated the <b>effect</b> of conceptual <b>research</b> use and pain intensity. Conclusions Many aspects of organizational context consistently moderated the <b>effects</b> of instrumental <b>research</b> use on pain assessment and pain intensity, while only a few influenced conceptual use of research on pain outcomes. Organizational context factors did not generally influence the <b>effect</b> of <b>research</b> use on pain management. Further research is [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Much of the {{laboratory}} research concerning peripatry is inextricably linked to founder <b>effect</b> <b>research.</b> Coyne and Orr conclude that selection's role in speciation is well established, whereas genetic drift's role is unsupported by experimental and field data—suggesting that founder-effect speciation does not occur. Nevertheless, {{a great deal of}} research has been conducted on the matter, and one study conducted involving bottleneck populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura found evidence of isolation after a single bottleneck.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} paper {{we want to}} found what is the {{relation}} between some morphological features and level of sexual products in a rainbow trout population of 3 and 4 years age. Also, we investigated the influence of extruded pellet fodder on quantitative roes and milt development in the two age categories. The <b>effected</b> <b>researches</b> put into evidence the superior development of females comparatively with males, indifferently on age, with significant and ensured differences. Following the roe quantity and number obtained from females of 3 and 4 years age, we observed that after use of extruded fodder are obtained both quantitative and also numerically superior performances comparatively to those ones obtained after feeding with classical pellet fodder and increase during age, the differences being significant and ensured. There were calculated also the correlations between morphological features taken in study and respective some reproduction indices and were established the directions in which exist real selection and improvement chances. After <b>effected</b> <b>researches</b> and obtained results come {{out a series of}} conclusions, following that their basis to be taken selection and improvement measures in view to increase breeding and multiplication performances...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 293 {{findings}} from 42 {{studies on the}} impact of publicized suicide stories in the media on the incidence of suicide in the real world were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Studies measuring the effect of either an entertainment or political celebrity suicide story were 14. 3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4. 03 times more likely to uncover a copycat <b>effect.</b> <b>Research</b> based on televised stories was 82 % less likely to report a copycat <b>effect</b> than <b>research</b> based on newspapers. A review of recent events in Austria and Switzerland indicates that suicide prevention organizations can successfully convince the media to change the frequency and content of their suicide coverage in an effort to reduce copycat effects...|$|R
