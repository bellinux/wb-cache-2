50|$|This is {{the first}} Gals Panic game to support the JAMMA connector. The <b>DIP-switch</b> arcade {{configuration}} was largely replaced by a more flexible, RAM-based software integrated to the service menu.|$|E
50|$|Spyder Flash: A Spyder marker {{equipped}} with an electronic trigger frame which uses an electro-magnet to trip the sear and release the striker to fire the marker. The Flash was capable of shooting {{in a variety of}} firing modes via a <b>dip-switch</b> set firing modes. Electronics were powered by a single 9.6-volt NiMH rechargeable battery. The charger plugs into a charger port located {{at the back of the}} trigger handle. It also used an innovative insert barrel and rear cocking with an oft-maligned aluminum bolt guard.|$|E
50|$|Garage {{and gate}} remote control are very common, {{especially}} {{in some countries}} such as the US, Australia, and the UK, where garage doors, gates and barriers are widely used. Such a remote is very simple by design, usually only one button, and some with more buttons to control several gates from one control. Such remotes {{can be divided into}} two categories by the encoder type used: fixed code and rolling code. If you find <b>dip-switches</b> in the remote, {{it is likely to be}} fixed code, an older technology which was widely used. However, fixed code has been criticized for its (lack of) security, thus rolling code has been more and more widely used in later installations.|$|R
30|$|We {{realized}} {{the connection between}} the test device and the host system, a common PC, via the Samsung Anyway Jig [35]. The jig serves as a universal maintenance tool for various devices produced by Samsung. It is equipped with a D-Sub DB- 25 connector and can be connected to the supported device via a proper adapter cable. To connect the jig to the test device, we used a custom Micro-USB to D-Sub DB- 25 cable. We established the connection to the host PC via the RS- 232 interface. The Samsung Anyway Jig Adapter connects the GND and ID-line of the Micro-USB of the device port with a resistor. This configures the micro-USB port such that it acts as a serial interface port. We configured the dimension of the resistor with the <b>DIP-switches</b> of the Samsung Anyway Jig. After connecting to the UART port, the whole boot process of a device can be monitored because the bootloader writes debug information to the serial interface. Depending on the kernel command line parameters, the kernel can also output its debug information over the serial interface.|$|R
40|$|The company, ScandiNova Systems, {{has had a}} {{need for}} a test system that can {{automate}} and optimize fault detection of the digitizer circuit in the control system of their klystron modulators. This thesis work is intended for this need with the aim of constructing a test system built in LabVIEW, and a pulse generator to generate stimulation for the digitizer circuit board. The test system has been tested and the results have shown that it works well for the given circumstances. The analysis of how the digitizer circuit reads an analog signal works almost perfectly, given an 5 %-tolerance interval from the reference value of how the pulse should be. However, not all of the digital outputs of the digitizer can be checked for faults with the current configuration of the circuit board. If the FPGA-code on the digitizer circuit is revised with the pulses of the pulse generator the Boolean error outputs of the FPGA can be correctly checked. Â  If a test system is to be created for other circuits in the control system based on the work done in this thesis project, the parts specified for the present circuit shall be removed from the LabVIEW-program. For example, almost all parts of the GUI that are specified for the digitizer circuit, the stepping of the <b>DIP-switches</b> etc,, shall be removed. Stimuli for the circuits shall also be created according to their specifications...|$|R
