5|$|The <b>gull-billed</b> <b>tern</b> is an opportunist predator, {{taking a}} wide variety of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.|$|E

40|$|Wintering <b>Gull-billed</b> <b>Terns</b> Gelochelidon nilotica in Guinea Bissau mainly fed on Fiddler Crabs Uca tangeri {{and were}} {{occasionally}} seen feeding on fish and locusts. Fiddler crabs {{have a low}} energy content, requiring a large gross intake to meet daily energy demands. Fiddler crabs also have a low ratio of digestible flesh to exoskeleton, and therefore tern food intake may be limited by gut capacity. Thus feeding on Fiddler Crabs may pose a problem to the terns. Activity budgets of <b>Gull-billed</b> <b>Terns</b> feeding on Fiddler Crabs show that a considerable {{part of the time}} is allocated to quiescence. The duration of resting intervals increased with energy intake and was positively correlated with the metabolisable energy content of the crab eaten, suggesting that resting periods are required for a proper digestion. However, the poor quality of Fiddler Crabs was offset by high capture rates. So daily energy expenditure of the terns could easily be met and feeding on Fiddler Crabs did not pose a problem to reach this goal. Even when resting pauses are included in foraging time, foraging for about 1. 5 hours on Fiddler Crabs satisfies the terns’ daily energetic requirements, whereas feeding on energy rich fish would require about 2. 5 hours to satisfy daily energetic requirements. Compared to the more specialised piscivorous Little Tern Sterna albifrons and Sandwich Tern S. sandvicensis, capture rate of fish was poor in <b>Gull-billed</b> <b>Terns.</b> From an energetic point of view, wintering <b>Gull-billed</b> <b>Terns</b> feeding on Fiddler Crabs seem to have an easy living in Guinea Bissau. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{breeding}} bioloev of Kentish Plovers (Cliaradrius alexandrinus) in Fuente de Piedra lake (southern Spain) in 1991 and 1992. Breeders showed sexual dimorphism in tarsal length and body mass; body mass decreased throughout the breeding season only in males. Laying dates spanned 88 days in 1991 and 110 in 1992. Eggs {{deposited in the}} late nesting season were larger {{than those in the}} begining of the season. Females incubated during daytime and males during the night. Apparent clutches of 1 - 2 eggs occurred mostly late in the nesting season and reflect a high incidence of partial prédation (recorded in 17 % of 288 2 - 3 egg clutches). Nest prédation increased {{in the course of the}} breeding season, and only 19 % of all clutches produced chicks. Variables measured for each nest site (nest cover, distances to water and to nearest neighbour) did not influence nest prédation. Kentish Plover pairs that lost clutches usually renested together, on average 11 - 24 days after loss of their previous clutch. The body masses of females were similar between first and subsequent replacement nestings. Biparental care of chicks lasted longer than in several other populations of Kentish Plovers. When the chicks were 15 - 20 days old one of the adults, usually the female, deserted the brood. <b>Gull-billed</b> <b>Terns</b> (Gelochelidon nilotica) preyed on chicks up to 16 days of age. Both sexes showed antipredator behaviours (alarm calls, mobbing). Possibly, the greater maternal protection of the brood at Fuente de Piedra compared to other breeding locations results from an interrelationship between high prédation pressure and type of predators, since mobbing of <b>Gull-billed</b> <b>Terns</b> by adult plovers was effective in deterring the terns. After deserting broods, some females mated to new males (sequential polyandry). Sequential polygyny was recorded in males that fledged chicks early enough for a subsequent nesting attempt. We propose that the duration of the breeding season and high clutch failure rates constrained the frequency of sequential polygamy in our population. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The Colorado River Delta {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{impacted}} wetland systems in the world and has experienced massive habitat loss owing to severe restrictions in freshwater inflow as a result of dam construction and diversion of water for irrigation. However, the delta still offers nesting and foraging habitats for waterbirds, although the habitats available are highly fragmented and limited. Stable isotope ratio (SIR) analysis was used to assess quantitatively isotopic niche width of <b>gull-billed</b> <b>terns</b> (Gelochelidon nilotica), laughing gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla) and snowy egrets (Egreta thula) that nest at an inland and coastal location. The variance in carbon and nitrogen SIR of egg albumen indicated that inland colonies have a much broader isotope niche width (range 2. 9 to 23. 9) than coastal colonies (< 0. 1 to 1. 4). Species-specific mean albumen δ 13 C values from inland nests were significantly more depleted in 13 C than coastal colonies (- 19. 5 to - 23. 1 ‰ and - 10. 4 to - 14. 9 ‰, respectively). Comparison of albumen δ 13 C values corrected for trophic fractionation with those of potential prey and primary producers collected at 10 potential foraging grounds indicates that females of the three species that nest in inland colonies did not feed in habitats located in the vicinity of their nesting site, while coastal colonies had distinct isotopic signatures reflecting marine primary production. Inland colonies probably forage in a variety of habitats and for different prey, relying on food webs based mostly on C 3 terrestrial plants. Differences in the isotopic composition of eggs from species nesting in the same area and between conspecifics nesting in different habitats indicate that foraging habitats vary substantially, suggesting that feeding varies as a function of local resource availability. These results suggest that a variety of habitat types fulfill the foraging needs of this suite of nesting waterbird species, especially in inland colonies. Since the specific feeding areas of nesting females from the inland colonies have not been identified, protection of the remaining wetlands within the Colorado River Delta is warranted. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
