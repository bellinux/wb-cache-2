6000|$|... "I have others," [...] he retorted, [...] "but never mind. I {{understood}} you to say, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{heard nothing}} by wireless about me?" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} your {{stricture}} about my not writing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no cause of complaint. My time is all {{taken up with}} public duties.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too modest," [...] Madame de Melbain said slowly. [...] "Louise {{has told}} me a good deal. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been a very {{faithful}} friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Lady Marrabel," [...] Saton said slowly, [...] "that you {{can tell}} me, if <b>you</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will tell me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baroness," [...] he said, [...] "my {{advice to}} you, {{for your own}} good entirely, is, with all respect to your husband, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shorten your honeymoon and pay your respects to the Emperor. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe it to him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> owe it to your country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must," [...] she said. [...] "Don't think me prejudiced, Lawrence. I {{must stand}} by my party. Theoretically, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are the only}} logical {{politician}} I have ever known. Actually, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are steering your course towards the sandbanks. You will fail, but you will fail magnificently. Well, that is something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ted, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a great talent, and {{it ought}} to be cultivated. You should have {{competent}} instruction. Come, you must tell me all about yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mitchy, [...] "fancy the 'lady' in her millions. Have {{you come}} up to London, wondering, as you must, about what's happening--for Vanderbank mentioned, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>HAVE</b> come up--in pursuit of her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not that," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{scarcely}} done a wise {{thing in}} leaving your husband. I cannot {{think that this}} life on the stage is good for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{absolutely}} {{deny any}} such knowledge. And more than <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are greatly mistaken as to her character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was nobody's doing. But I am very sorry <b>that</b> it occurred. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should have {{controlled}} yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Já vím, kdo to je. - I {{know who}} he is. Myslím, že se mýlíš. - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> (<b>that)</b> <b>you</b> are wrong. (subordinate relation) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right, my love! Of course <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done right: only I {{give you}} no credit, dearest; {{none in the}} least; for how could you help loving one so lovable in every way as dear Herbert?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you were," [...] he answered, [...] "so {{much the}} better, {{but you are}} not. Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been rather unkind to me. I have {{scarcely}} seen you alone since you have been here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish to do}} you justice," [...] Andrew {{answered}} coldly, [...] "and I {{am willing}} {{to believe that you}} have faith yourself in the extraordinary story you have just told us. But frankly <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been too credulous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An iron will is an {{integral}} part of such a temperament. How else could he be a leader? And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are mistaken in--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Felicia," [...] I said, [...] "I do {{not trust}} your uncle. I {{do not believe in}} his great mission. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} are deceived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have a maid {{who has a}} sweetheart? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{remarked to}} your uncle last night {{that she had been}} out to see him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not in}} {{the habit}} of revenging myself, Mr. Meeson," [...] {{answered}} Augusta, with dignity; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done a very wicked thing to disinherit your nephew in that fashion, and I don't wonder that you feel uncomfortable about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, and it's a lucky shot too," [...] said Fred, [...] "for our {{provisions}} are running low. But perchance we shan't want much more food {{before reaching the}} Indian camp. You said, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a good guess where the camp lies, Mister--what shall we call you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do not!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "To me {{you have}} spoken like a sophist. One does not gain {{happiness}} by seeking it. You may be honest in {{some part of}} what you say--I cannot tell. Only <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> mistaken Sir Julien's ideas--and mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Jethro," [...] said Cynthia, [...] "sometimes I {{forget that}} you're a great, wise man, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are just a}} silly old goose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. For instance, if {{you were}} to become {{absolutely}} discredited, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would be effectually out of my way. Your people do not forgive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{might get}} {{your heart out}} of that grave," [...] said he, with playful sadness. [...] "It has been there a long time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is an advantage," [...] Captain Nelson laughed. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> raised {{your hand}} against that venerable but {{somewhat}} truculent prelate, I shudder at your boldness. I only {{caught a glimpse}} of him as he passed, but I could see that he looks rather scared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have not}} pretended to {{misunderstand}} you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> spoken wisely. Your stepdaughter must solve for herself the great riddle. It {{is not for}} {{any one of us}} to handicap her in her choice while she is yet a child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have changed}} a great deal, Edgar," [...] Mrs. Clinton said. [...] "Of course {{we have seen}} Rupert {{comparatively}} lately; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> changed more than he has from what you both were three years ago. You look older than he does, and your figure is more set." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Bes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and <b>I</b> had best {{go hunting}} {{far away in}} those lands you know, where even the Great King cannot follow us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{nevertheless}} true and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do believe it. What have I done <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should {{all of a}} sudden build a fence around yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{you never}} ought {{to act in}} {{opposition}} to it. <b>That</b> is what <b>you</b> really mean, Captain Aylmer; and upon my word <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had an uncle, Alan Blair, {{who died}} {{forty years ago}} in California," [...] I said quietly. [...] "Recently I have had {{occasion}} to examine some of his papers. I found a journal among them and I have brought it to you because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the best right to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will pardon me, sir," [...] {{he said in}} a subdued tone, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} to look at your engagement book. There is Lady Arlingford's reception to-night, ten till twelve, and the Hatton House ball, marked with a cross, sir, important. I put your clothes out an hour ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever I am {{you made}} me, {{and you are}} a devil, George Caresfoot, or you could not take {{pleasure}} in the tortures you inflicted before you destroyed. But, don't go too far, or you may regret it. Am I a woman to be played with? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> trained me too well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were {{standing}} in the guardroom doorway when Captain Tremayne passed you at twenty minutes to twelve {{on the night of the}} 28th?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{grandfather}} was a fine man, Mr. Durrett," [...] she informed Hambleton. [...] "It is a pity for <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{do not have to}} work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{ought to}} be {{concerned}} about Stuyvesant," [...] said Phonny, [...] "for he is as sage and demure as any man I ever saw." ...|$|R
