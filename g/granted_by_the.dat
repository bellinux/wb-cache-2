5|$|According to Tibetologist John Powers, Tibetan sources counter this {{narrative}} of titles <b>granted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Chinese to Tibetans with various titles which the Tibetans {{gave to the}} Chinese emperors and their officials. Tribute missions from Tibetan monasteries to the Chinese court brought back not only titles, but large, commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold. The Ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas, but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves, and no Tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the Ming.|$|E
5|$|After the 1910 season, Stricklett {{he retired}} from baseball. However, he applied for {{reinstatement}} in 1912, which was <b>granted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> National Commission.

The Superbas sold his rights to the Binghamton Bingoes of the New York State League, and he pitched for the team. In minor league baseball, Stricklett won 20 games in a season at least five times, compiling a 169-99 record across nine seasons.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was <b>granted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> King to Matthew de Mortagne, {{who in turn}} granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert. It is thought that Sir John was a {{descendant}} of either Matthew or Hildebert. Perhaps because of {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E

5|$|Although the State Arms {{were granted}} in 1969, {{municipal}} heraldry {{had already been}} using the black swan symbolism since 1926, when the coat of arms of Perth were granted with a black swan as a charge {{in the first quarter}} and black swan supporters. This was followed by Northam (1953, black swan crest) and Bunbury (1959, black swan crest). Following the grant of the State Arms, municipal arms continued this tradition: Fremantle (1971, charge), Gosnells (1978, charge), Melville (1981, supporters) and Subiaco (1984, crest). All of the municipal arms <b>granted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Crown have included a representation of a black swan, presumably acknowledging the allegiance of each municipality to the state.|$|E
5|$|Basset {{witnessed}} a royal charter in 1135 but was dead by 1144, when his lands were <b>granted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Empress Matilda {{and her son}} Henry to Richard's son Geoffrey Ridel. His other sons were Ralph Basset, who held lands near Drayton, and William Basset, who held lands near Sapcote. William became a royal justice and sheriff like his father. Richard also had two daughters: Sibil, who married Robert de Cauz, and Matilda, who married John de Stuteville. Ralph inherited the ancestral lands in Normandy. The Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that Basset built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy purely to demonstrate his status and wealth.|$|E
