40|$|To explore whether leaf {{traits and}} trait {{relationships}} varied during progressive succession within the understory and canopy layers, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations (mass- and area-based), and photosynthetic capacity (A: mass- and area-based) of tropical woody vegetation were measured in 2 layers in 3 successional stages of tropical forests. For understory plants, 4 out of 7 leaf traits varied significantly along the successional stages. The {{slopes of the}} N-mass-SLA and P-mass-SLA relationships were steeper in <b>early</b> <b>than</b> in intermediate and old-growth forests. The slopes of the N-mass-A(mass), P-mass-A(mass), and SLA-A(mass) relationships did not differ among the 3 successional stages, but the y-intercepts were higher in <b>early</b> <b>than</b> in intermediate and old-growth forests. The slope of the N-mass-P-mass relationship changed little along the successional gradient, but the y-intercepts were higher in old-growth forest <b>than</b> in <b>early</b> and intermediate successional forests. For canopy trees, 3 out of 7 leaf traits changed significantly, but the slopes of 6 bivariate relationships remained invariant over the successional chronosequence. However, the y-intercepts of the N-mass-A(mass) and SLA-A(mass) relationships were higher in early and intermediate forests than in old growth forest, and the y-intercept of the N-mass-P-mass relationship was higher in <b>early</b> <b>than</b> in intermediate and old-growth forests. These results show that understory plants adjusted their SLA to adapt to environmental conditions more readily in intermediate and old-growth forests <b>than</b> in <b>early</b> successional forest. Resource allocation strategies did not differ within the canopy layers during the successional progress, and variations in photosynthetic nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency (PNUE/PPUE) and N:P ratios were unrelated to resource allocation strategies, but likely responded to environmental pressures.

40|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{predictors}} of {{the speed with which}} adults can name a pictured object is the age at which the object and its name are first learned. Age of acquisition also predicts the retention or loss of individual words following brain damage in conditions like aphasia and Alzheimer's disease. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used to reveal brain areas differentially involved in naming objects with early or late acquired names. A baseline task involved passive viewing of non-objects. The comparison between the silent object naming conditions (early and late) with baseline showed significant activation in frontal, parietal and mediotemporal regions bilaterally and in the lingual and fusiform gyri on the left. Direct comparison of early and late items identified clusters with significantly greater activation for early acquired items at the occipital poles (in the posterior parts of the middle occipital gyri) and at the left temporal pole. In contrast, the left middle occipital and fusiform gyri showed significantly greater activation for late <b>than</b> <b>early</b> acquired items. We propose that greater activation to <b>early</b> <b>than</b> late objects at the occipital poles and at the left temporal pole reflects the more detailed visual and semantic representations of <b>early</b> <b>than</b> late acquired items. We propose that greater activation to late <b>than</b> <b>early</b> objects in the left middle occipital and fusiform gyri occurs because those areas are involved in mapping visual onto semantic representations, which is more difficult, and demands more resource, for late <b>than</b> for <b>early</b> items. ...|$|R
