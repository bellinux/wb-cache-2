Utada does not consider the hiatus her retiring from music, as she enjoys the process of making music, and considers herself a musician. Furthermore, Utada still has a contract to fulfill with EMI Group, a contract signed in 2010 to release music globally under her name Hikaru Utada. Utada explained in an interview on Tokio Hot 100 that the hiatus was to ground her, as since she was 15 she had not <b>grown</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> had no concept of 'true personal growth'. During her hiatus, she intends to do overseas volunteer work, learn French and re-establish relationships with her relatives, such as with her father and manager Teruzane Utada, who she admitted not even meeting outside of work.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{retirement}} from competitive golf in 1930, {{and even in}} the years leading up to that, Jones had {{become one of the most}} famous sports figures in the world, and was recognized virtually everywhere he went in public. While certainly appreciative of the enormous adulation and media coverage, this massive attention caused Jones to lose personal privacy in golf circles, and he wished to create a private golf club where he and his friends could play golf in peace and quiet. For several years, he searched for a property near Atlanta where he could develop his own golf club. His friend Clifford Roberts, a New York City investment dealer, knew of Jones's desire, became aware of a promising property for sale in Augusta, Georgia, where Jones's mother-in-law had <b>grown</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> informed Jones about it. Jones first visited Fruitlands, an Augusta arboretum and indigo plantation since the Civil War era, in the spring of 1930, and he purchased it for $70,000 in 1931, with the plan to design a golf course on the site.|$|E
25|$|The vaquero, the Spanish or Mexican cowboy {{who worked}} with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 18th century and flourished in California and {{bordering}} territories during the Spanish Colonial period. Settlers from the United States did not enter California until after the Mexican-American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch {{where he was born}} or had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> raised his own family there. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas. The modern distinction between vaquero and buckaroo within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.|$|E

25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form {{a clear idea of}} his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed to choose an assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document it was not for the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E

Norm Breyfogle also {{took the opportunity to}} redesign Anarky's costume, excising the head extender with the explanation that the character had <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> filled out his costume. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective but flexible material that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion which had previously been impossible due to the inflexible metal that the first mask was made of.|$|E

Co-effects supervisor Marlon West elaborated, [...] "When Elsa finally lets go and really starts owning her cryokinetic abilities, we wanted the ice and snow that she make to get across the idea that Elsa has now <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> become this beautiful, elegant, confident and powerful young woman." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 5, 1931, {{he married}} Katherine Elizabeth [...] "Kay" [...] Hanson (1907–79), {{whom he had}} dated since high school, at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan.

Edwin O'Malley encouraged Walter to break off his engagement, and after Walter refused his parents did not attend the wedding. O'Malley was a smoker, who golfed occasionally, but more commonly gardened for recreation.
