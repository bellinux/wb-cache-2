5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction.

5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of Valletta were not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front, {{and it is now}} a town in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Except for the partly {{at-grade}} Bishan MRT Station (North South Line), {{the entirety}} of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network. Underground stations and the trains themselves are air-conditioned, while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E

There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5|$|Under Venetian rule, a small harbour {{was built}} in Rethymno, which became the third most {{important}} city on Crete after Heraklion and Chania. On 8 April 1540, a line of fortifications began to be built around the city. The walls were designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli, and were completed in around 1570. These fortifications were not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a large assault, and when Uluç Ali Reis attacked in 1571, the Ottomans captured and sacked the city.|$|E
5|$|With the {{development}} of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, they were not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Phreatic {{eruption}}s (or steam-blast eruptions) are {{a type of}} eruption {{driven by}} the expansion of steam. When cold ground or surface water {{come into contact with}} hot rock or magma it superheats and explodes, fracturing the surrounding rock and thrusting out a mixture of steam, water, ash, volcanic bombs, and volcanic blocks. The distinguishing feature of phreatic explosions is that they only blast out fragments of pre-existing solid rock from the volcanic conduit; no new magma is erupted. Because they are driven by the cracking of rock strata under pressure, phreatic activity does not always result in an eruption; if the rock face is strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the explosive force, outright eruptions may not occur, although cracks in the rock will probably develop and weaken it, furthering future eruptions.|$|E
5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to thicken with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> {{the forces}} {{generated by the}} leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
50|$|In the {{atmospheric}} pressure present at sea level, water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). At {{an altitude of}} 63,000 feet (18,900 m), it boils at only 37 °C (98.6 °F), the normal body temperature of humans. This altitude is known as Armstrong’s Line. In practice bodily fluids do not boil off at this altitude. This is because the skin and outer organs have <b>enough</b> strength <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> this pressure, thus pressure inside the body would be significantly higher—however, bubbles starting to form is still an issue.|$|R
50|$|Gravity style {{diversion}} dams {{are built}} to non counteract {{the force of}} the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with <b>enough</b> weight <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the force. Gravity dams are commonly constructed using masonry or cement. The foundations of the gravity dams are generally constructed on top of a solid bedrock foundation. However, gravity dams can be built over unconsolidated ground as long as proper measures are put in place to stop the flow of water under the dam. If water were to get under the dam, the dam could fail.|$|R
25|$|Experts using {{computer}} modeling at Louisiana State University after Hurricane Katrina {{have concluded}} that the levees were never topped but rather faulty design, inadequate construction, or some combination of the two were responsible for the flooding of most of New Orleans: some canal walls leaked underneath, because the wall foundations were not deep <b>enough</b> in peat-subsoil <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the pressure of higher water.|$|R
5|$|Horses {{from the}} Ardennes region {{were used in}} the Crusades in the 11th century by knights led by Godfrey of Bouillon. They were used during the 17th century by Marshal Turenne as remounts for his cavalry. In the French Revolution, they were {{considered}} to be the best artillery horse available, due to their temperament, stamina and strength. Napoleon used large numbers of Ardennes horses to pull artillery and transport supplies during his 1812 Russian campaign. They were said to be the only breed used by Napoleon that was hardy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the winter retreat from Moscow, which they did while pulling a large amount of the army's wagon train. They were also used to pull artillery in World War I, when they were depended upon by the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse. The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the Brabant.|$|E
5|$|On land, {{pinnipeds}} are near-sighted in dim light. This {{is reduced}} in bright light, as the retracted pupil reduces the lens and cornea's ability to bend light. They {{also have a}} well-developed tapetum lucidum, a reflecting layer that increases sensitivity by reflecting light back through the rods. This helps them see in low-light conditions. Ice-living seals like the harp seal have corneas that can tolerate high levels of ultraviolet radiation typical of bright, snowy environments. As such, they do not suffer snow blindness. Pinnipeds appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones. Flexible eye movement has been documented in seals. The extraocular muscles of the walrus are well developed. This and its lack of orbital roof allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both frontal and dorsal directions. Seals release large amounts of mucus to protect their eyes. The corneal epithelium is keratinized and the sclera is thick <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the pressures of diving. As in many mammals and birds, pinnipeds possess nictitating membranes.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that their}} forces had failed, Paskevich and Pahlen decided {{to throw in}} even more forces into the fight. Elements of the 9th 'Ingermanland' Infantry Regiment and 10th 'New Ingermanland' Infantry Regiment (890 men and six guns) were ordered to attack {{the eastern side of}} the {{northern}} wing. Simultaneously seven battalions (ca. 4,000 men) were to attack the central and eastern wings from the south. About 70 pieces of artillery were ordered to fire on the second line of Polish defences to prevent Polish reinforcements from breaking through to the fort. This time several thousand Russians entered the northern wing in strict military formations. By then the garrison under Maj. Lipski had 800 men and was not strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the assault. Poles were again pushed back into the trees of the far side of the northern wing, and Maj. Lipski was killed. He was replaced by Maj. Dobrogoyski, who panicked and sounded a retreat, taking with him 500 men. The remaining 300 soldiers under Maj. Świtkowski tried again to force the Russians out, but were by then outnumbered 10 to 1 and around 10:30 had to withdraw towards the central wing. The central wing, by then under the command of Lt. Col. Wodzyński, held out against a large column led by General Lüders, composed of the elite regiments of Prince Wilhelm and Prince Charles.|$|E
50|$|Embankment style {{diversion}} dams {{are constructed}} {{to counteract the}} force of the water pushing on the dam by building a dam with <b>enough</b> weight <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> the force. Embankment dams are commonly made from materials in the surrounding area where the dam is being built. The materials generally include: sand, gravel, and rocks. The combination of these building materials with either clay or an impervious membrane gives the embankment dam its integrity. As a result, the combination of its simple construction and locally available building materials the cost of building an embankment dam is lower than the other types of dams.|$|R

In the Belmont Stakes, Ponder began it {{as he did in}} the Kentucky Derby, but by now Capot's jockey Ted Atkinson knew his rival. Instead of forcing the pace, he kept it slow, allowing Capot <b>to</b> have just <b>enough</b> left <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> Ponder's fast late charge.|$|R
30|$|A {{possible}} {{application is}} wooden guardrail beam that utilizes small logs. Although steel W-beam guardrail and steel post {{are widely used}} currently, wood {{can be a great}} material for the guardrail because of the ability of the carbon sink and beauty. Wooden post and steel W-beam guardrail have been developed and already used [4 – 6]. Zhang et al. [7] developed another wooden guardrail system which consists of cedar round timber beam and concrete post. Guardrail beam is an important road facility to save a life. The guardrail beams should satisfy the requirements of structural performance.

50|$|Marshal Heinrich Botel {{gathered}} {{men from}} Kulm, Elbing, and Balga for an expeditionary attack deeper into Prussia. They traveled into {{the lands of}} Natangians and pillaged the region. On their way back they were in turn attacked by an army of Natangians. The Knights retreated to the nearby village of Krücken south of Kreuzburg (now Kamenka south of Slavskoye), where Prussians hesitated to attack. The Prussian army was growing as fresh troops arrived from more distant territories, and the Knights did not have <b>enough</b> supplies <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a siege. Therefore, the Teutonic Knights bargained for surrender: the marshal and three other knights were to remain as hostages while the others were {{to lay down their}} weapons.|$|R
