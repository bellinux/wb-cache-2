40|$|Economists {{are aware}} that {{conventional}} measures of national income do not capture everything {{that is important to}} individuals. In particular, the value of huge <b>improvments</b> in health over the twentieth century has gone uncalculated. Usher (1980) and Nordhaus (2002) have emphasised the virtues of including mortality <b>improvments</b> in some form of extended national income measure. This paper therefore sets out a methodology {{that can be used to}} calculate the value of mortality and morbidity improvements. The results indicate that health improvements in developed economies have been worth at least $ 1 trillion.

For modeling the face pose we employ a tree of boosted classifiers built using either Haar-like filters or Gauss filters. A first classifier extracts faces of any pose from the background. Then more specific classifiers discriminate between different poses. The tree of classifiers is trained by hierarchically sub-sampling the pose space. Finally, Condensation algorithm {{is used for}} tracking the faces. Experiments show large <b>improvments</b> in terms of detection rate and processing speed compared to state-of-the-art algorithms...|$|R
