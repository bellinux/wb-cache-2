Although 7 sero/genotypes of hantaviruses {{have been found in}} rodents, only Hantaan virus (carried by Apodemus agrarius mice) and Seoul virus (carried by Rattus norvegicus rats) reportedly cause disease in humans. During 1950 – 2007, a total of 1, 557, 622 cases of HFRS in humans and 46, 427 deaths (3 %) were reported in China. HFRS has been reported in 29 of 31 provinces in China. After implementation of comprehensive preventive measures, including vaccination, in the past decade in China, incidence of HFRS has dramatically decreased; only 11, 248 HFRS cases were reported in 2007. Mortality rates also declined from the highest level of 14. 2 % in 1969 to ≈ 1 % during 1995 – 2007. However, the numbers of HFRS cases and deaths in China remain the highest in the world. During the past decade, hantaviruses have gained worldwide attention as emerging zoonotic pathogens (1 – 3).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Hantavirus</b> <b>pulmonary</b> and {{cardiovascular}} <b>syndrome</b> (HPCS) is an emerging serious {{disease in the}} Americas. Hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae) are the causative agents of this syndrome and are mainly transmitted through inhalation of aerosols containing the excreta of wild rodents. In the Ribeirão Preto region (state of São Paulo, Brazil), HPCS has been reported since 1998, caused by the Araraquara virus (ARAV), for which Necromys lasiurus is the rodent reservoir. This study aimed to show diagnostic results relating to infection in humans and rodents, obtained at the Virology Research Center of the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine, University of São Paulo, between 2005 and 2008. METHODS: HPCS was diagnosed by means of ELISA and/or RT-PCR in 11 (21. 2 %) out of 52 suspected cases, and 54. 4 % of these were fatal. Furthermore, 595 wild rodents (Necromys lasiurus, Akodon sp, Calomys tener and Oligoryzomys sp) were caught between 2005 and 2008. RESULTS: Fifteen (2. 5 %) of these rodents presented antibodies for hantavirus, as follows: Necromys lasiurus (4 %), Calomys tener (1. 9 %) and Akodon sp (1. 5 %). Nucleotide sequences obtained through RT-PCR from one HPCS patient and one Calomys tener rodent were compared with hantavirus sequences from GenBank, which showed that both were homologous with ARAV. CONCLUSIONS: This work corroborates previous studies showing that ARAV is the hantavirus causing HPCS in the Ribeirão Preto region. It also shows that rodents infected with hantavirus represent a constant risk of transmission of this virus to man...|$|R

TB is a growing problem regionwide, especially in Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic where drug-resistant cases also are on the rise. Haiti does not provide data but probably also has a high infection rate. HIV/AIDS also is spreading rapidly, placing Latin America third behind Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in HIV prevalence. Prevalence is high in Brazil and especially in the Caribbean countries (except Cuba), where 2 percent of the population is infected. Malaria is prevalent in the Amazon basin. Dengue reemerged in the region in 1976, presenting both as the usual form and the more lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Hepatitis B and C prevalence is greatest in the Amazon basin, Bolivia, and Central America, while DHF is particularly prevalent in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. Yellow fever has made a comeback over the last decade throughout the Amazon basin, and there have been several recent outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease attributed to E. coli infection in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru Hemorrhagic fevers are present in almost all South American countries, and most <b>hantavirus</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurs in the southern cone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, an {{outbreak}} of <b>hantavirus</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurred in the Four Corners region in the southwestern United States.

40|$|We {{developed}} a 1 -hour fi eld enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detecting antibody to Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). The assay specificity and sensitivity were {{comparable to those}} of a standard EIA. This test will permit identifi cation of rodents with antibody to this and perhaps other hantaviruses. Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are rodentborne or insectivoreborne viruses; some are recognized causes of human hemorrhagic fever with renal <b>syndrome</b> or <b>hantavirus</b> <b>pulmonary</b> (or cardiopulmonary) <b>syndrome</b> (HPS) (1). The normal transmission cycle is rodent to rodent, without arthropod intermediate hosts. Each hantavirus has a single principal reservoir host, which suggests a coevolutionary relationship (2). In North America, the principal cause of HPS is Sin Nombre virus (SNV) because of the geographically widespread nature of its rodent host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), the most common mammal in North America. As with other rodent reservoirs that harbor unique hantaviruses, most, if not all, deer mice become persistently infected without discernible pathologic consequences (3, 4), which makes distinguishing infected from uninfected deer mice by simple observation impossible. Development of a field-relevant technique for detection of antibody to SNV would be of value; the technique could be exploited for further investigations of the virus–reservoir host interactions and characteristics and to determine whether experimental infections of deer mice with SNV accurately parallel natural infections (3, 4). Commonly used serologic tests for deer mice require a minimum of 3 – 5 hours to complete (2, 5, 6) and thus are impractical to use in the field in a single day without putting the rodents at risk for death from heat, cold, dehydration, trap injuries, and other hazards while tests are being conducted.

40|$|Clinical {{laboratories}} {{are increasingly}} receiving requests to perform nucleic acid amplification tests {{for the detection}} {{of a wide variety of}} infectious agents. In this paper, the efficiency of nucleic acid amplification techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections is reviewed. In general, these techniques should be applied only {{for the detection of}} microorganisms for which available diagnostic techniques are markedly insensitive or nonexistent or when turnaround times for existing tests (e. g., viral culture) are much longer than those expected with amplification. This is the case for rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and <b>hantaviruses</b> causing a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii. For Legionella spp. and fungi, contamination originating from the environment is a limiting factor in interpretation of results, as is the difficulty in differentiating colonization and infection. Detection of these agents in urine or blood by amplification techniques remains to be evaluated. In the clinical setting, there is no need for molecular diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii. At present, amplification methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot replace the classical diagnostic techniques, due to their lack of sensitivity and the absence of specific internal controls for the detection of inhibitors of the reaction. Also, the results of interlaboratory comparisons are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, isolates are needed for susceptibility studies. Additional work remains to be done on sample preparation methods, comparison between different amplification methods, and analysis of results. The techniques can be useful for the rapid identification of M. tuberculosis in particular circumstances, as well as the rapid detection of most rifampin-resistant isolates. The introduction of diagnostic amplification techniques into a clinical laboratory implies a level of proficiency for excluding false-positive and false-negative results...|$|R
