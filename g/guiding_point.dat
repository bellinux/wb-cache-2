40|$|Abstract In {{previous}} studies, {{we provided}} {{evidence for a}} directional distortion of the endpoints of movements to memorized target locations. This distortion was similar to a perceptual distortion in direction discrimination known as the oblique effect so we named it the ‘‘motor oblique effect’’. In this report we analyzed the directional errors during {{the evolution of the}} movement trajectory in memory guided and visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> movements and compared them with directional errors in a perceptual experiment of arrow pointing. We observed that the motor oblique effect was present in the evolving trajectory of both memory and visually guided reaching movements. In memory <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> the motor oblique effect did not disappear during trajectory evolution while in visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> the motor oblique effect disappeared with decreasing distance from the target and was smaller in magnitude compared to the perceptual oblique effect and the memory motor oblique effect early on after movement initiation. The motor oblique effect in visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> increased when reaction time was small and dis-appeared with larger reaction times. The results are best explained using the hypothesis that a low level oblique effect is present for visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> movements and this effect is corrected by a mechanism that does not depend on visual feedback from the trajectory evolution and might even be completed during movement planning. A second cognitive oblique effect is added in the percep-tual estimation of direction and affects the memory <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> movements. It is finally argued that the motor oblique effect can be a useful probe for the study of per-ception–action interaction...|$|R

This {{contribution}} presents {{our work}} towards {{a system that}} autonomously guides the user’s visual attention on important information (e. g., traffic situation or in-car system status signal, etc.) in error prone situations while driving a car. Therefore we use a highly accurate head-mounted eyetracking system to estimate the driver’s current focus of visual attention. Based on this data, we present our strategies to guide the driver’s attention to where he should focus his attention. These strategies use both graphical animations in form of a <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> on the Graphical User Interface as well as auditory animation that are present via headphones using a Virtual Acoustics system. In {{the end of this}} contribution, we present the results from a usability study. ...|$|E

30|$|While the LC-CUSUM {{has been}} used here to assess the {{performance}} of a single individual, it may prove useful for monitoring the introduction of a new procedure in any setting where feedback is available and corrective actions can be implemented, or in monitoring new trainees, who have the advantage of being trained by an experienced DIE sonographer. It may also prove useful for professional societies that are responsible for developing guidelines for good practice [17]. It is clear that any general gynecologic sonographer could benefit from such training, provided that feedback on diagnosis is available. We believe that our experience may serve as a <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> to other operators who aim to learn endometriosis mapping. With the new consensus opinion recently published by Guerriero et al. [30], better standardization and education is becoming feasible.|$|E

A counterclockwise rotation was used to compress the bone in case of soft bone. The tap or thread cutter was used to create the threads in dense bones. Following, the implant assembly was aseptically transferred to the osteotomy site, and the implant placement was started manually and finalized using a hand ratchet. If excessive force was experienced, the osteotomy was irrigated, and the depth was checked by retapping.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{function}} of the lining is for this element to reflect the silhouette of the outer shell, so that the garment is smooth when wearing, to minimize friction when wearing, and for easy removal of the garment from the wearer’s body (Kang and Suh 2007). The fabric of the lining depends on the outer shell fabric and its color. In general, the <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> is to choose the similar color to the outer shell and a solid plain lining color. Use of a synthetic lining fabric is standard for low to mid priced garment manufacturing, while silk is used for higher priced garments. The most popular lining fiber types are polyester, rayon, and acetate. The structure of the fabric is dependent upon the season in which the garment is intended to be worn. Plain weave is for spring and summer garments, while plain weave and twill are suitable for fall garments, and twill and satin are for winter-wear garments (Kim and Suh 2007).|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{superior}} hemiretina in primates and hu-mans has {{a greater}} density of ganglion cells than the in-ferior hemiretina, suggesting a bias towards processing information in the lower visual field (loVF). In primates, this over-representation of the loVF is also evident {{at the level of}} striate and extrastriate cortex. This is particularly true in some of the visual areas constituting the dorsal “action ” pathway, such as area V 6 A. Here we show that visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> movements with the hand are both faster and more accurate when performed in the loVF when compared to the same movements made in the upper visual field (upVF). This was true {{despite the fact that the}} biomechanics of the movements made did not differ across conditions. The loVF advantage for the control of visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> movements is unlike-ly to be due to retinal factors and may instead reflect a functional bias for controlling skilled movements in this region of space. Possible neural correlates for this loVF advantage for visually <b>guided</b> <b>pointing</b> are discussed...|$|R

An account is made about the work process related to the analysis and criticism of social life in the cities of M 6 xico. The text {{is divided into three}} parts. The first two relate the two interpretive models of social life which correspond to two cycles of intellectual labour; while the last part proposes a perspective based on the most ordered part of the conceptual elaboration. The <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> of this relation is the reflection about the two aforementioned terms, which are articulated at various times during the intellectual work. In a first instance, it is the different theories of communication, ideologies, systems and thetheory of action, among others, which form the basis of a proposal about composition and social organization. Secondly, semiology and urban anthropology order the theoretical meditation. Both point towards the conformation of a theory of composition and social organization that is derived from the practical, direct experience of social life...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPeople {{worldwide}} {{are increasingly}} {{faced with a}} force that drives international communication and globalization. Whether they are directed impacted or more subtly affected they can weigh how the pervasive force of the English language is touching upon essential parts of their own languages and cultures. If {{you listen to the}} radio or watch TV in the Czech Republic, you can catch previously unheard words and phrases seeping in, such as “updatovat” or “door-to-door”. This paper looks at ways the Czech Republic has reacted to the encroaching effects of English. It compares both languages and it also more specifically looks at some examples of English words and phrases that have become loanwords in Czech, and at issues of cultural relativity. It uses a series of questionnaires spaced over time to gauge how students at a technical university consider English in comparison to their own language. As a <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> it looks at some of the findings of renowned sociologists such as Bourdieu, Hofstede, Trompeenaars and E. Hall to use as reference points to generally examine how some cultural factors can influence the approach to learning a foreign language...|$|E

40|$|Blood {{coagulation}} is {{a cascade}} of complex enzymatic reactions which involves specific proteins and cellular components to interact and prevent blood loss. The coagulation process begins by either “Tissue Dependent Pathway ” (also known as extrinsic pathway) or by “contact activation pathway ” (also known as intrinsic pathway). TFPI is an endogenous multivalent Kunitz type protease inhibitor which inhibits Tissue factor dependent pathway by inhibiting Tissue Factor:Factor VIIa (TF:FVIIa) complex and Factor Xa. TFPI {{is one of the}} most studied coagulation pathway inhibitor which has various clinical and potential therapeutic applications, however, its exact mechanism of inhibition is still unknown. Structure based mechanism elucidation is commonly employed technique in such cases. Therefore, in the current study the generated a complete TFPI structural model so as to understand the mechanistic details of it’s functioning. The model was checked for stereochemical quality by PROCHECK-NMR, WHATIF, ProSA, and QMEAN servers. The model was selected, energy minimized and simulated for 1. 5 ns. The result of the study may be a <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> for further investigations on TFPI and its role in coagulation mechanism. Background: Blood coagulation pathway is a complex biological mechanism where specific proteins and cellular components interact to prevent blood loss [1].

40|$|The {{existing}} literature provides {{a variety of}} drivers enabling rapid internationalization of born global firms. This explorative study with its inductive approach attempts to analyze to what extent born global theory {{can be used to}} understand internationalization in the context of small-sized game development firms. Five interviews of a qualitative nature are used to collect data from founders of firms in this under-researched context. The data collection process is based on an operationalization of concepts based on the three categories of founder, organizational and macro-environmental drivers. The findings show that the firms can be aligned to three different stages of their business development, from subcontracting, to game development, to self-publishing. Subcontractors are not born global, but game developers must develop games with global market potential. These firms are pushed to be international by the heavily globalized nature of their industry and digital nature of both the products and the distribution platforms. Founder and organizational factors do not drive the born global approach as much as the environment, but still play a role in explaining the business of these firms. Overall, the findings of this thesis may provide a <b>guiding</b> <b>point</b> for further research in this specific context of firms acting in an industry with immediate internationalization...|$|E
