[...] The light was very wonderful, for the sun had just gone down and all the western heavens were crimson with its departing glory. In the few moments that they stood there gazing it might almost have been believed that some portentous miracle had happened, so deep and dark, and yet so bright, were the hues of the horizon. It seemed as though the lands below the hill were bathed in blood. The elm trees interrupted their view, {{so that they could}} only look out through the spaces between their trunks. [...] "Come to the stile," [...] said he. [...] "If you were to live a thousand years you might never again see such a sunset as that.

6000|$|The Truth is, Daun's was an {{intricate}} case just now; needing, above all things, swiftness of treatment; what, of all things, {{it could not}} get from Daun. His denunciations on that burnt Suburb were again loud; but Schmettau continues deaf to all that,--means [...] "to defend himself by the known rules of war and of honor;" [...] declares, he [...] "will dispute from street to street, and only finish {{in the middle of}} Polish Majesty's Royal Palace." [...] Denunciation will do nothing! Daun had above 100,000 men in those parts. Rushing forward with sharp shot and bayonet storm, instead of logical denunciation, it is probable Daun might have settled his Schmettau. But the hour of tide was rigorous, withal;--and such an ebb, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>missed</b> it in hesitating! NOVEMBER 15th, Daun withdrew; the ebbing come. That same day, Friedrich was at Lauban in the Lausitz, within a hundred miles again; speeding hitherward; behind him a Silesia brushed clear, before him a Saxony to be brushed. [...] "Reason weighty" [...] enough, think Daun and the Austrian Gazettes! But such, since you have missed the tide-hour, is the inexorable fact of ebb,--going at that frightful rate. Daun never was the man to dispute facts.|$|E

I can't go with you, for I'm saving up my strength for our picnic at Château-Bigot to-morrow; and I want you, Kitty, to see that the colonel sees everything. I've had trouble enough, goodness knows, getting the facts together for him." [...] This was as Kitty and Mr. Arbuton sat waiting in Mrs. Ellison's parlor for the delinquent colonel, who had just stepped round to the Hôtel St. Louis and was to be back presently. But the moment of his return passed; a quarter-hour of grace; a half-hour of grim magnanimity,--and still no colonel. Mrs. Ellison began by saying that it was perfectly abominable, and left herself, in a greater extremity, with nothing more forcible to add than that it was too provoking. [...] "It's getting so late now," [...] she said at last, [...] "that it's no use waiting any longer, if you mean to go at all, to-day; and to-day's the only day you can go. There, you'd better drive on without him. I can't bear to have you miss it." [...] And, thus adjured, the younger people rose and went.|$|E

So you see?" [...] Mrs. Roberts addresses herself to her husband in the library of their apartment in Hotel Bellingham, at Boston, as she stands before the fire pulling on a long glove and looking at him across his desk, where he has sunk into a weary heap in his swivel chair. [...] "You are dreadfully used up, Edward, and I think it's cruel to make you go out; but what can I do? If it was anybody but Mrs. Miller I wouldn't think of having you go; I'm sure I never want to have her about, anyway. But that's just the kind of people that you're a perfect slave to! Now, dear, I've let the two girls go out, and you must remember that you're in the place alone with the children; but you needn't be troubled, because nobody will come after this hour till Willis does, and the girls will be back before that. Willis is to come and get you on his way to the Millers', and it's all been arranged for you, and you needn't think of a thing till Willis comes. You'll have to dress, of course; but you needn't begin that at once, and you can just sit here in your chair and rest." [...] Mr. Roberts stretches his arms wildly abroad, and, throwing back his head, permits himself a yawn that eclipses his whole face. Mrs. Roberts lets both her arms fall at her side in token of extreme despair. [...] "Edward! If you should go to sleep!" ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the lockout}} of the 2011 offseason, Beatty gained 19 pounds and {{reported}} to camp at 319 pounds. In training camp, Beatty won the starting Left Tackle job. The offensive line underwent significant change as veteran offensive linemen Shaun O'Hara and Rich Seubert were both released. In the first preseason {{game against the}} Carolina Panthers, Beatty did not give up any sacks. Beatty gained media attention in the week following the game for his tough practicing against Jason Pierre-Paul, who had 2 sacks in the Carolina Preseason game and veteran Osi Umenyiora.
