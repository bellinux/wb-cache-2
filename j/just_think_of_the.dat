6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is 'here you are'!" [...] exclaimed Polly. [...] "The girls have been here nearly half an hour waiting. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time wasted!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, I won't," [...] {{repeated}} Mrs Denman; [...] "how can I? <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. Sitting in {{my chair}} in dishabille, when a man--a Man, Miss Dee--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hundred and}} one {{things that come}} from it," [...] said Jack. [...] "Kerosene and gasoline, and benzine and naphtha and paraffin, and I don't know what all." ...|$|E
60|$|CROFTS. Yes. Now <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> {{trouble and}} the {{explanations}} {{it would save}} {{if we were to}} keep the whole thing in the family, so to speak. Ask your mother whether she'd like to have to explain all her affairs to a perfect stranger.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Why, <b>the</b> people <b>of</b> St. <b>Just</b> only <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> berryin', but I do <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resurrection; the consekince is {{that they}} do dig too deep, an' afore the St. Just folk are well out of their graves, ours will be a braave way up to heaven!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{then when}} Netley {{walked up to}} <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table and laid down a cheque for a hundred dollars {{conditional}} on the fund reaching one hundred thousand the room was in an uproar. A hundred thousand dollars! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it! <b>The</b> figures fairly stagger one. To <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a hundred thousand dollars raised in five minutes in a little place like Mariposa! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. 'Happy New Year," [...] said Pagett, {{smiling at}} the sunshine. [...] "What a divine climate you have here! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brown cold fog hanging over London now!" [...] And he rubbed his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not for economy, mate," [...] objected Dick Moy. [...] "We can't {{afford to}} do dooty as lights without {{increased}} pay. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intellektooal force required for to keep the lights agoin' night after night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{believe it}} myself, Grace," [...] he answered. [...] "It {{seems to me}} I've been going to school all my life. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> years and years I put in at Putnam Hall Military Academy before I came to Brill!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, HE ran away, {{when you}} left. But <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it! <b>The</b> other day, when papa and I {{went into a}} big {{restaurant}} in San Francisco, who should be there WAITING on the table--yes, Clarence, a real waiter--but Jim Hooker! Papa spoke to him; but of course," [...] with a slight elevation of her pretty chin, [...] "I couldn't, you know; fancy--a waiter!" ...|$|R
60|$|ZOO. The same reply, {{word for}} word, that your illustrious predecessor, {{as you call}} him, got fifteen years ago. You asked for it; and you got it. And <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> {{important}} questions you might have asked. She would have answered them, you know. It is always like that. I will go and arrange to have you sent home: you can wait {{for me in the}} entrance hall [she goes out].|$|R
5000|$|Farrant's work is {{infused with}} acerbic wit and iconoclastic innovation. As the Globe & Mail has noted, [...] "M.A.C. Farrant's short stories revel in <b>the</b> absurdity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern world. If you've never heard <b>of</b> her, <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as <b>the</b> 'bizarro' Alice Munro." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, heaps! 'Course if you {{get stuck}} with a Fellaheen regiment, you're sold; {{but if you are}} {{appointed}} to a Soudanese lot, you're in clover. They are first-class fighting-men - and <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eligible central position of Egypt in the next row!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{so sorry}} for the Outrams that I should not care about the {{sideboard}} if you had got it for twopence. What an awful smash! <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old place being bought by a Jew! Tom and Leonard are utterly ruined, they say, not a sixpence left. I declare I nearly cried when I saw that man selling Leonard's guns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who can tell?" [...] Wrayson answered. [...] "That Morris Barnes was in {{possession}} of valuables of some sort, everything goes to prove. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{number of people who}} have shown their interest in him. There is Bentham and his mysterious client, the Baroness de Sturm and your daughter, and--the person who murdered him. Apparently, even though he lost his life, Barnes was too clever for them, for his precious belongings must still be undiscovered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{means you}} agree with me that it's <b>the</b> punkest state <b>of</b> things you ever struck. Well, you're quite right. It is. It's a shame to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that {{innocent}} kid having this sort of deal handed to him. Why, <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him at <b>the</b> studio!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as dust. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as <b>the</b> {{dirt and}} dust of far-off lands blowing {{over here and}} {{settling}} on [...] "Pig-Pen!" [...] It staggers the imagination! He may be carrying the soil that was trod upon by Solomon or Nebuchadnezzar or Genghis Khan! ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Breath <b>of</b> Life {{is a dark}} wave, {{ethereal}} {{wave and}} gothic rock band from Belgium. [...] "I guess {{you can say that}} <b>The</b> Breath <b>of</b> Life are an institution in the Belgian Goth scene. During decades they were, without any doubt, the sole Belgian band who was able to blend ethereal darkwave, gothrock and post-punk. Or perhaps it is better <b>just</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Breath <b>of</b> Life as they created a very personal sound" [...] wrote Peek A Boo magazine in February 2015.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absurd little town, knowing {{nothing of}} the only memorable {{incident}} which ever happened within its boundaries since the old Britons built it, this sad and lovely story, which consecrates the spot (for I found it holy to my contemplation, again, {{as soon as it}} lay behind me) in the heart of a stranger from three thousand miles over the sea! It but confirms what I have been saying, that sublime and beautiful facts are best understood when etherealized by distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are my chief {{inducement}} to the match. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state those dears must be in, {{with only}} a young governess, {{and half a dozen}} giddy maids to see to them. I long to be among them, and named an early day, because measles and scarlatina are coming round again, and only Fanny, and the twins, Gus and Gam, have had either. I know all their names and ages, dispositions, and characters, and love them like a mother already. He perfectly adores them, and that is very charming in a learned man like Mr. Bliss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{opinion is}} that they are good both for man and monkey," [...] said Jack. [...] "Just consider, now: {{it must have been a}} terrible trial for yon gorilla-mamma to hear a bullet pass within an inch of her head, and have her sweet little darling frightened almost out of its wits. Well, but <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state of {{satisfaction}} and rejoicing that she must be in now at having escaped. Had it not been for that trial she would now have been in her ordinary humdrum condition. I quite agree with Ralph that trials are really a blessing to us." ...|$|E
50|$|While he is away {{serving in}} the armed forces, Steve Morgan's {{advertising}} agency is being run by his wife, who goes by her maiden name Pat Brown so clients won't <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as <b>the</b> boss's wife. Pat loses a big account and anxiously wants to sign up Smoothies cigarettes, owned by playboy Mark Townley.|$|R
2500|$|A {{spokesman}} for the National Society for Human Rights, an organisation which is funded by the Saudi Government, said that <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> executions is rising because crime rates are rising, that prisoners are treated humanely, and that the beheadings deter crime, saying, [...] "Allah, our creator, knows best what's good for His people...Should we <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> and preserve <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murderer and not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> others?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nom de Dieu! <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> his name! <b>The</b> Scarlet Pimpernel {{they call}} him! No one knows him {{by any other}} name! and he is preternaturally tall and strong and superhumanly cunning! And the power which he has of being transmuted into various personalities--rendering himself quite unrecognisable to <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most sharp-seeing patriot of France, must of a surety be a gift of Satan!" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{this was}} what a single day brought about; and yet years pass away so often without a change. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{alteration}} in that four-and-twenty hours. De Lissac was gone. Edie was gone. Napoleon had escaped. War had broken out. Jim Horscroft had lost everything, and he and I were setting out {{to fight against the}} French. It was all like a dream, until I tramped off to the coach that evening, and looked back at the grey farm steading and at the two little dark figures: my mother with her face sunk in her Shetland shawl, and my father waving his drover's stick to hearten me upon my way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of that!" [...] he concluded. [...] "That's the Amazon {{river in}} flood time in South America. And the world's full of places like that--everywhere, most likely, except Oakland. Oakland's {{just a place}} to start from, I guess. Now that's adventure, I want to tell you. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> luck of them boys! All the same, some day I'm {{going to go over}} the Andes to the {{headwaters}} of the Amazon, all through the rubber country, an' canoe down the Amazon thousands of miles to its mouth where it's that wide you can't see one bank from the other an' where you can scoop up perfectly fresh water out of the ocean a hundred miles from land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very," [...] he {{repeated}} with biting sarcasm, whilst nervously his bony fingers {{played with the}} inevitable bit of string. [...] "Very curious indeed. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole thing. There was the old man with all his wealth, and two sons, one to whom he is devoted, {{and the other with}} whom he does nothing but quarrel. One day there is another of these quarrels, but more violent, more terrible than any that have previously occurred, with the result that the father, heartbroken by it all, has an attack of apoplexy and practically dies of a broken heart. After that he alters his will, and subsequently a will is proved which {{turns out to be a}} forgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know I'm a great {{trial to}} you, Marilla," [...] said Anne repentantly. [...] "I make so many {{mistakes}}. But then <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> mistakes I don't make, although I might. I'll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I go to school. Oh, Marilla, {{my heart was}} just set on going to that concert. I never was to a concert in my life, and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it. You didn't know just how I felt about it, but you see Matthew did. Matthew understands me, and it's so nice to be understood, Marilla." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luckily {{there are}} some {{advantages}} in the--the profession of a sailor. As long as they defy the world away at sea somewhere eighteen thousand miles from here, I don't mind so much. I wonder what that interesting old party will say. He will have another surprise. They mean to drag him along with them on board the ship straight away. Rescue work. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Roderick Anthony, <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> a gentleman, after all..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't, my dear, speak so coldly of your father! You don't {{know what}} he has to put up with. You don't know his {{troubles}} and anxieties--all this wretched business." [...] She paused, and her face became portentous. [...] "Marjorie, do you know if these railways go on as they are going he may have to eat into his capital this year. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that, and <b>the</b> worry he has! And this last shame and anxiety!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Ruyter, you {{are like}} a child. You know nothing. The land from which the white man comes will never suffer him to be driven out of Africa. England is rich in everything, and will send men to fill the places of those who fall. Besides, I think God is on the white man's side, because the white man in the main intends and tries to do good. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> `fair.' The black man wants beads and brass wire and cotton, and many other things--the white man brings these things from over the sea. On the other hand the white man wants hides, horns, ivory--the black man can supply these things. They meet to exchange, good is done by each to the other. Why should they fight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{nodded his}} head slowly. [...] "It makes me regular uncomfortable, the bare thought of that chap running about the country! He is at present At Large, and from certain {{evidence}} it is supposed that he has--taken--took, I suppose they mean--the road to Port Stowe. You see we're right in it! None of your American wonders, this time. And <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things he might do! Where'd you be, if he took a drop over and above, and had a fancy to go for you? Suppose he wants to rob--who can prevent him? He can trespass, he can burgle, he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man! Easier! For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp, I'm told. And wherever there was liquor he fancied--" ...|$|E
60|$|Morning, noon, {{and night}} the visitor is perpetually putting {{his hand into}} his side pocket and pulling out coppers. He drips coppers all day in an unending stream. You enter a French theatre. You buy a programme, fifty centimes, and ten more {{to the man who}} sells it. You hand your coat and cane to an aged harpy, who presides over what is called the vestiaire, pay her twenty-five centimes and give her ten. You are shown to your seat by another old fairy in dingy black (she has a French name, but I forget it) and give her twenty centimes. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silly {{business}} of it. Your ticket, if it is a good seat in a good theatre, has cost you about three dollars and a half. One would almost think the theatre could afford to throw in eight cents worth of harpies for the sake of international good will.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{was raised}} in a Baptist {{household}} and went to a Catholic school, but he no longer identifies himself as religious. Though he is not a Scientologist and has denied rumors claiming him as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church <b>of</b> Scientology, he has spoken favorably about it, saying [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideas in Scientology are brilliant and revolutionary and non-religious." ...|$|R
5000|$|Charlie Brown is {{the only}} Peanuts {{character}} to unconditionally accept [...] "Pig-Pen" [...] for who he is, even defending [...] "Pig-Pen's" [...] uncleanliness in one strip (which was re-used in A Charlie Brown Christmas): Don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as dust. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as <b>the</b> dirt and dust of far-off lands blowing over here and settling on [...] "Pig-Pen!" [...] It staggers the imagination! He may be carrying the soil that was trod upon by Solomon or Nebuchadnezzar or Genghis Khan! ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{leaned forward}} {{with his hands}} on his knees. [...] "I was in Genoa at that time {{learning}} banking; Garibaldi was a wonderful man! One could not help it." [...] He spoke quite simply. [...] "You might say it was like seeing a little man stand up to a ring of great hulking fellows; I went, just as you would have gone, if you'd been there. I was not long with them--our war began; I had to go back home." [...] He said this as if there had been but one war since the world began. [...] "In '60," [...] he mused, [...] "till '65. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it! <b>The</b> poor country. Why, in my State, South Carolina--I was through it all--nobody could be spared there--we were one to three." ...|$|R
