5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} power over the Iazyges. There were offers from the princes of the Iazyges to supply troops, but these were denied based on the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might revolt or desert in a war.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the plans}} for Tracy and Jenna, Jack tells Liz—the head writer for TGS—to begin searching for a new cast member to help lessen this elitist image. Liz {{recruits}} TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to help in her search, planning trips to comedy clubs to find new talent. Both agree {{to try to keep}} the process secret from the cast and crew for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be angered over the idea of a new actor joining the cast. Liz and Pete give awkward answers trying to explain why they are going places together and ultimately tell the TGS writing staff. They also inadvertently tell Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) who, angered by the news, quits the show.|$|E
5|$|Hindman set to {{work and}} issued a series of harsh {{military}} edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies {{for the defense of}} the State. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not have an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Several Gibraltar Police officers, {{including}} Special Branch officers, gave {{evidence about}} {{the aftermath of the}} shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be fired if anyone found {{out and they}} swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed {{in front of his}} classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E

50|$|The {{networks}} <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> {{a single}} profanity would block an entire program. <b>They</b> also <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would lose advertising revenue because advertisers would {{not pay for}} time slots during programs that might be blocked.|$|R
5|$|When a {{group of}} terrorists takes an American family hostage, Claire negotiates with their imprisoned leader, Yusuf Al Ahmadi (Farshad Farahat), who agrees to tell his {{followers}} to release the hostages. Al Ahmadi reneges on the deal, however, and tells them to kill the hostages. At the same time, journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes an investigative news story detailing Frank's crimes. Claire gives Frank the idea to declare war on the terrorists and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can exploit. In the final scene, Claire finally breaks the fourth wall with Frank.|$|E
5|$|News of the Fort Rosalie attack reached New Orleans {{in early}} December, and the colonists there began to panic. The city {{depended}} upon grain {{and other supplies}} from the Illinois settlement, and shipments {{up and down the}} Mississippi River would be threatened by the loss of Fort Rosalie. Governor Périer reacted to the massacre by forbidding the entry of a delegation of Choctaw people into the city, for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were using the pretext of a friendly visit to launch an attack. He then ordered slaves and French troops to march downstream and massacre a small village of Chaouacha people who had played no part in the uprising in Natchez. His superiors in Paris reprimanded the leader for this act, which may have been intended to prevent any alliance between slaves and Native Americans against the French colonists. Many Louisiana colonists—Dumont de Montigny in particular—blamed Chépart (who was killed by the Natchez) and Périer for the massacre; Louis XV, the French king, ordered Périer back to France in 1732. Périer's replacement was his predecessor, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, whom the French state thought to be more experienced at dealing with the Native Americans of the region. A year earlier, the French West India Company had given up control of the colony to Louis XV because it had been costly and difficult to manage even before the rebellion.|$|E
25|$|First, small {{steelmakers}} {{once more}} began breaking ranks. The union settled another {{contract with a}} small steel manufacturer on July 17. Several other agreements seemed near, leading the larger companies to <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were losing the battle for employer sentiment.|$|E

25|$|Even if Czechoslovakia officially {{declared}} {{equality of}} all citizens, {{members of the}} Hungarian minority were reluctant to apply for positions in diplomacy, army or state services because of <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be easily misused by foreign intelligence services, especially in time of threat to the country.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the causes}} for the Turkish {{campaign}} against the Greek-speaking christian population was a <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would aid the Ottoman Empire's enemies, and a belief among some Turks that to form a modern nation state {{it was necessary to}} purge from the territories of the state those national groups who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation state.|$|E
25|$|In many societies, {{men who do}} not act in this {{traditional}} masculine way are ostracized by their peers and considered effeminate. In studies, young males from Cambodia, Mexico, Peru and South Africa, reported that they have participated in incidents where girls were coerced into sex (such as gang rapes) and that they did so {{as a way to}} prove their masculinity to their friends, or under peer pressure and <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be rejected if they didn't participate in the assault.|$|E
50|$|Vittorio Pozzo {{developed}} {{a plan to}} accommodate the teams' requests, but, after a vote, the plan was not passed: the smaller clubs <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would disappear if such a reduction was introduced.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{northern}} frontier, Loyalists were often harshly treated, and they reacted {{in many instances}} by joining Loyalist military units, <b>fearing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could never {{return to their homes}} unless the British prevailed.|$|R
2500|$|Some <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> Home Rule {{would become}} [...] "Rome Rule" [...] under an oppressive and {{socially}} dominant Roman Catholic Church. <b>They</b> <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would experience discrimination, including legal disabilities analogous to those imposed on Catholics and dissenting Protestants {{under the old}} Penal Laws.|$|R
25|$|With {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, many {{martial arts}} were banned by the new {{government}} for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be used by ultra-nationalistic groups {{as a way to}} cause civil unrest. The police-jō taught by Shimizu to the Tokyo Police force {{was one of the few}} exceptions and many other martial arts practitioners from before the war went to Shimizus dojo in Tokyo for training. The police-jo were further developed in the 1960s when it was adapted for use in crowd-control with the Tokyo Riot police.|$|E
25|$|Although his {{expulsion}} {{would have}} formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately {{and joined the}} staunchly Republican artillery unit of the National Guard. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois' former unit were {{arrested and charged with}} conspiracy to overthrow the government.|$|E
25|$|The {{people and}} warriors in Arindal's capital are panicking {{because they are}} under attack. Lora berates them, saying that she herself stands firm even though she has lost father, brother and lover. She reminds them of Groma's prophecy that the kingdom will not fall if Arindal returns, but the chorus express doubts. Just as she begins to <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are right (O musst du Hoffnung schwinden), a {{messenger}} arrives to announce that Arindal is on his way. The new king is greeted joyously by his people, but Arindal himself expresses his fears {{that he is not}} strong enough for battle. Meanwhile, Morald and Lora express their mutual love.|$|E

25|$|Huldah Hawley {{was born}} in 1755 and died in 1856 {{at the age of}} 101. The widow of Tory Chauncey Beardsley, Huldah took {{pleasure}} in talking of the exciting times of the Revolution and related during her lifetime about the time that two companies of French soldiers, under the command of French General Rochambeau, encamped a whole winter during the war on what is now known as Mountain Hill, a high rocky bluff in {{the central part of the}} village of Nichol's Farms. This high rocky bluff, at the time, commanded a view of Long Island Sound for , and was used to spy on British ships. Hawley said the soldiers ordered her to cook for them, and she furnished them with provisions for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would kill her. French coins have since been found near the site of their camp in Abraham Nichols Park.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{first began}} {{developing}} nuclear weapons during World War II under {{the order of}} President Franklin Roosevelt in 1939, motivated by the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were engaged in a}} race with Nazi Germany to develop such a weapon. After a slow start {{under the direction of the}} National Bureau of Standards, at the urging of British scientists and American administrators, the program was put under the Office of Scientific Research and Development, where in 1942 it was officially transferred under the auspices of the United States Army and became known as the Manhattan Project, an American, British and Canadian joint venture. Under the direction of General Leslie Groves, over thirty different sites were constructed for the research, production, and testing of components related to bomb making. These included the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, under the direction of physicist Robert Oppenheimer, the Hanford plutonium production facility in Washington, and the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|The Lord Nelson-class battleships were {{designed}} and built {{at a time when}} the direction of future battleship construction was controversial. On the one hand, naval combat during the Russo–Japanese War of 1904–1905 suggested that engagement ranges would increase to the point that intermediate and secondary batteries would become far less important and perhaps even ineffective, and that smaller-calibre guns would be useless in combat between capital ships; on the other hand, the lower rate of fire of battleship main batteries raised questions about the prudence of building all-big-gun battleships, for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be overwhelmed by the higher rate of fire of intermediate-calibre guns in the shorter-range engagements that might occur in fog or bad weather or at night. In the end, the all-big-gun battleships, which became known as dreadnoughts after the first such ship, , were vindicated, but this was by no means clear when the Lord Nelsons {{were designed}} in 1904 or even by the time they were laid down in 1905.|$|E
50|$|When the British besieged Copenhagen in 1807, it was <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would destroy}} the mills on the fortifications. Therefore two extra mills were {{constructed}} on less exposed locations, one at Sølvgade and one on Nyholm.|$|R

50|$|Early Muslim armies {{stayed in}} encampments away from cities because Umar <b>feared</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might become {{attracted}} to wealth and luxury. Some cities also had {{agreements with the}} Muslims, such as during the Siege of Jerusalem in 637 CE.|$|R
