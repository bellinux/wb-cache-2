500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producer was series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who also functioned as the series' showrunner. During production of the previous season, Nickelodeon picked up a second season for SpongeBob SquarePants on August 31, 1999. The season premiered more than a year later, on October 26, 2000. Season production assistant and then-staff writer Derek Iversen commented, [...] "We hoped it would go one season. We hoped it would go two seasons. I figured you <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can and you hope." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the album as a [...] "fine balancing act" [...] of [...] "emo-edged" [...] tracks and [...] "wallop-packed rockers." [...] Steve Hochman of The Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Those graduating from teen tastes could well turn to this album {{as a first}} step to adulthood." [...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can, listen to your favorite band, bury your head in the sand, before it all begins again. Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat World song!" ...|$|E
500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, if you never see me again, <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.|$|E

2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: <b>Do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Poet Michael Longley, a {{close friend}} of Heaney, said: [...] "I feel like I've lost a brother." [...] Thomas Kinsella said he was shocked, but John Montague said he had known for some time that the poet was not well. Playwright Frank McGuinness called Heaney [...] "the {{greatest}} Irishman of my generation: he had no rivals." [...] Colm Tóibín wrote: [...] "In a time of burnings and bombings Heaney used poetry to offer an alternative world." [...] Gerald Dawe said he was [...] "like an older brother who encouraged you to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> could do." [...] Theo Dorgan said, [...] " [...] work will pass into permanence." [...] Everywhere I go there is real shock at this. Seamus was one of us." [...] His publisher, Faber and Faber, noted that [...] "his impact on literary culture is immeasurable." [...] Playwright Tom Stoppard said, [...] "Seamus never had a sour moment, neither in person nor on paper". Andrew Motion, a former UK Poet Laureate and friend of Heaney, called him [...] "a great poet, a wonderful writer about poetry, and a person of truly exceptional grace and intelligence." ...|$|E
