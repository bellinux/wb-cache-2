40|$|Intelligent {{interaction}} {{between humans and}} computers has been a dream of artificial intelligence {{since the beginning of}} digital era and one of the original motivations behind the creation of artificial intelligence. A key step towards the achievement of such an ambitious goal is to enable the Question Answering systems understand the <b>information</b> <b>need</b> of the user. In this thesis, we attempt to enable the QA system’s ability to understand the user’s <b>information</b> <b>need</b> by three approaches. First, an clarification question generation method is proposed to help the user clarify the <b>information</b> <b>need</b> and bridge <b>information</b> <b>need</b> gap between QA system and the user. Next, a translation based model is obtained from the large archives of Community Question Answering data, to model the <b>information</b> <b>need</b> behind a question and boost the performance of question recommendation. Finally, a fine-grained classification framework is proposed to enable the systems to recommend an-swered questions based on <b>information</b> <b>need</b> satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{raison d'etre}} of IR is to satisfy human <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> But, {{do we really}} {{understand}} <b>information</b> <b>need?</b> Despite advances {{in the past few}} decades in both the IR and relevant scientific communities, this question is largely unanswered. We do not really understand how an <b>information</b> <b>need</b> emerges and how it is physically manifested. <b>Information</b> <b>need</b> refers to a complex concept: at the very initial state of the phenomenon (i. e. at a visceral level), even the searcher may not be aware of its existence. This renders the measuring of this concept (using traditional behaviour studies) nearly impossible. In this paper, we investigate the connection between an <b>information</b> <b>need</b> and brain activity. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we measured the brain activity of twenty four participants while they performed a Question Answering (Q/A) Task, where the questions were carefully selected and developed from TREC- 8 and TREC 2001 Q/A Track. The results of this experiment revealed a distributed network of brain regions commonly associated with activities related to <b>information</b> <b>need</b> and retrieval and differing brain activity in processing scenarios when participants knew the answer to a given question and when they did not and needed to search. We believe our study and conclusions constitute an important step in unravelling the nature of <b>information</b> <b>need</b> and therefore better satisfying it. © 2016 ACM...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo measure patient-perceived {{knowledge}} and <b>information</b> <b>need</b> regarding regional {{health care services}} and their determinants among 400 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to identify the preferred method of information provision. MethodsPostal survey on {{knowledge and}} <b>information</b> <b>need</b> (content and accessibility) of 18 regional health care services and preferences for the mode of delivery of information. Logistic regression analyses determined which factors were associated with insufficient knowledge and <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> ResultsTwo-hundred and thirty-seven (94 %) patients reported insufficient knowledge about the contents and 235 (94 %) about the accessibility {{of at least one}} health care services, whereas 172 patients (69 %) reported an <b>information</b> <b>need</b> about the content and 154 (61 %) on the accessibility. Age was significantly associated with knowledge whereas both age and physical functioning were significantly associated with <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> Seventy-nine percent of the patients mentioned written information, 21 % the Internet and 12 % personal contact with a professional as a preferred method of information delivery. ConclusionMany RA patients reported a lack of knowledge or <b>information</b> <b>need</b> concerning the contents and accessibility of regional health care services.

40|$|Abstract – In this article, {{we address}} the rarely {{discussed}} prob-lem of connecting high-level information (e. g., aggregated states and enemy intentions) to information acquisition. Our {{approach is to}} partition the transition of <b>information</b> <b>need</b> to sensor man-agement into a set of comprehensible entities (information types and functions), which we present in a framework. The frame-work is stepwise (sequential) and first translates actual informa-tion (from the data and information fusion process) to <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> The <b>information</b> <b>need</b> is mapped to the task space by a task management function which performs prioritization with respect to <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> A further step includes projection of tasks to service space by an allocation scheme, and finally services give orders to resources. In the terminology of the framework, we dis-cuss the extension of a previous study (that involved plan recogni-tion) with a sensor management function...|$|R

The ostensive model {{assumes that}} a user’s <b>information</b> <b>need</b> is dynamic and developing, thus, a {{recently}} accessed object {{can be seen}} as more indicative to the current <b>information</b> <b>need.</b> The model has been proved to be effective in image retrieval. This paper investigates the effectiveness of an ostensive model applied to web retrieval, where query-biased sentences are used to implicitly capture an underlying <b>information</b> <b>need</b> and to support a user’s browsing of search results. Our study suggests that the sentence-based approach to an ostensive browsing is promising to facilitate an effective exploration of search results. ...|$|R
25|$|Metis is a Dewey-free library {{classification}} system developed and implemented in 2011 by Sue Giffard, Tali Balas Kaplan, Jennifer Still, and Andrea Dolloff, the librarians at the Ethical Culture School in New York City. The system places the thinking, interests, <b>information</b> <b>needs</b> and information-seeking behavior of children at its center. It was developed {{as an alternative}} to the Dewey Decimal Classification System and the practices which customarily accompany that system in school and public libraries in the United States: namely, the alphabetical arrangement of fiction by author, and the frequent arrangement of biographies in alphabetical order by biographee. The Metis system (named for Metis the Titan who was the mother of Athena in Greek mythology) was designed to encourage productive independent browsing by children, as well as allowing for successful catalog searching by elementary school students.|$|E

However, the authors found many respondents were frustrated with the negative or male-centric literature that made up the bulk of information available in libraries; libraries needed to ensure that information was readily available, current and positive to best serve lesbian populations.|$|E
