25|$|Mount Carroll and Mount Clinton {{had been}} {{outfitted}} as third-class passenger ships for {{employment in the}} immigrant trade, but when the Harding administration imposed immigration restrictions, Harriman was forced to refit the two ships as freighters. There were already far too many freighters in transatlantic service however, and Harriman was soon forced to sell both ships. Likewise, his two Hawaiian-American passenger liners were to fail due to stiff competition from the Matson Navigation Company. The <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> shipping was becoming increasingly evident.|$|R
50|$|Changing global {{economic}} conditions and severe drought dramatically affected the Ghanaian aluminum industry during the 1980s. The discovery of vast bauxite reserves in Australia and Brazil created a <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> the mineral and induced a prolonged {{recession in the}} aluminum trade. Under these conditions, Valco found it far more economical to import semi-processed alumina from Jamaica and South Korea than to rely on local supplies, despite the discovery in the early 1970s of sizable new deposits at Kibi. Valco's refusal to build an aluminum production facility brought Kaiser and Reynolds into bitter conflict with the government.|$|R
50|$|Exploration {{activities}} between 1952 and 1960 {{expanded the}} Mount Isa ore reserves from 9.9 {{million tons of}} lead-zinc-silver ore to 25.6 million tons, and from 3.8 million tons of copper ore to 24.2 million tons. As {{a consequence of the}} expansion of reserves, MIM decided to expand production. The quantity of copper produced rose from zero in 1952 to 60,000 tons in 1960, while the lead bullion output increased from about 36,860 t in 1952 to 60,000 t in 1959 and then reduced to 52,000 t in 1960 as a consequence of a decision to reduce output in the face <b>of</b> a <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> lead metal.|$|R
50|$|The country's 2013/2014 coffee crop is {{expected}} to be a bumper harvest of around 17 million to 29.5 million 60-kg bags. Such a large production will add to a <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> beans and will pressure coffee prices which have lost about 10 percent since October 2012. The country's coffee industry has taken a hit; of the 127 local coffee export firms that operated in 2012, 56 have ceased trading or shifted to other businesses after having taken out loans they can't repay. A few firms, such as Vietnam's top coffee exporter the Intimex Group, will benefit from the 2013 harvest. Intimex accounts for a quarter of the country's coffee exports and made $1.2 billion in revenue in 2012.|$|R
40|$|Since around 2000 the {{education}} premium {{and the level}} of employment in high-skill occupations has stagnated, if not actually begun to shrink. This brings into question the generally held view that in advanced countries, while potentially harmful for those who work with their hands, globalization and technological change benefit those who work with their minds. The paper argues that these unexpected labor market trends are the result not so much of autonomous changes in technology as much as they are that of the large power asymmetry between capital and labor that developed in the last few decades. The <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> labor appears to have revived a pattern of skill replacing technological change that is reminiscent of 19 th century capitalism. The relative abundance of cheap labor creates an incentive to chip away whatever component can be routinized from complex tasks that are performed by expensive skilled workers {{so that they can be}} offshored and automated. The paper develops a game theoretical definition of asymmetric power and shows why in labor markets characterized by a structural imbalance between supply and demand, market exchange ceases to be a positive-sum game, and how that can favor skill replacing technological change over one that augments skills. While autonomous innovations determine what non-routine task can at all be transformed into routine ones, the attractiveness of doing so is not independent of major shifts in labor market conditions...|$|R
500|$|In February 1930 Brownlee {{advocated}} a federally {{guaranteed minimum price}} to farmers of $0.70 per bushel of wheat. [...] In November he asked new Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, {{with whom he had}} practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous, to stabilize wheat [...] "at some reasonable price". [...] Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable in the face <b>of</b> a <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> 400 million bushels. [...] Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers, many of whom {{would not be able to}} purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans. [...] Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance, but only quietly and only in the last resort; he was concerned that a well-publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms, knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would. [...] When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks' loans to farmers for binder twine, he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government. [...] To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans, he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter. [...] As he had hoped, this threat enhanced lenders' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers' payments did not even cover interest. [...] Despite these minor successes, Brownlee's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished. [...] It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat, part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply.|$|R
25|$|Substantial {{investments}} {{were made}} in the manufacture of solar panels and wind generators by a number of companies, supported by liberal loans by banks and local governments. However, by 2012 manufacturing capacity had far outstripped domestic and global demand for both products, particularly solar panels, which were subjected to anti-dumping penalties by both the United States and Europe. The <b>global</b> <b>oversupply</b> has resulted in bankruptcies and production cutbacks both inside and outside China. China has budgeted $50 billion to subsidize production of solar power over the two decades following 2015 but, even at the sharply reduced price resulting from <b>oversupply,</b> as <b>of</b> 2012 cost of solar power in China remained three times that of power produced by conventional coal-fired power plants.|$|R

40|$|In recent decennia, a {{substantial}} part of the European labor markets are characterized by an <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> the higher educated. It is suggested that this structural labor market feature can increase job-competition between and within different educational groups and can have negative consequences for the socio-economic position of the lower educated. Hence, to gain more insight into the macro-mechanisms linking education to health, we address the question whether an <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> the higher educated further widens the educational gap in depression. In addition, we pay attention to the influence <b>of</b> <b>oversupply</b> on the mental health of the general population health. Analysis are based on round 3 (2006), 6 (2012) and 7 (2014) of the European Social Survey. The final sample consists of 76. 713 respondents aged between 20 and 65 in 25 European countries. Depression is measured using an eight-item version of the CES-D 8. Since respondents are clustered in countries, we apply random slope multilevel-modelling to answer the research questions. Results from cross-level interactions reveal that an <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> the higher educated does not influence the association between education and mental health implying that an oversupply does not widen the educational gap in depression. Additionally, results show a negative effect <b>of</b> <b>oversupply</b> on the mental health of the general population. This indicates that in countries with an <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> the higher educated, people are experiencing less depressive complaints...|$|R

Electronic patient database in a university-affiliated hospital in Thailand was used. Based on the utilization of top 5 high drug expenditure in 2005, the prevalence and the financial loss <b>of</b> <b>oversupply</b> (medication possession ratio [MPR] > 1. 00) were estimated. In total, 1893 patients were included in this study. The average age was 65. 2 years and the majority were female (56 %). The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>oversupply</b> ranged from 23. 2 % to 62. 8 %, whereas the annual financial loss ranged from US $ 4108 to US $ 10 517. The total amount of loss was US $ 32 903 or 3. 77 % of total medication costs. In summary, {{because of the high}} prevalence and associated high financial loss, <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> medication is a significant financial burden on hospitals and society...|$|R

40|$|There is much {{speculation}} {{regarding the}} contribution of China's changing demography {{to the spread of}} HIV/AIDS. We employ a bio-behavioral macrosimulation model of the heterosexual spread of HIV/AIDS to evaluate the roles that China's unique demographic conditions [...] (1) masculine sex ratios at birth and (2) a population age structure that reflects rapid fertility decline since the 1970 's [...] play in altering the market for sexual partners, thereby potentially fueling an increase in behaviors associated with greater risk of HIV infection. We first simulate the relative contributions of the sex ratio at birth and the population age structure to the <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> males in the market for sexual partners and show that the sex ratio at birth only aggravates the severe <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> males which is primarily a consequence of the population age structure. We then examine the potential consequences of this demographic distortion for the spread of HIV infection and show that, to the extent that males adapt to the dearth of suitable female partners by seeking unprotected sexual contacts with female sex workers, the impact <b>of</b> the <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> males in the sexual partnership market on the spread of HIV will be severe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the nature and}} extent of undersupply and the economic consequences <b>of</b> <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> medication among non-adherent patients. Methods: This study used copies of repeat prescriptions (=multiple dispensations), collected during 1 week in 2002 at 16 Swedish community pharmacies. For patients with a refill adherence below 80 %, treatment gaps were defined as the number of days they had no drug available. The cost <b>of</b> drug <b>oversupply</b> (i. e., refill adherence > 120 %) was calculated from the prices of the drug packages dispensed. Results: The number of collected repeat prescriptions was 3, 636. The median of treatment gaps among patients with a refill adherence below 80 % was 53 days per 90 - 100 days treatment period and the corresponding median for oversupply was 40 days. The cost <b>of</b> <b>oversupply</b> for exempt patients (i. e., patients who have paid 1, 800 SEK (196 euro; US$ 243) per year for medicines) was 32, 000 SEK (3, 500 euro; US$ 4, 300) higher than for non-exempt patients. An extrapolation to all Sweden indicates that exemption from charges leads to an additional <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> about 142 million SEK (15 million euro; US$ 19 million) per year above that of non-exempt patients. Conclusion: Both undersupply and <b>oversupply</b> <b>of</b> prescribed medicines are common in Sweden. Patients with a refill adherence below 80 % seem to have less than half of the prescribed treatment available. Oversupply or drug stockpiling occurs more frequently among exempt than among non-exempt patients, and this oversupply leads to high unnecessary costs...|$|R
