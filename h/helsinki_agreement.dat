When the memorandum of understanding between the Government of Indonesia (GoI) and GAM (Free Aceh Movement) was finally signed on August 15, 2005, in <b>Helsinki,</b> Finland. The <b>agreement</b> brought an end to the nearly thirty years of bloody armed conflict that claimed 15, 000 lives, displaced tens of thousands and impacted the whole country economically, as well as politically.

Many believed that GAM had to be eliminated by employing military operations. The military options, however, proved ineffective to eliminate rebellion. Instead, the military abuses and resource exploitation have only increased the GAM's public support. The <b>Helsinki</b> peace <b>agreement</b> appears to have a better chance to put an end to the separatist conflict in Aceh. This win-win solution settlement has so far worked well.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War British-Romanian relations were strained, marked by accusations of espionage directed towards Britain’s diplomats and requests for recalls. The British Government reacted moderately to these, acquiescing to recall their diplomats but refusing to concede to the Romanians when it came to their ‘flimsy’ accusations. Negotiation was preferred to reprisals especially when certain Britons had to be rescued from the Communists’ hands. In one respect Britain was not that indulgent: when money was involved, particularly the assets of oil companies nationalized in 1948. Trade remained a priority for both the British and Romanian governments. After laborious negotiations, a trade agreement was signed in 1960 and the ascendant trend continued into the 1970 s when Harold Wilson and Nicolae Ceausescu established a close relation. Britain’s interest in Romania was defined at this juncture as being firstly political, mercantile and cultural, indicated in order of priority. As far as Romania remained a ‘thorn’ in the Soviet Union’s back, a means to reach the remote Chinese or a mediator between various sides of the world in conflict, politics was priority. Trade remained an issue for both parties. Cultural relations were almost nonexistent for the duration of this period. Concern for human rights, <b>Helsinki</b> <b>agreements</b> notwithstanding, focused entirely on the predicament of a few persons who wished to marry or to reunite with their family in Britain. When political interest in Romania declined in the 1980 s, Britain’s economic interest still remained. Relations between Britain and the Ceausescu’ Romania remained strong until the Revolution of 1989 that swept away Ceausescu and the Communist regime. Although Ceausescu’s policies of national assertion abroad, and promises, censorship and repression inside, had produced a seemingly a stable state, neither Ceausescu nor London, had grasped that a changing background in Eastern Europe would challenge the existence of the Romanian Communist regime. Once renowned for an assertive foreign policy, Romania was again in the spot of world at the end of 1989, this time for having executed its dictator and bloodily ending a regime...|$|R

40|$|The {{differences}} in the international responses to the violent conflicts in East Timor (1998 – 1999), Maluku (1999 – 2003) and Aceh (1998 – 2005) are examined in this research. Given the growing acceptance {{of the significance of}} {{the use of military force}} for humanitarian purposes, the humanitarian crises in Maluku and Aceh might prima facie have justified humanitarian intervention similar to that in East Timor. By analysing the differences from the Indonesia’s domestic political point of view it is clear that the conscience-shocking situation caused by the violent conflicts was not the compelling factor for the international community to militarily intervene. The deployment of a multinational force in East Timor (INTERFET) was decided only after the UN and foreign major countries believed that such military intervention would not jeopardize the ongoing process of democratization in Indonesia. This suggested that Indonesia’s domestic circumstance was central to whether a similar measure in Maluku and Aceh would take place or not. Due to the reformasi (political reform) in Indonesia within which the independence of East Timor took place, two main changes within Indonesian politics, namely the growing sentiment of anti-international intervention and the continuing democratization process, helped to ensure that humanitarian intervention in the two other regions did not happen. These two conditions were fortified by the increasingly consolidated democratic politics which brought the communal conflict in Maluku to the Malino Peace Agreement. The emergence of a stronger and democratic government in Indonesia, furthermore, made cooperation with the international community possible in seeking a peaceful resolution to the armed conflict in Aceh. By involving the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI) the government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) agreed to the <b>Helsinki</b> peace <b>agreement</b> and accepted the role of the Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM) to secure its implementation. Thus, a strong democratic government made an international military intervention for humanitarian purposes unnecessary...|$|R

This article is based on a multiparametric stochastic model we introduced in 2004, as combination of a statistical part, describing an array of buildings randomly distributed at the terrain, and a waveguide model, describing a grid of straight streets with buildings along them. Joint signal power distributions in azimuth-time delay and elevation-azimuth planes are obtained and compared to high-resolution 3 -D measurements carried out in downtown <b>Helsinki.</b> A good <b>agreement</b> between theoretical predictions and the measurements is obtained basically, and also regarding the wave-guiding effect and antenna height dependencies. A satisfactory physical explanation, which accounts for the character of the specific building topography, the height and tilt of the antennas, is found. Finally, we present a numerical experiment of changing the base station antenna height, its directivity, and tilt. By this we show that the proposed stochastic approach allows to predict and control a-priori main parameters of smart antenna based only on knowledge of specific features of built-up terrain.

40|$|This report {{details the}} aim, history, {{activities}} and {{outcomes of the}} Aceh Peace Process Follow- Up Project, and provides a set of recommendations on how the process can successfully be continued. Crisis Management Initiative (CMI) concluded in 2009 that an invigorated, systematic and constructive dialogue process was needed to achieve a satisfactory implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which had been signed in 2005 in Helsinki by the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). Consequently, CMI initiated the Aceh Peace Process Follow-Up Project, which was made possible through {{the support of the}} European Union. In the course of the project, President Ahtisaari, chairman of CMI and the mediator of the <b>Helsinki</b> peace <b>agreement,</b> provided an advising role that helped to keep the follow-up process on track. To achieve the goal of establishing an effective dialogue mechanism between the signatories of the MoU, CMI advised the parties on a structured approach and provided expertise on thematic areas related to unimplemented MoU issues. In addition, CMI maintained a regular dialogue with the provincial government and parliament of Aceh, and held consultations with representatives of civil society organisations. The project has been able to witness the development of a process entitled “Focus Group Discussions” designed to address the implementation of the MoU commitments, initiated by the Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs and its Aceh Desk. Until now, four of these meetings have been held, attended by CMI’s country coordinator as an observer. The FGD meetings have assumed the format of an institutionalised process owned by the signatories of the MoU. The report details the provisions of the MoU that remain yet to be dealt with by the parties. These include deviations of the Law on the Governing of Aceh (LoGA) from the MoU and the unimplemented MoU provisions. It is suggested that an evaluation of the six years of implementation of the Law of Governing Aceh could provide an important input for a possible process leading to an amendment of the law and allowing the concerns and grievances to be taken up in a systematic fashion. It is the aim that most of these aspects, if not all, will be successively dealt with in the FGD by 2014. The report also considers some important influencing factors for sustaining peace in Aceh. These include the need for a strong civil society, with whom the local government should regularly have consultations; strengthening of the economy; continued support for women empowerment in political life: and the continued development of a healthy, reformed security sector. In conclusion, President Ahtisaari and CMI remain encouraged by the achievements so far and commend the parties’ willingness to engage in a constructive manner towards resolving the open issues. With the project, CMI is concluding its role in supporting the peace process, while encouraging all parties to continue constructive collaboration on the promising path to sustained peace in Aceh...|$|R
40|$|Acehnese voters {{registered}} clear displeasure {{with the}} ruling Partai Aceh in national legislative elections, argues this report. Overview The 9 April 2014 legislative elections in Aceh produced three surprises. First, voters sent {{a strong message}} of displeasure to the ruling Partai Aceh (PA), the party controlled by leaders of the former rebel Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka, GAM). PA still came out on top but with significantly reduced percentages in its east coast strongholds. Second, its major competition came not from a rival GAM-led local party but from national parties, particularly the newcomer NasDem. And third, despite its alliance with PA, Gerindra, the party of Prabowo Subianto, proved weaker than expected. In the provincial legislature (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Aceh, DPRA), Partai Aceh dropped from 33 out of 69 seats to 29 out of 81 seats, or a drop from 47. 8 per cent to just under 36 per cent. The drop was particularly striking given the party’s perceived control over the electoral machinery and widespread allegations of fraud in the counting process—factors that many Acehnese saw as {{more important than the}} violence that marred the campaign period. Partai Aceh’s most serious opponent proved not to be the local Partai Nasional Aceh, as expected, but national parties. NasDem made a particularly strong showing, benefiting from being fresh and untainted by previous involvement in government. It also had good candidates, lots of money, and an Acehnese at the top, media magnate Surya Paloh. NasDem and Golkar each secured nine DPRA seats, while the National Mandate Party (Partai Amanat Nasional, PAN) received eight, up from five in 2009. PNA only received three after a poorly resourced and disorganised campaign, as well as intimidation of its supporters by PA sympathisers. Gerindra, the party of presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, which entered into an alliance with Partai Aceh in 2013, did worse than expected, securing only two seats from Aceh in the national parliament. It had targeted six. In 2009, President Yudhoyono’s Partai Demokrat had a similar alliance with PA and won seven. There appears to be no enthusiasm in Aceh for Prabowo as president, but with Partai Aceh’s backing, he will almost certainly do better than Jakarta governor Jokowi in the July 2014 presidential contest, if not with the extraordinary numbers that Yudhoyono received in 2009 — 93. 2 per cent of the vote. Jokowi’s Indonesian Democratic Struggle Party (Partai Demokrasi Indonesia-Perjuangan, PDIP) is widely seen as hostile toward Aceh, since its leadership formally objected to several points of the 2005 <b>Helsinki</b> peace <b>agreement.</b> It does not help that the one PDIP leader elected to the national parliament in these elections, Tagore Abubakar, is known for his leadership of a movement that wants to carve a new province out of Aceh. That said, Jokowi himself seems to have a reasonably positive image and could attract both voters who want a new face and those in the anyone-but-Prabowo camp. It could also help that he lived in Takengon, Central Aceh from 1985 to 1989 as a businessman and knows the province well. Women candidates did better this time at the provincial level, with three women elected from PA, as opposed to one in 2009, and the percentage of women in the DPRA rising from 7. 25 per cent in 2009 to 14. 8 per cent in 2014. The percentage of women elected to district councils was only 8. 8 per cent. With PA’s reduced but still strong showing, its leaders could go one of two ways over the next five years. They could take this vote as a warning that voters want change and work more seriously to improve social services, protect forests, clean up corruption, end extortion and generally improve governance.

40|$|The {{decision}} of the Aceh provincial government to adopt the banner of the former rebel Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka, GAM) as its official provincial flag is testing the limits of autonomy, irritating Jakarta, heightening ethnic and political tensions, reviving a campaign for the division of Aceh and raising fears of violence as a national election approaches in 2014. On 25 March 2013, the provincial legislature adopted a regulation (qanun) making the GAM’s old banner the provincial flag. It was immediately signed by Governor Zaini Abdullah. The governor and deputy governor are members of Partai Aceh, the political party set up by former rebel leaders in 2008 that also controls the legislature. The central government, seeing the flag as a separatist symbol and thus in violation of national law, immediately raised objections and asked for changes. Partai Aceh leaders, seeing the flag as a potent tool for mass mobilisation in 2014, have refused, arguing that it cannot be a separatist symbol if GAM explicitly recognised Indonesian sovereignty {{as part of the}} <b>Helsinki</b> peace <b>agreement</b> in 2005 that ended a nearly 30 -year insurgency. Partai Aceh believes that if it remains firm, Jakarta will eventually concede, as it did in 2012 over an election dispute. Indonesian President Yudhoyono’s government is torn. On the one hand, it does not want a fight with the GAM leaders; the 2005 peace agreement is the most important achievement of a president who, in his final term, is very much concerned about his legacy. It also is unwilling to provoke GAM too far, fearful that it will return to conflict, a fear many in Aceh discount as unwarranted but one that Partai Aceh has exploited with relish. On the other hand, it {{does not want to be}} branded as anti-nationalist as the 2014 election looms, especially as some in the security forces remain convinced that GAM has not given up the goal of independence and is using democratic means to pursue it. The president and his advisers also know that if they allow the GAM flag to fly, it will have repercussions in Papua, where dozens of pro-independence activists remain jailed for flying the “Morning Star” flag of the independence movement. GAM leaders see little to lose by standing their ground. The flag is a hugely emotive symbol, and defying Jakarta is generally a winning stance locally. Some individual members of parliament see it as a way of regaining waning popularity for failing to deliver anything substantive to their constituencies. Also, Partai Aceh took a controversial decision to partner with Gerindra, the party of former army General Pra­bo­wo Subianto, for the 2014 election. Leaders like Muzakir Manaf, deputy governor and former commander of GAM’s armed wing, may want to use the flag issue to show they have not compromised their principles by allying with a man whose human rights record is often questioned. Within Aceh, adoption of the GAM flag has sparked protests from non-Acehnese ethnic groups in the central highlands and south west. The GAM heartland has always been along the east coast; to highlanders like the Gayo, the flag thus represents the domination of the coastal Acehnese at their expense. The issue has revived a dor­mant campaign for the division of Aceh into three by the creation of two new provinces, Aceh Leuser Antara (ALA) for the central highlands and Aceh Barat Selatan (ABAS) for the south west. If GAM does not back down on the flag, support for that campaign by the intelligence services is likely to rise, and with it, the probability of increased ethnic tensions. The options for breaking the stalemate seem to be as follows: the government concedes; GAM concedes, making slight changes to the flag by adding or removing an element; GAM agrees to limits on how or where the flag can be displayed; or the dispute is taken to the Supreme Court, thereby delaying any resolution. In the meantime, the power of the GAM machinery in Aceh continues to grow...|$|R
