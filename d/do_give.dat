25|$|Most of Coleridge's juvenalia was posthumously published. Those written {{while he}} {{attended}} Christ's Hospitals were imitations of conventional models of poetry {{during the late}} 18th-century. In particular, he focused on John Milton's L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, and his Lycidas, along with the poems of Collins, Gray, and Thomson. In terms of form, Coleridge relied on many abstract nouns that he would mark with capitalisation, and his nouns were constantly modified {{with a set of}} two adjectives. He did not start working with his own poetic form until 1794. Although they don't provide a sense of where Coleridge developed his poetry later, the school-age poems <b>do</b> <b>give</b> insight into Coleridge's thoughts and feelings during those years.|$|E

25|$|Engagement {{in social}} media {{for the purpose of}} a social media {{strategy}} is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content (digital photos, digital videos, text) and conversations, as well as the sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging Traditional media such as TV news shows are limited to one-way interaction with customers or 'push and tell' where only specific information is given to the customer with few or limited mechanisms to obtain customer feedback. Traditional media such as paper newspapers, of course, <b>do</b> <b>give</b> readers the option of sending a letter to the editor, but this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open, as participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer (or citizen).|$|E

500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I <b>do</b> <b>give.</b> So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said that it [...] "contains some superb touching character scenes between Homer and Lisa, a fascinating glimpse of Marge's insecurities, and some nice touches that take it above the show's very high average." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "Bart on the Road" [...] is an episode which is built upon a [...] "frankly ludicrous" [...] idea which if the writers were to [...] "stumble upon" [...] now, [...] "we'd simply see Bart happen upon a license and skip town without anyone noticing, but here they <b>do</b> <b>give</b> the setup {{a great deal of}} consideration {{both on and off the}} screen." [...] He thought the story was [...] "partly believable, though the opportunity when Bart hits the road is largely wasted with only a few well constructed jokes to speak of." [...] Foster thinks, [...] "what saves the episode is the opportunity to see Lisa and Homer connect, once again displaying what a strong season this is for Lisa as we see the two share some wonderfully tender moments, alongside some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and said that he [...] "loves" [...] the children's experiences at their parents' jobs, adding, [...] "and when they head out of town, the fun continues. Any episode that sends the kids to the site of the World's Fair is OK by me." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Patty and Selma explain their job at the DMV: [...] "Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays." [...] Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B+. John Thorpe of Central Michigan Life named it the eighth best episode of the series. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a score of 9.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "outstanding" [...] and summarizing his review with: [...] ""Bart on the Road" [...] is a fun trip and very funny, but it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable." ...|$|E

The Appendices to The Lord of the Rings <b>do</b> <b>give</b> Gimli's and Aragorn's birthdates: {{at the time of}} the War of the Ring, they are 139 and 87 respectively. [...] Though his father and his kingdom appear in The Hobbit, Legolas does not appear himself, as his character had not yet been created.

2500|$|The Roddick Foundation is an {{organisation}} {{founded by}} Anita Roddick.

The organization has been described as [...] "a front for Taliban enthusiasts and al Qaida devotees that fraudulently presents itself a human rights group". The Network for Social Change gave a non-charitable grant of £15,000 in 2008. Both entities agreed to cease funding CAGE {{at the request of the}} Charity Commission, which has expressed concern that funding CAGE risked damaging public confidence in charity. Lord Carlile, formerly the British Government’s independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said: [...] "I would never advise anybody to give money to CagePrisoners.

2500|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} offered for Yale's representation in national elections {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating [...] "a laboratory for future leaders," [...] an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster. Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>give</b> very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale." [...] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes [...] "an ethos of organized activity" [...] at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News. Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: [...] "It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." [...] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the [...] "son and grandson of alumni", and for a [...] "member of a politically influential family". New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.|$|E
