5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E

5|$|Ibrox Park had {{the worst}} fan safety record in Britain before its {{complete}} redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular, often overcrowded, and very steep exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters' coaches. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to yet affect football in Britain happened on Stairway 13 after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back {{when they heard the}} roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling in the same direction when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} a comprehensive description of upper eyelid movement in normal human subjects. Using the magnetic search coil technique to monitor lid position and modified skin electrodes to record orbicularis oculi electromyographic (EMG) activity, {{the authors found}} that the basic eyelid movements, blinks, and saccadic lid movements, can be uniquely and reliably characterized by their amplitude-maximum velocity relationships. The data show that similar increases in levator palpebrae activity produce the upward lid movements that accompany upward saccadic eye movements {{as well as the}} upward phase of a blink. The lid movements that accompany downward saccadic eye movements arise almost exclusively from the passive <b>downward</b> <b>forces</b> and relaxation of the levator palpebrae muscle. In contrast, active orbicularis oculi contraction and the passive <b>downward</b> <b>forces</b> act together to generate lid closure with a blink. These normative data and techniques provide the basis for the clinical analysis of lid motility by which abnormal lid movements can be compared with normal lid kinematics.

25|$|In a {{different}} gravitational field, for example, {{on the surface}} of the Moon, an object can have a significantly different weight than on Earth. The gravity {{on the surface of}} the Moon is only about one-sixth as strong as {{on the surface of the}} Earth. A one-kilogram mass is still a one-kilogram mass (as mass is an extrinsic property of the object) but the <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> due to gravity, and therefore its weight, is only one-sixth of what the object would have on Earth. So a man of mass 180 pounds weighs only about 30 pounds-force when visiting the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called thermal stress weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E
50|$|When {{a parcel}} is unstable, it will {{continue}} to move vertically, in either direction, dependent on whether it receives upward or <b>downward</b> <b>forcing,</b> until it reaches a stable layer (though momentum, gravity, and other forcing may cause the parcel to continue). There are multiple types of CAPE, downdraft CAPE (DCAPE), estimates the potential strength of rain and evaporatively cooled downdrafts. Other types of CAPE may depend on the depth being considered. Other examples are surface based CAPE (SBCAPE), mixed layer or mean layer CAPE (MLCAPE), most unstable or maximum usable CAPE (MUCAPE), and normalized CAPE (NCAPE).|$|R

Then the object {{will be subject to}} a net <b>downward</b> gravitational <b>force.</b> Compare this with the net <b>downward</b> gravitational <b>force</b> on an equal volume of the fluid. If the object is less dense than the fluid, the difference between these two vectors is an upward pointing vector, the buoyant force, and the object will rise.

25|$|Early designs {{including}} Siemens, Westinghouse, and Combustion Engineering had {{a mostly}} can-like shape built with reinforced concrete. As concrete {{has a very}} good compression strength compared to tensile, this is a logical design for the building materials since the extremely heavy top part of containment exerts a large <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> that prevents some tensile stress if containment pressure were to suddenly go up. As reactor designs have evolved, many nearly spherical containment designs for PWRs have also been constructed. Depending on the material used, this is the most apparently logical design because a sphere is the best structure for simply containing a large pressure. Most current PWR designs involve some combination of the two, with a cylindrical lower part and a half-spherical top.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong was {{responsible}} for developing the hydraulic accumulator. Where water pressure was not available on site {{for the use of}} hydraulic cranes, Armstrong often built high water towers to provide a supply of water at pressure. However, when supplying cranes for use at New Holland on the Humber Estuary, he was unable to do this because the foundations consisted of sand. After much careful thought he produced the weighted accumulator, a cast-iron cylinder fitted with a plunger supporting a very heavy weight. The plunger would slowly be raised, drawing in water, until the <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> of the weight was sufficient to force the water below it into pipes at great pressure. The accumulator was a very significant, if unspectacular, invention, which found many applications in the following years.|$|E
25|$|The above example {{can be used}} {{to explain}} why the Eötvös effect starts {{diminishing}} when an object is travelling westward as its tangential speed increases above Earth's rotation (465m/s). If the westward train in the above example increases speed, part of the force of gravity that pushes against the track accounts for the centripetal force needed to keep it in circular motion on the inertial frame. Once the train doubles its westward speed at 930m/s that centripetal force becomes equal to the force the train experiences when it stops. From the inertial frame, in both cases it rotates at the same speed but in the opposite directions. Thus, the force is the same cancelling completely the Eötvös effect. Any object that moves westward at a speed above 930m/s experiences an upward force instead. In the figure, the Eötvös effect is illustrated for a 10 kilogram object on the train at different speeds. The parabolic shape is because the centripetal force is proportional to the square of the tangential speed. On the inertial frame, the bottom of the parabola is centered at the origin. The offset is because this argument uses the Earth's rotating frame of reference. The graph shows that the Eötvös effect is not symmetrical, and that the resulting <b>downward</b> <b>force</b> experienced by an object that travels west at high velocity is less than the resulting upward force when it travels east at the same speed.|$|E
5000|$|The above {{processes}} specifically {{relied on}} the destabilization of the sub-cloud layer due to adiabatic or latent heating effects. Discounting the thermodynamical effects of hydrometeor fallout, another mechanism proposes that dynamics of the fallout alone are enough to create the lobes. Inhomogeneities in the masses of the hydrometeors along the cloud-base may cause inhomogeneous descent along the base. Frictional drag and associated eddy-like structures create the lobed appearance of the fallout. The main shortcoming of this theory is that vertical velocities in the lobes have been observed to be greater than the fall speeds of the hydrometeors within them; thus, {{there should be a}} dynamical <b>downward</b> <b>forcing,</b> as well.|$|R
40|$|A model, {{in which}} {{dissolved}} ions migrate through water films surrounding mineral grains to sites of reaction, predicts the geologically rapid {{occurrence of the}} gabbro-eclogite phase change in the earth's mantle at temperatures less than 600 – 800 °C. In a water-undersaturated mantle, interstices within the rock can contain water vapor in equilibrium with small amounts of hydrous phases such as chlorite, tremolite or talc and {{in the presence of}} other gases such as CO_ 2, at H_ 2 O pressures less than the lithostatic pressure of the rock. The solubility of ions in this interstitial water vapor is strongly dependent on pressure and is the rate-limiting process in the model; reaction occurs rapidly if the water pressure is at least 0. 5 – 1 kbar. The 5 km of oceanic gabbroic crust can transform to eclogite upon subduction into the mantle at depths of several tens of kilometers, depending on the rate of heating of the descending crustal material {{and the nature of the}} minor hydrous phases present.

To address how a tray could right itself {{at the moment of}} impending tilt, Grieve, a first-time inventor with a university background in 'History of film and photography', developed a finger receiver attached to the bottom of a wait tray based on first-principle physics, load dispersal, and counter movement. In a closed position, the finger receiver lays flush with the bottom of the wait tray so that the tray can sit on the surface of a bar or table without wobbling and can be stacked onto other trays. When the device is open, two slots can be accessed into which a waitperson may secure their two inside fingers, similar to how a flip-flop structurally attaches itself between the toes of the foot to counter the large stresses place upon it. The Safetray product's arrangement creates a strong cantilever advantage for the waitperson to allow them additional control over torque caused by items placed in various locations around the tray. The stability achieved with the Safetray product allows a waitperson to place a bottle of wine right {{at the edge of the}} tray while still keeping the tray in a horizontal position by reacting instinctively against the bottle's off-balance <b>downward</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

At the end of each glacial period when the glaciers retreated, the removal of the weight from the depressed land led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the return flow of mantle material back under the deglaciated area. Due to the extreme viscosity of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an equilibrium level.|$|R

Seismic displacement data related to the 1946 Nankaido earthquake are modeled in terms of a thick elastic plate overlying a fluidlike substratum.

The single distal locking row in the distal radius plates used in these studies are meant to buttress the articular surface of the distal radius in a raft fashion, with all the screws pointing in the same direction. The most significant complication described by these studies was pull-out of the plate when the plate had too little grip in a small or osteoporotic lateral fragment. Some authors advise suture augmentation of the coracoclavicular ligaments or coracoclavicular fixation in such cases [7, 9].
