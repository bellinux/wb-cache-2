5000|$|The vans {{could be}} {{equipped}} with either 5-passenger or 7-passenger seating, as with the previous generation. A new feature for 1991 was available [...] "Quad Command" [...] seating, in which two bucket seats replaced the center bench, which was optional on SE and up trims. Also optional were [...] "integrated child safety seats", in which the center part of the seats folded out to form a child safety seat with its own <b>integral</b> <b>seat</b> belt system. The Town & Country was only available with 7 passenger seating. Other new features included available All-wheel drive, an optional Bendix Anti-lock brakes system, and a driver's side airbag. As with the previous generation, the Chrysler Town & Country came standard with all the available options from the Caravan/Voyager, as well as unique features such as tufted leather seats, an Infinity sound system and a digital instrument cluster. It came standard with woodgrain panels on the side until 1992, when a no-cost woodgrain delete option which {{replaced it with a}} gold pinstripe, was introduced. The Dodge Caravan was exported to Europe, where it was sold as the Chrysler Voyager.|$|E
40|$|Human-engineering {{approach}} {{was used to}} design <b>integral</b> <b>seat</b> which provides all the safety, comfort, and protective features that can possibly be afforded airline passengers. Results of dynamic impact testing indicated that seat can withstand and attenuate gravity loads of 21 -g horizontal and 45 -g vertical; by design, seat will withstand lateral g's as well...|$|E
25|$|The quadruplication project, however, was continued. Track layouts were {{produced}} by the Permanent Way and Works team, Graceville being drawn in 1955. To accommodate the new works at this station, a number of partial resumptions were undertaken in Appel Street, where two houses and the house/shop {{on the corner of}} Verney Avenue were moved east on their allotments. Railway plans indicate a very busy shopping precinct along the opposite roadway, Honour Avenue. The new station layout allowed for one wide suburban island platform, on which a new station building and two awnings with <b>integral</b> <b>seating</b> were to be built, and one narrow main-line island platform, which was to house two awnings with more <b>integral</b> <b>seating.</b> The station structures were designed to fit the layouts.|$|R
50|$|Modern engines have {{cylinder}} heads made of either iron or aluminum. Iron {{cylinder heads}} most often have <b>integral</b> iron valve <b>seats.</b> These seats are the softest and most susceptible to wear among modern engine. Aluminum cylinder heads, however, have hardened steel valve seats, as aluminum {{would make a}} very poor seat. These hardened steel seats are significantly better than the <b>integral</b> <b>seats</b> of an iron head, and can be relatively easily removed and replaced if needed. If an <b>integral</b> iron <b>seat</b> needs to be replaced, the seat must be milled to allow the insert of a new seat. The new seat is then installed with application of a high-strength metal glue/adhesive. Once installed, the seat is ground to the correct angle and width.|$|R
5000|$|Pergolas are {{sometimes}} confused with arbours, and the terms {{are often used}} interchangeably. An arbour (or arbor in American English) is generally regarded as a wooden bench seat with a roof, usually enclosed by lattice panels forming a framework for climbing plants. A pergola, on the other hand, is a much larger and more open structure and does not normally include <b>integral</b> <b>seating.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "striking" [...] and [...] "spectacular" [...] {{restaurant}} section, {{added as}} part of the [...] "famous facelift" [...] of 1928, has been described as [...] "reminiscent of the Viennese Secession". [...] The three-bay exterior is framed by a two-storey gold and blue mosaic with gold lettering at the top, reading [...] and [...] The dado has gold Masonic symbols, and the lettering at the top is framed by two Stars of David; below these, there are a pair of gold figures in the form of chimera, with a griffin- or fish-style head and a curved body like that of a seahorse. [...] Below the mosaic frame, a two-storey glazed bronze screen with metal framing leads to a recessed doorway. Some of the glass is leaded with sunburst forms. Paired bronze lamp-holders project from the entrance. [...] At second-floor level, there is a modern three-part window. [...] Inside, much of Denman & Son's Art Deco work survives. There are moulded beams and friezes with swag motifs, <b>integral</b> <b>seating</b> and other furniture, Art Deco lighting, decorative plasterwork and an original staircase.|$|R
50|$|Black Diamond Square—named {{after the}} Black Diamond Hotel—is the main {{intersection}} of Port Adelaide, {{at the north}} end of Commercial Road. The hotel was designed by Adelaide architect William Wier. It opened as the White Horse Cellars Inn in 1851, with an <b>integral</b> 600 <b>seat</b> theatre. Parts of the building were used for an early freemason hall, library and the Port Adelaide Institute. It was renamed as the Family Hotel in 1876, then as the Black Diamond Hotel c. 1878. This last name came from the Black Diamond Line shipping company. From 1866-1883 Cannon brand beer was brewed in the hotel. The building was converted to retail shops in 1884 and the Central Hotel erected on the south side.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Shark {{is formed}} with <b>integral</b> fin, <b>seat</b> backs, floors and instrument panel. [...] The fin, set forward so the rudder trailing edge {{is above the}} elevator hinge line, is shaped like a shark's back fin, strongly swept and with a curved leading edge. There is also a small ventral fin. From the fin forward the upper fuselage line rises rapidly to merge into that of the side hinged, single piece canopy. There is a big baggage space behind the cockpit. Both of the adjustable tandem seats have flight controls; the Shark is flown by a sidestick. It {{is powered by a}} [...] Rotax 912ULS or [...] Rotax 914 turbocharged powerplant, driving a three-blade or a two-blade propeller. The Shark UL has retractable gear and a variable-pitch propeller.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept was}} {{fitted with a}} four-cylinder {{turbocharged}} engine rated , front wheel drive system, dual-clutch automatic transmission, diamond-look grille from the 2011 Concept A-Class, Alubeam body colour, headlamps shining red at standby mode, indicators with individual points of light up in succession, 21-inch wheels with perforated pins on the spokes, frameless side windows, panoramic sunroof, metallic-red colouring taillights, instrument panel upholstered in white nubuck leather, anthracite-coloured Alcantara on the upper section of the instrument panel, suede on the sports steering wheel, chrome trim elements and control panels in black anodised finish, surfaces around the HMI control panel in glossy shimmer of black anodised aluminium, four <b>integral</b> bucket <b>seats</b> with four integrated head restraints from Sport version of the W176 A-Class, and air vents in the instrument panel from the 2011 Concept A-Class.|$|R

25|$|Epoxy, metal-filled epoxy, and metal-coated epoxy is {{used for}} tooling that has an EOL {{in the tens of}} {{thousands}} of parts. It is typically used for molding flexible foam cushions and <b>seating,</b> <b>integral</b> skin and microcellular foam padding, and shallow-draft RIM bezels and fascia. The heat transfer characteristic of epoxy tooling is fair; the heat transfer characteristic of metal-filled and metal-coated epoxy is good. Copper tubing can be incorporated into the body of the tool, allowing hot water to circulate and heat the mold surface.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1918, Brough {{announced}} they would be initially concentrating production on their 3.5 hp (489cc) flat-twin motorcycle. This was bench tested at 14 bhp at 4200rpm, and it would go to 5600rpm, which was quite high but was guaranteed by George Brough 'to the extent of £100'. The engine had detachable heads with the valve <b>seats</b> <b>integral</b> and the rockers 'enclosed in neat aluminium cases'. Light aluminium pistons, roller bearing crankshaft, and two ball bearing mounted camshafts, are further indications of development work during the war.|$|R
50|$|For certain {{applications}} {{the valve}} stem and disk {{are made of}} different steel alloys, or the valve stem may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer. Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel valve seat inserts, where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed <b>integral</b> valve <b>seats</b> in the past. Because the valve stem extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against blow-by to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the stem to valve clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the induction stroke, and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|R
