5|$|The 2012 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} on June 22–23, 2012, at the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the first round, the Canucks drafted Brendan Gaunce, a two-way centre with size. Leading up to the draft, Gaunce was ranked 13th among North American skaters by the NHL's {{scouting}} department, and was the top-ranked Canadian forward. Projected to be a mid-first round pick, he dipped slightly to 26 where he was selected by the Canucks. General Manager Mike Gillis stated that going into the draft, they had targeted Gaunce, {{and if he had}} not been available, Vancouver would <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> down to add extra picks.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> guard Kareem Rush to the Charlotte Bobcats for two future {{second round}} draft picks (Ronny Turiaf and Patrick Beverly).

Atlanta Hawks acquired centers Michael Doleac (from the New York Knicks) and Joel Przybilla (from the Milwaukee Bucks), along with a 2005 second-round pick from the Knicks (Ronny Turiaf), while sending center Nazr Mohammed to the Knicks in the three-way trade.|$|E

The Spaniards restricted the activities of the Chinese and confined them to the Parián which was located near Intramuros. Most of the Chinese residents earned their livelihood as traders.|$|E

25|$|In September 2013, {{the group}} {{confirmed}} it had {{reached an agreement}} to sell 314 branches to the Corsair consortium, made up of private equity firms {{and a number of}} institutional investors, including the Church Commissioners, which controls the property and investment assets of the Church of England. The branches, incorporating 250,000 small business customers, 1,200 medium business customers and 1.8 million personal banking customers, were due to be separated from the group in 2016 as a standalone business. The planned company would <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> as an ethical bank, using the dormant Williams & Glyn's brand.|$|E
25|$|The Phoenicians {{are known}} to <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> with the {{resident}} Oestrimni and related tribes. The harbour of the Mar da Palha (Sea of Straw), a large basin in the estuary of the River Tagus near the river's mouth, is the best natural port on the Atlantic coast of Portugal, stretching 23km at its widest point. This {{would have made it}} an ideal location for a settlement to unload and reprovision Phoenician ships sailing on trade voyages. Legend tells that they sailed to Cornwall in Britain and the legendary Tin Islands, or Cassiterides, to buy tin from the natives, but this is unsubstantiated.|$|E

25|$|Most of Nicaragua's Caribbean {{lowlands}} {{area was}} inhabited by tribes that migrated north {{from what is}} now Colombia.

Food was obtained by hunting, fishing, and slash-and-burn agriculture. Crops like cassava and pineapples were the staple foods. The people of eastern Nicaragua appear to <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> with and been influenced by the native peoples of the Caribbean, as round thatched huts and canoes, both typical of the Caribbean, were common in eastern Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|In three days, {{however, the}} Harriman-Hill imbroglio managed to {{wreak havoc on}} the stock market. Northern Pacific stock was quoted at $150 a share on May 6, and is {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> as much as $1,000 a share behind the scenes. Harriman and Hill now worked to settle the issue for brokers to avoid panic. Hill, for his part, attempted to avoid future stock raids by placing his holdings in the Northern Securities Company, a move which would be undone by the Supreme Court in 1904 {{under the auspices of}} the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Harriman was not immune either; he was forced to break up his holdings in the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroad a few years later.|$|E
25|$|He {{was again}} called {{up for the}} Australian team prior to Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2015. Despite his {{presence}} in the team as consultant, Australia couldn't win {{any of the three}} Test matches, and lost the series 3–0. The Murali's acceptance of the rival side made a huge controversy throughout the country and Sri Lanka Cricket and Muralitharan <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> caustic verbal blows following an altercation between Murali and the Sri Lanka team manager. The Head of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala warned Muralitharan for attempting to coach the Australian team, the team which gave more pressure to Muralitharan in the past due to his bowling actions.Muralitharan also said that the team which was totally against him now called him to coach them to play against Sri Lanka was a big victory in his career.|$|E

25|$|After the Civil War, General Robert E. Lee {{turned down}} several financially tantalizing offers of {{employment}} that would merely <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> on his name, and instead accepted the post of college president for three reasons. First, he had been superintendent of the United States Military Academy on the Hudson River at West Point, New York, so supervising higher education was in his background. Second, and more important, he {{believed that it was}} a position in which he could actually make a contribution to the reconciliation of the nation. Third, the Washington family were his in-laws: his wife was the great-granddaughter of Martha Washington, and Lee had long looked on George Washington as a hero and role model, so {{it is hardly surprising that}} he welcomed the challenge of leading a college endowed by and named after the first president.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{economic}} {{effects were}} seen {{throughout the region}} after the test. South Korea's KOSPI index fell 2.4% to 1319.4, forcing the Korea Exchange to suspend trading for five minutes upon receiving the news. The Japanese and Taiwanese stock exchanges were closed for a market holiday {{on the day of}} the test. The Japanese yen also fell to a seven-month low against the United States dollar while oil on the world market rose above US$60 a barrel. Gold prices rose 1% as a safe haven investment. Several stock markets in Asia from the Singapore Exchange to the Philippine Stock Exchange <b>have</b> <b>traded</b> lower, possibly due to the tests. American stock markets were mixed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down at its open the next day; however, at 10:30am EDT, the Dow rebounded and concluded the day with an increase of 7.60 points (+0.06%). NSE and BSE of India, however, showed some strength.|$|E
25|$|CS:GO is not {{the first}} video game where players <b>have</b> <b>traded,</b> sold, or bought virtual in-game items, but the ease of {{accessing}} and transferring through the Steam Marketplace made it a successful virtual economy. However, with increased monetary values placed on some skins, the Steam Marketplace became infeasible. The Steam Marketplace only allows sales up to $400, with all transactions subject to a 15% fee collected by Valve. Trades and purchases via the Steam Marketplace required players to add funds to their Steam Wallets to purchase skins from others, with those funds being placed in the Wallet of the seller; such funds could not be taken out as real-world money, as otherwise Valve would be regulated as a bank. As the value of skins grew beyond these limits, new websites opened up that used the Steamworks application programming interface (API) to link players' inventory to these sites as to manage the trading of CS:GO skins while enabling these users to spend more and receive money through other online banking/payment sites like PayPal or using digital currency like Bitcoin, and bypassing Valve's transaction fee.|$|E

500|$|The {{amount of}} energy stored in the tendons {{increases}} with the animal's speed {{and the weight of}} the load it is carrying.
