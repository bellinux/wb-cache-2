These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 2012, Los Hijos del Averno {{lost the}} CMLL World Trios Championship to El Bufete del Amor ("The Law of Love"; Marco Corleone, Máximo, and Rush). Averno {{was forced to}} team up with {{constant}} rival La Mascara, for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was for the 2012 tournament. The team worked together without too many problems {{in the first round}} as they defeated the team of El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino, but stumbled in the second round as they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador, Jr. On April 26, 2013, at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show Averno defeated Místico La Nueva Era to win the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, Averno defeated Blue Panther in a submission only Lucha de Apuestas match, which forced Blue Panther to have all his hair shaved off as a result. On December 1, Averno lost the Mexican National Welterweight Championship to Titán. On April 28, 2014, CMLL announced that Averno had parted ways with the company.|$|E
5|$|On January 22, 2011, La Máscara {{made his}} Japanese debut, {{when he took}} part in the Fantastica Mania 2011 weekend, co-promoted by CMLL and New Japan Pro Wrestling in Tokyo. During the first night, he teamed with Tiger Mask in a tag team match, where they were {{defeated}} by Dragón Rojo, Jr. and Tomohiro Ishii. The following night, he, Máscara Dorada and La Sombra successfully defended the CMLL World Trios Championship against La Ola Amarilla (Okumura, Tetsuya Naito and Yujiro Takahashi). In April 2011, La Máscara began feuding with the WWE bound Averno, which led to CMLL booking the two to face each other in a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuesta on June 17. On June 17 at Juicio Final, La Máscara picked up the biggest win of his career by defeating Averno two falls to one and forcing him to unmask himself. Afterwards, La Máscara and Averno continued their rivalry, building up to another singles match on July 4, where Averno successfully defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. On July 15, La Generación Dorada lost the CMLL World Trios Championship to Los Hijos del Averno (Averno, Ephesto and Mephisto). After La Máscara pinned Averno in a six man tag team match on July 22, the two agreed to another match for the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship on July 29, where Averno was again able to retain the title. La Máscara and Averno faced each other again on September 9 {{in the second round of}} the Universal Championship tournament, where Averno once again was victorious. On November 22, La Máscara defeated Averno to win the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship. He would go on to lose the title to Volador, Jr. on February 14, 2012. On January 18, 2013, La Máscara returned to Japan to take part in the three-day Fantastica Mania 2013 event. During the first night, he teamed with Máscara Dorada and Máximo in a six man tag team match, where they were defeated by Taichi, Taka Michinoku and Volador Jr. During the second night, he, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Rush were defeated in a six man tag team match by Kazuchika Okada, Rey Escorpión and Volador Jr. During the third and final night, La Máscara successfully defended the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship against Volador Jr. La Máscara was once again forced to team up with Averno, for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was for the 2012 tournament. The team worked together without too many problems in the first round as they defeated the team of El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino, but stumbled in the second round as they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador, Jr. On April 7, La Máscara returned to New Japan Pro Wrestling at Invasion Attack, where he and Valiente unsuccessfully challenged Tama Tonga and El Terrible for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. On June 30, La Máscara, Rush and Titán defeated Los Invasores (Kráneo, Mr. Águila and Psicosis) to win the Mexican National Trios Championship. On August 13, La Máscara lost the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship to Mephisto. On October 18, La Máscara and Rush were awarded the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, when Rey Bucanero, one half of the previous champions, was unable to defend the title due to an injury. On February 18, 2014, La Máscara, Rush and Titán lost the Mexican National Trios Championship to La Peste Negra (El Felino, Mr. Niebla and Negro Casas).

25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the event, Joaquin Roldán reaffirmed that Nicho el Millonario had been suspended indefinitely for interfering in the Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. Konnan, meanwhile, gloated that, despite Abyss' and Anderson's failure to capture the AAA World Tag Team Championship, the TNA wrestlers as a whole had proven their superiority, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had promised. Konnan explained Van Dam's defeat in the main event by claiming that he had gotten injured during the match, but promised him a rematch with Wagner Jr. {{as soon as he}} had recovered. He also challenged Mari Apache to put her AAA Reina de Reinas Championship on the line against Mickie James.|$|E

However, to pay for it, Ian decides to sell his {{restaurant}} to a supermarket chain, causing the locals to protest.

Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops him going back to the school, he hits her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition. He tells Ian in the pub that he has killed Jane, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> killed Lucy, within earshot of everyone in the pub. After Bobby is questioned about the assault, he confesses to the police that he killed Lucy. They are reluctant to reopen the case but Ian is horrified when Bobby says he still has the murder weapon.|$|E
25|$|Sagan {{started his}} {{season at the}} Tour of Qatar, taking his first podium spot of the season on Stage 4 by {{finishing}} second. He finished second again the next day. He concluded the race first in the youth classification to win the white jersey. He subsequently headed to the Tour of Oman, failing to get his first season victory. He then participated to Tirreno–Adriatico, finishing second {{of the first and}} second stage. On Stage 6, Sagan took his first victory under the Tinkoff-Saxo colors in a flat stage which featured a lot of rain and breaks in the peloton. He finished the stage race in first in the points classification to earn the red jersey. He went on to compete in the Monument race Milan–San Remo, where he sprinted to a fourth position. In E3 Harelbeke, Sagan got clear of the main group with Geraint Thomas and Zdenek Stybar on the Oude Kwaremont with 41 kilometers left, but faded badly as Thomas attacked with 4 kilometers to go and finished 30th. Two days later, he finished tenth of Gent–Wevelgem, as only 39 riders finished the race. In April, he awarded himself the fourth place of the Tour of Flanders. He was chasing the leading duet with Greg Van Avermaet, but cracked in the finale, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did in the E3 Harelbeke. At Paris-Roubaix, he was in a group chasing the leaders, but had a mechanical problem with his shifter and had to change his bike in the final 10 kilometers, costing him precious time.

500|$|On October 1, Perot re-entered {{the presidential}} race, {{with a desire}} to further explain his {{economic}} plans to the American people. The New York Times commented that Perot's [...] "chances of winning are much less than when he quit in July. His only dim practical hope is to confuse and destabilize the contest." [...] He hoped to spend more resources using paid advertisements than holding traditional rallies to spread his message. During the last month of campaigning, Perot left his headquarters in Dallas only to appear in the presidential debates and seven rallies. One aide later commented: [...] "he wanted to do it <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> could go to the office every day, run for president, and go home and eat dinner." [...] Rather than using professional advisers, Perot employed [...] "political amateurs" [...] whose loyalty was unquestioned. Orson Swindle, whom he had known since the 1970s, was hired as the top aide. Perot's son-in-law Clayton Mulford, who was involved in the early draft effort, was hired as legal adviser. Sharon Holman, who worked for Perot since 1969, was hired as press secretary, and friend Murphy Martin was added as the media chief.|$|E

Zach's then-girlfriend, Rebecca Earp, testified that [...] "He said he would tie me up <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did Holly Bobo and nobody would ever see me again."

2500|$|The {{character}} Dr. Gerrigel {{uses the}} term [...] "Asenion" [...] to describe robots programmed with the Three Laws. The robots in Asimov's stories, being Asenion robots, are incapable of knowingly violating the Three Laws but, in principle, a robot in science fiction or {{in the real world}} could be non-Asenion. [...] "Asenion" [...] is a misspelling of the name Asimov which was made by an editor of the magazine Planet Stories. Asimov used this obscure variation to insert himself into The Caves of Steel <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> referred to himself as [...] "Azimuth or, possibly, Asymptote" [...] in Thiotimoline to the Stars, {{in much the same way}} that Vladimir Nabokov appeared in Lolita anagrammatically disguised as [...] "Vivian Darkbloom".|$|E

2500|$|Brando's {{performance}} was glowingly reviewed by critics. [...] "I {{thought it would}} be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys Edward G.

[...] "Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I {{thought it would be}} an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats." [...] Duvall later marveled to A's Biography, [...] "He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word action. He would go in front of that camera <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was before. Cut! It was all the same. There was really no beginning. I learned a lot from watching that." [...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Cibernético {{once again}} founded a new group, La Secta Cibernética, a pseudo-religious cult, with Cibernético as its [...] "religious leader". The group {{consisted}} of Cibernético's longtime associates Charly Manson and Chessman who had both been part of Los Vipers and LLL, and also included The Black Family (Ozz, Cuervo, Espiritu and Escoria). La Secta Cibernetica continued the storyline with Peña's loyalists that had been started back in the LLL days. Peña's main defender was La Parka (II), which in turn made him Cibernético's main rival. The two men faced off in the main event of Triplemanía XII {{in one of the}} biggest Lucha de Apuesta, or [...] "mask vs. mask" [...] matches of the year. In the end the Peña backed La Parka defeated Cibernético and forced him to unmask after the match.

Frustrated by his inability to defeat La Parka (in the storyline) Cibernético brought in a masked wrestler called Muerte Cibernética ("Cybernetic Death") to target La Parka. At Triplemanía XIV La Parka repeated the feat and unmasked Muerte Cibernética <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had unmasked Cibernético two years prior Following the unmasking Muerte Cibernética slowly began to take control of La Secta, taking advantage of Cibernético suffering a serious knee injury that took him away from the ring for several months.|$|E

Ren and his classmates want {{to do away with}} the law and have a senior prom. After a while Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, they fight and Chuck hits her. Later in church, Moore asks if Ren beat up Ariel. When Moore demands Ren's arrest, Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> did with Bobby. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, which prompts Moore to beg for her to not talk like that in church, having Ariel sarcastically ask Moore if he will pass another law, and how it didn't stop her and Chuck from having sex. But Moore slaps her without warning, which shocks Vi, Moore's wife, and prompts Ariel to tearfully and angrily criticize Moore for slapping her, and storm out of the church. Moore tries to apologize, but Vi stops Moore, telling him, [...] "You've done enough." [...] Vi is supportive of the dancing movement, explaining to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being good to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Jannetty's 1996 departure, Michaels became a born-again Christian in real life. This helped the two to patch up their above mentioned off-screen differences {{once and for all}} when Michaels shared his faith and aided Jannetty in becoming a Christian. On the SmackDown! shown on March 10, 2005 (taped two days earlier) Kurt Angle announced that as part of his preparation for his WrestleMania 21 match against Michaels he would face Michaels old partner Jannetty on the following SmackDown. The following Monday (March 14, 2005) Jannetty made a surprise appearance on WWE Raw and, for one night, The Rockers reunited to take on La Résistance (Sylvain Grenier and Rob Conway). Jannetty got the win with the [...] "Rocker Dropper" [...] after Michaels hit ”Sweet Chin Music” on Grenier. Three days later on SmackDown Angle had promised to make Jannetty ”tap out”, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was going to make Michaels tap out at WrestleMania 21. On the night Angle made good on his promise and forced Jannetty to submit to his ankle lock submission hold, but only after a nearly twenty-minute match and an impressive showing for Jannetty which saw him nearly pin the Olympic champion. After two good showings on Raw and SmackDown to convince WWE that he was still a very talented performer, they signed him to a contract. Due to a domestic incident, Jannetty was arrested and thus unable to meet the commitments of his WWE contract, which led to him being released from his contract by July 6, 2005.|$|E
