40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that boredom proneness is associated with failures of self-regulation. As yet few studies have directly explored the behavioural consequences of this relationship. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the behavioural constituents of boredom proneness and various self-regulatory traits. Foraging represents a common goal directed behaviour that emphasises exploration and attainment of valued outcomes. As such, foraging tasks were used as behavioural assays of self-regulatory behaviour. Foraging can be thought of as either internal or external: an <b>internal</b> <b>forging</b> task, emphasizes exploration of problem spaces with a goal of determining as many solutions as possible. The Boggle game, in which participants made as many words as possible from a grid of 9 letters, was used as an internal foraging task. An external foraging task, on the other hand, emphasizes exploration of physical or virtual environments, with a goal of maximizing provisions. A spatial foraging task, in which participants explored a virtual environment collecting as many red “berries” as possible, served as an external foraging task. Results suggest that although each self-regulatory trait was associated with a specific set of behaviors, self-regulatory traits seem to be better characterized as behavioral preferences. When individuals behaved contrary to what would be preferred under a given self-regulatory trait, it reflects a recurrent lack of regulatory fit. Instances of non-fit in the current study were associated with increased trait boredom proneness. These findings suggest that how goals are pursued may be an important determinant of boredom proneness...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{a three-year}} program concerned with obtaining basic design information for tubes having a random roughness {{on the inside}} wall (RID) and tubing having continuous <b>internal</b> fins (<b>Forge</b> Fin). Test apparatus and procedures were developed to obtain accurate heat-transfer and friction data {{for a wide variety}} of tube geometries using water as the test fluid. For the random roughness the heat-transfer coefficient was above the smooth tube value, for comparable flow conditions, by over 60 percent at a Reynolds number of 30, 000. Larger percentage improvements can be expected for higher Reynolds numbers and for fluids having higher Prandtl numbers. Improvements in performance, based on equal pumping power for augmented and smooth tubes, of about 50 percent were observed. The heat-transfer characteristics for tape-generated swirl flow through rough tubes were investigated in order to determine the interaction of swirl flow and roughness effects. For the particular range of parameters covered, for equal flow rates, the maximum improvement in heat transfer with swirl flow in smooth tubes was 70 percent, whereas with swirl flow in rough tubes, the improvement was as much as 100 percent. The heat-transfer coefficient for rough tube swirl flow was accurately correlated by a modification of an additive expression previously suggested for prediction of smooth tube swirl flow data. (cont.) The test program for internally finned tubes established that short spiralled fins produce the greatest improvement in heat transfer. On the basis of equal flow conditions, the heat transfer was improved by over 200 percent; while at equal pumping power, the performance was as high as 170 percent. These improvements, which are attributed to increased area and turbulence promotion, appear to equal the improvements displayed by any of the schemes used to augment heat transfer inside tubes. In order to bring the augmentation problem into perspective, a discussion of data for other types of roughness and finning is included. DS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{two types}} of cryptanalysis on a Merkle-Damg̊ard hash based MAC, which computes a MAC value of a message M by Hash(K‖`‖M) with a shared key K and the message length `. This construction is often called LPMAC. Firstly, we present a distinguishing-H attack against LPMAC instantiating any narrow-pipe Merkle-Damg̊ard hash function with O(2 n/ 2) queries, which indicates the incorrectness of the widely believed assumption that LPMAC instantiating a secure hash function should resist the distinguishing-H attack up to 2 n queries. In fact, all of the previous distinguishing-H attacks considered dedicated at-tacks depending on the underlying hash algorithm, {{and most of the}} cases, reduced rounds were attacked with a complexity between 2 n/ 2 and 2 n. Because it works in generic, our attack updates these results, namely full rounds are attacked with O(2 n/ 2) complexity. Secondly, we show that an even stronger attack, which is a powerful form of an almost universal forgery attack, can be performed on LPMAC. In this setting, attackers can modify the first several message-blocks of a given message and aim to recover an <b>internal</b> state and <b>forge</b> the MAC value. For any narrow-pipe Merkle-Damg̊ard hash function, our attack can be performed with O(2 n/ 2) queries.

25|$|As {{the country}} {{recovered}} from financial depression following the Panic of 1819, {{the question of}} <b>internal</b> improvements again <b>forged</b> to the front. In 1822, a bill to authorize the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road had been vetoed by the President. In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his views on the constitutional aspects of a policy of internal improvements. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them. For the moment, the drift toward a larger participation {{of the national government}} in internal improvements was stayed. Two years later, Congress authorized the President to institute surveys for such roads and canals as he believed to be needed for commerce and military defense. No one pleaded more eloquently for a larger conception of the functions of the national government than Henry Clay. He called the attention of his hearers to provisions made for coast surveys and lighthouses on the Atlantic seaboard and deplored the neglect of the interior of the country. Of the other presidential candidates, Jackson voted in the Senate for the general survey bill; and Adams left no doubt in the public mind that he did not reflect the narrow views of his section on this issue. Crawford felt the constitutional scruples which were everywhere being voiced in the South, and followed the old expedient of advocating a constitutional amendment to sanction national internal improvements.|$|R
30|$|The {{subject of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) has continuously been challenged by those who want corporations to move beyond transparency, ethical behaviour and stakeholder engagement. Today, responsible behaviours are increasingly being embedded into new sustainable business models {{that are designed to}} meet environmental, societal and governance deficits. Although there are numerous theories and empirical analyses on CSR constructs (Carroll 1979, Margolis and Walsh 2001, McWilliams and Siegel 2001, Fombrun 2005, Wang and Choi 2013, Strand et al. 2015), there is still scant theoretical research that links corporate sustainability with {{corporate social responsibility}} and environmental management. Therefore, this contribution aims at filling this academic gap by examining the conceptual developments of the “corporate sustainability and responsibility” notion. This review paper reiterates that that there is a business case for CSR as organizations can pursue profit-making activities (i.e. corporate sustainability). Businesses are encouraged to strategically re-align their products, services, and operations with responsible behaviors (Husted and Allen 2009). Strategic CSR outcomes may include responsible management of <b>internal</b> practices and <b>forging</b> relationships with external stakeholders. It is in the organizations’ interest to forge closer ties with the regulatory authorities and with their neighbouring communities. Responsible behaviours add value to the firm, society and the environment (Camilleri 2017). Therefore, businesses ought to utilize their skills, resources, and management capability that lead to social progress (see Beschorner 2014, Porter and Kramer 2011 : 77). This is consistent with the expectation that much of CSR is developed in order to improve the firm’s image and reputation, possibly allowing it to differentiate its products in the market (Fombrun 2005).|$|R
5000|$|In 1969 {{there were}} 859 Boss 429s made by Ford Motor Company, {{two of which}} were Cougars for the Lincoln/Mercury Race Division. There were five {{different}} colors available in 1969 (Raven Black, Wimbledon White, Royal Maroon, Candy apple Red, and Black Jade), and the only color for the interior was black. The fully functional hood scoop was {{the same color as}} the car, and noticeably larger than anything else offered on any Ford product at the time, {{with the exception of the}} two Boss 429 Cougars. This scoop would carry over to the 1970 model year but would be painted black on all cars. To this day, it is the largest factory hood scoop ever installed on a factory produced Mustang. All these cars were a manual transmission, and there was no air conditioning available due to the size of the engine. Though not originally offered as an option, it is common to add a spoiler and window louvers commonly seen on 1969-1970 Mach 1's and Boss 302's. Some early cars were known as [...] "S" [...] code cars and as such had a slightly different engine. These cars had magnesium valve covers, NASCAR style <b>forged</b> <b>internals,</b> nearly no smog or emissions equipment and are said to be more powerful than the later [...] "T" [...] and [...] "A" [...] code engines which had the emissions related equipment to satisfy government regulations. The engines in some cases were removed from the cars for use in other applications such as tractor pulling, due to the extreme torque and horsepower the engine was capable of producing.|$|R

The Mach 1 used a non-supercharged aluminum block with DOHC with only a forged crank on manual models. The Cobra used a 4.6 DOHC V8 as well, however it was a cast-iron block with <b>forged</b> <b>internals</b> and a supercharger, they are commonly mistaken to have the same block. It was conservatively rated at 305 hp (310 hp in 2004). Other special features included [...] "retro" [...] interior styling, with seats made to look like the [...] "comfortweave" [...] seats in the original Mach 1s, old-style gauges, and aluminum pedals and shifter. Outside, the Mach 1 featured a striping package and blacked-out spoiler designed to mimic the original Mach 1, [...] "Magnum 500" [...] styled 17 in wheels, and a [...] "Shaker" [...] hoodscoop. The [...] "Shaker" [...] was so named because it was attached to the engine and stuck out {{through a hole in the}} hood, and would move with the torque of the motor. Ford utilized the same casting for the new [...] "Shaker" [...] that they had for the 1969 model year. Despite having camshafts that produce power at lower rpm, the Mach 1's 4.6 produced as much power as the '01 Cobra, in part to the revised 4-valve heads, and an increase in compression from 9.85:1 to 10:1. The Mach 1 was also equipped with 3.55:1 rear gears, making it capable of very low 13-second 1/4 mile ETs and ~106 mph trap speeds with an experienced drag driver.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Reputation is {{the strongest}} {{determinant}} of any corporation’s sustainability. Stock prices can always come back, and business strategies can always be changed, but when an organisation’s reputation is gravely injured, its recovery is difficult, long term, and uncertain. It is quite notable in the corporate industry that individual corporate leaders possess some reputation. Consider leaders like The Oppenheimers, Jack Welch, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Patrice Motsepe, Martha Steward, Maria Ramos, and Nonkululeko Nyembezi–Heita. In many cases, the person becomes synonymous with the company. The image and reputation of the CEO becomes the image and reputation of the company. A risk on their reputation {{is a threat to}} the survival of the enterprise. Leaders who have built a strong corporate reputation know what it takes: an <b>internal</b> culture that <b>forges</b> a positive opinion of the company by successfully coping with both expected and anticipated challenges. They know that Public Relations is not a bandage that will cover risky behaviour. Most of all, they know that they must understand the role played by their behaviour; that the public’s perception does not end only with the product, but also with who leads the corporation and how. They know that their leadership style, strategies and personal lives are of public interest, and that every company’s solution must be unique. Cross–disciplinary theorists view corporate reputations as strategic assets and as a source of economic value. A good feeling about a company, its activities, workplace, past performance and future prospects by key stakeholders can lead to positive stakeholder decisions about the company. Corporate reputation has attracted interest {{from a wide range of}} academic disciplines. It is also a growing focus for business and media attention. This paper examines the construct of corporate reputation, and the effect brought about by the behaviour of the iii corporation’s leadership. Firstly, I define reputation in terms of the perceived experiences of stakeholders and their emotions, while the consequences of reputation are defined as the behavioural support of stakeholders towards the business. I then move on to consider how reputation has been measured by applying the corporate Reputation Quotient (RQ) of Harris–Fombrun. The RQ is a comprehensive measuring method of corporate reputation that was created specifically to capture the perceptions of any corporate stakeholder group, such as leaders, consumers, investors, employees, or key influencers. The instrument enables research on the drivers of a company's reputation, and allows the comparison of reputations both within and across industries. With a clearer understanding of the construct of corporate reputation and the allied constructs of image and identity, researchers are now well placed to test the relationships widely claimed by practitioners between corporate reputation and other variables, such as corporate leaders, commercial performance, employee and customer satisfaction. The review ends by illustrating some of the issues that can be assessed from the basis of a clearer conceptualisation of reputation and its measurement. Master...|$|R
40|$|The United States is {{currently}} experiencing an unprecedented renaissance {{of its economic}} power and its predominance in military technology. At the same time, {{over the last five}} years, American foreign policy in a number of key domains has caused irritation all over the world on account of its unmistakably unilateral bent—all the more so since the ‘assertive multilateralism’ of the Clinton administration that was proclaimed at the outset gave the impression of being not just an instrument of the government’s policymaking but its underlying principle. This unilateralism raises fundamental questions about the USA’s preferences in regard to foreign-policy strategies, about the status of international organizations (IOs), and about the conditions in which the United States is prepared to work together with other countries within a multilateral framework. In the area of security/arms-control policy, these questions pose themselves in particular in relation to American conduct toward three international institutions. These are: the United Nations, NATO, and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). These three bodies serve as a good means of highlighting the differences and parallels in American policy. As the Clinton era draws to a close, this study seeks to take stock of the administration’s two periods of office in a major area of policymaking, and to indicate whether the conduct of the USA toward the three selected international organizations confirms the unilateral trend observable in US foreign policy. American policy toward the United Nations is examined using the example of UN reform. We also analyze the disagreements about American participation in UN peacekeeping operations. The declared principle underlying this remains unilateral use of force by the United States as a means of enforcing its interests. In the debate about reform, the lowest common denominator between the major US actors is the need to make the United Nations more efficient—and to use the process of change to establish US influence on as firm a footing as possible. In other key areas, the administration and the Republican-dominated Congress have had entirely different views about the United Nations. This has led to an ambivalent picture of the hegemon, and to inconsistent foreign-policy strategies. The dissension over US policy toward the United Nations was exemplified particularly clearly in the matter of the reduction of the American debts. Although the Clinton administration acted unilaterally on several points (e. g. in reducing its contributions without consultation), the United States ultimately behaved as a hegemon that is open to compromise. The government campaigned for {{a large part of the}} arrears to be paid off, since the UN had satisfactorily carried out its reforms. A different position was taken by the dominant arch-conservative senators around Jesse Helms. They threatened to take the US out of the United Nations, in order to tighten up the reform conditions even more, and at the same time, year after year, they blocked funding. However paradoxical it may seem: because of the blockade policy of the majority in Congress, the American hegemon has so far been acting more like a ham-strung mediumsized power in this area of policymaking. It is not just the UN that is weakened; the reputation and influence of the United States within the United Nations are also - II - compromised at present. The establishment of power and influence that was sought via budgetary and administrative reform can currently only be achieved through the restoration of American credibility—in other words, initially by the USA’s changing from being the largest debtor to the largest and most reliable donor. By paying off part of its arrears, the United States has, after a lengthy tug-of-war, taken a first, hesitant step. An arduous path still lies ahead of it: the USA now has to persuade the General Assembly to accept its special demands and one-sided conditions. The US funding of the UN over the next few years which was laid down in law on 19 November 1999 is not a permanent solution, but a political stop-gap. The main problem of the last few years is unchanged: there is no stable internal American consensus for a constructive policy toward the UN. The conduct of the USA toward the regional organization NATO is examined via the three following aspects: a) the decision about the enlargement of the alliance; b) the discussion about the overhaul of the latter’s functions and area of competence; c) the development of a European Security and Defence Identity. Here, the United States comes across as a ‘benevolent hegemon’, whose conduct is still essentially cooperative and still adheres to multilateral principles even though ten years have passed since the end of the East–West conflict. Despite the major changes that have occurred in the alliance and its environment, US policy toward it is, overall, characterized by continuity. The United States does not see itself as a normal member of the alliance. It views itself, rather, as an irreplaceable leading power that lends the alliance cohesion, cushions <b>internal</b> European dissension, <b>forges</b> compromises on disputed issues, and acts for the good of all by pushing through decisions in borderline cases, even in the face of opposition. External observers see the American leadership as characterized by openness, dialogue, and a readiness to take account of the concerns and interests of smaller members of the alliance. Its power therefore does not express itself in unbridled dominance. However, this arrangement is increasingly coming under pressure in the American debate. Isolationist critics point to the costs of NATO involvement and to the danger of being drawn into conflicts in which the United States has no vital interests. The criticism of the unilateralists assumes that the alliance is restricting American freedom of action like a corset, without any significant reciprocal effort by the Europeans to relieve the burden on the USA. Up to now, this criticism has not been reflected in any major change in American policy on NATO. What {{is currently}} of greater political importance than the isolationist and unilateral criticism is the call of the internationalist center of the political spectrum for the alliance to be geared more strongly to American interests, because otherwise it will lose its practical relevance. Against this background, there is a danger that the foreign-policy consensus that has underpinned the hegemon’s involvement in NATO will now begin to crumble. The attitude of the United States toward the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is manifested, to begin with, in the legislation on the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This allows us to assess how far the superpower is complying with what are the binding provisions of the convention. - III - If one is to believe the political rhetoric, the United States is a cooperative member of the OPCW that vigorously supports the organization’s objectives—namely, the elimination of existing arsenals of chemical weapons and the non-proliferation of such weapons. However, US practice sometimes diverges significantly from the multilateral procedures set out in the Chemical Weapons Convention. The hegemon’s attitude here is similar to that shown to the United Nations: the unilateralism is unmistakable. During the toing and froing between the executive and the legislature, provisions were incorporated into the American ratification and implementation legislation that considerably restrict the organization’s powers within the United States. This policy of unilateral self-interest is embodied in the day-to-day cooperation with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The United States on the one hand hampered cooperation in The Hague—the organization’s base. It also put obstacles in the way of routine inspections by the OPCW team in various American chemical-weapons facilities. All in all, as far as the policy of the US hegemon toward the three selected international organizations is concerned, the picture that emerges underscores our overall assessment of an increase in unilateralism. NATO is the exception to the rule. As our analysis shows, the markedly unilateral conduct of the United States toward the UN and the OPCW on the one hand, and its cooperative policy toward NATO on the other, are a function of the peculiar characteristics of the three international organizations concerned. The UN and the OPCW are large-scale organizations, with 185 and 130 members respectively. Associated with this numerical size is a considerable ideological-cum-political disparity which keeps the influence of the USA—in so far as this is deliberately exerted—in check. We here turn to the explanatory factors for unilateralism and cooperation/multilateralism that have been suggested in the present discussion, and we assess their plausibility. We discuss the significance of four determining factors for unilateralism in relation to relevant US behavior toward the UN and the OPCW; and we consider the analytical scope of three explanatory factors for cooperation/multilateralism in relation to the essentially cooperative policy of the United States toward NATO. In conclusion, we raise the question of the permanence of the American hegemon’s basic unilateral stance. Although we are not able to give a definitive answer on this, it would appear to us that the determining factors elaborated here are likely to continue to be decisive for the foreseeable future: a revised version of the ‘assertive multilateralism’ of the first Clinton administration is not in prospect...|$|R
