40|$|We set out {{by noting}} the {{preference}} for circular flows in ecological thought, and the related abhorrence of inefficiency and waste that western ecology shares with mainstream economic thinking. This has often been manifest in a shared disdain both for uncontained, <b>free-burning</b> <b>fire</b> and for `unmanaged’ sexual desire. The paper constructs a `pyrosexual’ counter-narrative that explores the mutually constitutive and generative implication of sex and fire. Bringing together the solar ecology of Georges Bataille,feminist and queer thinking about sexuality and reproduction, {{and a range of}} ways of theorising biological life and fire, we explore how fire mediates between organismic desire and the energetic dynamics of the earth and solar system. The first section takes a genealogical approach to fire and sex that traces their entanglement from the initial `assembling’ of fire through to the emergence of a fire-handling creature. The second section looks at how fire has been contained and intensified by human actors, and the role that heat-driven transformations of inorganic matter have played in the incitement and channeling of desire in urban spaces. The third section addresses the development of industrial `heat engines’ and the implications for desire and reproduction of tapping vast reservoirs of subterranean solar energy. We round off by beginning to consider what alternative possibilities might lie in the re-negotiation of sex and fire on a planet undergoing rapid change...|$|E
40|$|An {{effectively}} strain-rate-free {{diffusion flame}} constitutes the most vigorous laminar combustion of initially unmixed reactive gases. Such a diffusion flame {{is characterized by}} a relatively long residence time and by a relatively large characteristic length scale. If such a flame were also planar, providing high symmetry, it would be particularly suitable for experimental and theoretical investigations of key combustion phenomena, such as multicomponent diffusion, chemical kinetics, and soot inception, growth, and oxidation. Unfortunately, a planar strain-rate-free diffusion flame is highly disrupted in earth-gravity (e. g., in a counterflow-diffusion-flame apparatus) because of the very rapid onset (approx. 100 ms) of gravity-induced instability. Accordingly, a specially dedicated apparatus was designed, fabricated, and initially checked out for the examination of a planar strain-rate-free diffusion flame in microgravity. Such a diffusion flame may be formed within a hollowed-out squat container (initially configured as 25 cm x 25 cm x 9 cm), with isothermal, noncatalytic, impervious walls. At test initiation, a thin metallic sheet (approx. 1 mm in thickness) that separates the internal volume into two equal portions, each of dimensions 25 cm x 25 cm x 4. 5 cm, is withdrawn, by uniform translation (approx. 50 cm/s) in its own plane, through a tightly fitting slit in one side wall. Thereupon, diluted fuel vapor (initially confined to one half-volume of the container) gains access to diluted oxygen (initially with the same pressure, density, and temperature as the fuel, but initially confined to the other half-volume). After a brief delay (approx. 10 ms), to permit limited but sufficient-for-flammability diffusional interpenetration of fuel vapor and oxidizer, burning is initiated by discharge of a line igniter, located along that side wall from which the trailing edge of the separator withdraws. The ignition spawns a triple-flame propagation across the 25 cm x 25 cm centerplane. When a diffusion flame is emplaced in the centerplane, any subsequent travel, and change in temperature, of that planar diffusion flame may be tracked, along with the effectively spatially uniform but temporally evolving pressure within the container. Eventually, nearly complete depletion of the stoichiometrically deficient reactant, along with heat loss to the container surfaces, effects extinction. These data afford an opportunity to check theoretical models of diffusion and chemical kinetics under conditions ranging from intense burning to flame out, or, alternatively, to evolve simple empirical representations of these phenomena. Thus, the project sought to utilize microgravity testing to elucidate commonly encountered phenomenology, arising in the commonly-encountered mode of combustion (whether related to heating, manufacturing, boiling, and propulsion, or to uncontrolled, <b>free-burning</b> <b>fire</b> in structures and wildland vegetation), of those commonly utilized fuels usually categorized as gaseous fuels (such as hydrogen, natural gas, and propane, which are gaseous under atmospheric conditions) ...|$|E

40|$|Weather {{is never}} static. It is always dynamic. Its {{interpretation}} is an art. The art of applying complex information about weather to the equally complex task of wildland fire control cannot be acquired easily-especially {{not by the}} mere reading of a book. The environment is in control in wildland firefighting. <b>Free-burning</b> <b>fires</b> are literally nourished by weather elements, atmospheric components, and atmospheric motion. Outguessing mother nature {{in order to win}} control is an extremely difficult task. We need to soothe her with understanding. We have attempted to present information {{in such a way that}} your daily and seasonal awareness of fire weather can begin with reliable basic knowledge. We have kept the use of technical terms to a minimum, but where it was necessary for clear and accurate presentation, we have introduced and defined the proper terms. Growing awareness of fire weather, when combined with related experience on fires, can develop into increasingly intuitive, rapid, and accurate applications. Toward this end, we have preceded each chapter with a paragraph or two on important points to look for in relating weather factors to fire-control planning and action...|$|R
40|$|A {{deterministic}} model is suggested {{to describe the}} spread of <b>free-burning</b> wildland <b>fires</b> {{and the effect of}} various types of suppression activity thereon. The costs caused by fire are described and optimal levels of suppression forces are derived with the objective of minimizing the total costs of suppression plus fire damage. Costs incurred under optimal manning policies as given by the model are compared with the historical costs incurred on actual forest fires under present manning plans. Results indicate that significant dollar savings can be achieved in total fire caused costs by considerably increasing the size of fire suppression organizations. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFire {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with TDI under conditions simulating a pool fire originating, e. g. from a leakage of stored TDI. The facilities of Cerchar provide conditions of a <b>free-burning,</b> well-ventilated <b>fire.</b> Burning rate, heat and smoke development and toxic gas emission were determined {{as a function of}} the pool diameter up to l m². Results are compared with small scale test results. Burning rate increases with increasing pool diameter reaching 2 kg/m²-min at l m² area. Yields of permanent gases do not differ significantly with increasing pool area, with HCN amounting to 5 mg/g. Free TDI is found in fire gas up to 15 ppm corresponding to a yield of 7 mg/g...|$|R
50|$|If {{water damage}} or water volume is of {{particular}} concern, a technique called Water Mist Fire Suppression may be an alternative. This technology has been under development for over 50 years. It hasn't entered general use, but is gaining some acceptance on ships {{and in a few}} residential applications. Mist suppression systems work by using the heat of the fire to 'flash' the water mist cloud to steam. This then smothers the fire. As such, mist systems tend to be highly effective where there {{is likely to be a}} <b>free-burning</b> hot <b>fire.</b> Where there is insufficient heat (as in a deep seated fire such as will be found in stored paper) no steam will be generated and the mist system will not extinguish the fire. Some tests have shown that the volume of water needed to extinguish a fire with such a system installed can be dramatically less than with a conventional sprinkler system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{occurrence}} of a liquid fuel burning on carpet {{has been involved}} in many incendiary and accidental fires. While the research on a liquid fuel fire on carpet is still limited, much work on porous media has been performed using sand or glass beads soaked with liquid fuel. In this study, a heat and mass transfer theory was first developed to analyze the burning process of liquid on carpet, and then several small-scale tests were performed to validate the theory. This analysis is valid for pool fires intermediate in size (5 - 20 cm. in diameter). The experimental apparatus consisted of a circular pan (105 mm) and a load cell. Varying amounts of fuels (heptane, kerosene and methanol) were spilled onto the carpet, which was allowed to burn in a quiescent environment. It was found that due to the different controlling mechanisms, the liquid burning rate could be less or more than that of a similarly spilled <b>free-burning</b> pool <b>fire.</b> For the worst-case scenario in fires, the maximum enhancement of the burning rate due to the porous media is predictable through the physical properties of the fuel. This analysis is valid for both combustion and evaporation. Several similar results in the scientific literature are analyzed to further describe the trend. This work explains the role of carpet in liquid pool fires and also helps to explain special risks related to the presence of carpet involved in arsons and will be useful in reconstruction of the early development of an incendiary or accidental fire...|$|R

40|$|<b>Free-burning</b> {{experimental}} <b>fires</b> {{were conducted}} in a wind tunnel to explore the role of ignition type and thus fire spread mode on the resulting emissions profile from combustion of fine (< 6 mm in diameter) Eucalyptus litter fuels. Fires were burnt spreading with the wind (heading fire), perpendicular to the wind (flanking fire) and against the wind (backing fire). Greenhouse gas compounds (i. e. CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O) and CO were quantified using off-axis integrated-cavity-output spectroscopy. Emissions factors calculated using a carbon mass balance technique (along with statistical testing) showed {{that most of the}} carbon was emitted as CO 2, with heading fires emitting 17 % more CO 2 than flanking and 9. 5 % more CO 2 than backing fires, and about twice as much CO as flanking and backing fires. Heading fires had less than half as much carbon remaining in combustion residues. Statistically significant differences in CH 4 and N 2 O emissions factors were not found with respect to fire spread mode. Emissions factors calculated per unit of dry fuel consumed showed that combustion phase (i. e. flaming or smouldering) had a statistically significant impact, with CO and N 2 O emissions increasing during smouldering combustion and CO 2 emissions decreasing. Findings on the equivalence of different emissions factor reporting methods are discussed along with the impact of our results for emissions accounting and potential sampling biases associated with our work. The primary implication {{of this study is that}} prescribed fire practices could be modified to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from forests by judicial use of ignition methods to induce flanking and backing fires over heading fires...|$|R
