500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving. All of these things {{operating}} in synchronicity: like ringtones, flat-screens, theater, cuisine, fashion, sushi.

Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you do all these things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E

Field explained his thought process on the film trailer: [...] "A trailer, is like a one-minute or whatever, mini movie that's got {{to have its own}} feeling and form to it— trailer music is very intense and gets right to the point. It sounds simple, but it's taken me some years to really figure out. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> 'rock and roll orchestra' because it's got orchestral elements and, sometimes, a choir, but it also has a lot of rock elements like the drive, the drums and the way it just builds and builds." ...|$|E

The social media campaign asked fans to sign petitions and to enter video competitions to win a concert in their town. The campaign was a success as One Direction's Facebook followers in the United States rose from 40,000 to 400,000.

Johnny Wright, who managed New Kids on the Block, Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, said: [...] "Now they are calling the radio station, and the radio station is scratching its head, saying, ‘We don't even have that record yet,’. It's almost like the return of The Beatles. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> hype, but it's positive hype because it's all real. It's not manufactured. No one paid these kids." ...|$|E

The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Maya {{culture was}} an important inspiration for Asturias. He saw a direct relationship between magical realism and Indigenous mentality, saying, “...an Indian or a mestizo in a small village might describe how he saw an enormous stone turn into a person or a giant, or a cloud turn into a stone. That is not a tangible reality but one that involves an understanding of supernatural forces. That is why when I {{have to give it}} a literary label <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "magic realism." [...] Similarly, scholar Lourdes Royano Gutiérrez argues that surrealist thought is not entirely different from the indigenous or mestizo worldview. Royano Gutiérrez describes this worldview as one in which the border between reality and dream is porous and not concrete. It is clear from both Asturias' and Gutiérrez' quotes that magical realism was seen as a suitable genre to represent an indigenous character's thoughts. The surrealist/magical realist style is exemplified in Asturias' works Mulata de tal and El señor Presidente.|$|E

In 1865, he spoke at a memorial service held for Lincoln in Concord: [...] "Old as history is, and manifold as are its tragedies, I doubt if any death has caused so much pain as this has caused, or will have caused, on its announcement."
