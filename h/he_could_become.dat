5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

5000|$|Vonnegut's sincerity, his {{willingness}} to scoff at received wisdom, is such that reading his work {{for the first time}} gives one the sense that everything else is rank hypocrisy. His opinion of human nature was low, and that low opinion applied to his heroes and his villains alike — he was endlessly disappointed in humanity and in himself, and he expressed that disappointment in a mixture of tar-black humor and deep despair. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> easily have <b>become</b> a crank, but he was too smart; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>become</b> a cynic, but there was something tender in his nature that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never quite suppress; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>become</b> a bore, but even at his most despairing he had an endless willingness to entertain his readers: with drawings, jokes, sex, bizarre plot twists, science fiction, whatever it took. -Lev Grossman, Time magazine, 2007 ...|$|R

5|$|Miller {{returned}} to Australia and led New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 1953–54. He topped the Australian first-class batting averages with 71.10, but had his poorest {{season with the}} ball, taking only 16wickets at 38.75. The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches. The season was also a transition point in Australian cricket, as Hassett retired upon return to Australia. Initially, Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy. Miller was the state captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller. At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> Test captain if he regained his form and his Test position. As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book, and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria. Johnson {{returned to}} form with 45wickets at 22.75 for the season.|$|E
