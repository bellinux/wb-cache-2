40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the diagnostic accuracy of three-dimensional MR myelography {{in the evaluation}} of traumatic injuries of the brachial plexus. METHODS: Twenty patients with clinical and electromyographic evidence of traumatic brachial plexopathy were examined with threedimensional MR myelography, conventional cervical myelography, and CT myelography 1 to 9 months after trauma. Three-dimensional MR myelography was performed on a 1. 5 -T MR unit with a constructive interference in steady state (CISS) technique. For each patient, maximum intensity myelographic projections and multiplanar reconstruction reformatted 1 -mm axial sections were obtained from the same 3 -D data set. Three-dimensional MR myelographic findings were compared with findings at cervical myelography and CT myelography. Surgical findings were available for comparison in 13 patients. RESULTS: Three-dimensional MR myelography enabled detection of meningoceles with avulsed or intact nerve roots, partial or complete radicular avulsions without disruption of the thecal <b>sac,</b> <b>dural</b> sleeve abnormalities, and dural scars. Assuming cervical myelography and CT myelography as the standards of reference, 3 -D MR myelography showed 89...|$|R

50|$|Dural ectasia is {{widening}} or ballooning of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> {{surrounding the}} spinal cord. This usually {{occurs in the}} lumbosacral region, as {{this is where the}} cerebrospinal fluid pressure is greatest, but the spinal canal can be affected in any plane.|$|E
50|$|The {{dura mater}} has two layers, or lamellae: The {{superficial}} layer (also called the periosteal layer), {{which serves as}} the skull's inner periosteum, called the endocranium; and a deep layer called the meningeal layer; the actual dura mater.

50|$|Spontaneous {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS) {{is a medical}} condition in which the {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (CSF) held {{in and around the}} human brain and spinal cord leaks out of the surrounding protective thecal or <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> of the dura, for no apparent reason. The dura, a tough, inflexible tissue, is the outermost of the three layers of the meninges, the system of membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.|$|E
5000|$|A lumbar {{puncture}} {{is done by}} positioning the person, usually lying on the side, applying local anesthetic, and inserting a needle into the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> (a sac around the spinal cord) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When this has been achieved, the [...] "opening pressure" [...] of the CSF is measured using a manometer. The pressure is normally between 6 and 18 cm water (cmH2O); in bacterial meningitis the pressure is usually elevated. In cryptococcal meningitis, intracranial pressure is markedly elevated. [...] The initial appearance of the fluid may prove {{an indication of the}} nature of the infection: cloudy CSF indicates higher levels of protein, white and red blood cells and/or bacteria, and therefore may suggest bacterial meningitis.|$|E
5000|$|Diastematomyelia is a [...] "dysraphic state" [...] {{of unknown}} {{embryonic}} origin, but is probably initiated by an accessory neurenteric canal (an additional embryonic spinal canal.) This condition {{may be an}} isolated phenomenon or {{may be associated with}} other segmental anomalies of the vertebral bodies such as spina bifida, kyphoscoliosis, butterfly vertebra, hemivertebra and block vertebrae which are observed in most of the cases. Scoliosis is identified in more than half of these patients. In most of the symptomatic patients, the spinal cord is split into halves by a bony spicule or fibrous band, each half being surrounded by a <b>dural</b> <b>sac.</b> Other conditions, such as intramedullary tumors, tethered cord, dermoids, lipoma, syringomyelia, hydromyelia and Arnold-Chiari malformations have been described in medical literature, but they are exceptionally rare.|$|E
50|$|Dural ectasia, the {{weakening}} of the connective tissue of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> encasing the spinal cord, {{can result in a}} loss of quality of life. It can be present for a long time without producing any noticeable symptoms. Symptoms that can occur are lower back pain, leg pain, abdominal pain, other neurological symptoms in the lower extremities, or headachessymptoms which usually diminish when lying flat. On X-ray however dural ectasia is not often visible in the early stages. A worsening of symptoms might warrant an MRI of the lower spine. Dural ectasia that has progressed to this stage would appear in an MRI as a dilated pouch wearing away at the lumbar vertebrae. Other spinal issues associated with Marfan syndrome include degenerative disc disease, spinal cysts and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} clinical findings. Some patients can have a narrowed canal without symptoms, and do not require therapy. Stenosis can occur as either central stenosis (the narrowing of the entire canal) or foraminal stenosis (the narrowing of the foramen through which the nerve root exits the spinal canal). Severe narrowing of the lateral portion of the canal is called “lateral recess stenosis". The ligamentum flavum (yellow ligament), an important structural component intimately adjacent to the posterior portion of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> (nerve sac) can become thickened and cause stenosis. The articular facets, also in the posterior portion of the bony spine can become thickened and enlarged causing stenosis. These changes are often called “trophic changes” or “facet trophism” in radiology reports. As the canal becomes smaller, resembling a triangular shape, it is called a [...] "trefoil" [...] canal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spinal cord}} (and brain) are {{protected}} by three layers of tissue or membranes called meninges, that surround the canal [...] The dura mater is the outermost layer, and it forms a tough protective coating. Between the dura mater and the surrounding bone of the vertebrae is a space called the epidural space. The epidural space is filled with adipose tissue, and it contains a network of blood vessels. The arachnoid mater, the middle protective layer, is named for its open, spiderweb-like appearance. The space between the arachnoid and the underlying pia mater is called the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can be sampled with a lumbar puncture, or [...] "spinal tap" [...] procedure. The delicate pia mater, the innermost protective layer, is tightly associated with {{the surface of the}} spinal cord. The cord is stabilized within the dura mater by the connecting denticulate ligaments, which extend from the enveloping pia mater laterally between the dorsal and ventral roots. The <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> ends at the vertebral level of the second sacral vertebra.|$|E
50|$|For {{the rest}} of the body, spinal nerves are {{responsible}} for somatosensory information. These arise from the spinal cord. Usually these arise as a web ("plexus") of interconnected nerves roots that arrange to form single nerves. These nerves control the functions of {{the rest of}} the body. In humans, there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves: 8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal. These nerve roots are named according to the spinal vertebrata which they are adjacent to. In the cervical region, the spinal nerve roots come out above the corresponding vertebrae (i.e., nerve root between the skull and 1st cervical vertebrae is called spinal nerve C1). From the thoracic region to the coccygeal region, the spinal nerve roots come out below the corresponding vertebrae. It is important to note that this method creates a problem when naming the spinal nerve root between C7 and T1 (so it is called spinal nerve root C8). In the lumbar and sacral region, the spinal nerve roots travel within the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and they travel below the level of L2 as the cauda equina.|$|E
5000|$|The {{spinal cord}} is {{protected}} by three layers of tissue, called spinal meninges, that surround the canal. The dura mater is the outermost layer, and it forms a tough protective coating. Between the dura mater and the surrounding bone of the vertebrae is a space called the epidural space. The epidural space is filled with adipose tissue, and it contains a network of blood vessels. The arachnoid mater is the middle protective layer. Its name {{comes from the fact}} that the tissue has a spiderweb-like appearance. The space between the arachnoid and the underlying pia mater is called the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The medical procedure known as a lumbar puncture (or [...] "spinal tap") involves use of a needle to withdraw cerebrospinal fluid from the subarachnoid space, usually from the lumbar region of the spine. The pia mater is the innermost protective layer. It is very delicate and it is tightly associated with the surface of the spinal cord. The cord is stabilized within the dura mater by the connecting denticulate ligaments, which extend from the enveloping pia mater laterally between the dorsal and ventral roots. The <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> ends at the vertebral level of the second sacral vertebra.|$|E
50|$|Diastematomyelia usually occurs between 9th {{thoracic}} and 1st sacral {{levels of}} the spinal column with most being {{at the level of}} the upper lumbar vertebra. Cervical diastematomyelia is a very rare entity. The extent (or length of spinal cord involved) varies from one affected individual to another. In approximately 60% of patients with diastematomyelia, the two hemicords, each covered by an intact layer of pia arachnoid, travel through a single subarachnoid space surrounded by a single <b>dural</b> <b>sac.</b> Each hemicord has its own anterior spinal artery. This form of diastematomyelia is not accompanied by any bony spur or fibrous band and is rarely symptomatic unless hydromyelia or tethering is present. The other 40% of patients have a bony spur or a fibrous band that passes through the two hemicords. In these cases, the dura and arachnoid are split into two separate dural and arachnoidal sacs, each surrounding the corresponding hemicord which are not necessarily symmetric. Each hemicord contains a central canal, one dorsal horn (giving rise to a dorsal nerve root), and one ventral horn (giving rise to a ventral nerve root.) One study showed the bony spur typically situated at the most inferior aspect of the dural cleft. They advised that if the imaging appears to show otherwise, a second spur (present in about 5% of patients with diastematomyelia) is likely to be present.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Forward {{shifting}} of the posterior cervical <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> {{is the most}} important sign in diagnosing Hirayama disease but can also be seen in normal subjects, causing potential diagnostic dilemma. We aim to explore the degree of forward displacement of posterior <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> in normal subjects compared to that with Hirayama disease. Materials and methods: 50 healthy male teenagers and 3 patients with Hirayama disease were recruited into the control group and patient group, respectively. MR imaging of the cervical spine was performed in both neutral and flexion positions for all subjects, with the following parameters measured: maximal distance of forward {{shifting of}} posterior <b>dural</b> <b>sac,</b> dimension of <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and spinal cord. Results: Forward shifting of the posterior cervical <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> was depicted in 46 % of normal subjects upon flexion position but without associated cord compression due to intrinsic expansion of the spinal canal volume. This intrinsic compensatory mechanism was inadequate in diseased patients leading to cord compression with significant increment in ratio of anteroposterior diameter of forward displacement of posterior dural wall/anteroposterior diameter of spinal canal ("x/y"), and decrement in ratio of anteroposterior diameter of spinal cord/perpendicular transverse diameter of spinal cord ("a/b"). Conclusion: Depicting of forward shifting of posterior <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> alone on flexion position cannot reliably diagnose Hirayama disease, which should be established only if there is forward shifting of posterior <b>dural</b> <b>sac,</b> plus increased ratio of x/y and decreased ratio of a/b on flexion position from associated mass effect on the spinal cord. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Objectives: To analyze {{the changes in}} the heights of the intervertebral disc and neural foramen, and the diameters and areas of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and lateral recess following anterior lumbar interbody fusion and posterior fixation in lumbar degenerative dis-ease. Summary of Literature Review: Anterior lumbar interbody fusion distracts from the height of the intervertebral disc and neur-al foramen and increase the area of the spinal canal. Materials and Methods: A mini-open anterior lumbar interbody fusion and posterior fixation was performed on 40 cases between January 1999 and March 2002. The measured factors included the height of the intervertebral disc and neural fora-men, the midsagittal and lateral diameters of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac,</b> the area of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and the diameter of the lateral recess. These were measured with calipers in 1 mm reconstructive computed tomography images before and 6 months after the anterior lum-bar interbody fusion.

A total of 126 spine MRIs (79 patients with AIS and 47 control subjects) were included in this retrospective analysis (age range 7 – 25  years, 62 % were females). <b>Dural</b> <b>sac</b> diameter (DSD) and vertebral body diameter (VBD) were estimated and <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> ratio (DSR = DSD/VBD) was calculated at T 5 and L 3. DSR at T 5 and L 3 were 0. 69  ±  0. 12, and 0. 52  ±  0. 10, respectively, in patients with AIS compared with 0. 62  ±  0. 11, and 0. 44  ±  0. 07, respectively, in controls (P =  0. 001 at T 5 and < 0. 001 at L 3). Our estimated cut-off values for DSR were 0. 84 and 0. 58 at T 5 and L 3, respectively.

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} MRI is the {{modality}} of choice when diagnosing spinal stenosis {{but it also}} shows that stenosis is prevalent in asymptomatic subjects over 60. The relationship between preoperative health-related quality of life, functional status, leg and back pain, and the objectively measured <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> area in single and multilevel stenosis is unknown. We assessed this relationship in a prospective study. Patients and methods The cohort included 109 consecutive patients with central spinal stenosis operated on with decompressive laminectomy or laminotomy. Preoperatively, all patients completed the questionnaires for EQ- 5 D, SF- 36, Oswestry disability index (ODI), estimated walking distance and leg and back pain (VAS). The cross-sectional area of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> was measured at relevant disc levels in mm(2), and spondylolisthesis was measured in mm. For comparison, {{the area of the}} most narrow level, the number of levels with <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> area < 70 mm(2), and spondylolisthesis were studied. Results Before surgery, patients with central spinal stenosis had low HRLQoL and functional status, and high pain levels. Patients with multilevel stenosis had better general health (p = 0. 04) and less leg and back pain despite having smaller <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> area than patients with single-level stenosis. There was a poor correlation between walking distance, ODI, the SF- 36, EQ- 5 D, and leg and back pain levels {{on the one hand and}} <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> area on the other. Women more often had multilevel spinal stenosis (p = 0. 05) and spondylolisthesis (p < 0. 001).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the transverse and longitudinal distensibility of the posterior human lumbar dura mater. Results are compared with previous literature on biomechanical property studies. Possible clinical implications were also examined. METHODS:Samples of human <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> were obtained from autopsy studies in three adult male cadavers. <b>Dural</b> <b>sac</b> samples were sectioned longitudinally to measure transverse and longitudinal distensibility, thickness and circumference. RESULTS:It was recorded that the posterior lumbar dura mater was easily distensible only in the transverse direction. The longitudinal force required to distend and rupture the posterior lumbar dura mater samples is 3. 5 to 6. 7 {{times greater than the}} force to produce a transversal rupture. CONCLUSION: Depending on the local cerebrospinal fluid pressure, the documented easier transverse distensibility of the posterior lumbar dura mater may allow greater contact of the lumbar <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> with the wall of the lumbar verterbral canal.

Sixteen patients with CDH satisfied the inclusion criteria. Before surgery the patients underwent cervical spine MRI, and the distance between the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and herniated disc was measured. An assessment was performed by MRI immediately after surgery, measuring the distance between <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and medial border of discectomy (DSMD). The preoperative average distance between the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and peak of the herniated disc (DSPHD) was 3. 87 ± 1. 32 [*]mm; preoperative average distance between <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and medial border of herniated disc (DSMHD) was 6. 91 ± 1. 21 [*]mm and an average distance of postoperative DSMD was 5. 41 ± 1. 40 [*]mm. Postoperative VAS of neck and shoulder pain was significantly decreased but JOA was significantly increased in each time point compared with preoperative ones. In summary, the effective range of PPFECD to treat paramedian CDH was 5. 41 ± 1. 40 [*]mm, indicating that DSMHD and DSPHD were within 6. 91 ± 1. 21 [*]mm and 3. 87 ± 1. 32 [*]mm, respectively.

40|$|Multiple <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> {{and spinal}} cord {{indentations}} are often observed on MRI in cervical spondylotic myelopathy. However, {{it is rare}} {{that all of the}} indented levels contribute to clinical symptoms. Pathological changes in cervical compression myelopathy have previously been reported. Still the critical degree of spinal cord compression needed to induce pathologic changes is unknown. To clearfy this matter the relationships between the spinal cord as well as the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> indentations, and pathological changes of the cervical spinal cord were investigated in cadavers. Sixty-eight cadavers were used for this study. The <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and the spinal cord were observed especially regarding presence of indentations. The spinal cord was removed from the specimens in order to perform histopathological examination. The indentations of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and the spinal cord were observed at C 4 / 5, C 5 / 6, C 6 / 7 and C 3 / 4 intervertebral levels in order of incidence. However, all of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> indentations were not correlated with spinal cord indentations. Pathological changes in the spinal cord were observed in two specimens with less than 30 % of the AP compression ratio. One specimen with 20. 9 % in the AP compression ratio had remarkable histopathological changes. In the other specimen with 29. 6 % in the AP compression ratio, diffuse demyelination was distributed in the lateral white matter. The results indicate that the critical degree of the AP compression ratio is 30 % to induce histopathological changes in the spinal cord. If a spinal cord indentation in the patient with cervical spondylotic myelopathy on imaging, i. e.

40|$|Early {{postoperative}} MRI after spinal {{surgery is}} difficult to interpret because of confounding postoperative mass effects and frequent occurrence of epidural hematomas. Purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate prevalence, extent and significance of hematoma in the first postoperative week in asymptomatic patients after decompression for lumbar stenosis and to determine the degree of clinically significant dura compression by comparing with the patients with postoperative symptoms. MRI was performed in 30 asymptomatic patients (47 levels) {{in the first week}} after lumbar spine decompression for degenerative stenosis. Eleven patients requiring surgical revision (16 levels) for symptomatic early postoperative hematoma were used for comparison. In both groups the cross-sectional area of the maximum dural compression (bony stenosis and <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> expansion) was measured preoperatively and postoperatively by an experienced radiologist. Epidural hematoma was seen in 42. 5 % in asymptomatic patients (20 / 47 levels). The median area of postoperative hematoma at the operated level was 176  mm 2 in asymptomatic patients and 365  mm 2 in symptomatic patients. The median cross-sectional area of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> at the operated level was 128. 5 and 0  mm 2 in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, respectively, at the site of maximal compression. In the symptomatic group 75 % of the patients had a maximal postoperative <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> area of 58. 5  mm 2 or less, whereas in the asymptomatic group 75 % of patients with epidural hematoma had an area of 75  mm 2 or more. The size of hematoma and the degree of <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> compression were significantly larger in patients with symptoms needing surgical revision. <b>Dural</b> <b>sac</b> area of less than 75  mm 2 in early postoperative MRI was found to be the threshold for clinical significance...|$|E

Sonography of lumbosacral spine was performed in 108 neurologically normal children (mean age = 2. 1 years) using 5 - to 12 -MHz linear transducer. M-mode was applied at the posterior and anterior subarachnoid spaces just below the conus medullaris and at the L 5 /S 1 <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> to document cerebrospinal fluid pulsation of the cauda equina. The oscillation rate and amplitude were measured. Sixteen children with spinal cord anomalies (6 with low tethered cord and 10 postoperative cases of low tethered cord) were also examined. The mean posterior/anterior subarachnoid spaces of normal children were 2. 6 mm/ 1. 8 mm at the terminal <b>dural</b> <b>sac.</b> The mean oscillation amplitude and rate of the cauda equina were 0. 52 mm and 121 /min at the L 5 /S 1 <b>dural</b> <b>sac.</b> The oscillation amplitude at this level demonstrated a statistically significant difference between normal and abnormal groups. In conclusion, we recommend taking the fifth percentile of the normal oscillation amplitude at the L 5 /S 1 <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> as a reference. Any oscillation amplitude of less than 0. 3 mm in a symptomatic patient should alert the clinician to possible cord abnormality, cord tethering, or retethering in postoperative cases. © 2004 by Elsevier Inc.

40|$|During {{myelography}} {{we observed}} the contrast {{material in the}} spinal subarachnoid space while we changed: (1) the intracranial blood volume by CO 2 inhalation, hyperventilation, and jugular vein compression; (2) the intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure by forced expiration with glottis closed; and (3) the CSF volume by withdrawals and reinjections of fluid. The spinal <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> enlarges with increases in volume of both intracranial blood and CSF. It partially collapses with reductions in volume of both intracranial blood and CSF. With increases in intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure, the thoracolumbar sac partially collapses, while the cervical sac enlarges. From these observations we conclude that the spinal <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> is a dynamic structure, readily changing its capacity in response to prevailing pressure gradients across its walls. It acts as a reservoir for CSF, which moves to and fro through the foramen magnum in response to changes in cerebral blood flow.

Treadmill tests were performed and the area of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and neuroforamina was examined with MRI for the narrowest spinal segment. VAS and ODI were used for clinical assessment. The median age of the patients was 67  years. In the narrowest spinal segment the median area of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> was 91  mm 2. The median ODI was 66 per cent. The median walking distance in the treadmill test was 70  m. The distance reached in the treadmill test correlated with the area of the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> (Spearman’s ρ =  0. 53) and ODI (ρ = − 0. 51), but not with the area of the neuroforamina and VAS. The distance reached in the treadmill test predicts the grade of stenosis in MRI but has a limited diagnostic importance for the level of clinical symptoms in lumbar spinal stenosis...|$|E
40|$|AimTo {{develop and}} {{validate}} a simple, reproducible method to assess <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> size using standard imaging technology. Materials and methodsThis study was institutional review board-approved. Two readers, blinded to the diagnoses, measured anterior–posterior (AP) and transverse (TR) <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> diameter (DSD), and AP vertebral body diameter (VBD) of the lumbar vertebrae using MRI images from 53 control patients with pre-existing MRI examinations, 19 prospectively MRI-imaged healthy controls, and 24 patients with Marfan syndrome with prior MRI or CT lumbar spine imaging. Statistical analysis utilized linear and logistic regression, Pearson correlation, and {{receiver operating characteristic}} (ROC) curves. ResultsAP-DSD and TR-DSD measurements were reproducible between two readers (r =  0. 91 and 0. 87, respectively). DSD (L 1 –L 5) was not different {{between male and female}} controls in the AP or TR plane (p =  0. 43; p =  0. 40, respectively), and did not vary by age (p =  0. 62; p =  0. 25) or height (p =  0. 64; p =  0. 32). AP-VBD was greater in males versus females (p =  1. 5  ×  10 − 8), resulting in a smaller <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> ratio (DSR) (DSD/VBD) in males (p =  5. 8  ×  10 − 6). Marfan patients had larger AP-DSDs and TR-DSDs than controls (p =  5. 9  ×  10 − 9; p =  6. 5  ×  10 − 9, respectively). Compared to DSR, AP-DSD and TR-DSD better discriminate Marfan from control subjects based on area under the curve (AUC) values from unadjusted ROCs (AP-DSD p <  0. 01; TR-DSD p =  0. 04). ConclusionIndividual vertebrae and L 1 –L 5 (average) AP-DSD and TR-DSD measurements are simple, reliable, and reproducible for quantitating <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> size without needing to control for gender, age, or height...|$|E
30|$|A judicious follow-up, {{properly}} hastened in case {{of painful}} symptomatology and/or neurological variations, brings to a fast and effective detection of instability; in such cases, when the <b>dural</b> <b>sac</b> and neuroforamina have been previously decompressed, a minimally invasive lumbar arthrodesis can definitely resolve the problem.|$|E
