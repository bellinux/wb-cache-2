5|$|After an {{incident}} involving sentries on the Greek-Bulgarian border in October 1925, fighting began {{between the two}} countries. Three days after the initial incident, <b>Greek</b> troops invaded Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government ordered its troops to make only token resistance, and evacuated between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people from the border region, trusting the League to settle the dispute. The League condemned the <b>Greek</b> invasion, and called for both <b>Greek</b> withdrawal and compensation to Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{had planned}} to settle <b>Greek</b> colonists on Bahrain, and {{although}} {{it is not clear that}} this happened on the scale he envisaged, Bahrain became very much part of the Hellenised world: the language of the upper classes was <b>Greek</b> (although Aramaic was in everyday use), while Zeus was worshipped in the form of the Arabian sun-god Shams. Bahrain even became the site of <b>Greek</b> athletic contests.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Greek</b> {{continued}} as {{the language of}} the Byzantine Empire, linguistic distribution in the East was more complex. A Greek-speaking majority lived in the <b>Greek</b> peninsula and islands, western Anatolia, major cities, and some coastal areas. Like <b>Greek</b> and Latin, the Thracian language was of Indo-European origin, as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Albanian is often seen as the descendant of Illyrian, although this hypothesis has been challenged by some linguists, who maintain that it derives from Dacian or Thracian. (Illyrian, Dacian, and Thracian, however, may have formed a subgroup or a Sprachbund; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Various Afroasiatic languages—primarily Coptic in Egypt, and Aramaic in Syria and Mesopotamia—were never replaced by <b>Greek.</b> The international use of <b>Greek,</b> however, was one factor enabling the spread of Christianity, as indicated for example by the use of <b>Greek</b> for the Epistles of Paul.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Greek</b> was {{in common}} use around the Mediterranean and into Asia Minor even beyond Imperial borders, {{linguistic}} {{distribution in the}} eastern part of the Empire was complex. Now-extinct languages in Anatolia included Galatian (the form of Celtic introduced by invading Gauls in the 3rd century BC), Phrygian, Pisidian, and Cappadocian, attested by Imperial-era inscriptions. Christian sources also mention the survival of Galatian, Cappadocian, Mysian, and Isaurian in Asia Minor. Like <b>Greek</b> and Latin, these are categorized as Indo-European. Phrygian is not named as a language in a literary text until the 6th century, but is preserved in about a hundred funerary inscriptions in <b>Greek</b> script, most accompanied by <b>Greek</b> text as well and dating from the 3rd century. A Cappadocian accent in speaking <b>Greek</b> seems to be mentioned in a few sources.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about this ethnic subgroup.

25|$|All {{of these}} events {{have led to the}} <b>Greeks</b> emigrating from both islands.

In 2000, there were around 400 <b>Greeks,</b> while the Turks were around 8000. Most of the former <b>Greeks</b> of Imbros and Tenedos are in diaspora in Greece, the United States, and Australia.|$|R
5|$|Although Jesuit {{schools are}} not obliged to {{disassociate}} from <b>Greek</b> systems, many do, and Georgetown University officially recognizes and funds {{only one of the}} many <b>Greek</b> organizations on campus, Alpha Phi Omega, the national co-ed community service fraternity.

Additionally, Georgetown University students are affiliated, in some cases, with fraternities at other nearby universities and colleges.|$|E
5|$|Among Imperial {{historian}}s {{who wrote in}} <b>Greek</b> are Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the Jewish historian Josephus, and the senator Cassius Dio. Other major <b>Greek</b> authors of the Empire include the biographer and antiquarian Plutarch, the geographer Strabo, and the rhetorician and satirist Lucian. Popular <b>Greek</b> romance novels {{were part of the}} development of long-form fiction works, represented in Latin by the Satyricon of Petronius and The Golden Ass of Apuleius.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} Imperial court, {{administration}} and military, the primary language {{used in the}} eastern Roman provinces even before {{the decline of the}} Western Empire was <b>Greek,</b> having been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin. Following Rome's conquest of the east its 'Pax Romana', inclusionist political practices and development of public infrastructure, facilitated the further spreading and entrenchment of <b>Greek</b> language in the east. Indeed, early on {{in the life of the}} Roman Empire, <b>Greek</b> had become the common language of the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations. <b>Greek</b> for a time became diglossic with the spoken language, known as Koine (eventually evolving into Demotic <b>Greek),</b> used alongside an older written form until Koine won out as the spoken and written standard.|$|E

BGSU is demolishing its current <b>Greek</b> Town Homes located on old Fraternity Row, old Sorority Row, and the North and South <b>Greek</b> Conklin buildings while they plan and construct a new <b>Greek</b> Village which will consolidate all of the organizations together on the West side of campus against Wooster Street. The plan consists of 10 buildings divided into 33 sections consisting of 4-Bedroom, 12-Bedroom, and 18-Bedroom style homes. The site lies on top of old Fraternity Row and the North and South Conklin building locations. The demolition was scheduled for the fall of 2014 and the new <b>Greek</b> Village finished {{in the fall of}} 2016.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University {{is home to}} many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational <b>Greek</b> organizations.

The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations {{within each of the}} three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural <b>Greek</b> Council.

5|$|Following its {{adoption}} as {{the court}} language of Philip II of Macedon's regime, authors of ancient Macedonia wrote their works in Koine <b>Greek,</b> the lingua franca of late Classical and Hellenistic Greece. Rare textual evidence indicates that the native Macedonian language was either a dialect of <b>Greek</b> similar to Thessalian <b>Greek</b> and Northwestern <b>Greek,</b> or a language closely related to <b>Greek.</b> The vast majority of surviving inscriptions from ancient Macedonia were written in Attic <b>Greek</b> and its successor Koine. Attic (and later Koine) <b>Greek</b> was the preferred language of the Ancient Macedonian army, although {{it is known that}} Alexander the Great once shouted an emergency order in Macedonian to his royal guards during the drinking party where he killed Cleitus the Black. Macedonian became extinct in either the Hellenistic or the Roman period, and entirely replaced by Koine <b>Greek.</b>|$|E
