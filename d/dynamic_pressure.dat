5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> outside the {{aircraft}} require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, {{have criticized}} the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale; however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 V1, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers' chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> in a dive. The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to the frame and longeron, to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.|$|E

40|$|Parachutes {{used for}} Mars landing {{missions}} are only certified for deployment at Mars behind blunt bodies flying at low angles of attack, Mach numbers up to 2. 2, and <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{of up to}} 800 Pa. NASA is currently studying entry vehicle concepts for future robotic missions to Mars that would require parachutes to be deployed at higher Mach numbers and <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures.</b> This paper demonstrates the need for expanding the parachute deployment envelope, and describes a three-phase technology development activity that has been initiated to address the need.

5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, windsocks indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure,</b> which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure,</b> or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
25|$|At about 80 seconds, {{the rocket}} {{experienced}} maximum <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> (max Q). The <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> on a rocket varies with air density and {{the square of}} relative velocity.

40|$|AbstractThe fluid-structure {{interaction}} behaviour of a cropped {{delta wing}} is investigated using a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) based aeroelastic solver in time domain. Here, an N-S based finite volume solver is coupled with a finite element based linear and nonlinear structural solvers to study the nonlinear aeroelastic characteristics of the delta wing over a range of <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures.</b> The amplitude and frequency obtained from the present coupled solver at various <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> are compared with the available experimental and computational results...|$|R
25|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> is the {{kinetic energy}} per unit volume of a fluid particle. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is in fact}} one {{of the terms of}} Bernoulli's equation, which can be derived from the {{conservation}} of energy for a fluid in motion. In simplified cases, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> is equal to the difference between the stagnation pressure and the static pressure.|$|E
25|$|If {{the fluid}} in {{question}} {{can be considered}} an ideal gas (which is generally the case for air), the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> can be expressed {{as a function of}} fluid pressure and Mach number.|$|E
25|$|The <b>dynamic</b> <b>{{pressure}},</b> {{along with}} the static pressure and the pressure due to elevation, is used in Bernoulli's principle as an energy balance on a closed system.

50|$|The HEAT-H2 Test Unit is an arc-heated {{aerothermal}} tunnel providing high-enthalpy flow at high Mach {{numbers and}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> simulating hypersonic flight at pressure altitudes up to 120 atm. H2 utilitzes an N-4 Huels-type arc heater to generate high-temperature, high-pressure air for expansion through a hypersonic nozzle into the evacuated test cell.|$|R
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure,</b> so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|Solids, liquids, and gases have stress fields. Static fluids support {{normal stress}} but will flow under shear stress. Moving viscous fluids can support shear stress (<b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure).</b> Solids can support both shear and normal stress, with ductile {{materials}} failing under shear and brittle materials failing under normal stress. All materials have temperature dependent variations in stress-related properties, and non-Newtonian materials have rate-dependent variations.|$|E
25|$|If we were {{to divide}} the <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> by the product of fluid density and {{acceleration}} due to gravity, g, the result is called velocity head, which is used in head equations like the one used for pressure head and hydraulic head.

An alternative to velocity head is dynamic head.|$|E

25|$|The planing {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces that are consistent with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E
25|$|On an orbital mission, the Atlas' rocket engines were ignited {{four seconds}} before lift-off. The launch vehicle {{was held to}} the ground by clamps and then {{released}} when sufficient thrust was built up at lift-off (A). After 30 seconds of flight, the point of maximum <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressure</b> against the vehicle was reached, at which the astronaut felt heavy vibrations. After 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the two outboard booster engines shut down and were released with the aft skirt, leaving the center sustainer engine running (B). At this point, the launch escape system was no longer needed, and was separated from the spacecraft by its jettison rocket (C). The space vehicle moved gradually to a horizontal attitude until, {{at an altitude of}} , the sustainer engine shut down and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit (D). This happened after 5 minutes and 10 seconds in a direction pointing east, whereby the spacecraft would gain speed from the rotation of the Earth. Here the spacecraft fired the three posigrade rockets for a second to separate it from the launch vehicle. Just before orbital insertion and sustainer engine cutoff, g-loads peaked at 8 g (6 g for a suborbital flight). In orbit, the spacecraft automatically turned 180°, pointed the retropackage forward and its nose 14.5° downward and kept this attitude {{for the rest of the}} orbital phase of the mission, as it was necessary for communication with the ground.|$|E

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} structural solver {{has been}} implemented internally within the NASA FUN 3 D {{computational fluid dynamics}} code, allowing for some new aeroelastic capabilities. Using a modal representation of the structure, a set of differential or differential-algebraic equations are derived for general thin structures with geometric nonlinearities. ODEPACK and LAPACK routines are linked with FUN 3 D, and the nonlinear equations are solved at each CFD time step. The existing predictor-corrector method is retained, whereby the structural solution is updated after mesh deformation. The nonlinear solver is validated using a test case for a flexible aeroshell at transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flow conditions. Agreement with linear theory is seen for the static aeroelastic solutions at relatively low <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures,</b> but structural nonlinearities limit deformation amplitudes at high <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures.</b> No flutter was found {{at any of the}} tested trajectory points, though LCO may be possible in the transonic regime...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an analytical {{assessment of the}} flutter character of an unclassified National Aerospace Plane configuration known as the demonstrator. Linear subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic analysis indicate that the vehicle is prone to body-freedom flutter resulting from the decrease in vibration frequency of the all-moveable wing at high flight <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures.</b> As the wing-pivot frequency decreases, it couples with the vehicle short-period mode resulting in dynamic instability. A similar instability sometimes occurs when the pivot mode couples with the fuselage-bending mode. Also assessed, for supersonic flight conditions, are configuration variations that include relocation of the wing further aft on the lifting-body fuselage, {{and the addition of}} body flaps {{to the rear of the}} vehicle. These changes are destabilizing because they result in severe wing-pivot/fuselage-bending instabilities at <b>dynamic</b> <b>pressures</b> lower than the instabilities indicated for the original demonstrator. Finally, a two-point wing support and actuation system concept is proposed for the National Aerospace Plane, which if developed may (according to cursory analysis) enhance overall stability...|$|R
