40|$|Calcitonin {{receptor}}-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP 1) {{comprise a}} receptor for calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and <b>intermedin.</b> Although CGRP is widely {{expressed in the}} nervous system, less {{is known about the}} localization of CLR and RAMP 1. To localize these proteins, we raised antibodies to CLR and RAMP 1. Antibodies specifically interacted with CLR and RAMP 1 in HEK cells coexpressing rat CLR and RAMP 1, determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Fluorescent CGRP specifically bound to the surface of these cells and CGRP, CLR, and RAMP 1 internalized into the same endosomes. CLR was prominently localized in nerve fibers of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, muscularis externa and lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract, and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of rats. CLR was detected at low levels in the soma of enteric, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and spinal neurons. RAMP 1 was also localized to enteric and DRG neurons and the dorsal horn. CLR and RAMP 1 were detected in perivascular nerves and arterial smooth muscle. Nerve fibers containing CGRP and <b>intermedin</b> were closely associated with CLR fibers in the gastrointestinal tract and dorsal horn, and CGRP and CLR colocalized in DRG neurons.

40|$|Introduction: Elevated {{blood levels}} of Cardiac Troponin (cTnT) are the gold {{standard}} for diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However cTnT is not detectable for 3 - 4 hours after symptom onset; an early marker of myocardial ischaemia is therefore desirable. The peptide Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) is released from nerve endings during myocardial ischaemia and has cardioprotective effects. <b>Intermedin</b> (IMD), from the same family, is elevated in myocardial infarction and oxidative stress in animal studies. Methods: I enrolled 81 patients with chest pain, suspected to have acute coronary syndrome to a chest pain study (1). Samples were taken on admission, at 12 hours after pain, the next day and the following day. Samples were analysed for <b>intermedin,</b> & CGRP (radioimmunoassay) and High-Sensitivity troponin (HsTnT). Study 2 assessed 30 patients undergoing Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI) with 6 controls. Samples taken, pre, 1, 5, 10, 30, 120 or 240 minutes post balloon inflation and next day. Results: Study 1 - <b>Intermedin</b> showed a non-significant trend towards elevation in ACS patients. In those patients who were (cTnT) negative « 0. 03 ng/ml) on presentation, IMD & CGRP were significantly elevated. CGRP was significantly elevated at 12 hours after ACS onset and appeared to remain elevated for 48 hours. HsTnT identified more ACS on an admission sample than cTnT. Study 2 - IMD showed a small but significant rise at ten minutes after balloon inflation. HsTnT was significantly elevated the next day following PC!. Neither marker was related to number of stents/inflations, balloon pressure or length of inflation. Conclusions: The novel peptide IMD is elevated in ischaemia and infarction, but the rise is too small to be clinically useful. CGRP had a significant rise in ACS patients, but again of a small magnitude. The time course of their elevation is incompletely defined. HsTnT is more sensitive in ACS than cTnT on a presenting blood sample. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

However, whether IMD protects against diabetic myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury is unknown. METHODS: Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin in Sprague [...] Dawley rats. Animals were subjected to MI via left circumflex artery ligation for 30 minutes followed by 2 hours R. IMD was administered formally 10 minutes before R. Outcome measures included left ventricular function, oxidative stress, cellular death, infarct size, and inflammation. RESULTS: IMD levels were significantly decreased in diabetic rats compared to control animals. After MI/R, diabetic rats manifested elevated <b>intermedin</b> levels, both in plasma (64. 95 +/- 4. 84 pmol/L, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and myocardial tissue (9. 8 +/- 0. 60 pmol/L, p 3 ̆c 0. 01) compared to pre-MI control values (43. 62 +/- 3. 47 pmol/L and 4. 4 +/- 0. 41).

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 I used program CAPTURE {{to analyze}} 1, 535 data sets for 33 North American species of small mammals for sources of {{variation}} in capture probabilities and to characterize species-specific responses to markrecapture trapping. CAPTURE incorporates seven models to account for all possible combinations of heterogeneity (h), behavioral response (b), and time effects (t) on capture probabilities, {{in addition to the}} null model (M₀) which requires equal capture-probabilities. The following information was tabulated for each data set: 1) results of the closure test; 2) probabilities of fit of the data to the models; 3) model-selection criteria; 4) abundance estimates, confidence intervals, and estimated probabilities of capture and recapture; and 5) mean maximum-distance moved. Population closure was not rejected 70 - 100 % of the time for 30 species when models M₀ or M[subscript h] were chosen by CAPTURE. Differences within families were significant only for Heteromyidae. Frequency of closure decreased significantly as length of trapping session increased for 4 of 5 species for which I performed the test. Model M₀ was selected most often by CAPTURE as the most appropriate model for most species, which merely reflected the inability of the program to detect unequal probabilities of capture from small data sets. However, heterogeneity was evident in Sylvilagus floridanus, Tamias townsendii, Spermophilus richardsonii, Glaucomys sabrinus, Peroqnathus parvus, Chaetodipus <b>intermedins,</b> Dipodomvs merriami, Dipodomvs ordii, Reithrodontomys spp., Peromvscus maniculatus, Sigmodon hispidus, Clethrionomys spp., Microtus californicus, and M. pennsvlvanicus. Strong behavioral responses (trap proneness or trap shyness) were detected in T. townsendii, S. richardsonii, R. megalotis, P. maniculatus, and M. pennsvlvanicus. Time effects, particularly with heterogeneity, were apparent for Sylvilagus nuttallii, Tamias minimus, D. ordii, C. gapperi, M. californicus, and M. pennsvlvanicus. Sylvilagus spp., Tamias amoenus, G. sabrinus, Perognathus longimembris, and Microtus ochrogaster were trap shy. Tamias striatus, J_. townsendii, S. richardsonii, P. parvus, R. megalotis, P. maniculatus, Peromvscus truei, S. hispidus, M. californicus, and M. pennsvlvanicus were trap prone. Murid species had the highest estimated probabilities of capture, followed in decreasing order by heteromyids, sciurids, and leporids. Estimates of abundance from model M[subscript h] were greatest and often significantly greater than those from, in decreasing order, M[subscript bh], M[subscript b], M₀, and M[subscript t]. Coefficients of variation of abundance estimates from models M[subscript b] and M[subscript bh] were usually twice as great as those from models M₀, M[subscript h], and M[subscript t], and the coefficients of variation from M[subscript bh] were significantly greater than those from M[subscript t] and M₀ Coefficient of variation is not an appropriate measure of the reliability of abundance estimates from CAPTURE models. Abundance estimates from the Jolly-Seber model were almost always less than those from CAPTURE models, regardless of which CAPTURE model was the most appropriate, and they rarely exceeded the total number of animals captured during the trapping session. The negative biases of these estimates were so great that they more likely were due to unequal probabilities of capture rather than to emigration...|$|R

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly recognised that natural enemies in arable land, particularly polyphagous predators such as carabid beetles, may help to suppress populations of pests, and that appropriate management of such predators {{may lead to a}} satisfactory level of pest control. Previous work has shown that a polyphagous carabid predator, Pterostichus melanarius, is capable of affecting the spatial and temporal dynamics of slug pest populations. This project is an examination of how P. melanarius affects the survival, behaviour and dispersion of two important slug pests, Deroceras reticulatum and Arion <b>intermedins,</b> and how this information applies to spatial and temporal data previously obtained from the field. Deroceras reticulatum, but not Arion intermedius, elicited a variety of anti-predator behaviour in the presence of substrates previously exposed to the predator. The movements of slugs in arenas, incorporating a zone containing paper upon which the predatory beetles had previously been maintained and a control zone, were recorded at intervals. Significantly more slugs of all the size classes tested accumulated on the control half of arenas after 24 hours, with small slugs being quickest to respond. Slugs avoided paper exposed to both male and female beetles. Slugs also avoided paper exposed to another predatory carabid, Pterostichus madidus, but not to Harpalus affinis, a phytophagous carabid. Slugs did not respond to paper that had been exposed to beetles and then stored for five days prior to the test. Changes in parameters of movement of slugs when in the presence of P. melanarius chemicals were detected using a video-tracking system. These changes are consistent with a kinesis that would enable slugs to rapidly escape from areas where beetles were recently present. Despite this no changes in the rate of dispersion of D. reticulatum juveniles was detected in mini-plots previously exposed to P. melanarius. However, adult D. reticulatum reduced feeding and egg-laying and increased refuge on soil previously exposed to P. melanarius. Chemicals on the exterior of P. melanarius were isolated and two compounds were found to reduce feeding by D. reticulatum on leaf discs compared to control discs. One of these chemicals is currently being analysed using mass spectroscopy and NMR to determine it's structure and identity. It was concluded that D. reticulatum have evolved behavioural responses to chemical cues from either this generalist carabid predator in particular, or carabid beetles generally, many species of which include molluscs in their diets. During a video-tracking study of beetle movements, some evidence was found for the detection and response of beetles to slug mucus, and amputation work suggested that the palps may be important in slug detection. Previous feeding experience was found not to influence prey choice in P. melanarius during a food choice experiment, with beetles always selecting a mixed diet when offered. Analysis of spatial data showed that slug size, but not beetle sex, was important in the spatial relationship between the predator and the prey, and this agrees with results from the laboratory experiments of slug behaviour. This work has added to the evidence provided by other studies that some generalist predators can have significant effects on the dynamics of pest populations and therefore may become useful biocontrol agents for pests if effectively managed. The implications of this work in the field of predator-prey ecology and for the efficacy of P. melanarius as a biological control agent of slugs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Among an {{interesting}} collection of Invertebrate animals from Sabang-bay (Poeloe Weh) brought together by Mr. G. A. J. van der Sande, Surgeon in the Dutch naval service, and presented by {{him to the}} Leyden Museum, {{there is a large}} Anemone, belonging to the genus Discosoma. About this specimen Mr. van der Sande writes: »in loosening the Anemone from the coral, upon which it was fixed, suddenly some small fishes came in sight and made an attack on the hands of the hospital-waiter who assisted me and on those of my self. Involuntary we were frightened and retracted our hands, and as the trouble of the water ceased, we saw small white-and-brown banded fishes hovering above the Anemone, which every now and then retired between the tentacula and made a renewed attack as soon as we again tried to release the Anemone from the coral”. According to Miss Dr. C. Popta, who examined the fishes, they proved to be young individuals of Amphiprion <b>intermedins</b> Schleg. It {{is not the first time}} that such a relation is stated between Anemones and fishes; more than thirty years ago Dr. C. Collingwood already made a similar observation on the reefs of the China-Sea 1). In the vicinity of the isle of Labuan he met with a gigantic specimen of an Anemone and always he noticed a small fish, banded with three broad rings of white and orange alternately, hovering in the water close by the Anemone and always returning to the same spot. Supposing that there was some connexion between them, »he raked with a stick in the body of the Anemone, and dislodged six fishes of the same species, and of various sizes, from the cavity of the zoophyte”. He also mentions an other species of fish, belonging to the same genus, but differing by having blackand cream-coloured vertical bands, that was obtained by Mr. Low from the body of an other fish-sheltering Anemone. In the next year 2) Lieutenant C. C. de Crespigny communicates about the friendship between the malacopterygian fish Premnas biaculeatus and the Actinia crassicornis, found in the same region. He observed the fish hovering over the Anemone, gently rubbing the tentacula with its pectoral fins. Trying to catch it, »the alarmed fish, instead of swimming away, dived into the body of its friend, the tentacles closing over it and thus burying it in a living tomb”. Some years thereafter 3) Dr. C. Ph. Sluiter made {{an interesting}} communication about the friendship between two large Anemones and two species of Amphiprion (tunicatus and Clarkii), found by him on the reefs of the bay of Batavia. After having transported those animals in his aquarium, he could observe that the small fishes not only found a shelter for the persecutions of larger predatory fishes between the tentacles of the Anemone, but that they also ate the spoil conquered by this animal, as well as the undigested food, that was casted out. In the splendid work on the Great Barrier Reef by Mr. W. Saville-Kent we find some statements and figures concerning the commensalism of species of Amphiprion and Discosomidae. This naturalist found the giant Discosoma (Stoichactis Hadd.) Kenti almost invariably lodging two or more specimens of A. percula; »on thrusting a stick into the oral orifice of the Anemone the fishes swim out, but return immediately to their residence within the gastric cavity of their host on the removal of the disturbing missile”. Again the allied Anemone, Discosoma (Stoichactis Hadd.) Haddoni, he saw always associated with individuals of another species of Amphiprion, A. bicinctus. In Western Australian waters 1), where he also met with the above-named Anemones, he found D. Kenti accompanied by an other Amphiprionspecies, that had the orange ground-colour of the body of A. percula and bicinctus substituted by a scarlet or black hue as in A. Clarkii. Speaking about the meaning of this commensalism for the Anemone, Mr. Saville-Kent makes the suggestion that the fish fulfills for it at once »the rôle of lures, attracting by its brilliant colours the notice of other predatory fishes, which, hastening to seize an apparently easy prey, are themselves entrapped within the outspread tentacles of the passively expectant Sea-Anemones”. Mr. Sluiter, though not doubting that Anemones can seize living fishes, says that he himself never observed it. However he believes that the moving to and fro of the fishes causes a refreshing of the water which is of advantage for the Anemone, and also that the fishes should draw near some spoil, that is too far removed to be seized by the Anemone itself...|$|R

In this study, we determined whether IMD exerts vascular and renal protection in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats by intravenous injection of adenovirus harboring the human IMD gene. Expression of human IMD was detected in the rat kidney via immunohistochemistry. IMD administration significantly lowered blood pressure, increased urine volume, and restored creatinine clearance. IMD also dramatically decreased superoxide formation and media thickness in the aorta. Vascular injury in the kidney was reduced by IMD gene delivery as evidenced by the prevention of glomerular and peritubular capillary loss. Moreover, IMD lessened morphological damage of the renal tubulointerstitium and reduced glomerular injury and hypertrophy. Attenuation of inflammatory cell accumulation in the kidney by IMD was accompanied by inhibition of p 38 MAPK activation and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression. In addition, IMD gene transfer resulted in a marked decline in myofibroblast and collagen accumulation in association with decreased transforming growth factor-β 1 levels. Furthermore, IMD increased nitric oxide excretion in the urine and lowered the amount of lipid peroxidation.

40|$|Adrenomedullin 2 (AM 2) or <b>intermedin</b> is {{a member}} of the {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) /calcitonin family of peptides and was discovered in 2004. Unlike other members of this family, no unique receptor has yet been identified for it. It is extensively distributed throughout the body. It causes hypotension when given peripherally, but when given into the CNS, it increases blood pressure and causes sympathetic activation. It also increases prolactin release, is anti-diuretic and natriuretic and reduces food intake. Whilst its effects resemble those of AM, it is frequently more potent. Some characterization of AM 2 has been done on molecularly defined receptors; the existing data suggest that it preferentially activates the AM receptor formed from calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity modifying protein 3. On this complex, its potency is generally equivalent to that of AM. There is no known receptor-activity where it is more potent than AM. In tissues and in animals it is frequently antagonised by CGRP and AM antagonists; however, situations exist in which an AM 2 response is maintained even in the presence of supramaximal concentrations of these antagonists. Thus, there is a partial mismatch between the pharmacology seen in tissues and that on cloned receptors. The only AM 2 antagonists are peptide fragments, and these have limited selectivity.

Here we investigated the effect of hypoxia on the expression of IMD in the murine lung and cultured murine pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMEC) {{as well as the}} role of IMD in regulating vascular permeability. Monoclonal IMD antibodies were generated, and transcript levels were assayed by quantitative RT-PCR. The promoter region of IMD gene was analyzed, and the effect of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α on IMD expression was investigated in HEK 293 T cells. Isolated murine lungs and a human lung microvascular endothelial cell monolayer model were used to study the effect of IMD on vascular permeability. IMD was identified as a pulmonary endothelial peptide by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Hypoxia caused an upregulation of IMD mRNA in the murine lung and PMEC. As shown by these results, HIF- 1 α enhances IMD promoter activity. Our functional studies showed that IMD abolished the increase in pressure-induced endothelial permeability. Moreover, IMD decreased basal and thrombin-induced hyperpermeability of an endothelial cell monolayer in a receptor-dependent manner and activated PKA in these cells. In conclusion, IMD is a novel hypoxia-induced gene and a potential interventional agent for the improvement of endothelial barrier function in systemic inflammatory responses and hypoxia-induced vascular leakage...|$|E

In this study, we revealed an autophagy-dependent mechanism involved in IMD’s protection against cardiac remodeling and cardiomyocyte death in heart hypertrophy. We observed that transverse aortic contraction (TAC) induction, Ang II or ISO exposure induced remarkable increase in the expression of endogenous IMD and its receptor components, CRLR, RAMP 1 and RAMP 3, in mouse hearts and H 9 c 2 cell cultures, respectively. Furthermore, the heart size, heart weight/body weight ratios, cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis, interstitial collagen, hypertrophic markers including ANP and BNP expression were also significantly increased, which were effectively suppressed by IMD supplementation. In addition, IMD induced capillary angiogenesis and improved functions in hypertrophic hearts. We further observed that IMD induced strong autophagy in hypertrophic hearts and cultured cells, which was paralleling with the decrease in cardiomyocyte size and apoptosis. Furthermore, an autophagy inhibitor, 3 -MA, was used to block the IMD-augmented autophagy level, and then the protection of IMD on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis was almost abrogated. We also observed that IMD supplementation stirred intracellular cAMP production, and augmented the ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation induced by Ang II/ISO exposure in H 9 c 2 cells. In addition, we inhibited PI 3 K, PKA and MAPK/ERK 1 / 2 signaling pathways by using wortamannin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intermedin</b> (IMD) {{is a novel}} peptide {{related to}} {{calcitonin}} gene-related peptide (CGRP) and adrenomedullin (AM). Proteolytic processing of a larger precursor yields a series of biologically active C-terminal fragments, IMD 1 – 53, IMD 1 – 47 and IMD 8 – 47. IMD shares a family of receptors with AM and CGRP composed of a calcitonin-receptor like receptor (CALCRL) associated with one of three receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMP). Compared to CGRP, IMD is less potent at CGRP 1 receptors but more potent at AM 1 receptors and AM 2 receptors; compared to AM, IMD is more potent at CGRP 1 receptors but less potent at AM 1 and AM 2 receptors. The cellular and tissue distribution of IMD overlaps in some aspects with that of CGRP and AM but is distinct from both. IMD is present in neonatal but absent or expressed sparsely, in adult heart and vasculature and present at low levels in plasma. The prominent localization of IMD in hypothalamus and pituitary and in kidney {{is consistent with a}} physiological role in the central and peripheral regulation of the circulation and water-electrolyte homeostasis. IMD is a potent systemic and pulmonary vasodilator, influences regional blood flow and augments cardiac contractility. IMD protects myocardium from the deleterious effects of oxidative stress associated with ischaemia-reperfusion injury and exerts an anti-growth effect directly on cardiomyocytes to oppose the influence of hypertrophic stimuli.

40|$|<b>Intermedin</b> (IMD) is a {{recently}} discovered peptide {{closely related to}} adrenomedullin. Its principal physiological activity is {{its role in the}} regulation of the cardiovascular system, where it exerts a potent hypotensive effect. In addition, data were recently provided showing that this peptide is able to exert a clearcut pro-angiogenic effect both in vitro and in vivo. IMD acts through the non-selective interaction with receptor complexes formed by the dimerization of calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) with the receptor activity-modifying proteins RAMP 1, 2 or 3. Thus, in the present study, the role of CLR/RAMP complexes in mediating the pro-angiogenic effect induced by IMD on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured on Matrigel was examined. Real-time PCR demonstrated the expression of IMD, CLR/RAMP 1 and CLR/RAMP 2 (but not CLR/RAMP 3) mRNA in HUVECs. IMD exerted a significant in vitro angiogenic action, specifically triggered by the binding of the peptide to CLR/RAMP complexes. Both CLR/RAMP 1 and CLR/RAMP 2 appeared to mediate the pro-angiogenic effect, which was associated with a significant increase of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression 18 h following IMD administration, indicating that the observed pro-angiogenic effects are related, at least in part, to an increased synthesis of this growth factor promoted by the peptide. Western blot analysis, however, showed a significant increase of VEGF receptor- 2 phosphorylation as early as 5 min following IMD administration, indicating that IMD induces a pro-angiogenic response in human vascular endothelial cells not only via CLR/RAMP-induced release of VEGF, but also during signal initiation and propagation by transactivating the VEGF receptor- 2 machinery...|$|E

Methods Thirteen week-old male rats were divided in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) group (n = 12), SHR group (n = 12), IMD group (SHRs infused with IMD 1 - 47 500 ng/kg per hour, n = 12), and ADM group (SHRs infused with adrenomedullin 500 ng/kg per hour, n = 12). Results A two-week continuous administration of low dose IMD 1 - 47 via mini-osmotic pumps markedly reduced blood pressure, the maximal rates of increase and decrease of left-ventricle pressure development (LV ± dp/dtmax), left ventricular systolic pressure and heart rate in SHRs. Furthermore, IMD also inhibited protein over-expression of cardiovascular IMD receptors, myocardial Receptor Activity-Modifying Proteins (RAMP 1 and RAMP 2), aortic RAMP 1, RAMP 2, RAMP 3, and calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR); suppressed up-regulation of aortic RAMP 1, RAMP 2, RAMP 3 and CRLR gene expression; and markedly elevated the mRNA abundance of myocardial atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and myocardial brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Additionally, IMD 1 - 47 administration in SHRs increased aortic cAMP concentration and reduced myocardial cAMP concentration. Conclusion These findings support the speculation that IMD, as a cardiovascular active peptide, is involved in blood pressure reduction and cardiac function amelioration during hypertension. The mechanism underlying this effect may involve IMD binding of a receptor complex formed by RAMPs and CRLR, and consequential regulation of cAMP levels and other cardiovascular active factors, such as ANP and BNP...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intermedin</b> (IMD) is a newly {{discovered}} peptide {{closely related to}} adrenomedullin. We recently reported that IMD gene delivery prevented kidney damage and capillary loss in a rat model of chronic renal injury. In this study, we evaluated the role of IMD in angiogenesis in the ischemic hindlimb. Adenovirus containing human IMD or control adenovirus (Ad. Null) was injected into the adductor muscles of rats immediately after femoral artery ligation. The expression of human IMD was detected in the skeletal muscle 5 days after the viral injection. Blood perfusion in the ischemic hindlimb was monitored by laser-Doppler imaging from 1 to 3 wk after gene delivery. When compared with animals receiving Ad. Null, those with IMD gene transfer resulted in a time-dependent increase in blood perfusion. IMD gene delivery also increased capillary and arteriole density in ischemic hindlimb, identified by anti-CD- 31 and α-smooth muscle actin immunostaining. Angiogenesis promoted by IMD was confirmed by increased capillary formation and hemoglobin content in Matrigel implants containing IMD peptide in mice. In cultured endothelial cells, IMD induced cell migration and tube formation, and these effects were blocked by the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2), and anti-IMD-neutralizing antibody. IMD was found to increase the phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, and endothelial NOS, {{as well as to}} augment NO formation, VEGF, and VEGFR- 2 synthesis.

This study was undertaken to assess whether ADM 2 protein is present in decidual tissue and colocalized with HLA-G-positive cytotro-phoblast cells and natural killer cells; to assess whether ADM 2 regulates expression of HLA-G in trophoblast cells; and to identify whether mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is involved in ADM 2 -induced trophoblast cell invasion and migration. Using immunohistochemical methods and RT-PCR, this study shows that ADM 2 protein is colocalized with HLA-G-expressing cytotrophoblast cells as well as with NCAM 1 (CD 56) immunoreactivity in human first-trimester decidual tissue, and that ADM 2 mRNA is expressed in peripheral blood natural killer cells. Further, ADM 2 dose dependently increases the expression of HLA-G antigen in HTR- 8 SV/neo cells as well as in term placental villi explants, suggesting involvement of ADM 2 in the regulation of HLA-G in trophoblast cells. In addition, interference with the activity of RAF and MAPK 3 / 1 by their inhibitors, manumycin and U 0126, respectively, reduces ADM 2 -induced HTR- 8 SV/neo cell invasion and migration.

It has a wide distribution in the central nervous system (CNS) especially in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Cardiac sympathetic afferent reflex (CSAR) is enhanced in chronic heart failure (CHF) rats. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the effect of IMD in the PVN on CSAR and its related mechanisms in CHF rats. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Rats were subjected to left descending coronary artery ligation to induce CHF or sham-operation (Sham). Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. CSAR was evaluated by the RSNA and MAP responses to epicardial application of capsaicin. Acute experiments were carried out 8 weeks after coronary ligation or sham surgery under anesthesia. IMD and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels in the PVN were up-regulated in CHF rats. Bilateral PVN microinjection of IMD caused greater decreases in CSAR and the baseline RSNA and MAP in CHF rats than those in Sham rats. The decrease of CSAR caused by IMD was prevented by pretreatment with AM receptor antagonist AM 22 - 52, but not CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP 8 - 37. Ang II in the PVN significantly enhanced CSAR and superoxide anions level, which was inhibited by PVN pretreatment with IMD or tempol (a superoxide anions scavenger) in Sham and CHF rats. CONCLUSION: IMD in the PVN inhibits CSAR via AM receptor, and attenuates the effects of Ang II on CSAR and superoxide anions level in CHF rats.

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{is leading}} cause of death among older {{characterized}} by neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, progressive neuronal deficits, and increased levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. Cholinergic treatment could be the best suitable physiological therapy for AD. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a thirty-seven-amino acid regulatory neuropeptide resulting from different merging of the CGRP gene, which also includes adrenomedullin, amylin, calcitonin, <b>intermedin,</b> and calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide. It is a proof for a CGRP receptor within nucleus accumbens of brain that is different from either the CGRP 1 or CGRP 2 receptor in which it demonstrates similar high-affinity binding for salmon calcitonin, CGRP, and amylin, a possession which is not shared by any extra CGRP receptors. Binding of CGRP to its receptor increases activated cAMP-dependent pkA and PI 3 kinase, resulting in N-terminal fragments that are shown to exert complex inhibitory as well facilitator actions on nAChRs. Fragments such as CGRP 1 - 4, CGRP 1 - 5, and CGRP 1 - 6 rapidly as well as reversibly improve agonist sensitivity of nAChRs without straight stimulating those receptors and produce the Ca 2 + -induced intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) -activated angiotensin-type (AT 4) receptor is also beneficial in AD. It has been suggested that exogenous administration of CGRP inhibits infiltration of macrophages and expression of various inflammatory mediators such as NFkB, IL- 1 b, TNF-α, iNOS, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9, and cell adhesion molecules like intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 which attenuates consequence of inflammation in AD.

ROS are also implicated in potentially counterbalancing processes, through stimulation of oxygen-sensitive gene expression. The vasodilator substance, adrenomedullin (AM), {{a member of the}} calcitonin gene-related peptide (CORP) family, is upregulated under conditions of oxidative stress and can attenuate ventricular remodelling. The purpose of this. study was to compare AM and the newly discovered and structurally-related peptide, <b>intermedin</b> (IMD), along with the associated CL receptor and receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPS 1 - 3), focusing on processes contributing to their upregulation in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Two appropriate experimental models were used: the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), which exhibits compensated LVH at 20 weeks of age; the Sprague-Dawley rat made. hypertensive by treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, Nro-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (LNAME), which develops LVH by 16 weeks of age. Robust increases in IMD mRNA expression, greater than those' that of AM, were observed in both SHRs and L-NAME treated rats, suggesting a important role for IMD in myocardial remodelling. In the L-NAME model, which exhibited more significant myocyte hypertrophy and oxidative stress, effects of blood pressure lowering using hydralazine / hydrochlorothiazide, antioxidant therapy with vitamin C / Tempol, and treatment with nifedipine I atenolQl to target hypertension and ischemic insult were assessed. These studies demonstrated that upregulation ofIMD at 1 d RAMP 1 occurs mainly as a result of oxidative stress, whereas AM and RAMPs 2 and 3 are induced by 'pressure overload. Similar to AM, IMD had' a direct antihypertrophic action in vitro and upregulated IMD could therefore counter-regulate hypertrophy in vivo, possibly through increased AM receptors, viz. the CL-rec. eptor with RAMP 2 and/or 3. The concordance of IMD and RAMP-l upregulation indicates, a CORP-type receptor action; considering also a lack of response to blood pressure reduction alone, IMD may possibly, as does CORP, serve primarily an anti-ischemic function.

Likewise, the linear calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) analogs (Cys(ACM) 2, 7) hαCGRP and (Cys(Et) 2, 7) haCGRP were only effective at AMY 1 (a) receptors, but they were partial agonists. As previously observed in COS- 7 cells, there was little induction of the AMY 2 (a) receptor phenotype; thus, AMY 2 (a) was not examined further in this study. The antagonist peptide salmon calcitonin 8 - 32 (sCT 8 - 32) did not discriminate strongly between CT and AMY receptors; however, AC 187 was a more effective antagonist of AMY responses at AMY receptors, and AC 413 additionally showed modest selectivity for AMY 1 (a) over AMY 3 (a) receptors. CGRP 8 - 37 also demonstrated receptor-dependent effects. CGRP 8 - 37 more effectively antagonized AMY at AMY 1 (a) than AMY 3 (a) receptors, although it was only a weak antagonist of both, but it did not inhibit responses at the CT(a) receptor. Low CGRP 8 - 37 affinity and agonism by linear CGRP analogs at AMY 1 (a) are the classic signature of a CGRP 2 receptor. Our data indicate that careful use of combinations of agonists and antagonists may allow pharmacological discrimination of CT(a), AMY 1 (a), and AMY 3 (a) receptors, providing a means to delineate the physiological significance of these receptors.

40|$|Abstract Background The pig is a {{biomedical}} {{model to}} study human and livestock traits. Many of these traits {{are controlled by}} neuropeptides that result from the cleavage of prohormones by prohormone convertases. Only 45 prohormones have been confirmed in the pig. Sequence homology can be ineffective to annotate prohormone genes in sequenced species like the pig due to the multifactorial nature of the prohormone processing. The goal {{of this study is}} to undertake the first complete survey of prohormone and prohormone convertases genes in the pig genome. These genes were functionally annotated based on 35 gene expression microarray experiments. The cleavage sites of prohormone sequences into potentially active neuropeptides were predicted. Results We identified 95 unique prohormone genes, 2 alternative calcitonin-related sequences, 8 prohormone convertases and 1 cleavage facilitator in the pig genome 10. 2 assembly and trace archives. Of these, 11 pig prohormone genes have not been reported in the UniProt, UniGene or Gene databases. These genes are <b>intermedin,</b> cortistatin, insulin-like 5, orexigenic neuropeptide QRFP, prokineticin 2, prolactin-releasing peptide, parathyroid hormone 2, urocortin, urocortin 2, urocortin 3, and urotensin 2 -related peptide. In addition, a novel neuropeptide S was identified in the pig genome correcting the previously reported pig sequence that is identical to the rabbit sequence. Most differentially expressed prohormone genes were under-expressed in pigs experiencing immune challenge relative to the un-challenged controls, in non-pregnant relative to pregnant sows, in old relative to young embryos, and in non-neural relative to neural tissues. The cleavage prediction based on human sequences had the best performance with a correct classification rate of cleaved and non-cleaved sites of 92 % suggesting that the processing of prohormones in pigs is similar to humans. The cleavage prediction models did not find conclusive evidence supporting the production of the bioactive neuropeptides urocortin 2, urocortin 3, torsin family 2 member A, tachykinin 4, islet amyloid polypeptide, and calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide 2 in the pig. Conclusions The present genomic and functional characterization supports the use of the pig as an effective animal model to gain a deeper understanding of prohormones, prohormone convertases and neuropeptides in biomedical and agricultural research. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityWith the {{attention}} of many physiologists, pharmacologists, biochemists, and microbiologists focused upon the cell, the quantitation of the responses of single cell effectors is of current interest. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} consideration of methods of quantitating the melanophore responses of frogs and fish to drugs and hormones. Color changes of animals have been studied since the time of Aristotle. For many years the melanophore responses of various species of animals were studied with respect to changes in environmental background. In the earlier part of this century the responses of melanophores to drugs and hormones, isolated from the endocrine glands, especially the pituitary and adrenal gland, were observed and quantitated, for the most part, subjectively. More recently the demonstration of the melanophore stimulating activity of preparations of ACTH has greatly increased interest in the responses of melanophores. A controversy of whether ACTH has <b>intermedin</b> activity or whether <b>intermedin</b> is a contaminant of ACTH preparations has increased the need for objective quantitative methods for measuring melanophore responses. Demonstration of the melanophore stimulating principle in the blood of patients under stress, patients with Addison's disease, and in pregnancy increases the importance of quantitation of the melanophore responses. Similarity between the pigment cells of the retina of many animals and the pigment cells present in the skins, fascia, and mesenteries of animals has been another stimulus for this study. Both morphology and the mechanism of melanin pigment migration are considered in the thesis. Photographs which confirm the theory that the melanophores of Fundulus heteroclitis are fixed stellate processed cells whose pigment migrates {{into and out of the}} processes and the body of the cell in response to epinephrine and an adrenergic blocking drug N- 9 -Fluorenyl-N-ethyl- 2 Chlorethylamine HCl (SY- 21) are presented. The reason for the changes in color of animals with the migration of pigment within the melanophores was demonstrated by measuring the areas covered by single melanophores with their pigment in the dispersed and concentrated states. The melanophore with dispersed pigment was found to cover approximately six times more area than with pigment in the concentrated state. A critical review of the previously reported methods of recording and quantitating melanophore responses is presented. Methods of quantitating melanophores are discussed under two large categories: subjective and objective. Subjective methods are those which use an arbitrary index by which the various stages of the melanophores are characterized by numbers. Together with the subjective eiement of such methods, the statistical treatment of such indices as measurement data is criticized on the ground that there is no mathematical reaction of the various subdivisions. The originators of the method expressed the fact that the indices were arbitrary designations. Criticisms of the objective quantitative methods developed up to the present time are discussed. It is concluded that only an objective quantitative method for measuring melanophore responses to which valid statistical procedures can be applied should be used for assay of the melanophore stimulating principle. An objective quantitative method of measuring melanophore responses in the intact frog is presented. This method consists of series of measurements of the light reflected from the dorsal surface of intact light adapted frogs before and at various time intervals after the administration of an Armour ACTH preparation. An extensive analysis of the data is presented and discussed. A slight dependence of the peak and one-hour responses on the starting reflectances of the frogs was calculated by means of covariance analysis. No dependence of the responses on the vreight of the animals was found. The arbitrary practice of administering the hormone on the basis of animal weight is criticized on the grounds that previous workers did not establish the dependence of the response on the weight of the animal. Dose-response regression lines are presented for the peak-response and the response one hour after administration of the ACTH. Analysis of these lines and comparison of the slopes, variances of error, and precision indices indicate the one-hour response has about the same degree of precision as the peakresponse. For purposes of assay, the one-hour-response is more convenient to use. This method fulfills the three criteria for quantitating responses set forth by Gaddum in that there is a linear relationship over a hundred fold range of doses; the standard deviation is independent of the response; and the precision index, lambda, has a small value. The reliability of the photoelectric method for quantitating melanophore responses was demonstrated by means of the assay of unknown solutions of the standard Armour ACTH preparation. An average error of 14 % for the unknowns was found. This method was employed in the assay of the melanophore stimulating activity of anterior pituitary preparations provided by Dr. E. B. Astwood. Most of the melanophore stimulating activity of the preparations was found to be present in the acetic acid fraction produced by fractionation of Corticotrophin between butanol and acetic acid. We are unable to confirm the 400 fold purification of the ACTH (butanol fraction) reported by Astwood and coworkers. Results of the assay of an alkali-treated preparation of Corticotrophin indicate a potentiation reported previously by other workers. Assay of the melanophore stimulating activity of posterior pituitary preparations indicated that almost all the <b>intermedin</b> activity is present in the Vasopressin fraction of posterior pituitary powder. Pitocin, or the oxytocic fraction of posterior pituitary powder, was found to have very little melanophore stimulating activity. Comparison of the slopes, standard deviations and precision indices of the standard preparation over a period of seven months indicated a stability of the assay method. It is concluded, therefore, that the photoelectric method of measuring melanophore responses is reliable. A study of the effects of a number of drugs on the melanophores of the intact frog and the response of the melanophores to a dose of 0. 4 µg/frog was presented. Dimethylaminoethyl benzhydryl ether HCl (Benadryl), atropine sulfate, epinephrine in a dose of 0. 1 mg/frog, methacholine chloride, and a drug produced by the condensation of an alkoxyphenylamine with formaldehyde (48 / 80) were found to disperse the pigment within the melanophores of the intact light adapted frogs. Histamine diphosphate, epinephrine - 1 mg/frog, and tetraethylammonium did not disperse the pigment within the melanophores at one half hour. None of the drugs studied blocked the responses to the standard dose of ACTH. A method of quantitating the melanophore responses of isolated frog skins was described and compared with the in vivo method. When the results were expressed in the same way as that of the originators of the method, there was an increase in the variability of the responses and heterogeneity of the variances was revealed. The responses expressed as the light transmission measurement forty minutes after administration of the ACTH was variable. A log dose-response regression line was presented with its statistical analysis. The precision index of the in vitro photoelectric method was found to be greater than that of the in vivo photoelectric method. The sensitivity of the intact animal was greater than isolated pieces of frog skin. An attempt to quantitate the melanophore responses of isolated Fundulus heteroclitis melanophores was presented. The method, similar to that reported by Smith consists of the measurement of changes in light transmission through the scales after the administration of piperidine methyl- 3 -benzodioxane (Benodaine), and in another series, epinephrine. Statistical analysis indicated variability of the responses and a precision index of 0. 96. Because of the great variability of the responses no significant differences were produced by changing the temperature at which the experiments are conducted. The response to epinephrine was also variable and in this series no significant regression was found. In conclusion, a method of quantitating melanophore responses of the intact frog has been developed. This method has the advantages of sensitivity, reliability and accuracy. The data permit the application of statistical procedures which give the results a known degree of confidence that is unobtainable with the in vivo methods that have been reported to date...|$|E
