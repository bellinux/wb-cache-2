5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy and not very smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was {{also concerned about the}} restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{be a member of the}} related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the Milky Way, previously {{believed to be}} nebulous, and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds.

60|$|But it is {{not this}} faculty of his which has been imitated by his scholars; for {{it is not}} this faculty which made him their ideal, however it may have {{attracted}} them. All which sensible men deplore in him is that which poetasters have exalted in him. His morbidity and his doubt have become in their eyes his differential energy, because too often, {{it was all in}} him with which they had wit <b>to</b> sympathise. They <b>found</b> <b>it</b> easy <b>to</b> curse and complain, instead of helping to mend. So had he. They <b>found</b> <b>it</b> pleasant <b>to</b> confound institutions with the abuses which defaced them. So had he. They <b>found</b> <b>it</b> pleasant <b>to</b> give way to their spleen. So had he. They <b>found</b> <b>it</b> pleasant <b>to</b> believe that the poet was to regenerate the world, without having settled with what he was <b>to</b> regenerate <b>it.</b> So had he. They <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more pleasant <b>to</b> obey sentiment than inductive laws. So had he. They <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more pleasant <b>to</b> hurl about enormous words and startling figures than to examine reverently the awful depths of beauty which lie in the simplest words and the severest figures. So had he.|$|R

5|$|It {{was given}} the rank of full species (separate from the white-cheeked nuthatch) in 2005 in Pamela C. Rasmussen's Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide. Other {{authorities}} followed suit, but as of 2014, S. przewalskii {{does not have a}} full threat-status evaluation by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2014 phylogenetic study of the species <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be {{at the base of the}} nuthatch evolutionary tree out of 21 species examined, dispelling a hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis.|$|E
5|$|Other {{analyses}} {{have found}} Paranthodon {{closely related to}} Tuojiangosaurus, Loricatosaurus, and Kentrosaurus within Stegosaurinae. Even though phylogenetic analyses recognize Paranthodon as a stegosaurid, the type material actually bears no synapomorphies of Stegosauria. However, the material is likely of stegosaurian nature, and phylogenies by many authors have <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be within the group.|$|E
5|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback has {{not been}} {{identified}} as a threat to this species, but testing has <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be highly susceptible; in one study it exhibited the highest susceptibility of 49 Banksia species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.|$|E

As a result, on the Eastern front, Ali <b>found</b> <b>it</b> hard <b>to</b> expand the state.|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have good acting which could still be more expressive, but was more indifferent {{to the use of}} unnecessary connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|The five reel {{film was}} {{released}} through the Pathé Exchange as a Pathé Gold Rooster Play on October 7, 1917. Charles E. Wagner of the Exhibitor's Trade Review <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{be a good}} film with great direction and photography, but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared {{to be involved in}} the accident was too real. Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual suggestiveness; which should prove a strong program for the Pathé program. Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences, but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer. A reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film's excessive use of coincidental meetings to be highly improbable, but found Warde's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances. The reviewer said that Emile Chautard had made the improbable story more plausible.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} praised by critics for its visuals, but {{was criticized for}} its poor game {{controls}} and short length. Meanwhile, the soundtrack polarized players and critics alike, with those defending it saying the music was catchy and well produced; while detractors <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be out of place for a racing game. Sonic R is the only original Sonic game to be released on the Sega Saturn; Sonic 3D Blast is a port of the Genesis title, and Sonic Jam is a compilation of the first four Sonic games.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift was also {{composed}} by Hitoshi Sakimoto, {{this time with}} the assistance of composers from his company Basiscape. The music was released as Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift Original Soundtrack by Square Enix in 2007. It was enjoyed by reviewers, who <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be pleasant and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} as the album's first {{single in the}} second quarter of 2007. The track received mixed reviews from pop music critics, who generally <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be less impressive than past singles. It entered the top forty in Germany, Ireland and The Netherlands, and became Bedingfield's fourth United Kingdom top ten single release. Calvin Harris covered it in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the large}} genus Entoloma, which {{contains}} around 1500 species, E.sinuatum has been classically {{placed in the}} section Entoloma within the subgenus Entoloma, {{as it is the}} type species of the genus. A 2009 study analysing DNA sequences and spore morphology <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> lie in a rhodopolioid clade with (among other species) E.sordidulum, E.politum and E.rhodopolium, and most closely related to E.sp.1. This rhodopolioid clade lay within a crown Entoloma clade.|$|E

5|$|After a 10-day forced march north, {{and having}} {{received}} only basic medical attention, Large {{arrived at a}} prison camp outside Chongsung, about 50 miles north east of Sinuiju. He {{spent two years in}} the camp and celebrated his 21st birthday there. Throughout his incarceration he had two bullets and at least 18 pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body. To help Large cope with the chronic pain of his untreated injuries, an American POW introduced him to marijuana, which grew wild in the area. Although he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a highly effective– and enjoyable– painkiller, he was somewhat alarmed by its psychoactive effects and subsequently tried to limit his use of the drug. Like many of his fellow prisoners, Large also suffered from beri-beri and dysentery.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} vaccine was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, U2 {{released}} their 12th studio album, No Line on the Horizon. The album received generally favourable {{reviews and}} debuted at {{number one in}} over 30 countries, but its sales of 5million units were comparatively low by U2 standards {{and it did not}} contain a hit single. Having spent time in Fez, Morocco, recording and absorbing exotic musical influences, the group intended the record to be more experimental than their previous two. However, critics <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be more conventional than expected. During the five-and-a-half year gestation period for Songs of Innocence, lead singer Bono expressed uncertainty on several occasions over how U2 could remain relevant musically after the relatively lukewarm commercial performance of No Line on the Horizon.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the team had yet another stroke of luck. Bowen's former thesis advisor at King's College, London, was Edward Appleton, who had worked with Watt and Harold Pye during the 1920s. Pye had since gone on to form his own radio company, Pye Ltd., and was active in the {{television}} field. They had recently introduced a new television set based on an innovative vacuum tube developed by Philips of Holland, the EF50 pentode. Appleton mentioned the Pye design to Bowen, who <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be a great improvement over the EMI version, and was happy to learn there had been a small production run {{that could be used for}} their experiments. The design became widely known as the Pye strip.|$|E
5|$|Mercy Point {{was placed}} on hiatus after only three episodes were aired, and was {{replaced}} by the reality television seriesAmerica's Greatest Petsand the sitcomReunited. The show suffered from low ratings,with an average of two million viewers. The final four episodes of the series were broadcast in two 2-hour blocks on Thursday nights in July 1999. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to Mercy Pointwas mixed; some commentators praised its characterization and use of science-fiction elements, while others <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be uninteresting and unoriginal. Callaway stated that he had the potential story arcs for the full first season already planned before the show's cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Paltrow's guest {{appearance}} attracted positive commentary, but the episode's sub-plots {{were less}} well received. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed the episode {{one of the}} best of the season. Time James Poniewozik felt that it was a relatively subdued, mediocre episode, and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be an improvement on the previous two episodes, if not genuinely good. The National Alliance on Mental Illness criticized the episode for its depiction of bipolar disorder. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance.|$|E
