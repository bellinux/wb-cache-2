Despite many efforts these diseases continue to present clinical management dilemmas, principally {{because of their}} rare frequency that limits considerably the possibilities of collecting enough cases for clinical and research studies. Through a Task Force conducted by the European Respiratory Society, which comprised respiratory physicians and basic scientists from across Europe, 185 cases of <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> in immunocompetent children were collected and reviewed. The present report provides important clinically-relevant information on the current approach to diagnosis and management of chronic <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in children}}.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{functional}} evaluation {{has become}} increasingly important in the understanding and management of patients with <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases.</b> The cardiopulmonary exercise test and the six-minute walk test (6 MWT), through their isolated variables, {{have been used to}} do this evaluation, with some limitations. OBJECTIVES: We proposed a new composite index (desaturation distance ratio using continuous peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and the distance walked as a more reliable tool for doing a functional evaluation of these patients. METHODS: 6 MWT was performed by <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> patients and controls. Analyzed parameters were walked distance and desaturation area (DAO 2), obtained by taking the difference between maximal SpO 2 possible (100 %) and patient's SpO 2 every 2 seconds. desaturation distance ratio was calculated using the ratio between DAO 2 and distance walked. RESULTS: Forty-nine <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> patients and 11 control subjects completed the protocol. The mean (SD) age was 60 (12) years and 65 (9) years, respectively (p:NS). Data obtained from 6 MWT showed a significant statistical difference between <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> patients and controls: mean walked distance (430 and 602 meters, respectively); SpO 2 minimal maintained at least 10 seconds - SpO 2 min (85 % and 94 %, respectively), and median desaturation distance ratio (10 and 2. 5, respectively). A correlation analysis, considering <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> patients, revealed the best correlation between desaturation distance ratio and DLco (r= - 0. 72; p< 0. 001), being the correlation between SpO 2 min and DLco of 0. 61 (p< 0. 001) and among walked distance and DLco of 0. 58 (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Desaturation distance ratio is a promising concept and a more reliable physiologic tool to assess pulmonary diseases characterized by involvement of the alveolar-capillary membrane, such as <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is {{currently}} widely applied to sample cells and proteins {{present in the}} bronchoalveolar space for subsequent studies.

The studies presented in this thesis are based on BAL fluid data obtained from patients during a ten-year period between 1980 and 1990.

25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing bronchiectasis, a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking deep breaths and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus can be helpful in some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause lung fibrosis and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate tissue repair in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> They have decreased pulmonary reserve, trouble breathing, a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the average}} person, the {{diaphragm}} should be intersected by the 5th to 7th anterior ribs at the mid-clavicular line, and 9 to 10 posterior ribs should be viewable {{on a normal}} PA inspiratory film. An {{increase in the number}} of viewable ribs implies hyperinflation, as can occur, for example, with obstructive lung disease or foreign body aspiration. A decrease implies hypoventilation, as can occur with restrictive lung disease, pleural effusions or atelectasis. Underexpansion can also cause interstitial markings due to parenchymal crowding, which can mimic the appearance of <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>disease.</b> Enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery can indirectly reflect changes of pulmonary hypertension, with a size greater than 16mm abnormal in men and 15mm in women.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDefensins are {{endogenous}} {{antibiotics and}} regulators of inflammation, immunity and wound repair.

Levels of HAD in BALF of patients with PAP were significantly higher than those in controls and patients with COP and sarcoidosis. Serum levels of HAD in all groups were significantly higher than those in controls. Levels of HBD- 1 and - 2 in BALF of patients with PAP were extremely high in all subjects. Serum levels of HBD- 1 were higher in all patient groups, with the exception of those with PAP, and those of HBD- 2 were also higher in patients with IPF and sarcoidosis, compared with controls. BALF of PAP patients, but not IPF patients and controls, expressed antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

40|$|AbstractThe p 53 gene is {{well known}} as a tumour {{suppressor}} gene. In addition, the mutated p 53 gene is detected {{in a variety of}} human cancers including lung cancer, and is considered as an oncogene. Lung cancer is also frequently associated with <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases.</b> Therefore, {{it may be possible to}} hypothesize that there might be some abnormality of p 53 gene in <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases.</b> This work examined the relationship between the p 53 protein and gene in lung tissues of 28 patients with <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases.</b> Among 28 patients, 13 cases were pathologically diagnosed to have usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), 12 cases were diagnosed as having collagen vascular <b>lung</b> <b>diseases,</b> and three cases were diagnosed to have a non-specific interstitial pneumonia. Twenty-three tissue samples were obtained by open lung biopsy and five samples were taken by autopsy. Paraffin-embedded tissues were treated by microwave, and stained with an anti-p 53 antibody (DO 7) by the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase (ABC) method. In selected patients, mutations in exons 5 – 8 of the p 53 gene were also examined by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequence. In addition, the presence of anti-p 53 antibodies in patients' sera was screened for by ELISA. Fifteen samples (53 · 6 %) revealed overexpression of the p 53 protein in the nuclei of alveolar epithelial cells. However, SSCP or sequence analysis, which was performed in 13 tissues, showed no mutations in exons 5 – 8 of the p 53 gene. In conclusion, p 53 proteins were overexpressed in <b>interstitial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases,</b> and the expressed p 53 protein was considered to be wild-type.
