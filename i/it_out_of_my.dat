5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three months. I took <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, {{but it was still}} in gestation. So I had to put it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E
500|$|Vašek expresses his confusions in a short, sad song ("I can't get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head"), but is {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} a travelling circus. The Ringmaster introduces the star attractions: Esmeralda, the Spanish dancer, a [...] "real Indian" [...] sword swallower, and a dancing bear. A rapid folk-dance, the skočná, follows. Vašek is entranced by Esmeralda, but his timid advances are interrupted when the [...] "Indian" [...] rushes in, announcing that the [...] "bear" [...] has collapsed in a drunken stupor. A replacement is required. Vašek is soon persuaded to take the job, egged on by Esmeralda's flattering words ("We'll make a pretty thing out of you").|$|E

500|$|The {{basis for}} this order of battle is a return {{prepared}} by General Washington on August 3. [...] It encompasses all of the units stationed in the New York area, not only {{those involved in the}} battle. [...] The total provided is a listing of all troops, not just those listed as ready for duty. [...] A substantial number of troops were sick during July and August. [...] For example, General William Heath, writing in his memoirs, recorded that about 10,000 men were sick on August 8, and Washington reported on September 2 having fewer than 20,000 men present and fit for duty. [...] Later returns were apparently impossible: Washington wrote to Congress on August 26 that [...] "he shifting and changing which the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of course puts <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> power to transmit a general one of the army." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} Black Eye deal with sexual and abuse topics: [...] "Nothing you will likely {{hear on the}} radio", Rootes explained. The song [...] "Hypersonic", named after the best-selling {{vibrator}} in England, celebrates the joys of vibrator use. The title track, [...] "Black Eye", is about domestic violence. Rootes remarked: [...] "When I was frowing up, my dad was really violent. I knew it was something I had to write a song about – to get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> system." [...] The song inspired the album cover, which depicts a cat holding a mouse in its jaw. Rootes explained that the mouse's black eye represents a moment of serenity before it dies. Similarly, the song [...] "Scream" [...] deals with rape issues, while [...] "Dirty Old Bird" [...] is about spousal abuse. The track [...] "Technicolour Yawn" [...] is about the unpleasant effect of a hangover, [...] "Psychofudge" [...] is about drug usage, and [...] "Cheap" [...] deals with one's loss of virginity and the subsequent feel of becoming [...] "sort of cheap and common." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-1984, Madonna met {{producer}} Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios (now Avatar Studios) in New York. Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started to like it. [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] Hence the song was finally recorded. Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that: ...|$|E

2500|$|Gillespie has criticised {{dairy farming}} {{and the use}} of leather balls. While {{coaching}} Yorkshire, the club was sponsored by a dairy, about which Gillespie said: [...] "Yes, they are a sponsor but it doesn't mean I agree with what they do. <b>It's</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> control, just like the fact that cricket balls are made of leather".|$|R
2500|$|The group {{found a new}} {{management}} team in Coalition Entertainment (Rob Lanni & Eric Lawrence with Sarah Parham) in 1996. Once they had realized their music changed {{and wanted to be}} taken more seriously, [...] "Rainbow Butt Monkeys" [...] became [...] "Finger Eleven". The name Finger Eleven comes from an earlier version of the song [...] "Thin Spirits" [...] from the album Tip. Scott Anderson explains: [...] "when everything is pushing you in one direction and your instinct drives you in another that's finger eleven, I couldn't get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." ...|$|E

I still can't get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." [...] While a student, Hirst had a placement at a mortuary, an experience that influenced his later themes and materials.|$|E

2500|$|A strange-looking whale {{can be seen}} {{flying around}} the large statue {{during most of the}} video, {{specifically}} {{at the end of the}} video. The whale in the video was Joe Hahn's idea. He has been quoted as saying, [...] "It's not like I pulled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ass; it made sense to me." [...] The reasoning behind its inclusion is still unknown. The whale could be identified as a [...] "space whale" [...] which takes the concept that life (or time) is too short for one to absorb all its mass surroundings. The whale also makes a brief appearance in the music video for [...] "Shadow of the Day".|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{most famous}} remark {{supposedly}} occurred as Groucho was interviewing Charlotte Story, who had borne 20 children. When Marx {{asked why she}} had chosen to raise such a large family, Mrs. Story {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "I love my husband"; to which Marx responded, [...] "I love my cigar, but I take <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth once in awhile." [...] The remark was judged too risqué to be aired, according to the anecdote, and was edited out before broadcast. [...] Charlotte Story and her husband Marion, indeed parents of 20 children, were real people who appeared on the program in 1950. Audio recordings of the interview exist, and a reference to cigars is made ("With each new kid, do you go around passing out cigars?"), but {{there is no evidence of}} the famous line. Marx and Fenneman both denied that the incident took place. [...] "I get credit all the time for things I never said," [...] Marx told Roger Ebert, in 1972. [...] "You know that line in You Bet Your Life? The guy says he has seventeen kids and I say, 'I smoke a cigar, but I take <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth occasionally'? [...] I never said that." [...] Marx's 1976 memoir recounts the episode as fact, but co-writer Hector Arce relied mostly on sources other than Groucho himself—who was by then in his mid eighties, in ill health [...] and [...] mentally compromised—and was probably unaware that Groucho had specifically denied making the legendary observation.|$|E
2500|$|In a Rolling Stone {{article in}} 2006, former Skid Row {{frontman}} Sebastian Bach described the album as [...] "epic" [...] and [...] "mind-blowing" [...] and added [...] "It's a very cool album—it's badass with killer screams, killer guitar riffs, but it's got a totally modern sound. The {{word for it}} is 'grand.' It's fucking epic. He's reinvented himself yet again." [...] Bach has also described the album as having [...] "the rawness {{and the power of}} Appetite for Destruction, but it also has the grandiosity of 'November Rain'." [...] He went on to describe the song [...] "Sorry", which he sings backing vocals on, stating [...] "There's this one song called 'Sorry' that's almost like doom metal with Axl singing really clean over this grinding, slow beat that is fucking mean, I cannot get <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the band's fourth album, Eldorado, A Symphony, {{a concept}} album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped overdubbing strings and hired an {{orchestra}} and choir instead. Louis Clark {{was hired by}} the band as string arranger. The first single off the album, [...] "Can't Get <b>It</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Head", became their first US top 10 hit, and Eldorado, A Symphony became ELO's first gold album. Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished {{to spend more time with}} his family; and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne. Following the release of Eldorado Kelly Groucutt was recruited as bassist, and in early 1975 Melvyn Gale replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and regularly appeared on The Midnight Special (1973, 1975, 1976 & 1977) more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances. Face the Music was released in 1975, producing the hit singles [...] "Evil Woman", their third UK top 10, and [...] "Strange Magic". The opening instrumental [...] "Fire on High", with its mix of strings and blazing acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television program CBS Sports Spectacular in the mid-1970s. The group toured extensively from 3 February to 13 April 1976, playing 68 shows in 76 days in the US.|$|E
