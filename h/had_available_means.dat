40|$|Address–Event–Representation (AER) is a {{communication}} protocol for transferring images between chips, originally developed for bio-inspired image-processing systems.

METHODS: A medical chart review of patients who had undergone duodenal aspirate culture at an academic medical centre in 2003 was performed to record clinical characteristics and culture results.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) are the {{treatment}} of choice for CPP. We investigated growth in GnRHa-naïve subjects, treated with leuprolide acetate 1 -month depot for CPP. Methods This prospective, open-label study had a long-term, observational, follow-up period. Forty-nine females and 6 males were enrolled. Leuprolide acetate depot was administered intramuscularly every 28 days. Height and growth rate during and after treatment until adulthood were measured. Results Among 30 of 49 females having an adult height (AH) measurement, 29 <b>had</b> target heights <b>available</b> (<b>mean</b> = 163. 8 cm) and 27 had pretreatment predicted adult heights (PAHs; mean = 157. 4 cm). After treatment, the mean AH at mean age 21. 8 years [range 13. 7 - 26. 7 years] was 162. 5 cm, a mean height gain over baseline PAH of 4. 0 cm. The mean height standard deviation score was - 0. 1 at AH. Conclusions Treatment of CPP with leuprolide acetate 1 -month depot had beneficial effects on growth rate and preservation of AH.

40|$|Our {{continuing}} experienced {{decline in}} the number of farms often provides an opportunity for the acreage expansion of the remaining units. In addition, the expansion of the farm’s size (acreage-wise or through intensification) requires a change in the capital investment. As these opportunities arise, it appears it would be deemed advantageous to <b>have</b> <b>available</b> a <b>means</b> of analyzing the influences of variability in the supply of the available resources. Because of the nature and scope of linear programming, it is thought that linear programming techniques are adaptable to this purpose. This study undertakes refinement of parametric programming methods, and is primarily devoted to methodology. Allowances for more than one resource to become variable are permitted. In undertaking this study the assumption was made that the objectives could be attained by linear programming techniques. The primary objective is to refine the methodology of continuous programming with variable resources. In so doing it is necessary to determine the optimum points (ridge lines) for each variable as it is expanded. Within these ridge lines a series of restrictive resource lines are devised. On contour maps, the marginal rates of substitution of variable resources will be depicted by a series of isoquants. The resources will be examined in both their complementary and competitive ranges to determine the influence of variable resources upon utilization. Finally, these methods will be employed in analyzing a more realistic and practical example. Advisor: Robert M. Finle...|$|R

40|$|At present, nurses {{working in}} the acute {{medicine}} often meet patients who have had introduced a central venous catheter. In the acute medicine this catheter is essential for its wide-spread utilization. It also needs an intensive nursing care due to its invasiveness and an easy importation of an infection. Every hospital has its own standards developed for its treatment as well as successes in a prevention of the catheter infection. The patients often perceive an introduction of the central venous catheter as an inconvenience {{and they do not}} understand restrictions which are necessary when the catheter is going to be introduced. An aim of the bachelor thesis was to determine the problems that nursing staff meet in the care of the central venous catheter, which methods they use in the prevention of the infection and what are the feelings of patients with the introduced central venous catheter. In order to achieve the defined aims a qualitative method of a semi-structured interview was used. Interviews were made with nurses working in intensive care wards and in departments of anaesthesiology and resuscitation and a semi-structured interview with the patients who have had an experience with the inserted central venous catheter as well. Results were described in the interviews and interesting facts were entered into tables. The research showed that a frequent problem for nurses was the infection. Another finding showed that nurses <b>have</b> used <b>available</b> <b>means</b> to prevent an onset of the infection and they followed the nursing care standards while taking care of the central venous catheter. The interviews with the patients showed that they had perceived problems especially with a re-bandage of the central venous catheter...|$|R

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportA {{research}} project {{was conducted to}} determine whether anthracnose stalk rot (ASR) reduction (and the associated protection of grain yield) is a nontarget benefit that can be expected of transgenic (insect resistant) corn hybrids deployed for management of European corn borer (ECB). Grain yield, insect and disease development, and standability were monitored in field plots of transgenic and near-isogenic (nontransformed) corn hybrids infested at mid-whorl stages with ECB, the anthracnose fungus, or both. Previous results indicated that Bt hybrids were promising for management of this pest complex, but damaging levels of first brood ECB were not encountered in experiments that relied on natural, local insect populations. Artificial infestation was utilized in this experiment. Unfortunately, because of unusually harsh environmental conditions at the experimental site, only a low percentage of first brood ECB larvae survived long enough to invade corn stalks. This resulted in a low incidence of insect injury during corn vegetative stages. Although anthracnose stalk rot incidence was low overall at the brown silk stage, ASR was significantly lower in the transformed (Bt) version of each hybrid pair. It has been shown previously that ASR at this early growth stage can result in large losses of grain yield. These results provide further evidence that yield protection can be expected from Bt corn hybrids {{in the presence of}} C. graminicola and low to moderate populations of first brood ECB typically encountered in New York. It is still unclear whether such protection against early ASR will occur in the presence of high populations of ECB encountered occasionally in New York, but frequently in the US Corn Belt. We cannot effectively deploy Bt corn hybrids on New York farms to reduce losses to ECB and ASR until we <b>have</b> <b>available</b> better <b>means</b> for predicting an ECB infestation in a particular location prior to corn planting...|$|R
