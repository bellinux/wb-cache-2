5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with <b>everolimus</b> or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has {{approved}} several drugs for managing {{some of the}} major manifestations of TSC. The antiepileptic medication vigabatrinwas approved in 2009 for treatment of infantile spasms and was recommended as first-line therapy for infantile spasms in children with TSC by the 2012 International TSC Consensus Conference. Adrenocorticotropic hormone was approved in 2010 to treat infantile spasms. <b>Everolimus</b> was approved for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012. <b>Everolimus</b> also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC. In 2017, the European Commission approved <b>everolimus</b> for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.|$|E
25|$|A {{randomized}} {{trial of}} people with advanced HCC showed no benefit for the combination of <b>everolimus</b> and pasireotide.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the genome}} of an {{exceptional}} bladder cancer patient whose tumor had been eliminated {{by the drug}} <b>everolimus</b> was sequenced, revealing mutations in two genes, TSC1 and NF2. The mutations disregulated mTOR, the protein inhibited by <b>everolimus,</b> allowing it to reproduce without limit. As a result, in 2015, the Exceptional Responders Initiative was created at the National Cancer Institute. The initiative allows such exceptional patients (who have responded positively {{for at least six}} months to a cancer drug that usually fails) to have their genomes sequenced to identify the relevant mutations. Once identified, other patients could be screened for those mutations and then be given the drug. In 2016 To that end, a nationwide cancer drug trial began in 2015, involving up to twenty-four hundred centers. Patients with appropriate mutations are matched with one of more than forty drugs.|$|E
25|$|While {{sirolimus}} {{inhibition of}} mTORC1 appears {{to mediate the}} drug's benefits, it also inhibits mTORC2, which results in diabetes-like symptoms. This includes decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin. Sirolimus treatment may additionally {{increase the risk of}} type 2 diabetes. In mouse studies, these symptoms can be avoided through the use of alternate dosing regimens or analogs such as <b>everolimus</b> or temsirolimus.|$|E
25|$|Sirolimus {{also shows}} promise in {{treating}} {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC), a congenital disorder that leaves sufferers prone to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth's Rapamune) and <b>everolimus</b> (Novartis's RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} {{treatments for}} RCC {{discussed in the}} “Treatment” section are also relevant for the metastatic form of the disease. Options include interleukin-2 which is a standard therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma. From 2007 to 2013, seven new treatments have been approved specifically for mRCC (sunitinib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab, sorafenib, <b>everolimus,</b> pazopanib and axitinib). These new treatments {{are based on the}} fact that renal cell carcinomas are very vascular tumors – they contain a large number of blood vessels. The drugs aim to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels in the tumors, hence slowing growth and in some cases reducing the size of the tumors.|$|E
500|$|... 2006: Small trials showed {{promising}} {{results in}} the use of rapamycin to shrink angiomyolipoma and astrocytomas. Several larger multicentre clinical trials began: lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and kidney angiomyolipoma (AML) were treated with rapamycin; giant cell astrocytomas were treated with the rapamycin derivative <b>everolimus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The drug {{is mainly}} to inhibit neointimal growth (due to {{proliferation}} of smooth muscle cells) which would cause restenosis. [...] Much of the neointimal hyperplasia {{seems to be}} caused by inflammation. Hence, immunosuppressive and antiproliferative drugs are used. Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and <b>everolimus</b> were previously used for other medical applications and have been included in licensed DES.|$|E
2500|$|Sirolimus {{was shown}} to inhibit the {{progression}} of dermal Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with renal transplants. [...] Other mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus (CCI-779) or <b>everolimus</b> (RAD001), are being tested for use in cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme and mantle cell lymphoma. However, these drugs have {{a higher rate of}} fatal adverse events in cancer patients than control drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Auto-immune and {{inflammatory}} kidney disease, such as vasculitis or transplant rejection, may {{be treated}} with immunosuppression. Commonly used agents are prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, <b>everolimus,</b> thymoglobulin and sirolimus. Newer, so-called [...] "biologic drugs" [...] or monoclonal antibodies, are also used in these conditions and include rituximab, basiliximab and eculizumab. Blood products including intravenous immunoglobulin and {{a process known as}} plasma exchange can also be employed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of rapamycin as an anticancer agent began {{again in the}} 1990s {{with the discovery of}} temsirolimus (CCI-779). [...] This was a novel soluble rapamycin derivative that had a favorable toxicological profile in animals. [...] More rapamycin derivatives with improved pharmacokinetics and reduced immunosuppressive effects have since then been developed for the treatment of cancer. These rapalogs include temsirolimus (CCI-779), <b>everolimus</b> (RAD001), and ridaforolimus (AP-23573) which are being evaluated in cancer clinical trials. Rapamycin analogs have similar therapeutic effects as rapamycin. However they have improved hydrophilicity and can be used for oral and intravenous administration. In 2012 National Cancer Institute listed more than 200 clinical trials testing the anticancer activity of rapalogs both as monotherapy or as a part of combination therapy for many cancer types.|$|E
2500|$|Interventional {{procedures}} have {{been plagued by}} restenosis due {{to the formation of}} endothelial tissue overgrowth at the lesion site. [...] Restenosis is the body's response to the injury of the vessel wall from angioplasty and to the stent as a foreign body. [...] As assessed in clinical trials during the late 1980 and 1990s, using only balloon angioplasty (POBA, plain old balloon angioplasty), up to 50% of patients suffered significant restenosis; but that percentage has dropped to the single to lower two digit range with the introduction of drug-eluting stents. [...] Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and <b>everolimus</b> are the three drugs used in coatings which are currently FDA approved in the United States. [...] As opposed to bare metal, drug eluting stents are covered with a medicine that is slowly dispersed with the goal of suppressing the restenosis reaction. [...] The key to the success of drug coating has been (a) choosing effective agents, (b) developing ways of adequately binding the drugs to the stainless surface of the stent struts (the coating must stay bound despite marked handling and stent deformation stresses), and (c) developing coating controlled release mechanisms that release the drug slowly over about 30 days. [...] One of the newest innovations in coronary stents is the development of a dissolving stent. [...] Abbott Laboratories has used a dissolvable material, polylactic acid, that will completely absorb within 2 years of being implanted.|$|E
5000|$|A study {{published}} in 2012 shows that <b>everolimus</b> sensitivity varies between patients depending on their tumor genomes. A group of patients with advanced metastasic bladder carcinoma (NCT00805129) [...] treated with <b>everolimus</b> revealed a single patient who had a complete response to <b>everolimus</b> treatment for 26 months. The researchers sequenced the genome of this patient and compared it to different reference genomes and to other patients' genomes. They found that mutations in TSC1 led to a lengthened duration of response to <b>everolimus</b> and {{to an increase in}} the time to cancer recurrence. The mutated TSC1 apparently had made these tumors vulnerable to treatment with <b>everolimus.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} line setting, nivolumab {{demonstrated}} an overall survival advantage in advanced clear {{renal cell carcinoma}} over <b>everolimus</b> in 2015 and {{was approved by the}} FDA. Cabozantinib also demonstrated an overall survival benefit over <b>everolimus</b> and was approved by the FDA as a second-line treatment in 2016. Lenvatinib in combination with <b>everolimus</b> was approved in 2016 for patients who have had exactly one prior line of angiogenic therapy.|$|E
50|$|Inhibition of mTOR, the {{molecular}} target of <b>everolimus,</b> extends the lifespan of model organisms including mice, and mTOR inhibition {{has been suggested}} as an anti-aging therapy. <b>Everolimus</b> was used in a recent clinical trial by Novartis, and short-term treatment was shown to enhance {{the response to the}} influenza vaccine in the elderly, possible by reversing immunosenescence. <b>Everolimus</b> treatment of mice results in reduced metabolic side effects compared to sirolimus.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>everolimus</b> (Afinitor) {{is labeled}} for {{treatment}} of progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.

50|$|Other {{treatment}} options include biological therapies such as <b>everolimus,</b> torisel, nexavar, sutent, and axitinib, {{the use of}} immunotherapy including interferon and interleukin-2. Immunotherapy is successful in 10 to 15% of people. Sunitinib is the current standard of care in the adjuvant setting along with pazopanib; these treatments are often followed by <b>everolimus,</b> axitinib, and sorafenib.|$|E
50|$|<b>Everolimus</b> is {{an analog}} of {{sirolimus}} and {{also is an}} mTOR inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Everolimus</b> {{is used in}} {{drug-eluting}} coronary stents as an immunosuppressant {{to prevent}} restenosis. Abbott Vascular produce an everolimus-eluting stent (EES) called Xience Alpine.

50|$|Compared {{with the}} parent {{compound}} rapamycin, <b>everolimus</b> is more selective for the mTORC1 protein complex, with {{little impact on}} the mTORC2 complex. This {{can lead to a}} hyper-activation of the kinase AKT via inhibition on the mTORC1 negative feedback loop, while not inhibiting the mTORC2 positive feedback to AKT. This AKT elevation can lead to longer survival in some cell types. Thus, <b>everolimus</b> has important effects on cell growth, cell proliferation and cell survival.|$|E

50|$|Although, {{sirolimus}} had generated fears over use of m-TOR inhibitors in liver transplantation recipients, due {{to possible}} early hepatic artery thrombosis and graft loss, use of <b>everolimus</b> {{in the setting}} of liver transplantation is promising. Jeng et al., in their study of 43 patients, concluded the safety of <b>everolimus</b> in the early phase after living donor liver transplantation. In their study, no hepatic artery thrombosis or wound infection was noted. Also, a possible role of <b>everolimus</b> in reducing the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after liver transplantation was correlated. A target trough level of 3 ng/mL at 3 months was shown to be beneficial in recipients with pre-transplant renal dysfunction. In their study, 6 of 9 renal failure patients showed significant recovery of renal function, whereas 3 showed further deterioration, one of whom required hemodialysis.|$|E
