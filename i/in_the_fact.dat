5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that {{the significance of the}} attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E
5|$|The 1936 {{season was}} fairly active, with 20 {{tropical}} cyclones including 3 tropical depressions. Seven storms became hurricanes, of which one {{became a major}} hurricane.

Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{of their}} lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the {{indigenous}} sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she had never had to sit an exam before entering university.|$|E

5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. The result was the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. The result was that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E

5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Velázquez depicts a back view of its subject who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E

5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female is evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just {{one of the three}} is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar city, with a {{population}} of 14,791 at the 2001 census, {{is one of the oldest}} cities in India. The city lies on the shore of Pushkar Lake. The date of its actual origin is not known, but legend associates Brahma with its creation concurrent with the lake; Brahma is said to have performed penance here for a darshan (sight) of god Vishnu. Thus, its uniqueness lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of its historic-religious-cultural background, and as a result it attracts approximately 100,000 visitors every month, apart from the very large congregation that occurs during the annual Pushkar Fair. However, the Pushkar Lake is central to its sustenance as a religious centre. The tourist arrivals during 2005 were reported to be about 16.12 million (said to be the maximum among all tourist attractions in Rajasthan), out of which the foreign tourists were about 63,000.|$|E

The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists for structures in modern species.|$|E

Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he had returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E
5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that its rooms are single occupancy.

In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female floors are 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E
