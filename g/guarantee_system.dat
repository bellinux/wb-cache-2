Feedback-loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software, as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process, to <b>guarantee</b> <b>system</b> properties at run-time. Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems. In particular, they have been applied {{to the development of}} products such as IBM's Universal Database server and IBM Tivoli. From a software perspective, the autonomic (MAPE, monitor analyze plan execute) loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems.|$|E

Specifically we investigate two main issues: (1) determinants of bank risk, and (2) market discipline to the banks either in implicit, explicit <b>guarantee</b> <b>systems,</b> and all periods. Using Indonesian data, we find that domestic, foreign, and ownership concentration have positive impact on bank risk. Bank shareholders engage in entrenchment behaviour, rather than convergence behaviour. We further find that charter value and compliance to regulation have negative impact on bank risk. Next, we find that market disciplines the banks. Market disciplines the banks at thesame degree in implicit and explicit deposit <b>guarantee</b> <b>systems.</b> Our findings highlight the importance of {{paying close attention to}} banks ownership, charter value, and compliance to regulation. Furthermore, since we find that market disciplines the Banks at the same degree in explicit and implicit <b>guarantee</b> <b>systems,</b> we need to investigate this issue further. This finding highlights research potential in the future: to investigate disciplining behaviour from various types of depositors...|$|R
