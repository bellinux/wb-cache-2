5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed <b>enclosures</b> more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion <b>enclosures</b> for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage <b>enclosures</b> prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural <b>enclosures</b> and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E
5|$|The castle is divided, {{along its}} length, into three <b>enclosures,</b> each {{separated}} by a deep dry moat. There are some similarities with Château Gaillard, built by Richard the Lionheart in the closing years of the 12thcentury, which also consists of three <b>enclosures</b> and sits on a promontory above a nearby town.|$|E
5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} {{of output}} power for directionality, so it requires more <b>enclosures</b> {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of <b>enclosures.</b> Sixteen <b>enclosures</b> in four rows were used in 2007 {{at one of the}} stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E

30|$|Using a {{checklist}} of more than 400 <b>enclosure</b> owners in each location, systematic random sampling was used to select 40 <b>enclosure</b> owners {{in each of the}} three locations in Chepareria ward to attain a sample of 120 households. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data on household demographic characteristics, age of <b>enclosure</b> since establishment, the number and size of <b>enclosure,</b> <b>enclosure</b> income, <b>enclosure</b> management practices/regimes, <b>enclosure</b> ownership and distance from <b>enclosure</b> to tarmac and Chepareria market. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs) were used to complement the information gathered through the semi-structured questionnaire. Five KIIs and eight FGDs were conducted to clarify and give more insights on aspects of <b>enclosure</b> management, ownership/tenure, size and reasons for <b>enclosure</b> establishment. Literature review was used to contextualize the study while observation was critical in identifying the stated management systems.|$|R
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker <b>enclosures.</b> Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer <b>enclosures</b> can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer <b>enclosures</b> can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported <b>enclosures.</b> Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer <b>enclosures</b> greater durability.|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{southern}} pudu (Pudu puda) was {{performed at the}} zoo Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden during twelve days in Mars and April 2014. Observations were performed during twilight. Time budget and <b>enclosure</b> use was examined, when the animals {{had access to the}} whole <b>enclosure</b> of 1000 m 2 or a smaller part of the <b>enclosure</b> of 200 m 2. There was almost no difference in time budget between the two <b>enclosure</b> sizes. At both <b>enclosure</b> sizes the animals spent most of the time at a place that was hidden from outside the <b>enclosure.</b> The hidden place was situated in the house. Also {{the rest of the house}} was a place where the animals spent a lot of time. The big <b>enclosure</b> part, the part of the <b>enclosure</b> that the animals did not have access to in the 200 m 2 <b>enclosure,</b> was more rocky and hilly, which might have been features the animals preferred. Another reason to the preference of the big <b>enclosure</b> part might have been that the animals didn’t have access to that part of the <b>enclosure</b> the whole time and therefor found it more exciting. The three small shelters in the <b>enclosure</b> were seldom used. The shelter that was used the most was located in the part of the <b>enclosure</b> the animals didn’t have access to when they were in the small <b>enclosure.</b> The pudus seemed to be affected by not always having access to the whole <b>enclosure,</b> but additional observations are desired to ensure chance didn’t impact on the results. In the future it would be interesting to do a follow-up to study the animals at different times of the day. It would also be interesting to study enrichments to see if the animals would like to spend more time in other places than the house if the rest of the <b>enclosure</b> was enriched...|$|R
5|$|There is {{a record}} of a {{windmill}} at Ambrosden in 1300. A document of 1633 records a Windmill Field and Windmill Way.

By 1623 there had been several small <b>Enclosures</b> of agricultural land in the parish and by 1685 some common lands {{were reported to have}} been enclosed, with further <b>enclosures</b> reported between 1702 and 1785.

5|$|At the Union of 1707 England {{had about}} five times the {{population}} of Scotland, and about 36 times as much wealth, however, Scotland began to experience the beginnings of economic expansion that would begin {{to allow it to}} close this gap.
