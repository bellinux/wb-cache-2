5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million.

2500|$|American Horse {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} advocates of education for the Indian, and his son Samuel and nephew Robert were among the first students at Carlisle.

American Horse agreed to send two sons and a daughter for first class: Ben American Horse, Samuel American Horse and Maggie Stands Looking. Charles A. Eastman recalled, “His daughters were the handsomest Indian girls of full blood that I ever saw.” ...|$|E
