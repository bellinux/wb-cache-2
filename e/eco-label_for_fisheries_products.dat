In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} of promoting and rewarding the sustainable management in fisheries and aquaculture using product differentiation through eco-labelling and organic labeling respectively. At the same time food safety concerns arise due to the often food crisis experienced worldwide in the past few years. In this paper, we present a choice experiment addressing preferences for seafood products in Greece. Amongst other attributes, four different species (namely anchovy, cod, seabream and mussels) are included while two types of labels i. e. eco-label and organic label and a safety certification are introduced.

The total quality {{is a concept that}} assures the total satisfaction of clients on the entire distribution chain, including all the actors in this chain. The aquaculture and fisheries are very diverse sectors which use different breeding and fishing technologies and provide a wide variety of specific products. This induces a real complexity of the supply and distribution chain <b>for</b> fish and <b>fishery</b> <b>products,</b> including the links from the production point (fishery or farm) to the final consumer.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} that may exist between national fisheries management regimes through international markets <b>for</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>products.</b> A two-stage, two-period model is developed {{in which the}} fishing industries of a "domestic" country and a "foreign" country harvest identical <b>fisheries</b> <b>products,</b> from separate fish stocks, for the same international market. The domestic country uses a harvest policy to regulate its fishing industry in each period, while the foreign fishing industry is unregulated.

In addition to residues of agro-chemicals, veterinary drugs and heavy metal organic and inorganic contamination, infectious fish diseases represent {{one of the most}} important problems and challenges in aquaculture production, both from an economic and sanitary point of view. Diseases increase cost and reduce profit because of loss in dead fish, cost of treatment or decreased growth rate of diseased and convalescent fish.

40|$|The {{development}} of fishery technologies supports food sustainability {{to achieve a}} steady supply of fish and <b>fishery</b> <b>products.</b> However, the priorities for research and development (R&D) in fishery technologies vary by region due to differences in fish resource availability, environmental concerns, and consumer preferences <b>for</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>products.</b> This study examines trends in fishery technology innovations using data on patents granted as an indicator of changing R&D priorities. To clarify changes in R&D priorities, we apply a decomposition analysis framework that classifies fishery technologies into three types: harvesting, aquaculture, and new products. This study mainly focuses on China, Japan, and Korea as the major fishing countries in the north-east Asia region. The results show that the number of fishery technology patents granted increased between 1993 and 2015; in particular, the number of aquaculture patents granted has grown rapidly since 2012. However, the trend in Japan was the opposite, as the apparent priority given to aquaculture technology innovation decreased between 1993 and 2015. The trends and priority changes <b>for</b> <b>fishery</b> technology inventions vary by country and technology group.

High per capita fish consumption, huge market size (population), increasingly strong purchasing power, coupled with relatively liberal trade policies are among the factors behind this trend. Even though the economic crisis in the region has scaled down the degree of market expansion {{for the last two}} years, it has, on the other hand, provided trade opportunities among the regional countries <b>for</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>products,</b> including those from aquaculture. Ten species are being cultured commercialIy in the region, but only a few are important in the intra-regional trade. Shrimp, particularly black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), is the most important species being cultured and traded in the region, both in terms of volume and value. The other major species are carps, tilapia, and milkfish, but these are mostly consumed locally and only a limited quantity is traded between countries in the region.

Traditional shrimp diets in aquaculture rely on fish meal and fish oil from pelagic fish fisheries. A reduction or elimination of these ingredients would reduce the dependency of shrimp aquaculture on offshore fisheries and increase economic competiveness. Biofuel production produces algal by-products of potential use to aquaculturists that might reduce or eliminate the need <b>for</b> <b>fisheries</b> <b>products</b> in shrimp feed.

As a consequence, maintaining the integrity of fisheries resources will continue to grow in importance as a policy issue. The growth of aquaculture can affect the health of capture fisheries through several pathways. Its potentially negative impacts include habitat degradation, escaped farmed species, and the demand for wild-caught feed inputs. Evidence from existing studies is synthesized on the policy issues arising from the environmental interfaces between the two activities. IMPACT modeling is discussed and results of various scenarios are presented, addressing aquaculture’s potential to ease pressure on wild fisheries through price-induced supply response. Capture fisheries production in a slow aquaculture growth scenario is approximately 3 million metric tons higher than in a rapid aquaculture growth scenario. However, fishmeal and fish oil prices rise by nearly 50 % under the rapid aquaculture growth scenario, indicating that the growth of high-value aquaculture has the potential to influence pressure on reduction stocks, barring technical change...|$|R

30|$|The {{increase}} in global demand <b>for</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>products</b> {{has led to}} a fivefold {{increase in}} aquaculture production since 1990. Commercial feed is the highest production cost in intensive aquaculture, and residual commercial feed leads to eutrophication; hence it is important to find a low-cost alternative that has less environmental impact. We investigate the use of the filamentous green algae, Chaetomorpha sp., as a raw feed for giant tiger prawns. The giant tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon was grown in monoculture, and in co-culture with Chaetomorpha sp. to investigate the potential benefits of co-culturing. Five 20 -day-old giant tiger prawn juveniles were released in 70 -L monoculture and co-culture tanks, and the specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were measured after 10  weeks. The final mean body weight of co-cultured prawns was approximately 50  % heavier than that of monocultured prawns. The SGR in co-culture tanks was 4.79  ±  0.08  % day− 1, which was higher than that in monoculture tanks (4.14  ±  0.27  % day− 1). The FCR was 38.9  % lower in co-culture than in monoculture tanks. The protein content of Chaetomorpha sp. obtained from proximate analysis was almost the same or a little lower than other filamentous green seaweeds; however, the Chaetomorpha sp. has higher fiber and gross energy. These results show that Chaetomorpha sp. has potential for reducing feed costs in prawn intensive aquaculture through co-culturing.|$|R
