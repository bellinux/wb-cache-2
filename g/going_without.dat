She is also addicted to the drug diazepam.|$|E
5|$|After <b>going</b> <b>without</b> a rabbi {{for another}} two years, in 1921 Temple Sinai hired Rudolph I. Coffee, an Oakland native and cousin of Judah Leon Magnes. Coffee was outspoken, and passionately {{advocated}} liberal causes: he supported disarmament, birth control, and {{separation of church and}} state, and opposed prohibition, antisemitism, and Tammany Hall. Along with other local rabbis Jacob Nieto and Jacob Weinstein, he demanded the release of labor leaders and accused bombers Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. He also supported California's compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill and mentally retarded, and eugenicist E. S. Gosney's advocacy on this issue.|$|E

25|$|The {{facilities}} in Nepal had improved enough by 1998 {{to allow them}} to host that year's ACC Trophy at grounds in Lalitpur and Kirtipur (at TU Cricket Ground) and Kathmandu. Nepal themselves were unsuccessful in the tournament, <b>going</b> <b>without</b> a win.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{investigation}} into the Jamison family's disappearance {{indicated that they had}} probably not vanished of their own accord. The Jamisons' pickup truck was discovered within a few days, abandoned in Latimer County, Oklahoma, a short distance south of the town of Kinta. The Jamisons' bodies were not found, but their dog was still in the truck. The dog was malnourished after days of <b>going</b> <b>without</b> food or water. Police also discovered the Jamisons' IDs, wallets, mobile phones, a GPS system, and about $32,000 in cash. The Jamisons were known for carrying large amounts of cash with them.|$|E
25|$|The {{run for the}} Torres Strait was <b>going</b> <b>without</b> {{incident}} {{until an}} unknown destroyer and freighter were spotted on the 17th headed {{in the opposite direction}} and then on 18 February Don Isidro was attacked twice by a Japanese bomber, though without damage. That attack was decisive in the captain's decision to turn toward the friendly port of Darwin. On the morning of the 19th seven Japanese fighters strafed the ship while she was about 25 miles north of Bathurst Island. This attack holed the ship, destroyed all life boats and rafts and wounded a number of crew and defenders. In early afternoon, at about 1:30 (1330) the ship was again attacked by a single bomber and again escaped bomb damage.|$|E
25|$|From all reports, Allen was {{not only}} {{respected}} but was warmly regarded by his troops of his 1st Infantry Division, particularly the enlisted men. Like General George Patton, Allen's superior {{for much of the}} war, Allen generally placed his headquarters far forward, as close to the front line as possible. Unlike Patton, however, Allen did not bother greatly with his military appearance, frequently <b>going</b> <b>without</b> clean uniforms and haircuts. He was also reportedly the only American general officer in the European and North African theaters who preferred to sleep on the ground, rather than on a cot or in a bed. However, despite a casual attitude toward his own personal appearance, Allen did not tolerate slovenliness or incompetence in the troops under his command. He expected his soldiers to keep their weapons and equipment in perfect working order and trained the men constantly to keep them combat ready.|$|E

25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show <b>going</b> <b>without</b> revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E

500|$|Welles {{spent the}} first five months of his RKO {{contract}} trying to get his first project <b>going,</b> <b>without</b> success. [...] "They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there," [...] wrote The Hollywood Reporter. It was agreed that Welles would film Heart of Darkness, previously adapted for The Mercury Theatre on the Air, which would be presented entirely through a first-person camera. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera—unheard of at the time—the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget. Schaefer told Welles that the $500,000 budget could not be exceeded; as war loomed, revenue was declining sharply in Europe by the fall of 1939.|$|E

500|$|While he {{was going}} after water for a wounded man, Dean fell down a steep slope and was knocked unconscious. When he regained {{consciousness}} he found he had a gashed head, a broken shoulder, and many bruises. For 36 days, Dean wandered alone in the mountains trying to reach safety, <b>going</b> <b>without</b> food and medical treatment. The [...] tall Dean who had weighed [...] before the war was reduced to [...] as he wandered for the next month. On August 25, two South Koreans who pretended to be guiding him toward safety led him into a prearranged ambush of North Korean soldiers at Chinan, [...] south of Taejon and [...] west of Taegu. Dean attempted to fight the North Koreans with his sidearm to make them kill him, but they easily took the weakened Dean prisoner.|$|E
500|$|The {{secondary}} plot line, {{about the}} auditions for New Directions soloist at Nationals, was roundly criticized. Canning {{called it a}} [...] "faux drama", though he added that Jesse was [...] "a delight to despise", and VanDerWerff said it was [...] "completely ridiculous {{to do this with}} Nationals coming up" [...] in a week's time, and [...] "constructed almost entirely" [...] to make Jesse a [...] "jerk". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit on the lack of preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed [...] "like a very bad idea" [...] to be <b>going</b> <b>without</b> a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were [...] "awkwardly paced", though he thought they were [...] "fantastic"; Reiter said they [...] "stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs {{in the middle of the}} episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, [...] "stops the show cold". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy for another reason altogether: [...] "Having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first few}} nights {{involved}} camping on nearby ice floes with the constant risk of them breaking up, {{but the last}} four nights were in the boats, with Worsley spending most {{of it at the}} tiller and <b>going</b> <b>without</b> sleep for 90 hours straight. His experience with open boats came to the fore in his sound handling of the Dudley Docker, while his navigation was exemplary, guiding the fleet of lifeboats unerringly to Elephant Island once they found favourable wind conditions. [...] On the final night at sea, with Elephant Island having been sighted earlier in the day, heavy seas separated his boat from the other two lifeboats. His boat taking on water and caught in a rip, Worsley steered the Dudley Docker all through the night. Relieved early in the morning, he promptly fell asleep and could only be awoken by kicks to the head. It was three years later that he eventually found out the method that was used by his companions to shake him from his deep sleep. [...] The Dudley Docker made shore on 15 April, landing on the same shingle beach of Elephant Island as the other lifeboats. It was the expedition's first landfall in almost 18 months.|$|E
