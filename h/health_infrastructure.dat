40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} were: 1) determining the direct effect of government spending on education, <b>health</b> and <b>infrastructure</b> to economic growth and human development index, 2) investigating the direct impact of economic growth on the human development index, 3) describing the indirect consequence of government spending on the sector education, <b>health</b> and <b>infrastructure</b> to the human development index through economic growth. In order to examine the hypothesis testing, the researcher employed path analysis and used the data derived from government spending files which comprised the expenditures on education, <b>health</b> and <b>infrastructure,</b> human development index and economic growth from 1997 up to 2011. The analysis showed {{that there is a}} direct effect of government spending on education, <b>health</b> and <b>infrastructure</b> to the human development index and economic growth and indirect influences of the government expenditure on education, <b>health</b> and <b>infrastructure</b> to the human development index through economic growth. ...|$|R

25|$|When European colonials {{entered a}} region, they {{invariably}} brought new resources and capital management. Different investment strategies were employed, which included focuses on <b>health,</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> or education. All colonial investments have had persistent effects on postcolonial societies, but {{certain types of}} spending {{have proven to be}} more beneficial than others. French economist Elise Huillery conducted research to determine specifically what types of public spending were associated with high levels of current development. Her findings were twofold. First, Huillery observes that the nature of colonial investments can directly influence current levels of performance. Increased spending in education lead to higher school attendance; additional doctors and medical facilities decreased preventable illnesses in children; and a colonial focus on infrastructure translated into more modernized infrastructure today. Adding to this, Huillery also learned that early colonial investments instituted a pattern of continued spending that directly influenced {{the quality and quantity of}} public goods available today.|$|E
25|$|Before DDT, {{eliminating}} mosquito {{breeding grounds}} by drainage or poisoning with Paris green or pyrethrum was sometimes successful. In {{parts of the}} world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation. A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public <b>health</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and vector control strategies such as larvaciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.|$|E

Life expectancy at birth has increased from 39.1 in 1960 to 59.5 years in 2008, maternal and child mortality rates have dropped dramatically and the <b>health</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has been expanded. Due to Eritrea's relative isolation, information and resources are extremely limited and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) found in 2008 average life expectancy to be slightly less than 63 years. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995–2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). The National Malaria Protection Unit of the Ministry of Health has registered tremendous improvements in reducing malarial mortality by as much as 85% and the number of cases by 92% between 1998 and 2006. The Eritrean government has banned female genital mutilation (FGM), saying the practice was painful and put women at risk of life-threatening health problems.|$|E

On 27 March 2016, around 2,000 far-right protesters led by Sunni Tehreek staged a sit-in at D-Chowk in front of the parliament in Islamabad, causing a partial halt to the capital city.

The protestors also burned down cars and city main public transit station and injured journalists and bystanders. The government on the 28th called in the army to control the law and order. By 29th the crowd had shrunk to 700 protestors, however the government remained reluctant to use force against the protesters.

500|$|Due to {{the advent}} of {{antiretroviral}} drugs, HIV/AIDS has become a manageable disease for people who can access and afford treatment; however, antiretroviral therapy remains largely unaffordable and inaccessible to most people in Malawi. For example, the South East region of Malawi has disproportionately low access to antiretroviral drugs. In many rural areas, poor <b>health</b> <b>infrastructure</b> combined with widespread famine have made sustained, high-quality antiretroviral therapy difficult or impossible. In addition, donations from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria were used to fund antiretroviral therapy programs that distributed medication on a [...] "first-come, first-served" [...] basis, making the drugs more accessible to the male, urban, educated population. Because there are no explicit policies regarding the fair distribution of antiretroviral drugs in Malawi, individual health care workers often become responsible for deciding who will receive treatment, which inevitably leads to inequitable distribution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Improving {{health in}} our nation {{requires}} strengthening four major domains {{of the health care}} system: personal health management, health care delivery, public health, and health-related research. Many avoidable shortcomings in the health sector that result in poor quality are due to inaccessible data, information, and knowledge. A national <b>health</b> information <b>infrastructure</b> (NHII) offers the connectivity and knowledge management essential to correct these shortcomings. Better health and a better health system are within our reach. Discussion A national <b>health</b> information <b>infrastructure</b> for the United States should address the needs of personal health management, health care delivery, public health, and research. It should also address relevant global dimensions (e. g., standards for sharing data and knowledge across national boundaries). The public and private sectors will need to collaborate to build a robust national <b>health</b> information <b>infrastructure,</b> essentially a 'paperless' health care system, for the United States. The federal government should assume leadership for assuring a national <b>health</b> information <b>infrastructure</b> as recommended by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics and the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee. Progress is needed in the areas of funding, incentives, standards, and continued refinement of a privacy (i. e., confidentiality and security) framework to facilitate personal identification for health purposes. Particular attention should be paid to NHII leadership and change management challenges. Summary A national <b>health</b> information <b>infrastructure</b> is a necessary step for improved health in the U. S. It will require a concerted, collaborative effort by both public and private sectors. If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it. Lord Kelvin </p...|$|R
