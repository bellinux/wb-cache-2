Wright states that he reduced that number to 1-2 after other sources contradicted Eckloff.

If a Turk {{says that he is}} in love (Aşık) with somebody, it is not a love that a person can feel for his or her parents; it is <b>just</b> for <b>one</b> <b>person,</b> and it {{indicates}} a huge infatuation.

2500|$|Traditionally, {{songs are}} {{considered}} to be given, completed, to individual Blackfoot people in visions or dreams. Though it is now accepted that music, especially white music, may be composed in the European influenced sense, the traditional view still greatly affects how songs and their creation or origin are considered.
