5|$|Some {{species of}} {{cetacean}} live in rivers and lakes, but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E
5|$|The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River {{is another}} species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, {{it does not}} {{perfectly}} fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> and the finless porpoise that, although the species {{may be found in}} both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers {{may not be able to}} survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).|$|E
5|$|Aside from that, Damai is {{also one}} of the perfect places in Sarawak to see the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> as the mammals can be spotted along the Salak River, Santubong estuary and at the Bako-Buntal Bay. The Santubong Peninsula offers a few sites for bird {{watching}} with the BirdLife International Organisation has registered the whole area on Bako-Buntal Bay as an 'Important Bird Area'. Between October and March, the Buntal River become an important wintering ground for bird migration. A number of birds that have been spotted by the Malaysian Nature Society (Kuching Branch) at Buntal including a variety of plovers, sandpipers, egrets, terns and other rare migrants, while resident birds including collared kingfisher, the white-bellied sea eagle and brahminy kite.|$|E
5000|$|Australian snubfin {{dolphins}} {{are very}} similar to the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> however, while the bodies of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> are two-colored, the bodies of Australian snubfins are three-colored. Australian snubfins can vary in color from a gray to a blue-gray. Their white underside, including the belly and genitals, helps in distinguishing them from the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins.</b> [...] The Australian snubfins do not have a beak, but their necks, like the necks of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> are very flexible which leave creases or wrinkles behind their heads. [...] Australian snubfins are shy and tend to stay away from boats. The skulls and fins of Australian snubfins also have slight variations from the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Similar to the Irrawaddy, the Australian snubfins feed on fish and fish eggs, crustaceans, and cephalopods.|$|R
25|$|Another {{identified}} threat {{towards the}} <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> was noise pollution from high speed vessels. This caused the dolphins to dive significantly longer than usual. The <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> would always change directions when they encountered these large vessels.|$|R
25|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{has been observed}} when Orcaella was forced inshore and excluded by more specialised dolphins. When captive humpback dolphins (Sonsa chinensis) and <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> were held together, reportedly the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> were frequently chased and confined to {{a small portion of}} the tank by the dominant humpbacks. In Chilika Lake, local fishers say when <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake.|$|R
25|$|The Irrawaddy gives {{its name}} to the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Orcaella brevirostris), which is found in the lower reaches of the river and known to help {{fishermen}} who practice cast-net fishing. Though called <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin,</b> it has been also found in the Bay of Bengal and the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> {{populations are}} {{classified}} by the IUCN as critically endangered; in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam (Mekong River sub-population), Indonesia (Mahakam River sub-population, Borneo), Myanmar (Ayeyarwady/Irrawaddy River sub-population), the Philippines (Malampaya Sound sub-population), and Thailand (Songkhla Lake sub-population). Irrawaddy dolphins in general however, are IUCN {{listed as a}} vulnerable species, which applies throughout their whole range. In 2004, CITES transferred the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> from Appendix II to Appendix I, which forbids all commercial trade in species that are threatened with extinction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> (under {{the common}} name of snubfin dolphin, with the {{scientific}} name misspelled as Oreaella brevezastris) is included the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule I, which bans their killing, transport {{and sale of}} products. A major restoration effort {{to open a new}} mouth between Chilika lake and the Bay of Bengal in 2000 was successful in restoring the lake ecology and regulating the salinity gradient in the lake waters, which has resulted in increases in the population of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> due to increase of prey species of fish, prawns and crabs.|$|E
40|$|Records from strandings, museum specimens, {{sighting}} {{databases and}} unpublished sightings of aerial surveys were compiled {{and used to}} review the distribution and population status of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Orcaella brevirostris, in Australian waters. Stranding and museum specimen records indicate that <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> occur only in the northern half of Australia, from approximately the Brisbane River (27 ° 32 'S, 152 ° 49 'E) {{on the east coast}} to Broome (17 ° 57 'S, 122 ° 14 'E) on the west coast. Aerial surveys demonstrate that <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> occur mainly in protected, shallow, coastal waters, close to river and creek mouths, which appear to be an important habitat for the species. <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> tend to form relatively small groups of 1 - 10 animals with occasional aggregations of up to 14 animals. The status of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> in Australian waters is difficult to assess, because most data have been collected opportunistically. However, the low number of sightings during aerial surveys, in comparison with observations of other sympatric marine mammals, such as Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), suggest that <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> are relatively uncommon in Australian waters. or possibly are inadequately sampled on aerial surveys...|$|R
25|$|In Laos, {{there is}} a planned dam across the Mekong River. This could {{threaten}} {{the existence of the}} endangered <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>Dolphins</b> in downstream Cambodia. Lao's government decision is forge the dam upstream of the core habitat of the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>Dolphins.</b> This could precipitate the extinction of this specific species in the Mekong River. The dam builders' proposal is to use explosives to dig out the tons of rock. This will create strong sound waves that could possibly kill the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> due to their highly sensitive hearing structures.|$|R

40|$|<b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Orcaella brevirostris, {{present a}} {{particular}} challenge to study. They live in shallow, turbid waters, are inconspicuous, have unpredictable surfacing patters, low surfacing profiles, and are generally elusive animals. Photographs of the dorsal region of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> were taken between December 1998 and November 1999 in Cleveland and Bowling Green Bays, North Queensland, Australia {{in order to}} assess the feasibility of using photo-identification techniques in studies of this species. Thirty-five individual <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> all adults, were identified in Cleveland Bay and three in Bowling Green Bay. Distinctive features were notches on the dorsal fin, including deep scars and cuts along the dorsal region, white marks on dorsal fin, and distinct dorsal fin shapes. The use of photo-identification to study <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> is feasible. Photo-identification can contribute significantly to the study of Irrawaddy dolphins' ecology and conservation biology...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> in Asia are {{increasingly}} threatened by tourist activity, such as {{large numbers of}} boats circulating {{the areas in which}} they live.

40|$|Sounds {{produced}} by <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Orcaella brevirostris, {{were recorded in}} coastal waters off northern Australia. They exhibit a varied repertoire, consisting of broadband clicks, pulsed sounds and whistles. Broad-band clicks, "creaks" and "buzz" sounds were recorded during foraging, while "squeaks" were recorded only during socializing. Both whistle types were recorded during foraging and socializing. The sounds {{produced by}} <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> do not resemble those of their nearest taxonomic relative, the killer whale, Orcinus orca. Pulsed sounds appear to resemble those produced by Sotalia and nonwhistling delphinids (e. g., Cephalorhynchus spp.). <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> exhibit a vocal repertoire that could reflect the acoustic specialization of this species to its environment. © 2000 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|March 18 - 19, 2013 Fishing {{with the}} help of <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> is unique to Myanmar. <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins,</b> Orcaella brevirostris, which live in about 74 km segment of the Ayeyawady (previously known as Irrawaddy) in upper Myanmar help {{fishermen}} who use castnets for fishing. A total of 51 castnet fishermen from six villages can do fishing with the dolphins and about 21 dolphins in this river segment help the fishermen. Dolphins and fishermen communicate by audio and visual signals during the fishing. Fishermen can catch more fish with less fishing effort and dolphins can also feed easily on those fish which are stunned by the net throws. <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> have been protected by law in Myanmar since 1994. Nowadays, cooperative fishing practice between the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphins</b> and castnet fishermen in Myanmar has been threatened with extinction by illegal electric fishing. It is an urgent need to study aquatic noise signals of dolphins, impacts of signals used by fishermen in communication with the dolphins and other noises such as boat noise on both dolphins and cooperative fishing practice...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} recorded descriptions of the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> was by Sir Richard Owen in 1866 based on a specimen found in 1852, in the harbour of Visakhapatnam {{on the east coast}} of India. It is one of two species in its genus. It has sometimes been listed variously in a family containing just itself and in Monodontidae and in Delphinapteridae. There is now widespread agreement to list it in the family Delphinidae.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Malampaya Sound was proclaimed a {{protected}} seascape. This {{is the lowest}} possible prioritization given to {{a protected}} area. Malampaya Sound Ecological Studies Project was initiated by the WWF. With technical support provided by the project, the municipality of Taytay and the Malampaya park management developed fishery policies to minimize the threats to the <b>Irrawaddy</b> <b>dolphin</b> from by-catch capture.
