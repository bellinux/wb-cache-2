25|$|Homosexual {{behavior}} is a ground for divorce, {{an act of}} sexual misconduct punishable as a crime in Alabama, a crime against nature, an inherent evil, and an act so heinous that it defies one's ability to describe it. That is enough under the law to allow a court to consider such activity harmful to a child. To declare that homosexuality is harmful <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> new law but to reaffirm the old; {{to say that it}} is not harmful is to experiment with people's lives, particularly the lives of children.|$|E
500|$|The footage {{were taken}} to Switzerland, where colleagues at Dhondup Wangchen's {{production}} company, Filming for Tibet, assembled it into Leaving Fear Behind. The 25-minute documentary constructed from Dhondup Wangchen and Jigme Gyatso's footage showed ethnic Tibetans criticizing the choice of China to host the 2008 Summer Olympics, praising the Dalai Lama, and expressing dislike of ethnic Han migrants. [...] The result was described by The New York Times as [...] "an unadorned indictment of the Chinese government". Dhondup Wangchen states in the documentary that [...] "My aim for this film <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a famous or particularly entertaining film. This film is {{about the plight of}} the Tibetan peoplehelpless and frustrated." [...] The film premiered on the opening day of the Olympics and was clandestinely screened for foreign reporters in Beijing.|$|E
500|$|Major {{parts of}} the song [...] "Sadda Haq" [...] were shot at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala and people waving the free Tibet flag in the {{backdrop}} were shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and Imtiaz Ali when the Board asked Ali to blur the flag before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. Imtiaz Ali said, [...] "I am not concerned at all. I {{have been out of}} India for long and don’t know whats going on, but I don’t see anything controversial in the intention portrayal in the movie. The purpose of the movie <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any social message, its more about personal freedom rather than a geographical issue." [...] However, he had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film's censor done. Later an official from the Board stated: [...] "The Censor Board chief explained to them that all the cuts were made by the director voluntarily, and he had the option of appealing to a review board which he didn’t do. There were certain discussions between (Imtiaz) Ali and the Board regarding retaining a kiss between two actors (Ranbir and Nargis), but there have been no disagreement regarding deleting the flag from the frames." [...] The controversy sparked protests among the Tibetan diaspora in Dharamsala and Chennai. Later television broadcasts blotted out a [...] "Free Tibet" [...] banner featured in the song.|$|E

2500|$|Strawson {{holds that}} a similar {{analysis}} is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: [...] "To say a statement is true <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. [...] When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.' [...] The function of [...] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Danish theologian and philosopher Søren Kierkegaard adopted [...] "Hume's {{suggestion}} {{that the role of}} reason <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> us wise but to reveal our ignorance." [...] However, Kierkegaard took this as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or fideism. The [...] "fact that Christianity is contrary to reason ... is the necessary precondition for true faith." [...] Political theorist Isaiah Berlin, for example, has pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against rational theology. Berlin also writes about Hume's influence on what Berlin calls the counter-enlightenment, and German anti-rationalism.|$|E
2500|$|The Yesha Council [...] and Israel Sheli, {{launched}} {{a project to}} improve coverage of Zionist views on Wikipedia.

2500|$|Some of Guattari's diary entries, {{correspondence}} with Deleuze, and {{notes on the}} development of the book were published posthumously as The Anti-Oedipus Papers (2004). The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani write that rather than having their confidence shaken by the [...] "provocations and magnificent rhetorical violence" [...] of Anti-Oedipus, the psychoanalytic profession felt that the debates raised by the book legitimated their discipline. Joshua Ramey writes that while the passage into Deleuze and Guattari's [...] "body without organs" [...] is [...] "fraught with danger and even pain ... the point of Anti-Oedipus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> glamorous that violence or that suffering. Rather, the point is to show that there is a viable level of Dinoysian experience." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Antisemitism was a {{constant}} theme", recalled Robert Paxton. It even, at first, opposed German plans. [...] "At this time the Nazis had <b>not</b> yet decided <b>to</b> exterminate the Jews, but to expel them. Their idea <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of France an antisemitic country.

2500|$|According to Prof. Jose Sánchez, [...] "a chief {{point of}} {{criticism}} of [...] is his unwillingness to replace Cesare Orsenigo as his nuncio to Berlin". The Vatican received many contemporary complaints about Orsenigo as nuncio; for example, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, the Archbishop of Vienna, wrote to Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione in 1939, stating that Orsenigo was too timid and ineffectual. The German episcopate was divided on Orsenigo; Bishop Konrad von Preysing {{wrote a letter to}} the Vatican in 1937 calling Orsenigo too sympathetic with the Nazis, but Cardinal Adolf Bertram, the chairman of the German Bishops Conference, wrote a letter of praise recommending that Orsenigo be allowed to stay. von Preysing had a history of correspondence with Orsenigo, but became frustrated upon receiving the following response: [...] "charity is well and good but the greatest charity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> problems for the church".|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, the SPLC {{published}} {{a list of}} [...] "anti-Muslim extremists", including British activist Maajid Nawaz and ex-Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The SPLC said that Nawaz appeared to be [...] "more interested in self-promotion and money than in any particular ideological dispute", identified what it said were gaps and inconsistencies in his backstory, rebuking his assertion that British universities had been infiltrated by radical Islamists. Nawaz, who identifies as a [...] "liberal, reform Muslim", denounced the listing as a [...] "smear", saying that the SPLC listing had made him a target of jihadists. Mark Potok of the SPLC responded, [...] "Our point <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these people targets for violence... The point is to tamp down the really baseless targeting." [...] The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights & Justice subsequently addressed a public letter to the SPLC (November 8, 2016) requesting a retraction of the listings.|$|E
2500|$|While Bill Naito's {{business}} ventures were often financially risky, {{it was clear}} that the potential for profit was not his primary motive, or at least not his only motive. [...] He was widely recognized for taking on ventures that were at least as beneficial to the community as they were potentially moneymaking. When asked about his own salary by The Oregonian in 1985, he replied, [...] "I'm a little crazy. My pay may not be the best in town, but I offer good economic advice. My objective <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pile of money. That's one objective, but another is satisfaction." [...] In the early 1980s he built the 300-unit McCormick Pier Apartments along the Willamette River waterfront, just north of Old Town, replacing a derelict warehouse district and providing needed middle-income housing in an area where other developers had concluded it could not succeed. [...] He lobbied in favor of a proposal for historic Union Station to be acquired by the city (and thereby preserved), which came to fruition in 1987.|$|E

2500|$|The {{parliament}} {{finally met}} on 21 October 1680, and on 23 October, Shaftesbury {{called for a}} committee {{to be set up}} to investigate the Popish Plot. When the Exclusion Bill again came before the House of Lords, Shaftesbury gave an impassioned pro-Exclusion speech on 15 November. The Lords, however, rejected the Exclusion Bill by a vote of 63–30. The Lords now explored alternative ways of limiting the powers of a Catholic successor, but Shaftesbury argued that the only viable alternative to exclusion was calling on the king to remarry. On 23 December 1680, Shaftesbury gave another fiery pro-Exclusion speech in the Lords, in the course of which he attacked the Duke of York, expressed mistrust of Charles II, and urged the parliament to not approve any taxes until [...] "the King shall satisfie the People, that what we give <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> us Slaves and Papists." [...] With parliament pursuing the Irish investigation vigorously, and threatening to impeach some of Charles II's judges, Charles prorogued parliament on 10 January 1681, and then dissolved it on 18 January, calling for fresh elections for a new parliament, to meet at Oxford on 21 March 1681. On 25 January 1681, Shaftesbury, Essex, and Salisbury presented the king a petition signed by sixteen peers asking that parliament should be held at Westminster Hall rather than Oxford, but the king remained committed to Oxford.|$|E
