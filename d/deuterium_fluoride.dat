40|$|Levels of {{the enzyme}} α-methylacyl-CoA {{racemase}} (AMACR) are increased ca. 9 -fold in prostate cancer cells. AMACR {{is a very}} promising novel drug target as reducing AMACR levels converts castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells to androgen-dependent cells which will respond to androgen-deprivation. Despite the importance of AMACR in prostate and other cancers, there are very limited numbers of AMACR inhibitors described to-date. This is mainly due {{to the absence of}} a high-throughput assay for the screening of inhibitors against AMACR. The active-site residues and catalytic mechanism of human AMACR are still unknown, which make the rational design of drugs targeting AMACR very difficult. A range of novel potential inhibitors were synthesised using a rational drug design approach to explore the structure-activity relationship (SAR) on the side-chains of AMACR inhibitors. Their potencies were assessed using the fluoride elimination assay based on 1 H and 19 F NMR. Potency, mode of binding and kinetic parameters of these inhibitors were assessed using the multi-well colorimetric assay, which is the first AMACR high-throughput continuous assay reported to-date. A site-directed mutagenesis study was carried out to identify the active-site residues and catalytic mechanism of human AMACR. His- 122, Asp- 152, Met- 184 and Glu- 237 were identified as potential active-site residues, so the cDNA was mutated and expressed. The activity of wild-type and mutant AMACR enzymes were assessed using the <b>deuterium</b> wash-in, <b>fluoride</b> elimination and multi-well colorimetric assays. Results from these assays showed that human AMACR does not operate using a ‘two-base’ mechanism. Instead, it operates using a ‘one-base’ mechanism, most likely via water molecules acting as intermediaries within the hydrogen-bondings network in the active site. The knowledge obtained from this research informs rational drug design for this castrate-resistant prostate cancer target...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focus on}} the {{analysis}} of spin-lattice NMRD relaxation profilesmeasured in various complex systems such as proteins, zeolites and ionicliquids. Proton, <b>deuterium</b> and <b>fluoride</b> T 1 -NMRD relaxation profiles wereobtained from a fast-field cycling (FFC) instrument. It is found that alsopossible to obtain NMRD profiles from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories. NMRD Profiles were analyzed by using differentrelaxation models, such as the Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan (SBM) theoryand the Stochastic Liouville (SL) theory. Paper I described the hydration of protein PrxV obtained from a MDsimulation, and compared with the picture emerges from an analysis byusing a generally accepted relaxation model [appendix C]. The result showsthat the information from NMRD analysis is an averaged picture of watermolecules with similar relaxation times; and the MD simulations containsinformation {{of all types of}} interested water molecules with differentresidence times. In paper II NMRD profiles have been used to characterize the hydration ofthe oxygen-evolving complex in state S 1 of photosystem II. NMRDexperiments were performed on both intact protein samples and Mndepletedsamples, and characteristic dispersion difference were foundbetween 0. 03 MHz to 1 MHz; approximately. Both the SBM theory and theSL theory have been used to explain this dispersion difference, and it isfound that this is due to a paramagnetic enhancement of 1 - 2 water moleculesnearby ~ 10 Å from the spin center of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. The result showsthe reorientation of the molecular cluster is in μs time interval. Whencompare these two theories, the SL theory presented a better interpretationbecause parameters obtained from the SBM theory shows they didn’t fulfilthe presupposed perturbation criterion (the Kubo term). Paper III deals with the water dynamics in the restricted/confined spaces inthe zeolite samples (H-ZSM- 5 and NH 4 -ZSM- 5) and obtained by proton anddeuterium spin-lattice NMRD profiles. The results show that the spin-latticeNMRD can be used to characterize various zeolites. The temperature has aweak effect on the relaxation rate R 1, but the change of different counter ionsmay change the hydration and the translational diffusion pores and givedifferent R 1. Proton and fluoride NMRD profiles and MD simulations were both used tostudy the dynamics of BMIM[PF 6] in paper IV. Results indicate the reorientation of the molecules are in the ns time regime, and the effectivecorrelation time obtained from 1 H and 19 F are the same. From the MDsimulation it is found the reorientation of [PF 6]- ions is much faster (in ps) compare with BMIM+ ion which moves in the ns time range. With previous results, the FFC NMRD profiles are indeed very informativetools to study the molecular dynamics of complex systems. The MDsimulation {{can be used as a}} complementary method to obtain detailedinformation. By combine these two methods, it provide a more colorfulpicture in the study of protein hydration and liquid molecular dynamics...|$|R

There is also a DF - CO2 laser (<b>deuterium</b> <b>fluoride</b> - carbon dioxide), which, like COIL, is a [...] "transfer laser." [...] The HF and DF lasers are unusual, in that there are several molecular energy transitions with sufficient energy to cross the threshold required for lasing. Since the molecules do not collide frequently enough to re-distribute the energy, several of these laser modes operate either simultaneously, or in extremely rapid succession, so that an HF or DF laser appears to operate simultaneously on several wavelengths unless a wavelength selection device is incorporated into the resonator.|$|E

50|$|The {{possibility}} {{of the creation of}} infrared lasers based on the vibrationally excited products of a chemical reaction was first proposed by John Polanyi in 1961. A pulsed (although not chemical) laser was demonstrated by Jerome V. V. Kasper and George C. Pimentel in 1965. First, hydrogen chloride (HCl) was pumped optically so vigorously that the molecule disassociated and then re-combined, leaving it in an excited state suitable for a laser. Then hydrogen fluoride (HF) and <b>deuterium</b> <b>fluoride</b> (DF) were demonstrated. Pimentel went on to explore a DF-CO2 transfer laser. Although this work did not produce a purely chemical continuous wave laser, it paved the way by showing the viability of the chemical reaction as a pumping mechanism for a chemical laser.|$|E

50|$|On July 18, 1996, the United States and Israel {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} to produce a cooperative THEL, called the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator, which would utilize <b>deuterium</b> <b>fluoride</b> chemical laser technologies. Primary among the four contractors awarded the project on September 30, 1996 was Northrop Grumman (formerly TRW). THEL conducted test firing in FY1998, and Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was planned in FY1999. However, this was significantly delayed due to reorienting the project as a mobile, not fixed design, called Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser (MTHEL). The original fixed location design eliminates most weight, size and power restrictions, but is not compatible with the fluid, mobile nature of modern combat. The initial MTHEL goal was a mobile version the size of three large semi trailers. Ideally it would be further downsized to a single semi trailer size. However, doing this while maintaining the original performance characteristics is difficult. Furthermore, the Israeli government, which had been providing significant funding, decreased their financial support in 2004, postponing the IOC date to at least 2010.|$|E

The x-ray pair correlation functions, which are dominated by fluorine-fluorine interactions, show the first peak at approximately 2. 53 +/- 0. 05 A remains very nearly invariant with decreasing temperature. Peaks around 4. 5 and 5. 0 A also appear at both temperatures in the x-ray data.
