40|$|During {{the last}} ten years of {{regulatory}} change, many UK companies have curtailed their <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension scheme. We test three competing explanations of UK corporate pension curtailments: integration, separation and risk management. We predict and find an association between the use of managerial discretion over changes in UK firms' expected rate of return on pension assets (ERR) assumptions, and subsequent decisions to curtail future <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>obligations.</b> These findings are consistent with a risk management-based explanation, even after controlling for other factors identified by prior literature as significant in explaining pension benefit reductions. We also find that curtailments and the risk management of ERR assumptions are associated with subsequent corporate restructuring decisions. The findings support the view that pension curtailment decisions are driven by the failure to adapt to new economic and regulatory pressures and that they are ultimately determined by strategic corporate risk management considerations.

40|$|On 30 November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued Financial Reporting Standard 17 (‘Retirement Benefits’, FRS 17) to {{supersede}} Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (‘Accounting for Pension Costs’, SSAP 24). It removed managerial discretion over the main actuarial assumptions {{used to estimate}} employers’ pension obligations, and required the recognition of pension assets and liabilities on a consistent ‘fair value’ basis. However, FRS 17 was only fully effective for reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2005. This thesis examines empirically how the prolonged period associated with the debate, promotion and implementation of FRS 17 interacted with various managerial pension choices. Evidence of these interactions can help discriminate among competing theoretical perspectives concerning employers’ long-term <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension <b>obligations.</b> This thesis draws upon these competing theoretical frameworks to develop and test hypotheses concerning the impact of pension accounting regulatory change on UK firms’ discretion over pension actuarial assumptions, termination and asset allocation during the period 1998 – 2002. The empirical results support three major hypotheses. Firstly, the magnitude of expected {{rate of return on}} pension assets assumption used for financial reporting purposes is driven primarily by the UK firms’ balance sheet leverage. Secondly, firms’ <b>defined</b> pension <b>benefits</b> termination decision is inter-related with their pension financial reporting choices. Thirdly, the allocation of pension assets has been managed in a way to reduce firms’ cash contribution risks that stem from measuring both pension assets and liabilities on a ‘fair value’ basis. These findings imply managerial discretionary behaviour related to these choices is consistent with the perspective that employer firms and their sponsored pension funds are an integrated economic entity, as is asserted by the new UK pension accounting rule (FRS 17) ...|$|R

The total cost combines both explicit costs and implicit costs. The explicit costs are the contributions {{made by the}} corporation or a governmental entity to fund the future <b>benefit</b> <b>obligation.</b> The implicit costs are those incurred by not meeting the plan sponsor’s objectives. These costs are represented by a collection of real options that the plan sponsor has the flexibility to manage through the asset allocation process.

40|$|Under some <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> {{pension plans}} (typically foreign plans), the actuarial {{present value of}} {{benefits}} to which an employee is entitled if the employee terminates immediately may exceed the actuarial present value of benefits to which the employee is entitled at expected date of separation based on service to date. For example, {{the provisions of the}} Italian severance pay statute require that, in most cases, the benefit an employee has accrued for service to date is payable immediately upon separation. The undiscounted value of that benefit payable currently would exceed the actuarial present value of that benefit if payment is estimated to occur at the employee's expected termination date. Another example arises in the United Kingdom where legislation requires that deferred vested benefits of terminated employees be statutorily revalued from date of separation to normal retirement age. If the vested <b>benefit</b> <b>obligation</b> (VBO) is determined assuming employee termination at the measurement date, that VBO could exceed the accumulated <b>benefit</b> <b>obligation</b> (ABO) if that obligation is measured giving consideration to a statutory revaluation only after the employee's expected date of termination. The issue is whether the VBO is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is entitled if the employee separates immediately (Approach 1) or the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement (Approach 2).

The employer settles its pension obligation {{through the}} purchase of insurance annuity contracts from an insurance company. The employer {{may or may not}} terminate the <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> pension plan. The employer appropriately applies the guidance of Statement 88. Subsequently, the insurance company becomes insolvent and is unable to meet all of its obligations under the annuity contracts. The employer decides to make up some portion or all of any deficiency in annuity payments to the retirees. The issue is how the employer should account for the cost of making up the deficiency in annuity payments to the retirees. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the employer should recognize a loss in the circumstances described above at the time the deficiency is assumed by the employer if any gain was recognized on the original settlement. The loss recognized would be the lesser of (1) any gain recognized on the original settlement or (2) the amount of the <b>benefit</b> <b>obligation</b> assumed by Copyright © 1991, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 1 the employer.

40|$|This audit {{finds that}} the quality and {{timeliness}} of financial reporting across the NSW public sector has continued to improve. Executive Summary Audit Result An unqualified audit opinion was issued on the Total State Sector Accounts for the year ended 30 June 2014. Quality and Timeliness of Financial Reporting The quality and timing of financial reporting has continued to improve across the NSW public sector. Timeframes have reduced {{and the number of}} errors has fallen since 2011 - 12. Opportunities for improved quality and timeliness of financial reporting still exist. Moving to more regular and frequent preparation of financial reports during the year will improve financial management of the sector. Financial Analysis - General Government Sector Budget Result The Budget Result for the year ended 30 June 2014 was a surplus of $ 1, 247 million (deficit of $ 1, 731 million for the year ended 30 June 2013), $ 3. 1 billion better than originally budgeted in June 2013. Revenues were 5. 5 per cent above original budget, while expenses were less than one per cent above original budget. The Budget Result was $ 259 million better than forecast in the 2014 - 15 Budget Papers, published in June 2014. Financial Analysis – Total State Sector Significant Transactions The State received $ 2. 8 billion from the lease of port operations in Newcastle, the sale of Eraring Energy and Delta West’s Mt Piper and Wallerawang power stations. The State recorded a gain of $ 611 million on these transactions. In 2012 - 13, the State received $ 5. 0 billion from other asset sale transactions and recorded a gain of $ 2. 0 billion. Revenues and Expenses Total revenues and expenses for the whole-of-government were $ 76. 1 billion ($ 70. 0 billion in 2012 - 13) and $ 73. 3 billion ($ 70. 4 billion), respectively. After the results from discontinued operations are included ($ 10. 0 million), the State’s Net Operating Balance was a $ 2. 8 billion ($ 49. 0 million) surplus. While the State’s total revenues and expenses exceed those reported by other states and territories, revenues and expenses per capita are lower than those in other jurisdictions. After fair value adjustments to liabilities and other losses, the State recorded an Operating Result of $ 1. 5 billion ($ 4. 3 billion) surplus. Taxation revenues increased by 10. 7 per cent overall, as a result of all sources of tax revenue increasing. Stamp duties of $ 7. 8 billion increased by $ 1. 6 billion or 25. 5 per cent from 2012 - 13. Treasury advises this was largely from growth in residential property sales, due to low interest rates, and an increase in large commercial transactions. Commonwealth grants totalled $ 27. 3 billion, $ 2. 7 billion more than in 2012 - 13. This was mainly due to a $ 1. 3 billion increase in National Partnership Payments relating to transport funding and a $ 1. 1 billion increase in general purpose payments from the Australian Government, which mainly comprise New South Wales’ share of the Goods and Services Tax. Employee costs of $ 35. 1 billion were 48 per cent of total expenditure, which is relatively consistent with previous year’s $ 34. 1 billion (49 per cent). Employee costs grew by 2. 8 per cent from the 2012 - 13. Assets and Liabilities The value of the State’s assets was around $ 340 billion at 30 June 2014 ($ 323 billion at 30 June 2013). The assets mostly comprise property, plant and equipment to provide or support service delivery. Capital expenditure was $ 14. 5 billion in 2013 - 14 ($ 14. 6 billion in 2012 - 13). In addition to the infrastructure assets reflected in the Total State Sector Accounts, the State has engaged in over forty public private partnerships to deliver infrastructure and services. The State’s total liabilities increased to around $ 172 billion at 30 June 2014 ($ 163 billion at 30 June 2013). Borrowings increased by $ 5. 7 billion or 7. 4 per cent to $ 82. 3 billion. The State’s net liability for the <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> superannuation scheme increased by around $ 6. 9 billion from $ 44. 2 billion to $ 51. 0 billion due to a change in accounting standards that remeasured the <b>defined</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>obligation</b> to include superannuation contributions tax on employer contributions. Fiscal Responsibility Credit Rating The State has maintained its AAA credit rating. In June 2014, Moody’s affirmed its Aaa rating and stable outlook, noting New South Wales is well placed compared to most Australian states and territories. Most recently in October 2014, Standard & Poor’s affirmed its AAA rating and elevated its outlook to ‘stable’ (up from ‘negative’) ...|$|R

40|$|Pension {{funds have}} played a {{critical}} role in the evolution of the markets for debt and equity securities and their derivatives in the U. S. over the last 15 years.
