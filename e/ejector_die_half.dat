500|$|Two dies {{are used}} in die casting; one is called the [...] "cover die half" [...] and the other the [...] "ejector die half". Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die {{contains}} the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The <b>ejector</b> <b>die</b> contains the <b>ejector</b> pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mold cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the <b>ejector</b> <b>die</b> {{is attached to the}} movable platen. The mold cavity is cut into two cavity inserts, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.|$|R

40|$|In this research, a {{study of}} the effect of a <b>die</b> <b>half</b> angle on the {{extrusion}} process has been performed. The experiments were conducted at room temperature around 27 °C.

The test lubricants used were paraffinic mineral oil VG 460 and Refined, Bleached and Deodorized (RBD) Palm stearin. The material of the workpiece (billet) was annealed with A 1100 aluminium. The experimental results were focused on the extrusion load, tool and workpiece surface roughness and plastic deformation of the workpiece. The resultant relative velocity was calculated using a visioplasticity method. The results shows that a taper angle of 60 ° recorded higher resultant relative velocity with a lower extrusion load and surface roughness compare to the taper angle of 45 °. The comparison study between Paraffinic Mineral Oil and RBD Palm Stearin shows no significant effect in both taper angles tested...|$|R
