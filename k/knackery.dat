5000|$|A knacker (...) is {{a person}} in the trade of {{rendering}} animals that have died on farms or are unfit for human consumption, such as horses that can no longer work. This leads to the slang expression [...] "knackered" [...] meaning very tired, or [...] "ready for the knacker's yard", where old horses are slaughtered and the by-products are sent for rendering. A knacker's yard or <b>knackery</b> is different from a slaughterhouse, where animals are slaughtered for human consumption. In most countries, <b>knackery</b> premises are regulated by law.|$|E
50|$|Kovco {{grew up in}} Briagolong in Victoria's Gippsland region, east of Melbourne, and {{completed}} the Victorian Certificate of Education at Maffra Secondary College in 1998. Before enlisting in the army, he worked in a <b>knackery</b> processing dead livestock. He was a keen mountain bike rider and also raced motorcycles. He was married to Shelley and they had two children, Tyrie and Alana.|$|E
50|$|Slaughterhouses {{that process}} meat not {{intended}} {{for human consumption}} are sometimes referred to as knacker's yards or <b>knackeries,</b> used for animals that are not fit for consumption or can no longer work on a farm such as work horses that can no longer work.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ireland {{has long}} been renowned as a major centre for the breeding, rearing and keeping of horses. Since 2007, however, there has been {{increasing}} concern for horse health and welfare standards, and links between these concerns and the structures, governance and funding of the Irish equine industries have been reported. This paper addresses two central issues: firstly the local governance of, trade in and disposal of unwanted horses; and secondly mechanisms employed to improve standards of care given to horses owned by certain communities. Method Primary information was gathered through visits to horse pounds run by and on behalf of Local Authorities, to social horse projects, to horse dealer yards, ferry ports, horse slaughter plants and <b>knackeries.</b> Results The approach adopted by members of a given group, e. g. ferry ports, is described and differences are highlighted, for example in how different Local Authorities implement the Control of Horses Act of 1986, and how the choice, for example, of disposal route affects the standard of animal welfare. Conclusions There is a pressing need for a more centrally mandated and uniformly applied system of governance to safeguard the health and promote the keeping of horses to a higher welfare standard in Ireland. Fundamental {{to an understanding of}} why there is insufficient oversight of the keeping and proper disposal of horses is the lack of a comprehensive, integrated system for the registration, identification and tracing of equidae in Ireland. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe aspects of case study herds investigated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF) in which animal welfare incidents occurred and to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that can be monitored to enhance the Early Warning System (EWS). Despite an EWS being in place for a number of years, animal welfare incidents continue to occur. Questionnaires regarding welfare incidents were sent to Superintending Veterinary Inspectors (SVIs), resulting in 18 herds being chosen as case study herds, 12 of which had a clearly defined welfare incident date. For each study herd, data on six potential KPIs were extracted from DAFF databases. The KPIs for those herds with a clearly defined welfare incident date were studied for a consecutive four year window, with the fourth year being the 'incident year', when the welfare incident was disclosed. For study herds without a clearly defined welfare incident date, the KPIs were determined on a yearly basis between 2001 and 2009. Results We found that the late registration of calves, the use of on-farm burial as a method of carcase disposal, an increasing number of moves to <b>knackeries</b> over time and records of animals moved to 'herd unknown' were notable on the case farms. Conclusion Four KPIs were prominent on the case study farms and warrant further investigation in control herds to determine their potential to provide a framework for refining current systems of early warning and prevention. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{estate was}} {{purchased}} in 1939 by Henry Dryden Ward from Wolsingham, County Durham. After the World War II his son Robert Henry {{and his wife}} Lena moved into Home Farm with their two young sons Dryden and Barrie. The hall fell into disrepair {{and much of the}} stonework was taken down and removed to Wolsingham by Henry Dryden Ward, which was later used to build Rogerley Hall {{on the outskirts of the}} village. This family still own the estate today. For many years they used the remainder of the derelict building as a <b>knackery,</b> they ran a successful sawmill business then turned their hand to the leisure industry. They designed and built a nine-hole golf course, while continuing to allow fishing in the lake. The gardener’s cottage, now a separate business is a flourishing restaurant, licensed to sell alcohol of course.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Knackery</b> {{by-products}} are rendered under regulation into {{fats and}} meat and bone meal for incineration. Cattle hides may be recovered for leather production. The kinds of animal processing which can occur at knackeries {{are defined by}} law, for example, in Australia by the Commonwealth Meat Inspection Act 1983. [...] In the EU the legislation covering knackeries is the REGULATION (EC) No 1069/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 21 October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption. [...] The trade of collecting and rendering is by its nature unpleasant and pungent. The trade and those who practice it {{were considered to be}} repellent in many societies, resulting in a social separation. This is so not only in Ireland or Britain, but also, for example, in Japan, where it is performed by burakumin. In the past this deterred people from entering the trade but in modern times knackeries have become profitable businesses.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out between June 1970 and December 1971 in which gall {{bladders}} from cattle either slaughtered for food consumption or disposed of through knackeries were cultured for salmonellas. Salmonella dublin was isolated from 28 of 1917 gall-bladders of adult cattle killed in the slaughterhouse at Carmarthen, and from 23 of 197 gall-bladders obtained from adult cattle sent to a <b>knackery</b> at Abergwili, near Carmarthen. The results are compared with a similar survey carried out in 1947 and 1948. Between June and November 1971 gall-bladders and uteri were also obtained from a slaughterhouse in Newcastle Emlyn, North Carmarthenshire, and a <b>knackery</b> in Tanygroes, South Cardiganshire. S. dublin was cultured from two gall-bladders but from none of the uteri of the 161 slaughterhouse cases. Seven of the 46 cows from the <b>knackery</b> yielded S. dublin on culture: 2 in the gall-bladder only, 3 in the uterus only and 2 in both gall bladder and uterus...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{occurrence}} of gastrointestinal parasites in horses in Perth. To apply polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of some species of encysted larval cyathostomes. Design: Between February and September of 2000, the gastrointestinal tracts of 29 horses submitted to a local <b>knackery</b> and Murdoch University Veterinary hospital in Perth were examined post mortem {{for the presence of}} gastrointestinal parasites. Procedure: The gastrointestinal tract was divided into six sections, which were screened for the presence of parasites such as Gasterophilus sp, Anoplocephala sp and Parascaris equorum. Samples of contents were taken for worm counts. Results: Cyathostomes were found in 28 of the 29 horses. Eighteen species of gastrointestinal helminths were identified. Twelve of these were cyathostomes, with the four most common species being Cyathostomum catinatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus and Cylicostephanus goldi. The large strongyle, Triodontophorus serratus, was found in three of the horses but species of Strongylus were not found. Conclusions: In contrast to a study conducted on horses from this region in 1985, cyathostomes were the most common gastrointestinal parasites found. The four most common cyathostome species found in the present study correlated well with findings of studies in other locations. The high number of cyathostomes {{may be due to the}} increase in resistance to anthelmintics among the species, and to improper anthelmintic use. The apparent reduction in number of large strongyles may be due to the widespread use of ivermectin, which is very effective against these parasites, and also possibly because some larvae may not have been detected...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the hand-held immunochromatographic assay was a reliable method for field based diagnosis of anthrax. This study was designed and conducted with an emphasis on obtaining an estimate of performance accuracy, in terms of specificity for the protective antigen (PA) component of the anthrax toxin. To examine specificity the hand-held assay had to be assessed under similar circumstances to that experienced in the field from typical animals in which anthrax may be suspected. To achieve this, blood samples were collected post-mortem from 240 cattle at the Stanhope and Camperdown knackeries in Victoria. Blood smears were prepared, hand-held assays were performed on-site and a sample of blood transported back to the laboratory for bacterial culture. All 240 samples gave negative results in the hand-held assay and B. anthracis was not detected in any sample by culture or blood smear, which were considered the definitive diagnostic tests. Thus the hand-held assay was regarded as 100 % specific (98. 5 - 100 %; 95 % CI) for these cattle examined in Victoria. The purpose of the second study was to determine whether the live Sterne strain 34 F 2 vaccine for anthrax would result in false positives arising in the hand-held assay in cattle recently vaccinated. Ten cattle were vaccinated with the 34 F 2 vaccine and monitored for 15 days. No PA was detected in the blood of vaccinated cattle in the hand-held assay or on culture within this time. These results show that the hand-held assay does not give false positive test results in cattle post-vaccination with live 34 F 2 B. anthracis vaccine. The hand-held assay can be used with confidence on samples from recently vaccinated cattle that have died when it is necessary to know whether they had succumbed to anthrax or not. The hand-held assay has the potential to be adopted as a routine test for the preliminary assessment of sudden death in cattle. The simplicity of the assay enables it to be used by unskilled lay people, which means that it could be used by <b>knackery</b> workers for surveillance in areas with a previous history of disease or by veterinarians as a preliminary routine tool in investigating sudden death in cattle. However the study described in this thesis only assesses the specificity of the assay and a further study, involving a similar number of cattle affected with anthrax, needs to be conducted to assess the sensitivity of the assay...|$|E
