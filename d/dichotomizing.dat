The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being <b>dichotomizing</b> and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{prognostic}} prediction between <b>dichotomized</b> and fractionated evaluations of hormone receptor expressions. Methods: Patients with stages I–III breast cancers, who received adjuvant tamoxifen, were enrolled. The expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). A fractionated score (F score), {{the percentage of}} positive-staining nuclei (0 =none, 1 = 1 %– 10 %, 2 = 11 %– 30 %, 3 = 31 %– 50 %, 4 = 51 %– 70 %, and 5 = 71 %– 100 %), was assigned to each case. The <b>dichotomized</b> scoring method defines an F score > 1 as positive. The prognostic values of both scores were compared by multiple Cox’s proportional hazard models of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Four hundred and sixteen patients with a median follow-up of 78. 0 months were included. F scores for ER and PR correlated directly with DFS and OS. Although both the <b>dichotomized</b> and fractionated ER and PR scores {{were significantly associated with}} DFS and OS in univariate analyses, only fractionated ER and PR scores remained as independent prognostic factors of DFS and OS in the final multiple Cox’s proportional hazard models. Conclusion: Fractionated IHC hormone receptor expression evaluation enhances the prognostic prediction compared with a <b>dichotomized</b> assessment...|$|R

50|$|One of Zimmermann’s major goals was {{to improve}} the plant {{systematics}} and taxonomy using informative phylogenetic morphological and developmental characters, such as plant telomes. Specifically, Zimmermann founded the telome theory, stating that telomes, or the most terminal ends of <b>dichotomizing</b> plant branching systems, evolved to form more complex structures such as leaves, roots, and reproductive organs of ferns and other vascular plants. He utilized this theory in plant classification to reveal insights about how aquatic plants first colonized land {{and the evolution of}} basal vascular plants.|$|E

The healthcare utilization data of 198 patients with POFP were collected using a structured interview and a validated “use of services and productivity” questionnaire. Unit costs were used with these utilization data to calculate direct healthcare costs in 3 categories: consultation, medication, and appliances and interventions. Consultation costs were a significant proportion of cumulative healthcare cost (P < 0. 001). <b>Dichotomized</b> GCPS status was predictive of increased healthcare cost over the last 6 mo, accounting for an average increase of £ 366 (95 % confidence interval, 135 to 598; P < 0. 01) when moving from a low GCPS status to a high GCPS status. Given the predictive capability of <b>dichotomized</b> GCPS status and the success of stratified models of care for other persistent pain conditions, <b>dichotomized</b> GCPS status may offer an opportunity to help determine stratification of care for patients with POFP...|$|R
