25|$|Marine {{energy or}} marine power (also {{sometimes}} referred to as ocean energy, ocean power, or marine and <b>hydrokinetic</b> energy) refers to the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy, or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes, transport and industries.|$|E
25|$|Marine energy, {{also known}} as ocean energy and marine and <b>hydrokinetic</b> energy (MHK) {{includes}} tidal and wave power and {{is a relatively new}} sector of renewable energy, with most projects still in the pilot phase, but the theoretical potential is equivalent to 4–18 million tonne of oil equivalent (toe). MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, wave energy converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream turbines in fast-moving rivers, ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents, and ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters.|$|E
25|$|Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows {{an income}} tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as {{adjusted}} for inflation for 2013) {{for the production of}} electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and <b>hydrokinetic</b> renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type.|$|E
25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{increased}} size and armor of the vehicle, a more powerful 400hp Detroit Diesel 6V53TIA turbocharged/aftercooled diesel engine is installed {{in place of the}} original 275hp engine on the M113, giving a power-to-weight ratio of 20hp/ton. This is coupled to an Allison X200 cross-drive, four-speed <b>Hydrokinetic</b> transmission. As a result of the longer chassis and improved engine a sixth road wheel is added (the M113 only has five). As an option the vehicle can be of 350hp only. The modifications allows the EIFV to keep up in terms of speed and mobility with modern tanks such as the M1A1/A2 Abrams, which are used by the Egyptian Army, despite the added weight. The vehicle can travers slopes up to 80%, side slopes of 40%, trenches 2200mm wide, and vertical obstacles with a height of 710mm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrokinetic</b> {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E
