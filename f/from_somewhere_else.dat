5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else.</b> MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, {{probably due to the}} resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else,</b> since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of strokes: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke happens when a person’s artery, which {{supplies}} blood to different areas of the brain, becomes blocked with a blood clot. This type of stroke happens 80% of the time. The blood clot may form in the blood vessel, which is called a thrombus, or the blood clot can travel <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else</b> in the blood system that is called an embolus. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or bursts. Overall, people experience bleeding inside or around brain tissue. This type of stroke happens 20% of the time and is very serious. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are weak vessels, traumatic injury, chronic high blood pressure hypertension, and an aneurysm.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} genetic classification, Koti is {{generally}} considered {{to belong to the}} Makhuwa group (P.30 in Guthrie's classification). A large portion of its vocabulary however derives from a past variety of Swahili, today the lingua franca of much of East Africa's coast. This Swahili influence is usually attributed to traders <b>from</b> Kilwa or <b>somewhere</b> <b>else</b> on the Zanzibar Coast, who in the fifteenth century settled at Angoche.

50|$|The {{story of}} Lothoo’s {{migration}} to Bathot is very interesting. One-day son of Thakur of Ringas, popularly called kunwar, {{was going on}} horse. He saw Lothoo passing by his horse but not saluting the kunwar. This irked the kunwar who climbed down the horse and started abusing Lothoo and even slapped Lothoo. Lothoo in turn without showing any anger picked the kunwar by hand, slapped him and threw him in air. The kunwar died on the spot. Lothoo told this incidence to his parents.

[...] One alternative was that life's origins on Earth had come <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else</b> in the Universe. Periodically resurrected (see Panspermia, above) Bernal said that this approach [...] "is equivalent in the last resort to asserting the operation of metaphysical, spiritual entities... it turns on the argument of creation by design by a creator or demiurge."

2500|$|Opportunity Rover {{found that}} the soil at Meridiani Planum was {{very similar to the}} soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however in many places at Meridiani the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules that were named [...] "{{blueberries}}." [...] These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral hematite. [...] It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules. [...] After further study it was decided that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water. [...] Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit. [...] The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock. [...] Most of the soil consisted of olivine basalt sands that did not come from the local rocks. [...] The sand may have been transported <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Tiriel survives in only {{a single}} {{manuscript}} copy, located in the British Museum. An eight-page document written in Blake's hand, the manuscript is inscribed [...] "Tiriel / MS. by Mr Blake". It is believed that up to page 8, line 4 ("Lead me to Har & Heva I am Tiriel King of the west"), the poem is a fair copy, transcribed <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else,</b> but at 8:4 the quantity of corrections and alterations increases, and the writing becomes scribbled and in a different ink {{to the rest of}} the poem. This difference has led Erdman to argue that the later part of the poem was not transcribed, but was worked out in the manuscript itself, and may have been rushed. Additionally, many of the handwritten corrections, emendations and deletions in the parts of the poem prior to 8:4 are in the same ink as the lines after 8:4, suggesting Blake went back over the manuscript and revised earlier parts of it when he returned to finish it.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the name}} [...] "Andhra" [...] in the Puranas has led some {{scholars}} {{to believe that the}} dynasty originated in the eastern Deccan region (the historic Andhra region, present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana). At Kotilingala in Telangana, coins bearing the legend [...] "Rano Siri Chimuka Satavahanasa" [...] were found. Epigraphist and numismastist P. V. P. Sastry initially identified Chimuka with the dynasty's founder Simuka, because of which Kotilingala {{came to be known as}} the only place where coins attributed to Simuka were found. Coins attributed to Simuka's successors Kanha and Satakarni I were also discovered at Kotilingla. Based on these discoveries, historians such as D. R. Reddy, S. Reddy and Shankar R. Goyal theorized that Kotlingala was the original home of the Satavahanas. However, the coin samples from Kotlingala are small, and it is not certain if these coins were minted there or reached there <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else.</b> Moreover, the identification of Chimuka of Kotilingala with the dynasty's founder Simuka has been contested by several scholars including P. L. Gupta and I. K. Sarma, who identified Chimuka as a later ruler. P.V.P. Sastry also later changed his view, and stated that the two kings were different. As for the Puranas, these texts were compiled much later, during the Gupta period, and it is not certain if the Satavahanas were referred to as Andhras during their time.|$|E

Even the animal style tattoos were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms.
