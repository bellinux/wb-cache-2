5|$|Banks broke <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> Craven Cottage on {{the opening}} day of the 1962–63 season, in a 2–1 defeat by Fulham. Leicester went to chase a {{possible}} double, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals whilst lying top of the table in April. City beat Liverpool 1–0 at Hillsborough to reach the final, with Banks keeping a clean sheet despite his goal being under a near-constant siege from the Merseyside club. The News of the World reported that Liverpool had had 34 attempts on goal to Leicester's one, and Banks later stated that it was his finest performance at club level. Unluckily, Banks then broke a finger in a 2–1 defeat by West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, and was out injured as Leicester lost their final three league games, ending the season in a disappointing fourth place. In the 1963 FA Cup Final Banks {{and the rest of the}} team underperformed, and lost the game 3–1 to Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|The {{excitement}} and {{interest of the}} dying game now centred around the batting performance of Alan Knott. His last day survival {{was more than just}} occupation of the crease. Beginning the day without a run to his name, he consistently thumbed <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the Australian attack for over three hours, playing shots even though he knew that his ship was sinking under his very feet. It was a magnificent solo effort of defiance.|$|E
500|$|After the Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds, the Series {{returned}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. Stengel won it, 1–0, {{on a home}} run into the right field bleachers. As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team's principal owner, Jacob Ruppert, who demanded that Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, [...] "a man who wins two games with home runs may feel a little playful, especially if he's a Stengel". The Yankees won the next three games to take the Series; Stengel batted [...]417 in the six games, completing his World Series career as a player with a [...]393 batting average.|$|E
6000|$|... "While {{they was}} talking who should come along but George English hisself! He came {{right up to}} the table, and they all sat back on the bench and stared at ’im fierce, and Henery Walker crinkled <b>’is</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R

500|$|Looking {{for a new}} {{headquarters}} Comcast asked Arden Group and Mariner Commercial Properties to {{work together}} and combine the properties into one building. The two developers briefly held discussions about combining the two sites, but by 2001 no agreement was reached and both developers had decided to move on with their own towers. As they sought to build competing condominium towers, {{the relationship between the two}} developers soon turned into a feud between the firm's lead partners, Craig Spencer of Arden Group and Tim Mahoney of Mariner Commercial Properties. In 2003 Mahoney received permission from the City Zoning Board of Adjustment to build a 50-story residential tower at the 1441 Chestnut Street site. At the zoning hearing Spencer attempted to block approval by saying the building was too tall and that it would damage his site by blocking views and casting shadows. He also said the tower was [...] "snubbing <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> the traditional zone of respect around City Hall." [...] Spencer filed a lawsuit to block construction of the building and a Court of Common Pleas ruled that the Zoning Board erred in approving 1441 Chestnut Street. Mariner appealed the ruling.|$|E
500|$|When Theresa [...] "had {{her eye on}} Ste" [...] for a {{potential}} boyfriend, Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail quipped [...] "Given his history of violence towards women, that might be realised more literally than she would like." [...] When he kissed Brendan, Stephen said Ste had {{joined the ranks of}} [...] "very confused young men" [...] that have featured in Hollyoaks. She added he had [...] "banged about wanting to be a good boyfriend and dad for aeons" [...] and being the victim of domestic violence was ironic for him. She later said the serial was brave for tackling gay domestic violence. She opined that Richardson gave an [...] "incredible performance" [...] and felt she was not alone in perceiving the storyline to be [...] "deeply disturbing" [...] and [...] "deeply moving". She later expressed her view that [...] "Ste hasn’t experienced much normality in his young life". She concluded that Ste never seemed to have a trouble free day. The Liverpool Daily Post said [...] "You know you're not flavour of the month when even Ste Hay looks down <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recalling Ali's anti-war position, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said: [...] "I {{remember}} the teachers at {{my high school}} didn't like Ali {{because he was so}} anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him." ...|$|E

60|$|George Barstow {{walked off}} 'ome, {{but he was}} in such a state o' mind 'e didn't know wot to do. Bob Pretty turning up <b>'is</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> fifteen pounds like that made 'im think that Joe Clark 'ad promised to pay 'im more if the cat was dead; and at last, arter {{worrying}} about it for a couple o' hours, 'e came up to this 'ere Cauliflower and offered Bob the fifteen pounds.|$|R
2500|$|On {{his return}} to the United States in 1940, Seldes {{published}} Witch Hunt, an account of the persecution of people with left-wing political views in America, and The Catholic Crisis, which sought to demonstrate the close relationship between the Catholic Church and fascist organizations in Europe. When Time reviewed the latter, it noted several of Seldes' works and said he [...] "stuck out his tongue at Benito Mussolini... thumbed <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> U. S. journalism...and uttered some hoarse Bronx cheers at the Roman Catholic Church." [...] The review complained that his detailed accounts of church activities were [...] "in part damaging" [...] but [...] "not all germane to the subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace-Johnson's {{charisma}} {{and lack of}} pretentiousness made him well liked among Sierra Leoneans. At one point, he declared to working class Creoles, [...] "I am not anything above yourselves. I am at par with you." [...] His opponents conceded that Wallace-Johnson's [...] "considerable personal magnetism for the masses" [...] were admirable qualities. According to , Wallace-Johnson's most important characteristic was his [...] "truculence and his apparent willingness to thumb <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> officialdom". In public, he spoke jokingly of colonial officials who most Sierra Leoneans feared. He casually referred to officials {{on a first-name basis}} and criticised them [...] "in diatribes and invectives the like of which had never before been heard in the Freetown society where decorum and savoir faire were the hall-marks of the leaders". His associations with England's members of Parliament also lent credence to his reputation.|$|E
2500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} of the Civil Aeronautics Board {{arrived at}} the scene of the crash at midnight of October 23. The remnants of the aircraft were placed under military guard for the duration of the investigation. During the course of the investigation, it was learned that Lieutenant Wilson of the B-34 and First Officer Reppert of Flight 28 had trained together, and had met up the previous night and talked about their chances of meeting while in flight. Though they briefly discussed the possibility of signalling each other, they made no such plans to the effect. The B-34 copilot, Sergeant Leigh, told investigators that Wilson had confided that he'd like to fly close to the airliner and [...] "thumb <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> him." [...] It was for this reason that the bomber circled twice around March Air Force Base in order to ensure that the aircraft would meet up during the flight to Palm Springs.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it is our}} cow-bell. It belonged on {{the black}} farrer cow, that Jim turned <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> up <b>at,</b> and he sneaked around and got it just to spite us." ...|$|R
60|$|O' course, {{we could}} {{understand}} the parson--'is pride wouldn't let 'im; but a low, poaching, thieving rascal like Bob Pretty turning up <b>'is</b> <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> ten pounds {{was more than}} we could make out. Even on the second day, when George Barstow made it ten pounds down and a shilling {{a week for a}} year besides, he didn't offer to stir; all he did was to try and make fun o' them as was looking for it.|$|R
5000|$|... "The small stout boy {{reviewed}} several {{incidents of}} the day in his mind: concrete against <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> jeers <b>at</b> <b>his</b> black felt beard, 'General Garbage,' and the recent threat to render his face concave." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{patted her}} on the shoulder, and she took his hand, holding it for comfort. With the other, the Colonel loudly blew <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> <b>At</b> last Mrs Parsons dried her eyes.|$|E

60|$|Now Will, too, {{had been}} at Marybone and Hockley-in-the-Hole, and after a gasp for breath and a glare over <b>his</b> {{bleeding}} <b>nose</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> enemy, he dashed forward his head {{as though it had}} been a battering-ram, intending to project it into Mr. Henry Warrington's stomach.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{night he}} sat {{thinking}} about it. Gentle Mistress Moon {{looked down at}} him through the tree-tops, and something inside him urged him to tell her his troubles. He pointed <b>his</b> sharp <b>nose</b> up <b>at</b> her, opened his mouth and, because she was so far away, did his best to make her hear. That was the very first Wolf howl ever heard. There was something very lonely and shivery and terrible in the sound, and all who heard it shook with fear. Mr. Wolf didn't know this, but he did know that he felt better for howling. So every night he pointed <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> up <b>at</b> Mistress Moon and howled.|$|R
