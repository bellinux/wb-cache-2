When the chute was closed, water collected behind the <b>dam.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>work</b> also extended to the stream below the splash dam, {{which had to be}} cleared of obstacles and often had its banks cleared for some distance above the waterline. This was an effort to prevent as many logs as possible from becoming stuck {{on the banks of the}} creek. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a law on March 28, 1871 allowing splash dam construction and clearing of creeks to allow loose logs to float better.|$|E

40|$|The current {{topographic}} {{maps of the}} Rhone Delta—and of Lake Geneva in general—are mainly {{based on}} hydrographic data that were acquired {{during the time of}} F. -A. Forel {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century. In this paper we present results of a new bathymetric survey, based on single- and multi-beam echosounder data. The new data, presented as a digital terrain model, show a wellstructured lake bottom morphology, reflecting depositional and erosional processes that shape the lake floor. As a major geomorphologic element, the sub-aquatic Rhone Delta extends from the coastal platform to the depositional fans of the central plain of the lake at 310 m depth. 9 canyons cut the platform edge of the delta. These are sinuous (‘‘meandering’’) channels formed by erosional and depositional processes, as indicated by the steep erosional canyon walls and the depositional levees on the canyon shoulders. Ripples or dune-like morphologies wrinkle the canyon bottoms and some slope areas. Subaquatic mass movements are apparently missing on the delta and are of minor importance on the lateral lake slopes. Morphologies of the underlying bedrock and small local river deltas are located along the lateral slopes of Lake Geneva. Based on historical maps, the recent history of the Rhone River connection to the sub-aquatic delta and the canyons is reconstructed. The transition from three to two river branches dates to 1830 – 1840, when the river branch to the Le Bouveret lake bay was cut. The transition from two to one river branch corresponds to the achievement of the correction and <b>dam</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> on the modern Rhone River channel between 1870 and 1880...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: On {{concrete}} <b>dam</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work,</b> it {{is necessary}} to manufacture a large amount of concrete and CSG (Cemented Sand and Gravel). The manufacture plant of concrete and CSG is operated in very long term, therefore the effect of its environmental impact could be serious. In general, {{there are two types of}} manufacture plant on the process of manufacturing concrete or CSG. The one is batch type plant; its mixing process is not continuous and {{it is necessary}} to repeat the processes of measuring and mixing every batch. The other is continuous mixing plant; mixing process is completely continuous, at the same time, the measurement and supplement of materials are also carried out continuously. Since continuous mixing plant can manufacture a large amount of products at short time, continuous mixing plant is suitable for manufacture plant of concrete dam construction. But it is hard to control the quality of products, so batch type plant used to be adopted as the mixer of the manufacture plant. In recent years, the new continuous mixing plant which can control the quality of products accurately has developed and been put to practical use on several projects of concrete and CSG dam construction. The best feature of this plant is its energy saving effect. This plant is equipped with a static continuous mixer for mixing concrete or CSG. This mixer is set up in vertical direction, and then it is possible to mix materials with no electric power but only by gravity force. In this study, environmental impact due to manufacture concrete and CSG by conventional batch type plant and new continuous mixing plant are estimated and compared, and then the advantage of new continues mixing plant for environment is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Hampstead Heaths eight-hundred {{acres of}} field and forest were {{acquired}} {{for the public}} in 1871. It was the first metropolitan open space in London to be acquired {{as a result of}} decades of campaigning, and is therefore central to discussions of public spaces, landscapes, and urban open spaces in Britain. This dissertation takes the Heath as its subject, arguing that its history is palimpsestic, offering a many-layered, multitudinous array of narratives that have not yet been adequately reflected in historical studies of the site. As Britain faces a new wave of privatization and threats to public spacea situation likened by some to the rampant enclosures of the nineteenth centuryI argue that the Heath and its history remain central to conflicts over access to public spaces. Through the lenses of environmental history, environmental aesthetics, and multispecies ethnography, I consider the ways in which human and nonhuman agencies have shaped the landscape and its management from the eighteenth century to the present. I consider cases as diverse as how water flow has shaped the Heath, as debates rage over <b>dam</b> <b>construction</b> <b>work</b> taking place on the site, {{to the ways in which}} sheep, corpses, and bramble scrub have contributed to the development of a management plan for the site. 	Specifically, this dissertation brings environmental history, environmental aesthetics, and multispecies ethnography into conversation, underscoring the ways in which the tools of each can contribute to a richer retelling of a landscapes many historical narratives. I draw on the work of aesthetician Arnold Berleant and ethnographer Anna Tsing to tell a fuller story of the Heaths complex history. I explore the Heath through a variety of methods: archival research; analysis of landscape aesthetics; descriptive accounts of my own aesthetic experience; participant ethnography in the form of interviews and first-hand accounts; and on-the-ground study of the Heaths landscape and natural history. In doing so, I call attention to the ways in which the many histories of Hampstead Heath are bound up with social, political, aesthetic, and nonhuman worlds, arguing that attending to their entanglement allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complex forces that shape access to public open spaces in Britain today...|$|E

The tower was constructed in the extreme eastern section of the Pharos island, and it was connected to the coastline by a huge <b>dam.</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>works</b> were completed in 280 B. C. Lighthouse of Alexandria was the highest ancient structure, except for Great Pyramids in Giza. It was a three-storey tower made of marble blocks. The lighthouse served as a fortress and protected the harbor. A detailed description of the functional design of the lighthouse, composition of its facades, peculiarities of its sculptural decorations are available now, and the same about the mechanism of delivery of fuel needed for the flashlight on the tower top. The author also discusses the technical problems of its maintenance and the most probable reasons for its destruction (earthquakes, etc.).

In addition, the application of high-fluidity concrete for dams {{has been the subject of}} research with the aim of further rationalization of <b>construction</b> <b>works.</b> Since high-fluidity concrete can have the characteristics of high density and high strength without compaction, the use of this material for buildings has been highly promoted. However, the use of high-fluidity concrete for mass concrete such as for dams can cause thermal cracking problems. For this reason, studies are being made to solve such problems by increasing the maximum aggregate size in high-fluidity concrete and decreasing the unit cement content.

Riverbed degradation is discussed by comparing four different longitudinal profiles surveyed in 1928, 1951, 1970 and 1998 in the 120 km long reach upstream of the outlet. The analysis of channel narrowing is carried out by comparing a number of cross-sections surveyed in different years across the same downstream reach. Field sediment transport measurements of seven major floods that occurred between 2003 and 2006 are compared with the bedload transport rates predicted by the most renowned equations. The current low bedload yield is discussed in terms of sediment supply limited conditions due to land use changes, erosion-control works and extensive and out of control bed material mining that have affected the Reno during the last decades...|$|R

To better understand such morphological changes and their causes, the hydraulic geometry data of several cross sections and the longitudinal profile data of the Reno river, surveyed at different times, were analysed emphasizing a dramatic streambed incision that took place between 1950 s and 1980 s, with a volume of sediment lost of about 18 x 106 m 3. At the same time a field campaign was started in 2003 collecting representative bed material samples and sediment transport measurements with Helley-Smith bedload sampler to assess the present river dynamics and evolution. Bedload transport rate resulted very low also during floods larger than bankfull stage and even those equations renown in the literature to underpredict bedload transport overestimate the sediment transport of the Reno R. Among the equations used those predicting transport rates closer to the actual surveyed values are modified Meyer-Peter & Muller equation The river transport capacity always resulted by far larger than sediment supply and no significant relation was found between flow parameters and the bedload transport rates measured. The occurrence of cyclic peaks and lows of bedload rate and a clear seasonality were as well. Sediment deficit of the Reno river system results from many factors including an increase in forest cover, presence of dams for agricultural and hydroelectric purposes, engineering works on the watershed and on the river channel, large bed material exploitation and likely a decrease in flood frequency...|$|R

Proportion of early-successional species was higher at the upstream site while late-successional species were dominant at the downstream site, as predicted. Lower fluctuations in discharge downstream of the dam may have helped succession advance, whereas at the upstream site, mainly during the high water period, floods could have caused sloughing of life forms from the outer layers of the biofilm, resetting the algal community to early successional stages. It may be concluded that the dam affected algal community and favored succession advance mainly by reducing current velocity and flow fluctuations...|$|R
