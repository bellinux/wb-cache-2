5|$|In the 1870s, the {{municipal}} government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating {{to share the}} spoils of political office.

The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run <b>for</b> <b>Mayor</b> <b>of</b> Buffalo, provided {{that the rest of}} the ticket was to his liking. When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent. He took office January 2, 1882.|$|E
