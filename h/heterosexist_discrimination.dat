25|$|Because LGBT {{people have}} {{historically}} been marginalized as sexual minorities, {{coming out of the}} closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a backlash of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> and homophobic violence.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} terms for {{homosexual}} people are lesbian for females and gay for males, though gay {{is also used}} to refer generally to both homosexual males and females. The number of people who identify as gay or lesbian and the proportion of people who have same-sex sexual experiences are difficult for researchers to estimate reliably for a variety of reasons, including many gay or lesbian people not openly identifying as such due to homophobia and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Homosexual behavior has also been documented and is observed in many non-human animal species.|$|E
40|$|Lesbians {{of color}} exemplify persons with multiple, marginalized identities. Scholars theorize {{that they are}} {{susceptible}} to racist, <b>heterosexist,</b> and sexist <b>discrimination.</b> Given the multiple pathways of discrimination, scholars postulate that lesbians of color are susceptible to adverse mental health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorders, and decreased life satisfaction (Williams and Williams-Morris, 2000). However, most literature on lesbians of color and mental health is primarily theoretical or conceptual while empirical evidence is limited. Further, the scant literature on lesbians of color that exists primarily explore Black and/or Latina lesbians, while very {{little is known about}} the mental health of Asian American and Native American lesbians. The purpose of my research study was to explore how Asian American lesbians' mental health is affected by the convergence of multiple societal oppressions such as racism, heterosexism, and sexism (N= 167). Additionally, I explored how both enculturation and unsupportive social interactions among Asian American lesbians moderates the relationship between mental health and perceived experiences with racism, heterosexism, sexism. Perceived experiences with racist, heterosexist, and sexist events were each measured by Asian American Racism-Related Stress Inventory (AARRSI; Liang, Li, and Kim, 2004), Heterosexist Harassment, Rejection, and Discrimination Scale (HHRD; Szymanski, 2006), and Schedule of Sexist Events (SSE; Klonoff and Landrine, 1995), respectively. To measure each moderator, level of enculturation and unsupportive social interactions, the study utilized Asian Values Scale (AVS; Kim et al., 1999) and Unsupportive Social Interactions Inventory (USII; Ingram, Betz, et al., 2001), respectively. Lastly, mental health outcomes were measured by Mental Health Inventory (MHI; Veit and Ware, 1983). Correlation analysis and multiple regression analyses evaluated the relationship among these variables. Results indicated that heterosexist events uniquely predicted mental health, unsupportive social interactions were predictive of mental health, and unsupportive social interactions significantly moderated the relationship between perceived experiences with racism and mental health. Limitations and implications future research and clinical practice are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The court {{referred}} to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Norris v. Ireland and of the Supreme Court of Canada in Vriend v. Alberta, finding that <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> causes psychological harm to gays and lesbians and affects their dignity and self-esteem. It also observed that the criminalisation of sodomy legitimises blackmail, entrapment and [...] "queer-bashing". Noting that gay men are a permanent minority in society who have been severely affected by discrimination, and that the conduct that is criminalised is consensual and causes no harm to others, the judgment determined that the discrimination is unfair and therefore infringes on the constitutional right to equality.|$|E

5000|$|Female {{athletes and}} sports that {{adhere to the}} {{feminine}} ideal receive increased benefits, including positive media attention, fan adoration, sponsorships, and reduced <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination.</b> [...] Women must present a body and appearance that conforms to heterosexist social norms. On the other hand, [...] boys are taught that masculinity in sports is {{defined in terms of}} [...] "toughness and dominance and to express disdain for females and any boy seen as weak or unwilling to take risks on or off the playing field".> Society and media emphasize athletic women's physical appearance and sexual attractiveness, through representing them as women first and athletes second. Thus, the feminine athletic ideal consists of an attractive appearance, thin body, and sexual appeal, which is conveyed also through clothing: women sportswear must fit snugly, but, most important must be sheath, exaggerating the female shape. In health/fitness magazines are included four stereotypes for masculinity: physical action, power, stance, and muscles. While for female it included three stereotypes: thin ideal, glistening/”wet” look, and feminine face. Thus, the health/fitness magazines tended to used the masculine and feminine ideals through stereotypes more than fashion magazines. Thus, who practice health-fitness tend to be less dressed or used close-fitting with the intention to emphasize the appeal.|$|E
40|$|Racial {{minority}} men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) experience greater levels of discrimination and higher rates of HIV infection. However, little is known about the associations between racial and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> and HIV risk behavior. Further, little is known about the mechanisms of the association between racial and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> and HIV risk behavior. There is some evidence to suggest that depression may be a mechanism that mediates the relationship between racial and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> and HIV risk behavior. Thus, one purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which discrimination based on both race and sexual orientation, alone and in combination, are associated with HIV risk behavior. A secondary purpose of this study was to examine whether the relationship between discrimination and HIV risk behavior is mediated by depressive symptoms. Lastly this study sought to examine whether the relationships between discrimination, depressive symptoms, and HIV risk behavior were mediated by social support, LGBT and Native identity, and LGBT and Native community participation. This study analyzed data from the HONOR project, the first national study of two-spirit individuals, which included 221 American Indian and Alaska Native MSM. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which experiences of racial and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> were associated with HIV risk behavior. Results indicate that <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> was associated with HIV risk behaviors, whereas racial discrimination was not. Conversely, results indicate that racial discrimination was associated with depressive symptoms, whereas <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> was not. This study found no association between depressive symptoms and HIV risk behavior, even when accounting for alcohol and substance use. Results indicate that depressive symptoms are not a mechanism that explains the association between discrimination and HIV risk and perhaps the better mechanism to examine in future studies is substance use. Finally, LGBT community participation was shown to have protective effects against HIV risk behaviors. These findings have the potential to guide development of mental health and HIV prevention interventions for Native MSM, with special attention to LGBT community participation and social support. Future research should examine attributes such as types, sources, and frequency of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> and LGBT community participation...|$|E
40|$|Minority stress theory {{recognizes the}} {{presence}} of added stress for individuals that belong to marginalized minority groups (Meyer, 2003). When considering {{the mental health of}} those who identify as sexual minorities, the role of internalized heterosexism (i. e. negative, self-hating thoughts attributed to a pervasive culture that stigmatizes non-heteronormativity) becomes crucial (Szymanski, 2008; Watson et al., 2016). We measured the relation between <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> as a measure of sexual minority stress and endorsement of disordered eating behaviors and cognitions in a sample of university students and then tested self-criticism as a moderator of this relation. Participants completed a battery of self-report instruments measuring self-criticism, heterosexism, and disordered eating behaviors and cognitions via an online platform. Main effects of self-criticism on specific DE outcomes were found, along with zero-order correlations between sexual minority stress, self-criticism, and DE outcomes.

40|$|Exposure to <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> {{may vary}} by a person’s place of residency. Utilizing a {{minority}} stress perspective, an online survey of self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals (n = 285) examined whether rural and small town inhabitants experienced greater exposure to six types of enacted stigma. After comparing {{the frequency of}} enacted stigma by community type, findings demonstrated that rural LGBs reported experiencing more homophobic statements, property damage, and employment discrimination than urban LGBs. Small town LGBs also encountered addi-tional amounts of housing discrimination and were more often chased by strangers com-pared with urban sexual minorities. Finally, disclosure practices and hierarchies based on race and social class also influenced exposure to discrimination. The importance of spatial factors often intensified when respondents disclosed their sexual identity more publicly. When exploring racial and class differences, affluent sexual minorities experi-enced less employment discrimination and white sexual minorities {{were less likely to}} experience several forms of heterosexist events (especially being punched and kicked).

40|$|This study {{examined}} sexual-minority women’s reports of sexism, heterosexism, and gendered heterosexism (discrimina-tion {{that is both}} sexist and heterosexist) as predictors of social identity and collective action during college. A measure of gendered heterosexism was developed that assesses women’s experiences with discrimination that is simultaneously sex-ist and heterosexist in nature. Thismeasure was distinct frommeasures of sexism and heterosexism and had good internal consistency. The sample included 83 sexual-minority college women (mean age = 19. 93 years). Significant differences occurred between groups of women based on their identification as lesbian/queer or bisexual. Lesbian/queer women reported significantly more <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination,</b> social identity, and commitment to sexual orientation activism than did bisexual women. After controlling for reported sexism, heterosexism, and their interaction, reported gendered heterosexism uniquely predicted social sexual-orientation identity, commitment to feminist activism, and commitment to lesbian/gay/bisexual/queer (LGBQ) collective action. Thus, young LGBQ women may experience discrimination that is qualitatively different from sexism, heterosexism, or high levels of both sexism and heterosexism. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} the implications of intersectionality on sexual-minority women’s experiences and identity development. Women and sexual minorities in emerging adulthood ex-perience frequent and harmful encounters with discrim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Utilizing the {{resource}} model of political participa-tion, we identify the antecedents of willingness {{to sign a}} petition supporting employment protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people among sexual mi-nority and heterosexual college students. Through secondary data analysis, we investigate the role of sociodemographic, mobilizing context, and framing variables, including various LGBT-related attitudes {{that have never been}} integrated in a single regression of LGBTactivism. Results from a sample of sexual minority (n = 367) and heterosexual (n = 1, 707) college students suggest that the majority of students from both sexual orientation groups are willing to sign a petition for LGBT rights. Although the impact of framing variables, such as transphobia and liberal identity, were most influential among both groups, the relevance of some framing antecedents (i. e., heterosexist attitudes and the disclosure of sexual identities) was specific to each sexuality. Before the inclusion of framing factors, knowing LGBT peers and observing <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> inspired greater activism among both sexuality groups as did being female and a graduate student; however, the significance of religious factors were only important among heterosexual students. Implications for future research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Lesbian, gay, and {{bisexual}} (LGB) individuals are challenged daily regarding {{the lack of}} emotional support from employers in acknowledging cultural differences. The LGB population is {{at high risk for}} <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> despite new employment laws that protect individuals from termination based on sexual orientation. Previously completed research indicated that LGB employees who felt supported emotionally in the workplace showed a higher rate of future employee recruitment, increased productivity, quick adjustment periods for new employees, decreased stress, and were committed to their agency. The purpose of this research study was to develop strategies to help the LGB population feel supported in the workplace. The strategies were identified from anonymous surveys completed by employees in the developmental disability support field. The study participants are members of the Advancing Strong Leadership program for North Carolina Developmental Disability (DD) Professionals. Participants shared their personal perceptions of how supportive their agency is for the LGB population. The results showed that 86. 36 % of the survey participants felt a change could be made to their agency to help increase support and acceptance for LGB employees. There were 16. 6 % of the employees that identified as LGB from public and non-profit agencies. The results suggest strategies for improving agency climate for LGB workers...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the associations between homophobia and heterosexism, psychodynamics of the subconscious mind, and life satisfaction among gay men during emerging adulthood. Although researchers have reported on the psychological distress associated with antigay oppression, limited research is available on the psychodynamics of young gay men in the United States, a place known for prevalent homophobia and heterosexism. Kohut 2 ̆ 7 s theory of self psychology and self object needs served as the theoretical foundation for the study. Selfobject needs, perceived homophobic and <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and life satisfaction were explored in a national sample of 118 gay men aged 18 - 25 years. Data were collected using the Selfobject Needs Inventory, Gay and Lesbian Oppressive Situation Inventory, and Satisfaction with Life Scale in a secure internet-based survey. Analysis of the data revealed significant and positive bivariate correlations between antigay oppression and elevated selfobject needs. Elevated selfobject needs were also related to psychodynamic protective reactions and maladjustment. The study results also revealed a significant negative correlation between antigay oppression and life satisfaction. The social change implications of this study relate to treatment planning and developing social programs that aim to decrease antigay oppression by informing mental health clinicians and the wider public about the inter-relationships between homophobia, heterosexism, selfobject needs of young gay men, and their life satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|The queer fandom {{of female}} Hong Kong pop singer Ho Denise Wan See (HOCC) from 2009 to mid- 2011 is dealt with through the {{qualitative}} methodology of in-depth interviews and media ethnography. HOCC, an idiosyncratic cultural producer who dabbles {{in the politics}} of ambiguity, creates texts that invite queer interpretations from fans and from queer activists in Hong Kong. Via analyses informed by both queer studies and audience studies, the various creative practices of fans in reshaping their sexual identities via popular culture are explored. These practices are highly political and empowering to a queer audience. However, the intensive rewriting of meanings as queer symbolic creativity and tactics in cultural politics fail to transform into formal institutional politics and more confrontational queer activism. This is so for several reasons. Internally, the hierarchical structure of fan organization, fan proximity to the culture industry, and the top-down encouragement of social charity as the only channel of activism have all reduced the possibility of transforming fans' queer sensibilities into institutional queer politics. Furthermore, Hong Kong, under the influence of three major discourses that seek to discipline and regulate sexualities—traditional Chinese ethics, the British colonial legacy, and the postcolonial revival of rightist Christianity—has a long social history of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> and a preference for normalizing when striving for queer citizenship. This empirical study examines relations between cultural specificity and fan agency in a non-Western context...|$|E
40|$|Anti-gay aggression, from {{harassment}} {{to violent}} assault and even murder, is prevalent in contemporary U. S. society. Violence against {{lesbians and gay}} men can be placed toward the more severe end of a continuum of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination</b> that occurs within the larger context of cultural heterosexism. A large body of evidence documents the pervasiveness of heterosexist attitudes and beliefs as well as identifies the correlates of anti-gay sentiment. To a much lesser extent, behavioral indicators of heterosexism have also been empirically observed. To date, however, very little research has systematically investigated face-to-face anti-gay aggression within a traditional social psychological laboratory experiment. This study investigated the influence of sexual orientation and gender of a target person, participant gender, and whether the participant acted alone or {{in the presence of a}} same-gender peer, on direct and indirect aggression using a Buss-type procedure. Overall, men were found to be more directly and indirectly aggressive than women, providing some validity to the operational definitions of aggression employed here. The primary hypothesis, that lesbian and gay labeled targets would elicit more aggression than unlabeled targets was supported. This effect was not mediated by the gay targets 2 ̆ 7 gender, the participants gender, whether the participants acted alone or in the presence of a same-gender peer, or by individual attitudes toward {{lesbians and gay men}}. These findings strongly suggest that being identified as gay or lesbian is a powerful mediator of aggression. Implications of these findings for strategies aimed at reducing anti-lesbian/gay aggression, and for future research are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{national}} survey of almost 4000 people, the report reveals strong links between psychological distress and drug use among LGBT Australians. Executive Summary A Closer Look at Private Lives 2 is a companion to the second Private Lives report released in 2012. The research and writing of both reports were funded by beyondblue and the Movember Foundation. The project was jointly managed by GLHV and ARCSHS, La Trobe University. Background The first Private Lives was released in 2006 and at the time was one of the largest reports on LGBT health and wellbeing anywhere in the world. Both the first and second reports provided a snapshot of LGBT Australian’s everyday lives. They included demographic data on diversity within LGBT communities and data on LGBT Australian’s physical and mental health, health service use, relationships, experiences of discrimination and community connections. This companion report, in contrast, focuses on the mental health and wellbeing of LGBT Australians. It relies on the mental health data from Private Lives 2 and looks, in detail, at variations in psychological distress and resilience between LGBT and mainstream communities and variations within LGBT communities according to gender identity, sexual identity, age and socio-economic status. It also looks at the relationships between LGBT Australians mental wellbeing and their experiences of <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination,</b> drug use, LGBT and mainstream community engagement, and health service use. The report concludes with an evidence-based LGBT mental health policy and program framework to guide the development of policies, programs and services aimed at promoting LGBT Australians’ positive mental health and their access to quality care. Methodology Private Lives 2 reported on the findings of {{a national}}, online survey of the lives of 3, 835 LGBT Australians. Respondents came from all states and territories and from rural, regional and remote areas. The companion report used two of the validated scales from Private Lives 2 as measures of mental health outcomes: the K 10 Psychological Distress Scale; and the Brief Resilience Scale. The development of the LGBT mental health policy and program framework involved a review of recent Australian population and health promotion strategies and a separate review of the research and grey literature on LGBT-inclusive service provision in Australia and overseas.

40|$|Research into {{discrimination}} {{on the grounds of}} sexual orientation and identity is becoming increasingly relevant in the workplace. In many nations gay rights have progressed to be in the forefront of the political and social arena and organisations are now turning their focus towards optimising the benefits of increasing workplace diversity. Still, discrimination in the form of heterosexism of GLBT employees continues to be a problem. Heterosexism is defined as a socio-political system that rejects, defames, and stigmatises any non-heterosexual type of behaviour, association, or community, with the continued promotion of a heterosexual lifestyle and concomitant subordination of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender ones. Although {{a number of studies have}} begun to address this issue, large gaps remain in the literature. The aim of this study was to design a model to better understand the antecedents and outcomes of workplace <b>heterosexist</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Participants from multiple organisations from all states across Australia completed an online questionnaire regarding their experiences in the workplace to assess heterosexist harassment, in relation to organisational support and their concealment and disclosure in the workplace. Using a structural equation modelling framework the relationship between these variables was used to predict the well-being of employees in the Australian labour market. Well-being was measured in the form of psychological well-being, job satisfaction, satisfaction with life and mental health. The study indicated that disclosure and concealment of sexual orientation in the Australian workplace are not significantly affected by direct and indirect heterosexism. The study indicates significantly that organisational support plays a large role in influencing the type of heterosexism, which is present in the Australian workplace. The study indicated that when organisational support for GLBT employees is promoted in the form of policies and activities endorsing these policies, direct heterosexist behaviours decrease but indirect heterosexist behaviours increase. This suggests that employees engage in more underhanded/indirect ways of discriminating GLBT employees when organisations support for GLBT employees is present. This relationship was completely mediated by direct and indirect heterosexism. The study indicated that there were no differences between gay men and lesbians, providing evidence in support for the assumptions of minority stress theory specifically in relation to direct/indirect heterosexism. Implications of the study are that GLBT Australian employees have significant poor well-being due to the presence of discrimination in the workplace in the form of indirect heterosexism...|$|E
