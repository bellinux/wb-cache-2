How do you draw a diagram {{explaining}} entropy? <b>Images</b> and <b>Understanding</b> explores the human problem of moving facts and ideas from one mind to another - the problems of how we see and communicate using images expressed in pictures, diagrams, words, music and dance. For artists as well as scientists discussion of this topic is timely, electronic and computing technology is expanding the means of generating and communicating images, while physiology and psychology are revealing the neural mechanisms of coding, perceiving and understanding them. The book is divided into six sections, each with an explanatory introduction followed by comprehensively illustrated contributions from internationally distinguished figures from fields as diverse as art history, choreography, psychology, computer science, and philosophy. <b>Images</b> and <b>Understanding</b> is unique in viewing the problems of imagery through the eyes of both science and art, it gives new insight into images and new ideas about understanding.

40|$|Introduction Haptic {{feedback}} is a promising interaction modality {{for a variety}} of applications. Successful examples include robot teleoperation [57], virtual prototyping [63], painting [4], and medical training [30, 55]. Graphical applications are augmented with force or tactile feedback for two reasons: 1. to increase the realism of the simulation and 2. to improve operator performance, as typically indicated by increased precision, reduced fatigue, and shorter task completion times. Even though a great variety of graphical visualization techniques have been developed in the past, e#ective display of complex multi-dimensional and multi-field datasets remains a challenging task. While the human visual system is excellent at interpreting two-dimensional <b>images,</b> <b>understanding</b> volumetric features is di#cult due to occlusion, clutter, and lack of spatial cues.

Since edge singularities account for the most important information in <b>images,</b> <b>understanding</b> how edges lbehave in the wavelet domain is the key to modeling. In the past, wavelet-domain statistical models have codified the tendency for wavelet coefficients representing an edge to be large across scale.

In this paper, we describe some of the forms of structure that are contained in natural images, and we show how these {{are related to the}} response properties of neurons at early stages of the visual system. Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i. e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex...|$|R

On the basis of the effective feature subset selected, this paper presents a method to extract the objects which are higher than their surroundings, such as trees or forest, in the color aerial images. The experiments results show that the feature subset selected and the method of the object extraction presented in this paper are practical and effective. <br /...|$|R
