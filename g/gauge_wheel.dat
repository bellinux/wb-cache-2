They also had other features, like long, low boilers, Wagner-type smoke deflectors, low chimney, low steam collector in a common long housing with a sandbox, and miniature driver booth, not giving shelter.

40|$|The {{following}} planters {{equipped with}} different attachments were tested during field evaluations for continuous production of corn (Zea may L.) : Buffalo Till-planter, John Deere MaxEmerge planter, MaxEmerge Conservation planter, and rotary-tiller slot planter. The attachments tested on the MaxEmerge planter included: free-rolling coulter, powered coulter and trash-whipper. The functional {{performance of a}} planter (including population control, spacing control, depth control, and seedbed preparation) was evaluated;Buffalo Till-planter made a cleanly tilled seedbed with strips of residue windrowed between the rows. But the slippage of <b>gauge</b> <b>wheel</b> which powers the metering system may change with different soil and residue conditions. No trouble was encountered when operating the MaxEmerge planter in a no-till ridge field. A lower emergence rate, however, was found when compared with MaxEmerge planter with an attachment. The trash may affect the function of power coulter, when the field is under wet and heavy residue conditions. The rotary-tiller slot planter was a trouble-free planter under heavy trash conditions, but the planter needs to be redesigned for a better seed metering system;The effect of residue quantity on planter function, corn growth and yield was not significant in 1983 season. There are larger average corn grain yield differences between years than between planter treatments. This shows the overriding importance of temperature and rainfall on corn production...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringAjay ShardaIn recent years, the {{technology}} employed on precision row-crop planters has rapidly advanced. These new technologies include automatic downforce control systems and electronic drive singulation seed meters. These new technologies offer producers higher productivity through high speed planting and increased yield potentials through accurate seed spacing and placement. To {{begin to understand}} the benefits and performance of these new technologies, research must be conducted that specifically targets these new systems. With this research, producers would be able to better select equipment for their operation and have a deeper understanding of proper system operation and settings. A test stand, of a scissor-lift type design, was developed to evaluate row crop planter automatic downforce systems. Evaluation of a planter’s automatic downforce system is important for understanding the planter’s capability of maintaining target seeding depth throughout varying field conditions. The test stand consists of a horizontal platform that can raise and lower to simulate terrain changes as well as a mechanism to load the planter row unit’s opening discs to simulate varying soil texture. The vertical height of the test stand and the disc load can be varied in real-time based on utilizing real-world scenarios under simulated conditions to evaluate downforce system response. The stand incorporated several sensors to obtain the overall applied downforce, applied disc load, applied <b>gauge</b> <b>wheel</b> load, and hydraulic pressure. The test stand’s capabilities were evaluated and found to be satisfactory for planter downforce system testing. The test stand was then used to evaluate a commercial automatic downforce system when operating under simulated field conditions. Field data was used to create simulations representing soil type changes, planter operating speed changes, and extreme conditions such as a hard, packed clay or rocky soil type. It was found that the evaluated downforce system was able to maintain target <b>gauge</b> <b>wheel</b> load to within ± 223 N for at least 94 % of the time during all simulations. This would suggest that the planter would be able to maintain target seeding depth for at least 94 % of field operations. Another key aspect for precision agricultural planters is to achieve accurate seed spacing at varying speeds. An electronic drive singulation seed metering system was evaluated to gather the meter’s effectiveness for high speed planting during straight and contour farming mode using simulated field conditions. The simulated conditions were used to gather the meter’s response when encountering high planting speeds, accelerations, decelerations, point-rows, and contours. These meters were found to be highly accurate, with less than 1. 5 % error in target seed meter speed during all simulated conditions. The meters were also found to have a response time that was always 0. 34 seconds or less for all simulated conditions...|$|E

The scale was popularised to some extent in the 1960s and 1970s by the writings of modellers such as Gordon North. An On30 layout, the Venago Valley (built by Bill Livingston) was featured in the June 1971 issue of Railroad Model Craftsman magazine. However, as there are very few prototype [...] gauge railways in the United States, it remained very much a minority modelling area, especially when compared with modelling in On2 and On3.|$|R

The conversion of many broad gauge lines to standard gauge meant that this was a period of consolidation but in 1876 the amalgamation of the Bristol and Exeter and South Devon Railway locomotives saw 180 locomotives added to the GWR's fleet.
