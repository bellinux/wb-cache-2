Methods: 81 patients with biopsy diagnosed pulmonary sarcoidosis and 81 patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) were included. All underwent HRCT scan. Findings were evaluated per lung lobe. The severity of disease was quantified per feature and overall with the Gay-Watters score. Results: Respectively, the two groups recorded: 52 (64. 20 %) vs 60 (74. 07 %) presented a reticular pattern, 62 (76. 54 %) vs 74 (91. 36 %) thickened septal lines, 24 (29. 63 %) vs 56 (69. 14 %) honeycomb pattern, 52 (64. 20 %) vs 43 (53. 09 %) ground glass attenuation, 7 (8. 64 %) vs 27 (33. 33 %) ground glass with traction bronchiectasis, 47 (59, 26 %) vs 25 (30. 86 %) <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern,</b> 48 (60, 49 %) vs 1 (1. 23 %) hilar / mediastinal lymph node enlargement.

We describe an unusual course of severe multisystem LCH with spontaneous remission. Case Presentation: We {{report on a}} 45 -year-old Caucasian woman with cervical cancer, FIGO stage IVB. Five months {{after the end of}} combined radiochemotherapy and brachytherapy, the patient was readmitted because of severe dysuria. Sterile leukocyturia was seen, and cystoscopy revealed only 3 unspecific small mucosal lesions compatible with postradiation cystitis. Incidentally, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the body showed <b>diffuse</b> <b>micronodular</b> and cystic lesions in lungs and hypodense lesions in the liver. Biopsies revealed infiltrations of CD 1 a and Langerin (CD 207) -positive histiocytes in the lung, liver, and bladder. Additionally, positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT) was compatible with bone involvement. Retrospective analysis revealed that the increase in alkaline phosphatase might have been a surrogate of bone marrow infiltration with osseous activity. Repeated pneumothoraces occurred, and only one course of vinblastine-prednisolone could be applied. Despite ongoing tobacco consumption and without further therapy, PET-CT showed considerable remission 2 months later. However, despite stable remission, documented by serial PET and conventional CT scans, persistent infiltration of the bladder by Langerhans histiocytes could still be demonstrated 17 months later. Unfortunately, cervical cancer recurred and progressed. Conclusion: Multisystem LCH may rapidly occur, may be oligosymptomatic and, even in high-risk cases, remission without specific therapy might occur. Whether alkaline phosphatase might be a surrogate to monitor osseous disease activity has to be further explored...|$|R

In patients who have undergone lobectomy, the necessity of performing a completion thyroidectomy (CT) is still discussed.

We studied 182 patients treated with CT after lobectomy and/or isthmectomy for PTC diagnosed from 1969 - 1998. Mean age at diagnosis was 40 +/- 14. 5 years and mean interval between partial thyroidectomy and CT was 19. 8 +/- 56. 8 months. At CT, 80 of 182 patients (44 %) had one or more foci of tumor in the remaining thyroid lobe, always of the same papillary histotype, associated with ipsilateral lymph node metastases in 22 cases. In addition, 10 patients with no tumoral foci in the thyroid specimen had evidence of lymph node metastases. The rate of bilateral tumor was not different when patients were analyzed according to the classification of " low-" or "highrisk. " Among several clinical features, the presence of lymph node metastases at the first surgical treatment and time interval between first treatment and CT were correlated with higher frequency of bilaterality (p = 0. 033 and p = 0. 044, respectively).

Study Design: Prospective study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pneumonology, First Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Cardiology, Department of Radiology Medicine, between June 2009 and May 2011. Methodology: Ten patients who met criteria for APS (5 primary and 5 secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus) were prospectively identified. All patients underwent chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and functional assessment including spirometry and 6 -minute walking distance. Patients were free of respiratory symptoms. HRCT scans were evaluated for presence of air-trapping, subpleural reticular pattern, centrilobular nodules of ground-glass opacity, cysts, emphysema, atelectasis, consolidation and pleural effusion. Extent of air-trapping was estimated based on a HRCT scoring system. Results: All patients exhibited radiological and functional pattern compatible with smallairway disease, irrespective of smoking status. HRCT findings were negatively correlated with reduced levels of maximum midexepiratory flow (MMEF) 25 / 75 %pred (r=- 0. 936, p< 0. 0001). Subpleural basal reticular pattern consistent with fibrosis was seen in 3 patients. Thin-walled cysts and upper-lobe hazy <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern</b> were detected in 4 patients.

30|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} classification system available for hepatic tuberculosis, Levine [10] classified hepatic involvement in tuberculosis into five patterns: miliary tuberculosis, concomitant hepatic and pulmonary disease, primary (isolated) hepatic tuberculosis, tubercular hepatic abscess, and tubercular cholangitis. Also, there is a pathological classification with radiological correlation wherein Yu et al. [9] classified the disease into three forms: parenchymal type (which is further subclassified into <b>micronodular</b> and macronodular <b>patterns),</b> serohepatic disease and tubercular cholangitis.|$|R
40|$|The enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, {{the most}} {{frequent}} endocrine cells of the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach, are under the trophic stimulus of gastrin. These cells undergo a hyperplastic increase in variety of hypergastrinemic diseases. The most widely accepted nomenclature for the description of hyperplastic proliferation has been retrospectively arranged in a sequence presumed to reflect a temporal evolution of the proliferative process. A comparative, prospective study aimed to verify, in human hypergastrinemic diseases such as atrophic body gastritis (ABG), Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and antral gastrin cell hyperfunction (AGCH), the effect of exposure of ECL cells to different pattern of gastrin hypersecretion, is lacking. To this purpose, we studied a series of consecutive patients with ABG, ZES and AGCH {{at the time of}} first diagnosis. Material and Methods: The patients included in this study (124 ABG, 18 ZES and 10 AGCH) were {{selected on the basis of}} two previously performed screening studies aimed to diagnose these diseases. All patients at the time of diagnosis underwent gastroscopy, with multiple biopsies of the gastric body mucosa for the evaluation of qualitative pattern of ECL cells hyperplasia, and basal fasting gastrin determination. A sample of hypergastrinemic patients from each group was further investigated by meal-stimulation of gastrin secretion and quantitative morphometry for CgA positive gastric body endocrine cells. Results: AGCH patients showed only the normal or simple hyperplasia pattern. In the ZES group, simple and linear grades accounted for 38. 4 percent and 46. 1 percent, respectively. MEN-I patients showed only these two patterns. The majority of ABG patients showed the presence of <b>micronodular</b> <b>pattern</b> (59. 7 percent). A correlation analysis between fasting gastrin levels and grade of hyperplasia (r = 0. 5580, p < 0. 0001), indicates that the greater the gastrin levels, the higher is the degree of severity of ECL hyperplasia pattern. In conclusion, our data support the role of gastrin as the selective contributor to the progression of ECL cell hyperplasia in humans...|$|R
