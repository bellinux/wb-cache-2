2500|$|The sixth {{rule of the}} {{avoidance}} doctrine provides that a court will not rule upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has benefitted from the statute. In support of this rule, Brandeis cited cases in which a party waived its ability to object to a statute because the party had pursued benefits afforded under the statute in one proceeding prior to challenging the statute's constitutionality in a separate judicial proceeding. The Supreme Court later distinguished cases relying on the [...] "estoppel to sue" [...] doctrine as being cases in which [...] "litigants had received or sought advantages from the statute that they wished to attack, advantages other than the mere right to sue." [...] The sixth rule may be of relatively little importance today. To the extent the estoppel principle {{was based on a}} doctrine forbidding parties from asserting inconsistent positions in judicial proceedings, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) now expressly allows alternative or <b>inconsistent</b> <b>allegations.</b> Moreover, broad modern principles of claim preclusion appear to address adequately the concern reflected in the cases cited for the estoppel principle.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{analyses}} of Canada’s behaviour on {{international human rights}} tend to view it {{through the prism of}} the state’s global identity as a good international citizen. Such explanations are limited in helping us understand Canada’s <b>inconsistent</b> responses to <b>allegations</b> that two citizens were tortured in the war on terror—Maher Arar and Omar Khadr. This article uses Jutta Brunnée and Stephen Toope’s interactional account, which emphasizes the need for continuous shared practices of legality in order for international human rights norms to exert influence, to analyze Canada’s responses to the torture of citizens. It argues that to make sense of Canada’s behaviour, we need to examine the role of different state and non-state actors in terms of whether they were agitating for Canada’s compliance with the international prohibition against torture. Civil society was critical in shaping the responses of the Canadian state to the torture of citizens...|$|R
5000|$|Plaintiff {{alleged that}} Google's Keyword Tool {{is not a}} [...] "neutral tool" [...] because when a {{potential}} advertiser enters the word [...] "ringtone" [...] into Google's Keyword Tool, the tool suggests the word [...] "free." [...] According to Plaintiff, this suggestion is [...] "neither innocuous nor neutral" [...] because Google {{is aware of the}} “mobile content industry's unauthorized charge problems."The court rejected Plaintiff's argument that the Keyword Tool materially contributes to the alleged illegality and thereby establishes developer liability. The court cited Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, where it ruled that [...] "if a particular tool 'facilitates the expression of information,' it generally will be considered 'neutral' so long as users ultimately determine what content to post, such that the tool merely provides 'a framework that could be utilized for proper or improper purposes.'" [...] Thus, like the menus in Carafano, Google's Keyword Tool is a neutral tool that merely provides options to advertisers.Plaintiff further alleged that Google effectively requires advertisers to engage in illegal conduct. The court held that Plaintiff's use of the word [...] "requires" [...] is <b>inconsistent</b> with the <b>allegation</b> that Google [...] "suggests" [...] words to the advertisers. [...] The court referred to the Ninth Circuit ruling in Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC where CDA immunity was denied because the website forced subscribers to disclose protected characteristics and discriminatory preferences as [...] "a condition of using its services." [...] The court thereby concluded that Plaintiff’s reasoning failed to disclose a [...] "requirement" [...] of any kind or suggest the type of [...] "direct and palpable" [...] involvement that otherwise is required to obviate CDA immunity.|$|R
