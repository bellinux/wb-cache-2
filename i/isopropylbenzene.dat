Linear plasmid-deficient strains had lost both the <b>isopropylbenzene</b> degradation and trichloroethene degradation characteristics, {{as well as the}} arsenite resistance and mercury resistance phenotypes. Reintroduction of pBD 2 restored all four characteristics. Conjugational transfer of pBD 2 to a plasmidless mutant of strain BD 2 and other R. erythropolis strains occurred at frequencies between 3. 5 x 10 (- 5) and 2. 6 x 10 (- 3) transconjugants per recipient.

Southern hybridizations with DNA encoding the toluene dioxygenase structural genes (todC 1 C 2 BA) from Pseudomonas putida F 1 revealed homology to linear plasmid DNA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two-phase {{partitioning}} bioreactors (TPPBs) {{are considered}} as a new technology for xenobiotic degradation in gaseous effluents. However, {{there is still a}} need for more knowledge on how to design and scale-up TPPBs. The partitioning of the two phases remains a misunderstood way of research. In particular, the impact of pollutant (<b>isopropylbenzene),</b> biomass and surfactant extract needs to be better evaluated. RESULTS:. An adaptated scale-down apparatus has been developed in order to quantify the speed of phase partitioning (SPP) into a plug flow section. Firstly, it was shown that <b>isopropylbenzene</b> (IPB) doesn’t destabilize more significantly the system. Secondly, respectively 0. 5 g. L- 1 and 0. 05 g. L- 1 of biomass and surfactant extract, separately or in mixture, were sufficient to ensure the stability of the two-phase system. Finally, a 100 m 3 limit of scaling-up was suggested {{on the basis of the}} circulation time comparison. CONCLUSION: The scaling-up of an aqueous/silicone-oil TPPB was found to be definitely conceivable when the presence of biotic compounds were considered. However, further considerations are needed to verify our assumptions, in particular by taking into account the velocity field pattern in full-scale bioreactors and reproduce it in lab-scale apparatus.

Collectively, the strains tested were able to transform all of the 14 aromatic hydrocarbons included in the mixtures, with most strains degrading five or more. Few strains degraded trichloroethylene well under these conditions, only one degraded methylene chloride, and none were able to transform chloroform. G 4, PKO 1, KR 1, F 1, and JS 150 exhibited generally broad but oxygenase-specific degradation profiles, with the three monooxygenase strains degrading significantly more o-xylene and trichloroethylene, and F 1 and JS 150 degrading greater quantities of <b>isopropylbenzene</b> and 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene. PaW 1 degraded only the methylaromatic hydrocarbons and styrene.

The deduced amino acid sequences of ipbA 1 A 2 A 3 A 4 BC exhibited the highest homologies with the corresponding proteins of biphenyl-degradative pathways in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

40|$|Rhodococcus sp. strain DK 17 was {{isolated}} from soil and analyzed for {{the ability to}} grow on o-xylene as the sole carbon and energy source. Although DK 17 cannot grow on m- and p-xylene, {{it is capable of}} growth on benzene, phenol, toluene, ethylbenzene, <b>isopropylbenzene,</b> and other alkylbenzene isomers. One UV-generated mutant strain, DK 176, simultaneously lost the ability to grow on o-xylene, ethylbenzene, <b>isopropylbenzene,</b> toluene, and benzene, although it could still grow on phenol. The mutant strain was also unable to oxidize indole to indigo following growth in the presence of o-xylene. This observation suggests the loss of an oxygenase that is involved in the initial oxidation of the (alkyl) benzenes tested. Another mutant strain, DK 180, isolated for the inability to grow on o-xylene, retained the ability to grow on benzene but was unable to grow on alkylbenzenes due to loss of a meta-cleavage dioxygenase needed for metabolism of methyl-substituted catechols. Further experiments showed that DK 180 as well as the wild-type strain DK 17 have an ortho-cleavage pathway which is specifically induced by benzene but not by o-xylene. These results indicate that DK 17 possesses two different ring-cleavage pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds, although the initial oxidation reactions may be catalyzed by a common oxygenase. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 300 -MHz proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry clearly show that DK 180 accumulates 3, 4 -dimethylcatechol from o-xylene and both 3 - and 4 -methylcatechol from toluene. This means that there are two initial routes of oxidation of toluene by the strain. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis demonstrated the presence of two large megaplasmids in the wild-type strain DK 17, one of which (pDK 2) was lost in the mutant strain DK 176.

Graphite has a lamellar structure, with an interlayer distance of 0. 335 nm. Besides the large number of reagents that can be intercalated, a number of different types of graphites are used. The most commonly used potassium–graphite intercalation compound, C 8 K, shows an interlayer distance of 5. 34 A, and all carbon layers are separated by a layer of K. Differences among the alkali metals in behavior toward graphite have been explained in terms of electron transfer.

C 8 K in toluene, benzene, or <b>isopropylbenzene</b> can act as an alkylation catalyst in the presence of ethylene to yield the corresponding nuclear and side chain-alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons. Graphite intercalation compounds can act as mild anionic polymerization initiators offering some benefits in comparison to analogous reactions in homogeneous medium or to metal dispersions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ionic {{exchange}} degree of aluminated mesoporous materials H(X) -AlMCM- 41 materials, {{the method of}} its exchange mode and its grains form were investigated for the mesoporous catalytic activity in the cumene (i. e. <b>isopropylbenzene)</b> cracking reaction. Benzene, propylene and xylene derivatives are the main products of this reaction. Olefins like butene and pentene appeared as the products of secondary reactions. No saturated hydrocarbons, except traces of butane, nor ethylbenzene and toluene were formed {{and seemed to be}} typical products of secondary reactions obtained with HNaY zeolites. Generally the exchanged H(X) -AlMCM- 41 materials by the substitution of Na + by NH 4 + are more active than those exchanged directly with acid solution (substitution of Na + by H +) even if both the two methods used exhibit a comparable content of acid sites within catalysts at a low exchange degrees. However, the first method of exchange has exhibited an important acidity for mesoporous materials when the ionic exchange degree was increased up to 90 %; it was probably due not only to the percentage of exchanged degree but also to the distribution of acid sites within the materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-phase}} partitioning bioreactor (TPPB) {{to treat}} gas effluents polluted by {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) has been developed. In this work, both the mass transfer of <b>isopropylbenzene</b> (IPB) and oxygen have been considered {{in relation to their}} influence on the hydrodynamics of the reactor and the type of silicone oils used as a second phase. The synergistic effect of silicone oil and stirrer speed on the global oxygen mass transfer coefficient (KLa) and gas-hold-up (up to 12 %) have been investigated. The addition of 10 % of low viscosity silicone oil (10 centistokes) in the reactor does not significantly affect the oxygen transfer rate. The very high solubility of IPB in the silicone oil leads to an enhancement of driving force term, especially for high fraction of silicone oil. However, it does not seem useful to exceed a volume fraction of 10 % since KLaIPB decreases sharply at higher proportions of silicone oil. KLaIPB and KLa O 2 evolve in the same way with the proportion of silicone oil. These results confirm the potentialities of our bioreactor to improve both the oxygen and pollutant gas transfer in the field of the treatment of gaseous pollutants, even for highly concentrated effluents.
