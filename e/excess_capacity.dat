5|$|From 1969 until 1987, {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Route 25 {{was at a}} junction with Maple Springs Road, US 6 and Route 28 in Wareham near the modern location of Exit 2. The MassDPW and the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) had plans to extend the freeway eastward to Cape Cod as early as 1953, when the route {{was included in the}} proposed Cape Cod Expressway that would connect New York City with Cape Cod. Route 25 was originally planned to connect to the Sagamore Bridge, which carried US 6 over the Cape Cod Canal and was used to access the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown. In 1962, however, the MassDPW conducted traffic studies on the two bridges crossing the canal and found that the Sagamore Bridge was above vehicular capacity, whereas the more southern Bourne Bridge had <b>excess</b> <b>capacity.</b> The Route 25 freeway was then redesigned to cross over the Bourne Bridge and connect with the Mid-Cape Highway (US 6) on the southern side of the canal via the proposed Southside Connector. The connector would have been constructed through the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Bourne, but was canceled by the MassDPW and MassHighway in 1977 when environmental tests indicated the freeway would disturb underground aquifers serving as water sources for the region. MassDPW instead changed the proposed eastern terminus of the Route 25 expressway to the approach ramps of the Bourne Bridge.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC market structure. First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds marginal costs, The MC firm maximizes profits where marginal revenue = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's demand curve is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds marginal costs. The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with <b>excess</b> <b>capacity.</b> That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this equilibrium condition occurs where the perfectly elastic demand curve equals minimum average cost. A MC firm’s demand curve is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the demand curve will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is <b>excess</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E

The methane <b>excess</b> adsorption <b>capacity</b> increased with the increase in the pore size in micropores and decreased with the increase in the pore size in mesopores. The methane <b>excess</b> adsorption <b>capacity</b> in chlorite pores increased with an increase in pressure or decrease in pore size.
