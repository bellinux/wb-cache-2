5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 <b>independent</b> <b>variables.</b> This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Hence these equations, {{which might}} be called {{functions}} elsewhere are in analytic geometry characterized as parametric equations and the <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> are considered as parameters.|$|E
50|$|Regress the {{mediator}} on the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> {{to confirm that}} the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> is a significant predictor of {{the mediator}}. If the mediator is not associated with the <b>independent</b> <b>variable,</b> then it couldn’t possibly mediate anything.|$|R

40|$|Discriminant Analysis is {{statistical}} technique {{which is}} used on the dependence relationship. Discriminat analysis uses dependent variable with form category data and <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> with form kuantitatif data. Discriminant analysis is aimed to classify particular person or observation in group with independent each other and thorough based {{on a number of}} <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b> Asumtions used in the discriminant analysis: 1.

25|$|Computations where {{a number}} of similar, and often nested, models are {{considered}} for the same data set. That is, where models with the same dependent variable but different sets of <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> are to be considered, for essentially {{the same set of}} data points.|$|E
25|$|Dynamical {{systems are}} defined over a single {{independent}} variable, usually {{thought of as}} time. A more general class of systems are defined over multiple <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> and are therefore called multidimensional systems. Such systems are useful for modeling, for example, image processing.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} is {{by using the}} Lagrangian frame of reference, following the fluid parcels. The Lagrangian formulations show enhanced convergence, {{as compared to the}} formulations in both the Eulerian frame, and in the frame with the potential and streamfunction as <b>independent</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the test}} {{result is the}} {{dependent}} variable, the measured response based on the particular conditions of the test or {{the level of the}} <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b> Some tests, however, may involve changing the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> to determine the level at which a certain response occurs: in this case, the test result is the <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|R
30|$|By adding control {{variable}} in step 1 and relevant <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> in step 2 step-wise linear regression was executed. In {{order to assess}} the change in <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> the value of R square was used. To identify that which variable {{is used as a}} {{control variable}} between dependent and <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> one way ANOVA was conducted.|$|R
5000|$|Irreversibility: In some {{withdrawal}} designs, once {{a change}} in the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> occurs, the dependent variable is affected. This cannot be undone by simply removing the <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|R
25|$|In general, {{the more}} a {{measurement}} {{is like the}} sum of <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> with equal influence on the result, the more normality it exhibits. This justifies the common use of this distribution to stand in {{for the effects of}} unobserved variables in models like the linear model.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and <b>independent</b> <b>variables,</b> by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the <b>independent</b> <b>variables,</b> and the coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E
25|$|A true {{experiment}} with random allocation of subjects to conditions allows researchers to make strong inferences about causal relationships. In an experiment, the researcher alters parameters of influence, called <b>independent</b> <b>variables,</b> and measures resulting changes of interest, called dependent variables. Prototypical experimental research is {{conducted in a}} laboratory with a carefully controlled environment.|$|E
50|$|Continuous signal {{may also}} be defined over an <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> other than time. Another very common <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> is space and is {{particularly}} useful in image processing, where two space dimensions are used.|$|R
5000|$|... (1) Temporal precedence. For example, if the <b>in{{dependent}}</b> <b>variable</b> {{precedes the}} dependent variable in time, this would provide evidence suggesting a directional, and potentially causal, link from the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> to {{the dependent variable}}.|$|R
40|$|Establishing a {{functional}} {{relationship between the}} independent and the dependent variable is {{the primary focus of}} applied behavior analysis. Accurate and reliable description and observation of both the <b>independent</b> and dependent <b>variables</b> are necessary to achieve this goal. Although considerable attention has been focused on ensuring the integrity of the dependent variable in the operant literature, similar effort has not been directed at ensuring the integrity of the <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b> Inaccurate descriptions of the application of the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> may threaten {{the reliability and validity of}} operant research data. A survey of articles in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis demonstrated that the majority of articles published do not use any assessment of the actual occurrence of the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> and a sizable minority do not provide operational definitions of the <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b> The feasibility and utility of ensuring the integrity of the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> is described...|$|R
25|$|In applied statistics, total {{least squares}} {{is a type}} of errors-in-variables regression, a least squares data {{modeling}} technique in which observational errors on both dependent and <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> are taken into account. It is a generalization of Deming regression and also of orthogonal regression, and can be applied to both linear and non-linear models.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the {{variance}} of the mean {{of a large number}} of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation. This makes clear that the sample mean of correlated variables does not generally converge to the population mean, even though the law of large numbers states that the sample mean will converge for <b>independent</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|E
25|$|If Y'r is {{a random}} {{variable}} following the {{negative binomial distribution}} with parameters r and p, and support {0,1,2,...}, then Y'r is a sum of r <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> following the geometric distribution (on {0,1,2,...}) with parameter 1-p. As {{a result of the}} central limit theorem, Y'r (properly scaled and shifted) is therefore approximately normal for sufficiently larger.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Sobel’s test {{is performed}} {{to determine if}} the relationship between the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> and dependent variable has been significantly reduced after inclusion of the mediator variable. In other words, this test assesses whether a mediation effect is significant. It examines the relationship between the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> and the dependent variable compared to the relationship between the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> and dependent variable including the mediation factor.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when time}} is the <b>independent</b> <b>{{variable}},</b> and values of some other variable are plotted {{as a function of}} time, normally the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> time is plotted horizontally, as in the line graph to the right.|$|R
30|$|The {{regression}} coefficient (“B”) of each <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> represents {{the change in}} the dependent variable SRR that is associated with a unit change in the <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b> The absolute change in SRR associated with a change of one standard deviation (SD) in the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> is calculated as B × SD. Repeating the calculation with the lower and upper 95  % confidence limits of B gives the confidence limits of the change in SRR.|$|R
25|$|Kopelman, Weber, & Messick (2002), in {{a review}} of the {{experimental}} research on cooperation in commons dilemmas, identify nine classes of <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas: social motives, gender, payoff structure, uncertainty, power and status, group size, communication, causes, and frames. They organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences (stable personality traits) and situational factors (the environment). Situational factors include both the task (social and decision structure) and the perception of the task.|$|E
25|$|The CMG {{control program}} was {{responsible}} for {{making sure that the}} gimbals never hit the stops, by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large gimbal angles closer to zero. Since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three degrees of freedom, while the control program could change six <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> (the three pairs of gimbal angles), the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments.|$|E
25|$|A {{common goal}} for a {{statistical}} research {{project is to}} investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion {{on the effect of}} changes in the values of predictors or <b>independent</b> <b>variables</b> on dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.|$|E
30|$|The first {{equation}} of Eq. (16) is a linear first order differential equation {{with the time}} as <b>independent</b> <b>variable,</b> while the second one is an ordinary second order differential equation with radial coordinate as <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> and it is called Bessel’s equation.|$|R
50|$|Mathematically {{it is not}} {{necessary}} to assign physical dimensions to the signal or to the <b>independent</b> <b>variable.</b> In the following discussion the meaning of x(t) will remain unspecified, but the <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> will be assumed to be that of time.|$|R
50|$|Regress the {{dependent}} variable on both the mediator and <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> {{to confirm that the}} mediator is a significant predictor of {{the dependent}} variable, and the previously significant <b>independent</b> <b>variable</b> in Step #1 is now greatly reduced, if not nonsignificant.|$|R
25|$|Regression {{analysis}} {{and in particular}} ordinary least squares specifies that a dependent variable depends according to some function upon one or more <b>independent</b> <b>variables,</b> with an additive error term. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption can be justified by assuming that the error term is actually the sum {{of a large number}} of independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be well approximated by a normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|Confidence limits can {{be found}} if the {{probability}} distribution of the parameters is known, or an asymptotic approximation is made, or assumed. Likewise statistical tests on the residuals can be made if the probability distribution of the residuals is known or assumed. The probability distribution of any linear combination of the dependent variables can be derived if the probability distribution of experimental errors is known or assumed. Inference is particularly straightforward if the errors are assumed to follow a normal distribution, which implies that the parameter estimates and residuals will also be normally distributed conditional on {{the values of the}} <b>independent</b> <b>variables.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{sampling}} theorem {{is usually}} formulated for functions {{of a single}} variable. Consequently, the theorem is directly applicable to time-dependent signals and is normally formulated in that context. However, the sampling theorem can be extended in a straightforward way to functions of arbitrarily many variables. Grayscale images, for example, are often represented as two-dimensional arrays (or matrices) of real numbers representing the relative intensities of pixels (picture elements) located at the intersections of row and column sample locations. As a result, images require two <b>independent</b> <b>variables,</b> or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, {{and one for the}} column.|$|E
