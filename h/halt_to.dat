5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. When {{they returned to}} their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
5|$|Even though Vrbanac {{ordered a}} <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the {{operation}} shortly after midnight on 18/19 September, the Bjelovar Corps failed to cancel new crossing attempts it had ordered for 6:00 the following morning. The attacks went ahead, albeit at 10:30, with the 52nd and the 125th Home Guard regiments' battlegroups {{trying to cross}} the Sava River at different locations. Despite strengthening river currents and continued VRS artillery fire, small reconnaissance elements managed to cross the river, only to be forced back an hour later.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 European Grand Prix on 24 August, mid-season testing {{took place}} at Italy's Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari {{concentrated}} on their aerodynamic set-up during tests on Monza's long straights. Massa set the quickest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren driver Heikki Kovalainen. BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld was quickest on the second day. Massa spun off into the gravel at the Ascari chicane, bringing a brief <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> testing. Hamilton was fastest on the third day.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of several Spec Ops games in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the series met with low sales and poor reviews, causing a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the {{production}} of successive games. In 2003, Take-Two mentioned in their financial results that Rockstar Games {{was working on the}} franchise, but in 2004 the project was cancelled. It was later revealed that Rockstar Vancouver would have developed the canned project, with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme working on the soundtrack for the game.|$|E
5|$|Kaiser and Deutschland {{were placed}} in reserve after the 1878 {{maneuvers}} were cancelled and remained there for a decade, {{with the exception of}} the 1883 maneuvers. During the maneuvers, both ships' steam engines proved troublesome, and indeed forced a temporary <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the training exercises when they simultaneously broke down. The two ships were reactivated in 1889 to participate in cruises following the coronation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. These included a state visit to Great Britain in August 1889 and a tour of the Mediterranean in the winter of 1889–1890.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1948, {{almost all}} {{railways}} in Britain—including the London Transport Passenger Board and the London and North Eastern Railway—were nationalised under the Transport Act 1947. The LPTB became the London Transport Executive (LT), and the LNER {{became a part}} of British Railways. In the Greater London Plan of 1944 Sir Patrick Abercrombie had strongly recommended a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> further modern development in Chesham and along the Chess Valley to preserve the sensitive local environment, and there was thus little prospect for growth in passenger numbers on the branch.|$|E

5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River {{began to}} {{overflow}} its banks in Nenana. Water flooded the rails of the Alaska Railroad in town, caused an evacuation of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, {{the entire town}} was at least partially flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|President Truman ordered {{military}} operations (including the B-29 bombings) to continue until official word of Japanese surrender was received. However, news correspondents incorrectly interpreted a comment by USAF commander Spaatz that the B-29s were not flying on August 11 (because of bad weather) as {{a statement that}} a ceasefire was in effect. To avoid giving the Japanese {{the impression that the}} Allies had abandoned peace efforts and resumed bombing, Truman then ordered a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> further bombings.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Platine War did {{not bring}} a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> {{conflict}} in the region. Peace remained out of reach in Uruguay, which remained unstable and {{in a state of}} constant crisis due to continuing internecine strife between the Blancos and Colorados. Border disputes, power struggles among diverse regional factions, and attempts to establish regional and internal influence would eventually spark the Uruguayan War as well as the later Paraguayan War.|$|E

5|$|These desertions alarmed Gaddafi, as the GUNT {{provided}} {{a cover of}} legitimacy to Libya's presence in Chad. To put a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> these and reunite the GUNT, a major offensive was launched on the Red Line {{with the goal of}} taking N'Djamena. The attack, started on 10 February 1986, involved 5,000 Libyan and 5,000 GUNT troops, and concentrated on the FANT outposts of Kouba Olanga, Kalait and Oum Chalouba. The campaign ended in disaster for Gaddafi, when a FANT counteroffensive on 13 February using the new equipment obtained from the French forced the attackers to withdraw and reorganize.|$|E
5|$|After a short <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> {{leave their}} baggage train behind {{and form a}} battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} {{assault on the}} northern wall, the defenders fled to the Temple Mount, pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Tancred then called a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection. When the defenders on the southern wall heard {{of the fall of}} the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Provençals to enter the city. Iftikhar al-Dawla, the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to Ascalon.|$|E

5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS in {{the massive}} Silurian underground civilisation, they are captured and taken to the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is not human, the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from the beach was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{creation}} of the newly established First Republic of Armenia in 1918, Bagramyan enlisted in the 3rd Armenian Regiment of that country's armed forces. From 1 April 1918, that is, after the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 3, 1918) with the Russian SFSR, he was in the 1st Armenian Cavalry Regiment, which put a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> the Ottoman 3rd Army, which was bent on conquering the remains of the republic, in Karaurgan, Sarikamish and Kars. He most notably took part in the May 1918 Battle of Sardarapat, where the Armenian military scored a crucial victory against Turkish forces. He remained in the regiment until May 1920.|$|E

5|$|In 1337 Phillip confiscated Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Edward alleging he was {{harbouring}} Phillip’s fugitive {{cousin and}} enemy, Robert of Artois. In response, Edward proclaimed himself king of France {{to encourage the}} Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French king. The conflict, later known as the Hundred Years' War, included a significant English naval victory at the Battle of Sluys, and a victory on land at Crécy, leaving Edward free to capture the important port of Calais. A subsequent victory against Scotland at the Battle of Neville's Cross resulted in the capture of David II and reduced the threat from Scotland. The Black Death brought a <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> Edward's campaigns by killing perhaps {{a third of his}} subjects. The only Plantagenet known to have died from the Black Death was Edward III's daughter Joan in Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|In early 1190 Geoffrey {{ordered a}} <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> {{religious}} ceremonies {{in the cathedral}} and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing {{to go on the}} Third Crusade, ordered Geoffrey to the king's presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was Justiciar, was hampering Geoffrey's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine, Richard insisted on immediate full payment. When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re-confiscated his lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey's election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey's estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of his fine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate <b>halt</b> <b>to</b> and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
