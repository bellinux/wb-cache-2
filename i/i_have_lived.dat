5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

500|$|On June 2, 2011, Romney {{formally}} {{announced the}} start of his campaign. Speaking on a farm in Stratham, New Hampshire, he focused on the economy and criticized President Obama's handling of it. He said, [...] "In the campaign to come, the American ideals of economic freedom and opportunity need a clear and unapologetic defense, and I intend to make it– because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted to do something different for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{never bought}} a slave and {{declined}} on principle to utilize slave labor, saying, [...] "I have, through my whole life, held {{the practice of}} slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> {{for many years in}} times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." [...] Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should [...] "sleep for a time." [...] He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution, due to opposition from southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.|$|E
500|$|Brodie {{suggested}} that Stevens's hatred of Johnson {{was the only}} thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the Ku Klux Klan. [...] Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time, and the murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, Alexander McClure, [...] "My life has been a failure. [...] With all this great struggle of years in Washington, and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic.", He took pride, he continued, in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania. When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, [...] "I have no history. My life-long regret is that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> so long and so uselessly." [...] Nevertheless, in his last formal speech to the House, Stevens stated that [...] "man still is vile. [...] But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction, that the patriot has a right to take courage." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "You are no {{stranger}} to the spirit of procrastination. The noblest mind that ever existed, the amiable man whom we lament was not free from it.

2500|$|She {{traveled}} across France {{to entertain}} the troops in 1918. Of her time at the Western Front, McMein said, [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> through air bombing I never will be frightened by anything on earth. The terror of air raids cannot be imagined. They are heralded by the blowing of sirens and the ringing of church bells, and amid this din the lights are extinguished and then suddenly come the bombs, falling no one knows where. The noise they made is worse {{than that of the}} battles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patrick O'Brian {{once wrote}} [...] "Obviously, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> very {{much out of}} the world: I know little of present-day Dublin or London or Paris, even less of post-modernity, post-structuralism, hard rock or rap, and I cannot write with much {{conviction}} about the contemporary scene." [...] This becomes obvious for readers of the Aubrey-Maturin Series, as he adopts a narrative voice contemporary with their setting. Richard Ollard, in examining the general reception to O'Brian's books, suggests that O'Brian's naval officers {{would be able to}} talk with and recognise Jane Austen's characters.|$|E
2500|$|For all its reservations, the Bill was for Redmond the {{fulfilment}} of {{a lifelong}} dream. [...] "If I may say so reverently", {{he told the}} House of Commons, [...] "I personally thank God that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> to see this day". But Asquith missed a magnificent opportunity, by failing to incorporate into the Bill any significant concessions to Ulster Unionists, who then campaigned relentlessly against it. Nonetheless by 1914 Redmond had become a nationalist hero of Parnellite stature and could have had every expectation of becoming head of a new Irish government in Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|Of his fictional project, Berry has written: [...] "I {{have made}} the {{imagined}} town of Port William, its neighborhood and membership, {{in an attempt to}} honor the actual place where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived.</b> By means of the imagined place, over the last fifty years, I have learned to see my native landscape and neighborhood as a place unique in the world, a work of God, possessed of an inherent sanctity that mocks any human valuation that can be put upon it." [...] Elsewhere, Berry has said, [...] "The only thing I try to accomplish in fiction is to show how people act when they love each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1921, Stieglitz's {{photographs}} of O'Keeffe {{were included in}} a retrospective exhibition at the Anderson Galleries. Stieglitz started photographing O'Keeffe when she visited him in New York City to see her 1917 exhibition, and continued taking photographs, {{many of which were}} in the nude. It created a public sensation. When he retired from photography in 1937, he had made more than 350 portraits of her. In 1978, she wrote about how distant from them she had become, [...] "When I look over the photographs Stieglitz took of me-some of them more than sixty years ago—I wonder who that person is. It is as if in my one life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> many lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the Dutch {{government}} changed {{it into a}} resocialisation institution and labour camp for beggars, prostitutes and alcoholics from Amsterdam and other western cities. They were supposed to learn farming and morals by experience so they could reintegrate into society. In reality the beggars were used for semi-forced and all-but-unpaid labour to reclaim the wetlands surrounding Ommerschans, eventually reclaiming an area of 4 by 2½ kilometres. Politician and novelist Jacob van Lennep visited Ommerschans during his walking tour with Dirk van Hogendorp across the newly independent United Kingdom of the Netherlands {{in the summer of}} 1823, and documented his shock at the conditions at the labour camp: [...] "These hours are certainly among the saddest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> through." ...|$|E
2500|$|William O. Douglas, who {{had been}} on the Toolson majority, had ruled in a 1971 {{emergency}} appeal from a suit brought by Spencer Haywood that basketball wasn't exempt, either, and suggested he was reconsidering his role in Toolson: [...] "the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed." [...] The following year he was the only justice from the Toolson court still sitting when Flood v. Kuhn was heard, and made his change of mind explicit in a footnote to his dissent: [...] "While I joined the Court's opinion in Toolson ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> to regret it; and I would now correct what I believe to be its fundamental error." ...|$|E
