25|$|In 2006 and 2007 it was {{reported}} that introducing a small number of specific transcription factor genes into normal skin cells of mice or humans can turn these cells into pluripotent stem cells, known as induced pluripotent stem cells. The technique uses modified retroviruses to transform the cells; this is a potential problem for <b>human</b> <b>therapy</b> since these viruses integrate their genes at a random location in the host's genome, which can interrupt other genes and potentially causes cancer.|$|E
25|$|These {{modifications}} {{have been}} used to create two types of insulin analogs: those that are more readily absorbed from the injection site and therefore act faster than natural insulin injected subcutaneously, intended to supply the bolus level of insulin needed at mealtime (prandial insulin); and those that are released slowly over a period of between 8 and 24 hours, intended to supply the basal level of insulin during the day and particularly at nighttime (basal insulin). The first insulin analog approved for <b>human</b> <b>therapy</b> (insulin Lispro rDNA) was manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{immunomodulatory}} and chemotactic properties, hMSC are being explored to treat immune-related diseases. For {{their use in}} <b>human</b> <b>therapies,</b> {{it is necessary to}} culture hMSC in xeno-free conditions. In this study, the impact that a xeno-free medium based on a human plasma derivate has on these properties was analysed. Bone marrow-derived hMSC preserved their immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory properties, as observed with in vitro assays with hMSC cocultured with mixed leukocyte reactions or with mitogen-stimulated leukocytes. Moreover, hMSC expanded in xeno-free medium were recruited by macrophages in both migration and invasion assays, which indicates that the cells maintained their chemotactic properties. These data suggest that xeno-free expanded hMSC preserved their immunomodulatory and chemotactic properties, indicating that the described xeno-free medium composition is a potential candidate to culture and expand hMSC for <b>human</b> cell <b>therapies...</b>|$|R

50|$|Toceranib is a {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} inhibitor and {{is used in the}} treatment of canine mast cell tumor also called mastocytoma. Together with masitinib (Kinavet (US)/Masivet (EU/ROW) by AB Science), toceranib is the only dog-specific anti-cancer drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is marketed as Palladia as its phosphate salt, toceranib phosphate (INN) by Pfizer. It was developed by SUGEN as SU11654, a sister compound to sunitinib, which was later approved for <b>human</b> <b>therapies.</b> Toceranib is likely to act mostly through inhibition of the kit tyrosine kinase, though it may also have an anti-angiogenic effect.|$|R

40|$|Among the {{earliest}} treatment paradigms envisioned for gene therapy was the ex vivo genetic modification of autologous stem cells, {{particularly in the}} context of bone-marrow transplantation. Many early applications of gammaretrovirus and lentivirus vectors have used this platform, with the primary focus being on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). In the April 2017 special issue of <b>Human</b> Gene <b>Therapy,</b> a number of crucial issues in the field of adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy were discussed. However, the issue of the utility of recombinant AAV (rAAV) gene therapy for stem-cell transduction was not directly addressed in that issue.

5000|$|The humanization {{processes}} {{takes advantage}} of the fact that production of monoclonal antibodies can be accomplished using recombinant DNA to create constructs capable of expression in mammalian cell culture. That is, gene segments capable of producing antibodies are isolated and cloned into cells that can be grown in a bioreactor such that antibody proteins produced from the DNA of the cloned genes can be harvested en masse. The step involving recombinant DNA provides an intervention point that can be readily exploited to alter the protein sequence of the expressed antibody. The alterations to antibody structure that are achieved in the humanization process are therefore all effectuated through techniques at the DNA level. Not all methods for deriving antibodies intended for <b>human</b> <b>therapy</b> require a humanization step (e.g. phage display) but essentially all are dependent on techniques that similarly allow the [...] "insertion" [...] or [...] "swapping-out" [...] of portions of the antibody molecule.|$|E
