5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired falconry bird, and {{has been used in}} falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be <b>flushed,</b> <b>and</b> then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving stoop to take the quarry. The speed and energy of the stoop allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E

50|$|Flushing citizens, {{feeling they}} had been tricked into {{building}} the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside in order to scare the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side into selling out to the LIRR, convinced wealthy residents of College Point and Whitestone, including Conrad Poppenhusen, to incorporate the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side Railroad in 1868. This company {{had the right to}} build a line from Long Island City to <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> beyond to Roslyn, with a branch from Flushing to Whitestone. The group gained control of the unfinished <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside Railroad, and opened its line to Flushing, paralleling the LIRR from Long Island City to Woodside, in 1868 and to College Point and Whitestone in 1869. This new line attracted most of the traffic from the older New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing,</b> <b>and</b> the LIRR {{wanted to get rid of}} its Flushing branch.

The New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> continued to own the line west of Winfield, and soon became the South Side Railroad's access to Long Island City. The segment between what was to become the former Laurel Hill Station and Winfield Station, was abandoned for passenger service in 1875, and completely abandoned in 1880. Part of the right-of-way ran through what is today the Mount Zion Jewish Cemetery in Maspeth. The <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside was merged into the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side in 1871, and its line was abandoned in favor of the ex-New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> line.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after it}} sold the New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> to the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side, the LIRR decided {{to enter the}} <b>Flushing</b> {{business}} again, <b>and</b> chartered the Newtown <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> Railroad ("White Line") on March 8, 1871. It opened on November 10, 1873, paralleling the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side {{to the south and}} beginning a rate war.|$|R

25|$|A new {{sewage system}} {{was built on}} Don's orders in 1815, but this was so poorly {{designed}} that it actually worsened Gibraltar's sanitary problems. It had no ability to be <b>flushed</b> <b>and</b> was insufficiently inclined to keep the sewage flowing out to the bay. As a result, the system merely brought sewage down from {{the upper part of}} the town to the lower part, where it piled up under the main streets. The sewage remained there until the winter rains dislodged it and flushed it into the bay. Because the outfalls were so short, however, the sewage simply washed back up onto the shoreline and resulted in the seafront being coated in a slick of effluent.|$|E
500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven"'s main {{theme is}} environmentalism. The song mainly deals with man's {{destruction}} {{of the ocean and}} [...] "confusion of man's place in the universe". [...] "On one hand, it's [...] this big organic toilet. Things get <b>flushed</b> <b>and</b> repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place", Black later said, [...] "It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids." [...] Francis came up with the song's hook, [...] "this monkey's gone to heaven", long before the song itself was written. The line itself forms a basis for the song, which revolves around man's relationship with the divine and environmentalism. After Francis set the developing lyrics to music, he rushed to lead guitarist Joey Santiago's apartment to play it to him. Santiago later commented on the nascent performance: [...] "It was early in the morning, I was still so tired. [...] 'Hey Joe, I need to come over. I need to show you something.' [...] It was awesome, really good. He had the 'If man is five' part there, and he was laughing. [...] It was hilarious".|$|E
2500|$|Public urinals {{usually have}} a plastic mesh guard, which may {{optionally}} contain a deodorizing urinal deodorizer block or [...] "urinal cake". The mesh is intended to prevent solid objects (such as cigarette butts, feces, chewing gum, or paper) from being <b>flushed</b> <b>and</b> possibly causing a plumbing stoppage. In some restaurants, bars, and clubs, ice may {{be put in the}} urinals, serving some of the same purposes as the deodorizing block without dispensing odorous chemicals.|$|E

25|$|A {{group of}} College Point and Whitestone citizens, feeling {{they had been}} tricked by the LIRR, {{convinced}} wealthy residents of College Point and Whitestone, including Conrad Poppenhusen, to buy out the stock of the old <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside Railroad {{and set out to}} complete the line. The construction of the line was done under the name of the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side Railroad, which was incorporated in 1868.

In 1869, the state legislature authorized the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side to buy the New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> east of the LIRR crossing at Winfield; connections were built by the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side at Woodside/Winfield <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> to connect its lines. The Haberman to Winfield portion of the New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> line was abandoned and a new right-of-way through Woodside was built.

The <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside was merged into the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side in 1871, and its line was abandoned in favor of the ex-New York <b>and</b> <b>Flushing</b> line.

5000|$|Dissatisfied with NY&F's service, Residents of <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Newtown {{convinced}} the LIRR {{to build the}} <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside Railroad, on February 24, 1864 as a competing branch to Flushing, which ran from Woodside Station toward Great Neck Junction. When the NY&F collapsed after construction of the Great Neck Extension, the LIRR acquired the railroad and left this branch unfinished. After Poppenhausen created the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side Railroad, he also acquired the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> Woodside, but was able to complete construction of the line, which became the Woodside Branch of the <b>Flushing</b> <b>and</b> North Side. The line only contained one other station at Junction Boulevard and 35th Avenue called Grinnell Station. East of Grinnell Station <b>and</b> the <b>Flushing</b> River, there was a junction leading either toward the main line of the F&NS railroad or the Whitestone Branch.|$|R

There is not a single agreed-upon upper limit for normal temperature with sources using values between [...] The increase in set-point triggers increased muscle contractions and causes a feeling of cold. This results in greater heat production and efforts to conserve heat. When the set-point temperature returns to normal, a person feels hot, becomes <b>flushed,</b> <b>and</b> may begin to sweat.

2500|$|Once a {{flushometer}} valve {{has been}} <b>flushed,</b> <b>and</b> after a preset interval, the flushometer mechanism closes the valve and stops the flow. The flushometer system requires no storage tank, but requires a high volume {{of water in}} a very short time. Thus a [...] inch (22 mm) pipe at minimum, or preferably a 1 inch (29 mm) pipe, must be used, but as the high volume is used only for a short duration, very little water is used for the amount of flushing efficacy delivered. Water main pressures must be above [...] While the higher water pressure employed by a flushometer valve does scour the bowl more efficiently than a gravity-driven system, and while fewer blockages typically occur {{as a result of this}} higher water pressure, flushometer systems still require approximately the same amount of water as a gravity system to operate (1.6 gpf).|$|E

Harlequin syndrome overlaps with several other syndromes. Parry-Romberg {{syndrome is}} a rare clinical entity of an unknown etiology. It is also described as progressive hemifacial atrophy.
