5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's ice cap. Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing novel, and <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> nearly as much attention as Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E

5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> {{the same}} negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, {{and men and}} animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy {{due to a lack of}} evidence, although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|Though {{this era}} in Galveston's history <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> {{a great deal}} of {{attention}} in popular culture (compared, for example, to Al Capone's Chicago), there has been some popular fiction and true crime story-telling centered on the era. Some notable examples include the novels Under the Skin by James Carlos Blake, No Greater Deception: A True Texas Story by Sydney Dotson, Galveston by Suzanne Morris, and Overlords by Matt Braun, as well as the anthology Lone Star Sleuths: An Anthology of Texas Crime Fiction by Bill Davis, et al. Galveston's Balinese Room was also the subject of a 1975 song by rock band ZZ Top.|$|E

5|$|Prediction of the {{probable}} chemical properties of meitnerium <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> much attention recently. Meitnerium {{is expected to}} be a noble metal. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements, the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the +6, +3, and +1 states, with the +3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions. In comparison, rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +3 for iridium and +3 for rhodium. The oxidation state +9, represented only by iridium in +, might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the nonafluoride (MtF9) and the + cation, although + {{is expected to be}} more stable than these meitnerium compounds. The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium, thus also allowing a stable +4 state. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The album Hit and Run was {{released}} in April 1981, soon followed by the eponymous single. Both releases were very successful in the UK, with the album reaching position No.5 and the single position No.33 in the respective charts. The album charted also in New Zealand and in Canada, where it went gold. Hit and Run was not released in the USA until 1982, with a different track listing including songs from Demolition. The success of their second album made Girlschool a rising attraction in the boiling British hard rock and heavy metal scene, ensuring headliner slots in medium-sized arenas in their sold-out UK tour or guest slots in stadium size concerts of major attractions like Black Sabbath and Rush. No dates in the USA were arranged, but Girlschool visited Canada in July. Their 1981 tour culminated on 28 August, headlining the Friday night of the three-day Reading Festival. The Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1 would later broadcast the Reading set, but the recording <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> an official release.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes. For chemical studies {{to be carried out}} on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 281Rg, the most stable known roentgenium isotope, is 26seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>received</b> as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium, despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the ns subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium.|$|E
