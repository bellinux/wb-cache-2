50|$|Epicoccum nigrum has a {{wide array}} of medical, industrial, and {{agricultural}} applications. It produces a variety of pigmented and non-pigmented antifungal and antibacterial compounds. These antimicrobial compounds are effective against other fungi and bacteria present in soil. Flavipin, and epirodins A and B are pigmented antifungal agents; non-pigmented compounds include epicorazines A and B. Endophytic fungi such as E. nigrum are being explored as alternative sources of antibiotics to treat important resistant infections. Polysaccharide antioxidants are also produced by E. nigrum. Epicocconone is a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> unique to E. nigrum. Epicocconone is valuable in terms of its ability to pigment cells orange, which then fluoresce red without impacting cell structure or function.|$|E
50|$|Ralstonia solanacearum is an aerobic nonspore-forming, Gram-negative, plant {{pathogenic}} bacterium. R. solanacearum is soil-borne and motile with a polar flagellar tuft. It colonises the xylem, causing {{bacterial wilt}} {{in a very}} wide range of potential host plants. It is known as Granville wilt when it occurs in tobacco. Bacterial wilts of tomato, pepper, eggplant, and Irish potato caused by R. solanacearum {{were among the first}} diseases that Erwin Frink Smith proved to be caused by a bacterial pathogen. Because of its devastating lethality, R. solanacearum is now of the more intensively studied phytopathogenic bacteria and bacterial wilt of tomato is a model system for investigating mechanisms of pathogenesis.Ralstonia was recently classified as Pseudomonas with similarity in most aspects, except that it does not produce <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> like Pseudomonas. The genomes from different strains varies from 5.5 Mb up to 6 Mb, roughly being 3.5 Mb of a chromosome and 2 Mb of a megaplasmid. While the strain GMI1000 {{was one of the first}} phytopathogenic bacterias to have its genome completed, the strain UY031 was the first R. solanacearum to have its methylome reported. Within the R. solanacearum species complex, the four major monophyletic clusters of strains are termed phylotypes, that are geographically distinct: phylotypes I-IV are found in Asia, America, Africa, and Oceania, respectively.|$|E

40|$|The phytopathogenic {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas syringae {{produces a}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> {{when it is}} grown in iron-deficient media. This pigment forms a very stable Fe(III) complex that was purified in this form by using a novel procedure based on ultrafiltration and column chromatography. The Fe(III) complex has a molecular weight of 1, 100 and contains 1 mol of Fe(III). The pigment is composed of an amino acid moiety with three threonines, three serines, one lysine, δ-N-hydroxyornithine, and a quinoline-type fluorescent chromophore. These features and its stability constant (in the range of 1032) suggest that the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> of P. syringae {{is related to the}} siderophores produced by another Pseudomonas species...|$|E
40|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is extensively farmed for their skin and meat. In order to optimise growth rates and production crocodiles {{need to be}} fed an optimal diet, based on their nutritional physiology. In this study two experiments were conducted to determine the passage rate of food in juvenile and sub-adult crocodiles. Plastic beads, pieces of flagging tape and a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> were used as digestive markers, to evaluate whether these markers are suitable as digestive markers in C. porosus. Results showed differences in excretion patterns between the type of markers. Large percentages of beads and pieces of flagging were retained in the stomach, not passing the digestive system. The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> was excreted by juvenile crocodiles almost continuously during the experiment. Despite {{the fact that the}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> did pass the digestive tract, the obtained data is inaccurate. It can be concluded that the used markers are not useable as digestive markers in crocodiles, since they were not successful in determining the passage rate in juvenile and sub-adult C. porosus. More precise markers need to be used as digestive markers in crocodilians to achieve more accurate knowledge about the crocodile digestive system to eventually improve crocodile nutrition...|$|E
40|$|Media and an {{analytical}} scheme {{have been developed}} which allow both a qualitative and quantitative estimation {{of the formation of}} pyocyanine, related phenazines, pyorubrin, and a blue and a yellow-green <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Use of the defined pyocyanine medium of Frank and DeMoss with sulfate or various organic sulfur sources allowed formation of pyocyanine, related phenazines, and pyorubrin. When sulfite was the sulfur source with or without iron, P. aeruginosa formed either a yellow-green or a blue <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment.</b> Formation of fluorescent pigments of P. aeruginosa is related to the ability of sulfite to act as a specific sulfur source. In an investigation of the role of both added iron and sulfur sources, complex patterns of pigment formation were observed. In addition to the fluorescent pigments, sulfite also supported the formation of slime by P. aeruginosa...|$|E

30|$|To {{choose a}} {{suitable}} strategy for temperature-shifting fermentation, {{we changed the}} culture temperature from 30 to 35  °C or from 35 to 30  °C at different fermentation times. Consequently the yields of Y 3 and Y 4 were {{higher than that of}} the constant temperature culture (at 30 and 35  °C) during the temperature shift from 30 to 35  °C. However, the shift from 35 to 30  °C did not increase and even decreased in some degree (Fig.  4 b). The two-stage temperature control strategy evidently caused the yield of yellow <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> (Y 3 and Y 4). Moreover, the temperature shift from 30 to 35  °C was better for the accumulation of yellow <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> (Y 3 and Y 4) compared with a constant temperature culture. The shift on the 4 th day was the best for the production of Y 3 and Y 4, wherein the yield of Y 3 and Y 4 improved by 98.21 and 79.31 % compared with constant temperature (at 30  °C) fermentation (Fig.  4 b).|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} of fluorescent bacteria as biological control agents for white root disease caused by Rigidoporus lignosus has been investigated. Isolation of bacteria {{from the soil}} using S 1 media produced two fluorescent bacteria isolates. Using the Microbact 12 A+ 12 B method, both bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. aeruginosa. These two species of bacteria were then used as antibiosis activity test against R. lignosus. Four series antibiosis activity tests were done, that were antibiosis test of media culture bacteria growth to R. lignosus colony, antibiosis test of dry <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> extract to R. lignosus, influence of Fe 3 + to antibiosis activity of bacteria test, and affinity of media supernatant to Fe 3 +. The results were: antibiosis activity of King 2 ̆ 7 s B (KB) media was more effective than media 523 in the inhibition of R. lignosus colony growth. There was no significant different antibiosis activity of dry <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> extract from media KB and media 523 in the inhibition of R. lignosus colony growth. The level of Fe 3 + in the media might influence antibiosis activity of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment.</b> Affinity test of KB supernatant from fluorescent bacteria culture with Fe 3 + showed an absorption peak of 410 nm on spectrophotometer, and none for the fungi. These results indicate that P. fluorescens and P. aeruginosa produce cathecol-type siderophore with high affinity against Fe 3 + compared with hydroxamate-type siderophore which is generally produced by fungus...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of coral fluorescence in mesophotic reefs, although well described for shallow waters, remains largely unstudied. We found that representatives of many scleracti-nian species are brightly fluorescent at depths of 50 – 60 m at the Interuniversity Institute for Marine Sciences (IUI) reef in Eilat, Israel. Some of these fluorescent species have distribu-tion maxima at mesophotic depths (40 – 100 m). Several individuals from these depths dis-played yellow or orange-red fluorescence, {{the latter being}} essentially absent in corals from the shallowest parts of this reef. We demonstrate experimentally {{that in some cases}} the pro-duction of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> is independent of the exposure to light; while in others, the fluorescence signature is altered or lost when the animals are kept in darkness. Further-more, we show that green-to-red photoconversion of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> mediated by short-wavelength light can occur also at depths where ultraviolet wavelengths are absent from the underwater light field. Intraspecific colour polymorphisms regarding the colour of the tissue fluorescence, common among shallow water corals, were also observed fo...|$|R
