40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the impact of smart {{specialization}} policies in an economically already well-developed and politically experienced environment. Arguably, German regions were quite experienced with strategic innovation policy long before the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> was imposed and their first reaction to it was accordingly reserved. Nonetheless, our case studies illustrate that the process related to the development of regional innovation strategies has in many German regions led to advances in methodology as well as improved communication and coordination in polities where information failures constitute a relevant challenge. Accordingly, a number of key challenges remain, in part related to many German regionsâ understanding of their own mandate within the country's multi-level governance system...|$|R

With regions and nations having completed the technical fulfillment of the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> and the related action plans, the first evaluation studies have been launched with the aim to assess {{the consistency of the}} concept, once moving from the design (theory) to the implementation phase (practice). From these first evaluation exercises, strengths and weaknesses emerge in the way the smart specialization strategy has been conceived that lead to reflections on its possible future adjustment trends. The paper highlights emerging bottlenecks (e. g. the lack of local pre-conditions in the local economy and limits of governance) as well as possible future trajectories to overcome such bottlenecks, like the shift from a compulsory to a voluntary RIS, and from an industry-focused to a territorial development strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{insight that}} this booklet {{provides}} - {{thanks to the}} precious contribution of national and regional authorities - shows that smart specialisation has gone far beyond the mere fulfilment of the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> criteria linked to Cohesion policy allocations. It has triggered {{a change in the}} way innovation-driven regional development policies are dealt with across Europe, confirming the outcome of a number of surveys recently run on this topic. These 'Smart Stories' will drive the reader through the features of smart specialisation as it has been applied in a number of EU countries and regions, with a view to stimulating to further explore the concept and its policy implications, to identify complementarities and potential for mutual learning and collaboration. The period of strategy development has in one sense finished; however, the process of implementing and monitoring S 3 will hopefully lead to many more 'Smart Stories' to be shared across all territories of the European Union.

40|$|To {{utilize the}} Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) for crisis management, {{macroeconomic}} surveillance {{of the member}} economies should be <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Hence, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Three Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to detect possibilities of economic crises and to prompt the restructuring or reforming of a rigid structure or system. Although monitoring the exchange rates of the currencies of these countries vis-à-vis the U. S. dollar is essential for surveillance, the AMRO should have an original tool to consider region-specific factors and more efficient tools than the International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes utilizing a regional monetary unit (RMU) in monitoring exchange rates.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a principal-agent model of IMF conditional lending, {{in the aftermath}} of a "capital-account" liquidity crisis. We show that traditional ex-post conditonality can be effective in safeguarding the Fund's resources, allowing for the provision of efficient emergency lending and reducing inefficient ex-ante credit rationing if the capital outflow which triggers the crisis is not excessive. We apply the baseline model to analyse the issues of debtor moral hazard and private sector involement (PSI), which have characterised the recent debate on reforming the International Financial Architecture. We show that debtor moral hazard is only a concern if the IMF cannot commit to make the post-crisis participation constraint of the debtor country binding, and that it can only be resolved via <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> (or pre-qualification). Attempts to reduce debtor moral hazard may however compromise the Fund's ability to safeguard its resources ex-post. We also show that PSI in the solution of balance of payments crisis is a central determinant of the effectiveness of both crisis prevention and resolution efforts on the part of the IMF. PSI may be an enabling condition for efficient crisis resolution, and may therefore be imposed even by a "PSI-averse" IMF. Moreover, there are conditions under which it is optimal for the IMF to ex-ante precommit to a tough, and ex-post sup-optimal, PSI policy,in order to mitigate investor moral hazard.

40|$|The {{conditionality}} {{employed by}} the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its lending policy {{is one of the}} main themes of controversy in the debate on the new international financial architecture. The purpose of this paper is to propose an analytical framework integrating the diverse explanations of the failure of IMF conditionality. Our analysis is based on the idea that the IMF is a key player in the running of markets in a global economy. More precisely, we explain that most of the criticisms concerning conditionality should be analyzed through what we agree to call the institutional failures of IMF conditionality. These institutional failures must be appreciated at two complementary levels: the first level refers to the intrinsic bureaucratic bias of the IMF while the second deals with the inability of the IMF to manage the institutional change required for the development of market processes and hence to maintain the institutional order in recipient countries. Although the first level failures have been particularly well studied via the international public choice approach, those of the second are, at best, often reduced to a simple statement. However, analyzing both levels of institutional failure of the IMF together is not without implications for the way in which the reforms of conditionality are conceived.

40|$|Elaborated in 2008 {{as part of}} the new {{industrial}} policy, {{the concept}} of smart specialisation has quickly become of key importance for the EU 2020 innovation strategy. New activities are to be nominated at the regional level that aim at exploring and discovering new technological and market opportunities in the process of entrepreneurial discovery. Smart specialisation is about defining a method to help policy-makers identify desirable areas for innovation policy intervention [Foray 2013]. Moreover, setting up national and regional smart specialisations constitutes an <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> for the cohesion policy programmes in the perspective 2014 - 2020. Smart specialization principles provide strategies and roles for all regions: leaders and less developed regions in the field of innovation and R&D. The main objective of the paper is to assess the advancement of selected Polish and French regions in the process of smart specialisation as examples of the above mentioned two types of regions present on the S 3 platform. In order to achieve the main objective of the paper, the following detailed objectives are expected to be met: - presentation of the economic fundamentals of smart specialization; - analysis of the transposition of the smart specialisation concept into strategic national and regional documents in Poland and in France; - assessment of the advancement of the smart specialisation process in selected Polish and French regions (sector analysis of smart specialisations in selected regions with regard to the innovation potential emphasized in the regional innovation strategies). There is an accepted rule in Poland that smart specialisations at national and regional level should be identified independently, which means that national specialisations cannot be treated as superior to regional ones. The progress of identifying regional smart specialisations is diversified. Fifteen Polish regions are registered in S 3 Platform, of which only five are peer-reviewed and eight have adopted RIS 3 priorities. Worth mentioning is the fact that specialisations identified at both national and regional level are convergent which indicates that both approaches selected effective specialisations, focused on whole country's economic growth. In France, where smart specializations are only identified at regional level, 20 out of 26 regions are registered in S 3 Platform, 24 of them being regions with encoded RIS 3 priorities.

5000|$|During {{his term}} as European Commissioner for Regional Policy (February 2010-November 2014) Johannes Hahn {{implemented}} {{the most ambitious}} and comprehensive reform of EU Regional Policy so far. The main achievement of the reform is the transformation of Regional Policy from a subvention- into a genuine investment policy, closely linked with EU economic governance and macro-economic conditions. This allows e.g. to modify programmes to support key structural reforms.The reform refocuses investments in the real economy and on priority areas which create sustainable jobs and foster growth such as the low carbon economy, support for small and medium enterprises, innovation & research, education and training. The introduction of clearly defined conditions {{as well as a}} better evaluation system make sure that the principle of [...] "better spending" [...] is actually safeguarded. Countries and regions will have to announce upfront what objectives they intend to achieve with the available resources and identify precisely how they will measure progress towards those goals. This will allow better monitoring and more focused investments.Based on the new regulation, European regions have developed so called smart specialisation strategies to identify their particular strengths and potentials as the basis for investments. The adoption of smart specialistion strategy was an <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> for the approval of regional programs for the period 2014-2020.Despite cuts in the overall EU budget, EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn succeeded to keep the high level of financial support for strategic investments in the new period (2014-2020): Funding for regional and cohesion policy in 2014-2020 amounts to 351,8 billion Euro. Taking into account the national contribution of member states, and the leverage effect of financial instruments, the overall impact of investments is likely to be about 600 billion Euro.Parts of the reform were already implemented {{in the last year of}} the Barroso term. Thanks to increased flexibility, allowing reprogramming of structural funds, the reformed Cohesion Policy paid also an important role in overcoming coping with the economic crisis. Measures in this context were e.g. reallocation of unused funds for education, training and employment as well as for providing urgently needed liquidity for enterprises [...]The reform, endorsed by the Council and European Parliament with overwhelming majority and strongly supported also by stakeholders and the Committee of the Regions, established Hahn's reputation as a [...] "forward looking, bold reformer".|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{agricultural}} {{support of}} the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has increasingly shifted from market price support measures to budgetary payments. This development has made support more visible and has raised public attention to the distribution of support, which in turn increased political awareness of the topic. Simulation models are tools frequently used for the ex-ante analysis of policy reforms. In other scientific areas, e. g. poverty analysis or tax reform analysis, it is quite common to assess impacts of macroeconomic shocks on income distribution on a national scale by the application of behavioural ex-ante models and referring {{to the level of}} individual incomes. Similar tools for the measurement of impacts of sectoral or macroeconomic policies on the individual farm income level are less frequent for the agricultural sector and, apart from few exceptions, ex-ante studies of redistributive effects of agricultural policy are rare. Yet, in <b>general,</b> <b>ex-ante</b> policy impact analysis in the agricultural sector has a long tradition. The combination of models to jointly assess effects at different levels of aggregation and taking behavioural effects into account is very common. Most of the model chains, however, take farm groups or average farms into account rather than accounting for effects at the individual farm level. Some {{attempts have been made to}} combine macro or sectoral models with micro models, which incorporate the behaviour of individual farms. Such research, however, is often restricted to the analysis of certain types of farms. In <b>general,</b> <b>ex-ante</b> analyses of redistributive effects among individual farms on a supra-regional level in the sense of evaluating a counterfactual distribution of income with regard to a reference distribution of income including an assessment of progressivity or related concepts can hardly be found for the agricultural sector. Against this background, the main objective of this work is to develop a tool that is able to consistently assess impacts of agricultural policy on individual farm incomes, thereby building on existing modelling approaches and thus, taking behavioural effects into account for the ex-ante analysis of redistributive effects of agricultural policy. Subsequently, different liberalization scenarios are defined and a detailed analysis of redistributive effects is carried out for the western German agricultural sector by the application of methodologies borrowed from the field of tax progressivity analysis. Thereby, several contributions to the understanding of modelling inequality effects are made, methodologically as well as empirically. The modelling system consists of three layers. At the sectoral and the meso-level two previously developed large scale models are applied. The European Simulation Model (ESIM) is an agricultural sector model with a strong focus on the CAP. It depicts the world agricultural sector  though in different degrees of regional disaggregation  and quantifies effects of agricultural policy at the European and member state level. It is, however, unable to estimate intra-sectoral income changes at the farm level. The Farm Modelling Information System (FARMIS) is a more disaggregate model that depicts the German agricultural sector in great detail. It applies 628 homogenous farm groups and is used in the modelling chain to estimate impacts on the intra-sectoral distribution of income at the meso-level. The two models at the sectoral and meso-level are consistently linked via an iterative solution process. After convergence is achieved between ESIM and FARMIS, the integrated results are further processed in a micro model, estimating impacts at the individual farm level. The micro model has been developed for this study, is static in nature, and relies on the results of the meso-model. After changes in individual incomes are calculated as a first step by the modelling system for different scenarios, model results are analysed in a second step by the application of a methodology for the measurement of redistributive effects that was originally developed for the analysis of tax reforms. Based on the comparison and decomposition of relative and absolute Gini coefficients, detailed redistributive impacts of changes in agricultural policy are presented. For the analysis, scenario results for the year 2020 are evaluated relative to the income distribution of a reference scenario where the CAP is still in place in 2020. To account for different conceptual impacts of inequality analysis on results, the analysis is carried out at different aggregation levels, for different income classifications, and for income data generated in a static way in comparison to data generated by the modelling system. It can be stated that inequality effects are robust with regard to the conceptual differences tested for, at least in terms of the direction of inequality changes. All calculated liberalization scenarios lead to decreasing absolute income differences among western German farms in 2020 because high-income farms lose higher absolute amounts of money than small-income farms. Relative to their Baseline incomes, however, low-income farms tend to lose a higher share compared to high-income farms which leads to increasing relative inequality due to liberalization. Only one exemption from this pattern of results exists: if grouped results are disaggregated and total household income is considered instead of family farm income. In summary, this work provides an innovative combination and extension of different simulation models, which enables the ex-ante measurement of income changes for individual farms. This information in turn facilitates the measurement of redistributive effects in the agricultural sector taking behavioural effects into account. Verschiedene Reformen der letzten Jahrzehnte haben die Ausgestaltung der Gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik (GAP) der Europäischen Union grundlegend verändert. Traditionelle Instrumente der Marktpreisstützung wurden in zunehmendem Maße durch Direktzahlungen an landwirtschaftliche Betriebe ersetzt. Diese Entwicklung führte zu einer erhöhten Transparenz in der politischen Stützung des Agrarsektors und rückte die Frage der Verteilung von Subventionen stärker in den Fokus des öffentlichen Interesses. Für die Analyse einer politischen Reform vor ihrer Umsetzung wird regelmäßig auf Simulationsmodelle zurückgegriffen. In anderen wissenschaftlichen Bereichen  beispielsweise in der Analyse von Armutseffekten oder in der Analyse von Steuerreformen  ist es gängige Praxis, die Auswirkungen makroökonomischer Veränderungen auf die individuelle Einkommensverteilung eines Landes durch die Anwendung von Simulationsmodellen vorab zu bewerten. Ähnliche Instrumente für die Bemessung von Auswirkungen sektoraler oder makroökonomischer Politiken auf die Höhe individueller Einkommen gibt es weniger oft für die Analyse des Agrarsektors. Grundsätzlich gibt es jedoch eine lange Tradition in der Entwicklung von Modellen für die Politikfolgenabschätzung im Agrarsektor. Auch die kombinierte Nutzung von verschiedenen Einzelmodellen für die gemeinsame, konsistente Bewertung von Politikszenarien auf verschiedenen Aggregationsstufen ist üblich. Die meisten Modell-Kombinationen beziehen sich jedoch auf die Auswertung von Betriebsgruppen oder Durchschnittsbetrieben als niedrigste Aggregationsstufe. Es existieren einige Ansätze, die Makromodelle mit Mikromodellen verknüpfen, die ihrerseits Verhaltensanpassungen einzelner Betriebe abbilden. Viele dieser Studien beschränken sich jedoch auf die Abbildung von bestimmten Betriebstypen oder Regionen. Grundsätzlich ist festzuhalten, dass bislang nur sehr wenige überregionale ex-ante Analysen von betriebsindividuellen Verteilungseffekten durchgeführt wurden. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit, eine Analysemethode zur simultanen und konsistenten Bewertung von agrarpolitisch induzierten Einkommensverteilungswirkungen auf aggregierter und betriebsindividueller Ebene im Agrarsektor zu entwickeln. Dabei wird auf bereits bestehende Einzelmodelle zur Politikfolgenabschätzung zurückgegriffen. Mit der entwickelten Methode werden verschiedene Liberalisierungsszenarien der europäischen Agrarpolitik ausgewertet. Eine detaillierte Analyse von Auswirkungen auf die betriebsindividuelle Einkommensverteilung wird für den westdeutschen Agrarsektor präsentiert. Das in der vorliegenden Arbeit entwickelte Modellsystem besteht aus drei verschiedenen Stufen. Auf der sektoralen Ebene und dem Meso-Level kommen zwei bereits existierende Modelle zur Politikfolgenabschätzung zum Einsatz. Das European Simulation Model (ESIM) ist ein Agrarsektormodell mit einem starkem Fokus auf die europäische Agrarpolitik. Das Modell wird zur Quantifizierung von agrarpolitisch induzierten Effekten auf europäischer Ebene sowie auf Ebene der Mitgliedstaaten verwendet. Aufgrund seiner hohen Aggregationsebene kann das Modell jedoch nicht zur Bestimmung von intra-sektoralen Einkommensänderungen verwendet werden. Hierzu wird das Farm Modelling Information System (FARMIS) hinzugezogen. Letzteres operiert auf einer niedrigeren Aggregationsstufe und bildet die Produktionsseite des deutschen Agrarsektors in größerem Detail ab. In dem Modell werden 628 homogene Betriebsgruppen verwendet. Die beiden Modelle werden in einem iterativen Prozess miteinander verlinkt. Nachdem Konvergenz erreicht ist, werden die Ergebnisse für die 628 Betriebsgruppen in einem Mikromodell weiter disaggregiert. Das Mikromodell wurde für die vorliegende Studie entwickelt. Es handelt sich um ein statisches Modell, das eng auf das FARMIS Modell abgestimmt ist. Die in einem ersten Schritt unter Anwendung des Modellsystems simulierten betriebsindividuellen Einkommensänderungen werden in einem zweiten Schritt analysiert. Zu diesem Zweck wird eine Methode zur Messung von Verteilungseffekten angewendet, die ursprünglich für die Analyse von Steuerreformen entwickelt wurde. Basierend auf einem Vergleich und einer Zerlegung von relativen und absoluten Gini-Koeffizienten können detaillierte Aussagen über die Auswirkungen von agrarpolitischen Reformen auf die Einkommensverteilung im Agrarsektor getroffen werden. Um den Einfluss verschiedener methodischer Ansätze auf die Ergebnisse abzuschätzen, wird die Analyse für verschiedene Aggregationslevel, verschiedene Einkommensklassifizierungen und verschiedene Arten der Berechnung von Einkommensänderungen (statisch versus modellbasiert) durchgeführt. Bezüglich der Ergebnisse kann konstatiert werden, dass die getesteten konzeptionellen Unterschiede mit einer Ausnahme keinen Einfluss auf die Richtung der Verteilungseffekte haben. Die simulierten Szenarien, die einen Abbau der Agrarpolitik beinhalten, führen zu einer Verringerung von absoluten Einkommensunterschieden zwischen westdeutschen Betrieben im Jahr 2020. Betriebe, die im Referenzszenario ein hohes Einkommen erzielen, verlieren durch eine Liberalisierung absolut gesehen mehr Einkommen, als Betriebe mit geringerem Einkommen in der Referenzsituation. Relativ gesehen verlieren jedoch Betriebe mit geringerem Einkommen einen größeren Anteil ihres Referenzeinkommens in 2020 als Betriebe mit höherem Referenzeinkommen. Dieses führt zu einer Vergrößerung von relativer Ungleichheit, aber zu einer Verringerung von absoluter Ungleichheit...|$|R
