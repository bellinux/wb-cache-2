5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the system to be considered a tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Creutz {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} come to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he became the head of its Physics Department and its Nuclear Research Center in 1948.

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21. Its inner core was largely disrupted, so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay, the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength. Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some <b>development</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, some Georgia Tech {{faculty members}} {{belonging}} to Sigma Xi started a research club that met {{once a month}} at Tech. One of the monthly subjects, proposed by ceramic engineering professor W. Harry Vaughan, was a collection of issues related to Tech, such as library <b>development,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> development of a state engineering station. Such a station would theoretically assist local businesses with engineering problems via Georgia Tech's established faculty and resources. This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiments at universities around the country, and the report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929.|$|E

Shortly after, one of Shatterstar's creators, Rob Liefeld, expressed his disapproval of Peter David's decision.
