5|$|NGC 2537, {{known as}} the Bear's Paw Galaxy, lies about 3 degrees north-northwest of 31 Lyncis. It is a blue compact dwarf galaxy that <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 17 and 30 million light-years away from Earth. Close by is IC 2233, a very flat and thin spiral galaxy that is between 26 and 40 million light-years away from Earth. A {{comparatively}} quiet galaxy with a low rate of star formation (less than one solar mass every twenty years), it was long suspected to be interacting with the Bear's Paw galaxy. This is now considered highly unlikely as observations with the Very Large Array showed the two galaxies lie at different distances.|$|E
5|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{takes place}} in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> near Tokyo. Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto accidentally {{releases}} a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with battle costumes. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.|$|E

5|$|After {{dreaming of}} {{spectacular}} horrors, Houdini awakens {{at the bottom}} of the pit and eventually manages to free himself from the ropes. Suspecting that he <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> in a temple under the Great Sphinx of Giza, he travels through the dark in an attempt to find an exit, following what he believes to be a draft from outdoors. Instead, he discovers that he has actually been heading further underground, eventually falling down a flight of stairs and landing in a large ceremonial cavern. There he witnesses an army of half-man, half-animal mummies, led by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs Khephren and Nitokris, leaving offerings to a hippopotamus-sized, five-headed, tentacled beast that appears from a hole deep in the hall. As he escapes, he realizes that this creature is merely the paw of a much larger deity in whose image the Sphinx was carved. Houdini dismisses the events as a hallucination or a dream consequent of the strains of his kidnapping ordeal, despite the resemblance he sees between Khephren and his guide, Drogman.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, Scully {{correctly}} deduces that Arlen was {{blinded by}} reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks {{in dire need}} of medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> nearby. He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the creature approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased creature then turns into Stites.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{recorded}} {{campaigns in}} Syro-Palestine during Amenhotep I's reign. However, {{according to the}} Tombos Stela of his successor, Thutmose I, when Thutmose led a campaign into Asia {{all the way to}} the Euphrates, he found no one who fought against him. If Thutmose did not lead a campaign which has not been recorded into Asia before this recorded one, it would mean that the preceding pharaoh would have had to pacify Syria instead, which would indicate a possible Asiatic campaign of Amenhotep I. Two references to the Levant potentially written during his reign might be contemporary witnesses to such a campaign. One of the candidates for Amenhotep's tomb contains a reference to Qedmi, which <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> in Canaan or the Transjordan, and Amenemhet's tomb contains a hostile reference to Mitanni. However, neither of these references necessarily refer to campaigning, nor do they even necessarily date to Amenhotep's reign. The location of Amenhotep's tomb is not certain, and Amenemhet lived to serve under multiple kings who are known to have attacked Mitanni. Records from Amenhotep's reign are simply altogether too scant and too vague to reach a conclusion about any Syrian campaign.|$|E

25|$|The kinetic rate {{of these}} {{reactions}} depends {{mostly on the}} monomer gas, which must be either gaseous or vaporized. However, other parameters are also important as well, such as power, pressure, flow rate, frequency, electrode gap and reactor configuration. Low flow rates usually only depend {{on the amount of}} reactive species present for polymerization, whereas high flow rates depend on {{the amount of time that}} is spent in the reactor. Therefore, the maximum rate of polymerization <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the middle.|$|E

The amount of deuterium burnt also depends to some extent on the composition of the object, specifically on the amount of helium and deuterium present and on the fraction of heavier elements, which determines the atmospheric opacity and thus the radiative cooling rate.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) during cardiac arrest is ideally {{reversal of the}} clinically dead state by restoration of blood circulation and breathing. However, there is great variation in the effectiveness of CPR for this purpose. Blood pressure is very low during manual CPR, resulting in only a ten-minute average extension of survival. Yet there are cases of patients regaining consciousness during CPR while still in full cardiac arrest. In absence of cerebral function monitoring or frank return to consciousness, the neurological status of patients undergoing CPR is intrinsically uncertain. It <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> between the state of clinical death and a normal functioning state.|$|E

Furthermore, Carrier argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the first century. He argues that the probability of Jesus' existence <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the range from 1/3 to 1/12000 depending on the estimates used for the computation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on your political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op <b>is</b> <b>somewhere</b> between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|E
