5|$|<b>Helper</b> T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} <b>helper</b> cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. <b>Helper</b> T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the <b>helper</b> T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the <b>helper</b> cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. <b>Helper</b> T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting <b>helper</b> T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by <b>helper</b> T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, <b>helper</b> T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|E

40|$|In cooperatively {{breeding}} pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis) {{blood plasma}} levels of LH and testosterone (T) were compared among {{three types of}} males: breeders, primary (= related) <b>helpers</b> and secondary (= unrelated) <b>helpers.</b> These categories {{did not differ in}} LH, but primary <b>helpers</b> had significantly lower T titers than breeders and secondary <b>helpers.</b> The low levels were paralleled by small gonad sizes and no sperm production, ~u~!!;csting that primary <b>helpers</b> were not able to fertilize eggs. The differences in T levels could neither be attributed to stochastic variation nor to differences in age, stress, molt, or reproductive activities. The most likely explanation arises from the observation that primary <b>helpers</b> are behaviorally dominated by breeders, whereas secondary <b>helpers</b> are not. The adaptive significance of low T titers and reduced fertility as a result from being dominated is discussed on the basis of empirical data and theoretical models. We argue that primary <b>helpers</b> in the pied kingfisher, and subordinate <b>helpers</b> in many other cooperative breeders, apparently are not "unwillingly " suppressed in their sexual development; they rather "choose " delayed reproduction when the costs from sexual competition with breeders exceed the benefits from cooperative breeding. In contrast, <b>helpers</b> that benefit more from competition than from cooperation, as secondary <b>helpers</b> do, cannot be expected to show reduced fertility...|$|R

This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion {{may not be the}} same as that presented to the T <b>helper</b> cell.

40|$|The {{theory of}} family-group {{dynamics}} predicts that group structure, helping behaviour and social interactions among group members should {{vary with the}} opportunities of subordinates to breed independently. We investigated experimentally whether unrelated mature <b>helpers</b> in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher reduce costly social and cooperative behaviour and choose to disperse and breed independently when offered vacant breeding sites. As predicted by the ecological constraints hypothesis, when breeding substrate was available, (i) <b>helpers</b> spent more time in dispersal areas and it was mainly large <b>helpers</b> that left the group to breed independently; (ii) all <b>helpers</b> invested less in costly submissive behaviours towards other group members and large <b>helpers</b> reduced help, supporting the ‘pay-to-stay’ hypothesis; and (iii) large <b>helpers,</b> particularly those that dispersed and bred, increased more in body mass in the treatment than those without breeding options, suggesting status-dependent strategic growth of <b>helpers.</b> We conclude that <b>helpers</b> of N. pulcher decide whether to stay and pay or disperse and breed in response to constraints on independent breeding...|$|R
50|$|The {{daffodil}} cichlid inhabits permanent {{social groups}} composed of one breeding pair and <b>helpers</b> of both sexes. Absolute breeding success (assessed {{by a combined}} measure of clutch size and egg survival probability) {{has been shown to}} be higher for breeding pairs with <b>helpers</b> compared to those without <b>helpers.</b> Egg size tends to decrease as the number of <b>helpers</b> within groups increases, which suggests that the presence of <b>helpers</b> enables breeder females to strategically reduce their investment per egg in a manner that maximizes breeder fitness.|$|R
50|$|Due to high predation, {{there is}} a high nest failure rate. If nest failure occurs after the {{beginning}} of May, failed breeders will not try to re-nest, but may become <b>helpers</b> at a nest of another, usually related, pair. In one study, around 50% of nests had one or more <b>helpers.</b> By helping close relatives, <b>helpers</b> gain indirect fitness benefits by increasing the survivability of related offspring. <b>Helpers</b> may also gain greater access to mates and territories in the future. <b>Helpers</b> also gain experience raising young and therefore their future offspring have greater survivability rates.|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{a number}} of studies have {{explored}} the issue of home help service for elderly care, very few studies have deeply investigated the emotional or psychological wellbeing of home helpers; in Japan specifically, the burden and distress of home <b>helpers</b> is still unknown. The present study aims to reveal the emotional and psychological profile of home <b>helpers.</b> Methods: The authors used qualitative data based on the retrospective abduction of a one-hour focus group discussion on burden and distress among home <b>helpers</b> held in and around the city of Nagoya in 2012. The group discussion was entitled “Define the burden and distress of home helpers”. A total of 14 participants, 12 females and 2 males, agreed to take part in the study. Results: Nine groups were extracted: 1) Relations between home <b>helpers</b> and users are not always smooth; 2) There is communication gap between home <b>helpers</b> and their colleagues; 3) Offering customized support to users and families is difficult; 4) Home <b>helpers</b> have tight schedules; 5) Home <b>helpers</b> are treated badly; 6) Poor support from management; 7) Users and families don't understand the public long-term care insurance system and need home <b>helpers</b> to constantly clarify it; 8) Home <b>helpers</b> often fail to provide the care services requested by users for lack of time; 9) Home <b>helpers</b> always feel isolated and worry about providing appropriate care. Conclusion: The results suggest that home <b>helpers</b> work in an environment where they have to endure hard labor, heavy pressure, and lack of sympathy...|$|R

5|$|The rate of {{psoriasis}} in HIV-positive {{individuals is}} {{comparable to that of}} HIV-negative individuals, however, psoriasis tends to be more severe in people infected with HIV. A much higher rate of psoriatic arthritis occurs in HIV-positive individuals with psoriasis than in those without the infection. The immune response in those infected with HIV is typically characterized by cellular signals from Th2 subset of CD4+ <b>helper</b> T cells, whereas the immune response in psoriasis vulgaris is characterized by a pattern of cellular signals typical of Th1 subset of CD4+ <b>helper</b> T cells and Th17 <b>helper</b> T cells. It is hypothesized that the diminished CD4+-T cell presence causes an overactivation of CD8+-T cells, which are responsible for the exacerbation of psoriasis in HIV-positive people. Psoriasis in those with HIV/AIDS is often severe and may be untreatable with conventional therapy.|$|E

50|$|When {{parents and}} <b>helpers</b> care for offspring, the {{protection}} {{may reduce the}} predation risk to offspring, which may allow mothers to invest less per single offspring. Daffodil cichlid <b>helpers</b> protect the group offspring and reduce the offspring's mortality rate. Therefore, dominant females are expected to reduce their investment per egg when more <b>helpers</b> are present. Experiments show that females do indeed reduce egg size with increasing number of <b>helpers</b> but not when perceived neighbor density is high.|$|R
50|$|Group {{augmentation}} {{presents a}} second hypothesis towards {{the evolution of}} cooperative breeding. This hypothesis suggests that increasing {{the size of the}} group, through the addition of <b>helpers,</b> aids in individual survival and may increase <b>helper’s</b> future breeding success. Group augmentation is favored if the grouping provides passive benefits for <b>helpers</b> in addition to inclusive fitness. By group augmenting, each individual member reduces their chances of becoming a victim of predation. Additionally, an increase in members reduces each <b>helper’s</b> duration as a sentinel (standing upon a high surface to survey for predators) or babysitting (guarding the offspring and den). The reduction in these guarding behaviors enables <b>helpers</b> to forage for longer periods.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} callitrichid primate <b>helpers</b> (allocare-givers {{other than an}} infant's father) on the survival, {{reproduction}} or behavior of infants and parents are reviewed, using both published studies and data from free-ranging golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia). Three lines of evidence suggest that <b>helpers</b> may increase their own inclusive fitness: (1) The number of adult males acting as <b>helpers</b> in free-ranging groups is correlated {{with the number of}} surviving infants in 3 callitrichid species. However, the lack of a negative correlation with number of infants dying suggests that activities other than direct infant care (e. g. territory defense) may be more important, especially in newly formed groups. (2) In 2 species, captive groups with <b>helpers</b> carry infants {{for longer periods of time}} than do groups without <b>helpers.</b> Whether such differences would translate into meaningful survival differences in free-ranging groups is unclear. (3) <b>Helpers</b> reduce the energetic burden of parents by reducing the amount of time they spend transporting or provisioning infants in at least 4 species. Reproductive males are more likely than reproductive females to benefit from the presence of <b>helpers,</b> reducing their investment in infant care activities as the number of <b>helpers</b> in the group increases. In free-ranging golden lion tamarins, the reproductive tenure of males, but not females, increases with the number of <b>helpers</b> in the group, suggesting that a reduction in energetic investment may translate into increased survival. 'Decisions' made by <b>helpers</b> to participate in infant transport are weighed against competing needs for foraging, vigilance, territory defense and, in some cases, prospecting for breeding opportunities. Given this complexity, a sophisticated model may be required to answer the question of how <b>helpers</b> 'decide' to participate in infant care versus other activities. Copyright 2000 S.

50|$|Males {{and females}} are equally {{likely to become}} <b>helpers.</b> Parents may allow the care of <b>helpers</b> to be {{additive}} to their own efforts, or on the other extreme, they may reduce their efforts with {{the care of the}} <b>helpers.</b> Juvenile males have a higher survivability than juvenile females, although the survival rate for adults of the two sexes is the same. Offspring that were raised with <b>helpers</b> have a higher survivability than offspring raised without. Failed breeders that became <b>helpers</b> have a higher survivability than failed breeders who did not. This may be because of the reduced energy expenditure from sharing a nest. This is similar to acorn woodpeckers and green wood hoopoes. However, failed breeders that did not help are more likely to breed successfully in subsequent years, so there may be a cost of helping. This may be due to <b>helpers</b> having relatively poorer body conditions {{at the end of the}} breeding season, similar to pied kingfisher and white-winged chough. Successful breeders have a survivability rate around the survivability of failed breeders who became <b>helpers.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlloparental care of non-breeders is {{the main}} {{characteristic}} of cooperatively breeding species. While many studies {{have contributed to the}} understanding of the evolutionary reasons why individuals provide care to young that are not their own offspring, the variables influencing and causing alloparental care are less understood. We tested in African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) whether age, sex, testosterone and corticosterone were correlated with alloparental care of non-breeding <b>helpers.</b> We studied 11 family groups under controlled conditions in the laboratory, each with two juvenile and two adult <b>helpers,</b> one being male and one being female in each age category. We predicted male <b>helpers</b> to show more alloparental care than female <b>helpers,</b> as males are the dispersing sex and might thus have to pay for staying. We also expected adult <b>helpers</b> to show more alloparental care than juvenile <b>helpers</b> and both corticosterone and testosterone to correlate negatively with alloparental care. We found high levels of alloparental care in non-breeding striped mice, which spent a significant amount of time in the nest, huddling and licking pups. There was neither a difference between the sexes nor between age categories (although both factors were significant in interaction terms), indicating either low costs and/or high benefits of alloparental care. Mothers showed significantly more care than <b>helpers,</b> and fathers showed similar levels of parental care as mothers but not significantly more than <b>helpers.</b> Although testosterone levels differed significantly between <b>helpers</b> of different age and sex, with adult male <b>helpers</b> showing the highest levels, we did not find any relationships between testosterone and the amount of alloparental care. Corticosterone levels were negatively correlated with alloparental care, and these effects were modulated by the sex and the age of <b>helpers.</b> In females, less alloparental care was shown with increasing corticosterone levels, while in males, the relationship was positive. Also, younger individuals with lower corticosterone levels showed more alloparental care than older individuals with low corticosterone levels. In sum, alloparental care is well developed in male and female non-breeding <b>helpers</b> of striped mice, both in adult and juvenile <b>helpers,</b> but independently of testosterone, with corticosterone showing an age- and sex-specific relationship with alloparental care...|$|R
