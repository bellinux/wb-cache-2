5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heavily modified for flight, {{and immediate}} transitional fossil predecessors have {{not so far}} been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{bereaved}} {{of the best}} friend of my life, of one who, if it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> ordained, would willingly have shared not only my poverty but also my death. During her life she was the faithful helper of my ministry. From her I never experienced the slightest hindrance.|$|E

5|$|In chapter 80 of the 13th century Icelandic saga Egils saga, Egill Skallagrímsson composes a poem {{in praise}} of Arinbjörn (Arinbjarnarkviða).

5|$|Traffic {{through the}} village <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> heavy on {{weekends}} during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street one-way, carrying traffic only to the west, while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets. Other villages that have made such changes found making streets one-way decreased business at their retailers.|$|E
5|$|While Johnny wanders {{the city}} and pines for a woman he sees in an {{apartment}} window ("Boulevard of Broken Dreams"), Tunny {{finds it hard to}} adjust to urban life and is seduced by a television ad for the army ("Favorite Son").

He enlists in the army.|$|E

5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E

5|$|Chris (Rob Lowe) has fired Denis Cooper, {{the former}} health {{department}} public relations director, who hung posters around city hall to publicly condemn his adulterous wife. Leslie (Amy Poehler) suggests Ann (Rashida Jones) replace him, mainly {{because they can}} spend more time together, since Ann <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> busy dating numerous men. Although reluctant to leave {{her job as a}} nurse, Ann agrees to attend the job interview, and Leslie provides her with an overwhelming amount of reading material to prepare for it. Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) encourages the parks department to attend the Snakehole Lounge, a nightclub he partially owns with his friend Jean-Ralphio Saperstein (Ben Schwartz), for the unveiling of his new alcoholic beverage, Snake Juice. Tom also encourages them to spread the word about the drink through word of mouth guerilla marketing. April (Aubrey Plaza) shows little interest in attending, until Andy (Chris Pratt) suggests they make a game of it by role-playing as different people at the bar. April pretends to be Janet Snakehole, an aristocratic widow with a dark secret, while Andy poses as his frequent alter-ego, FBI agent Burt Macklin.|$|E
5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
60|$|How {{she could}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> deceived!--He protested {{that he had}} never thought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> misled.|$|R

5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who {{is using a}} strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to obtain}} their power. Constantine's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.|$|E
5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
