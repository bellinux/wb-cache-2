During the tour frontman Jacoby Shaddix and Hinder lead singer Austin John created a very tight friendship, causing the band to tour with Hinder on multiple tours in later years.

500|$|In [...] "Mommy Dearest", it is {{discovered}} {{that there is a}} possibility Crowley may have faked his death and might still be alive; suggesting that perhaps Castiel had burned the wrong bones by mistake. Eve reveals this to Sam and Dean when they try to hunt her down. During the hunt, Eve is able to suppress Castiel's powers as she is older than him. After Dean kills Eve, Castiel's powers return and he kills all of her monsters with a blast of white light before transporting the group to the home of the uncle of two young boys who were turned into monsters. There, they find them dead, having been killed by demons, and Castiel promises to look into Crowley's possible survival to find out <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> he's dead or not. However, Castiel is instead seen with a very alive Crowley who states that he is [...] "tired of cleaning up after [...] messes", implying that Castiel had full knowledge of burning the wrong bones and that both he and Crowley have some sort of agreement between them and/or may be working together as partners.|$|E
500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He {{is the one who}} hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway with no place to sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the whole place collapses - which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E

2500|$|Newton's {{ownership}} {{of these materials}} by no means denotes membership within any early Rosicrucian order. [...] Furthermore, considering that his personal alchemical investigations were focused upon discovering materials which the Rosicrucians professed to already be in possession of long before he was born, would seem to some to exclude Newton from their membership. [...] However, in religious terms, {{the fact that a}} saint might have 'found God' would not preclude others from the search — quite the opposite. [...] The Ancient & Mystical Order Rosae Crucis has always claimed Newton as a frater. During his own life, Newton was openly 'accused' of being a Rosicrucian, as were many members of The Royal Society.

Hansen also admitted that Parker could've just lied about the contents of the envelopes and his investigation would've been stopped cold. As Hansen said years after the incident, [...] "That was the defining moment.

2500|$|The War of 1812 with England began {{about this}} time. There were many embargo laws then {{enforced}} and basically little trading with Europe in general. His cabinet-making business {{was all but}} rubbed out as the New England economy was in a recession at the time. It turned out little importation of European products came to America because of the war. There was a sharp incentive to make items in New England that were normally made in Europe. Many products were scarce and much rewarded for those that could produce them in America. Munroe figured {{there had to be}} a way to exploit this concept so thought of some ideas of things he could make. Being practical he first produced cabinetmaker’s squares since he already had skills in this area and it would be easy for him to make these. He did his level best selling them at a fair price, however competition eventually made his business decline. He then noticed the scarcity of imported pencils and the high price that people paid for them. Munroe figured that making these for people was a financial opportunity.

2500|$|The first alleged {{sexual act}} was of Jackson masturbating Gavin on Jackson's bed. Jackson {{allegedly}} initiated the molestation by urging the accuser to masturbate, {{telling him that}} boys who didn't [...] "might rape a girl." [...] However, in a police interview before the trial, Gavin was asked what he knew about masturbation and he replied, [...] "My grandma explained it to me. She told me that...if men don't do it...they might go ahead and rape a woman." [...] When asked about this coincidence, the accuser maintained that both his grandmother and Jackson had happened {{to tell him the}} same thing, but with different motives. The accuser testified that during that first sexual incident, he was wearing pajamas Jackson had given him, and {{that the two of them}} [...] "were under the covers." [...] Jackson allegedly manipulated the accuser's genitals for about five minutes, causing the accuser to ejaculate (count 2). Afterwards, the accuser averred, Jackson told him [...] "it was okay" [...] and they [...] "just went to sleep." [...] The next night, Gavin testified, [...] "the same thing happened again" [...] (count 3), in Jackson's bed, both of them wearing Jackson's pajamas, but now they were on top of the covers and maybe [...] "watching T.V. or something." [...] This time, Jackson also tried to guide the accuser's hand to Jackson's genitals, but the accuser pulled away (count 6). Gavin couldn't remember <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> <b>if</b> he ejaculated the second time but he thought he did. In an earlier interview with Sneddon, the accuser claimed he had been molested before the rebuttal video, but in court he testified that all molestation took place after the video was filmed.
