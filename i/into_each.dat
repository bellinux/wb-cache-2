5|$|Each {{background}} processor {{consisted of}} a computation section, a control section and local memory. The computation section performed 64-bit scalar, floating point and vector arithmetic. The control section provided instruction buffers, memory management functions, and a real-time clock. 16 kwords (128 kbytes) of high-speed local memory was incorporated <b>into</b> <b>each</b> background processor for use as temporary scratch memory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway.

5|$|The Pythagorean tiling is {{the unique}} tiling by squares of two {{different}} sizes that is both unilateral (no two squares have a common side) and equitransitive (each two squares {{of the same size}} can be mapped <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other by a symmetry of the tiling).|$|E

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{is defined by}} its cells (often a one- or two-dimensional array), a finite set of values or states that can go <b>into</b> <b>each</b> cell, a neighborhood associating each cell with a finite set of nearby cells, and an update rule according to which the values of all cells are updated, simultaneously, {{as a function of}} the values of their neighboring cells.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends <b>into</b> <b>each</b> lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{techniques}} differ {{amongst the}} bovid families and also {{depend on their}} build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight on all fours. Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, the opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other at high speeds. As a rule, only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, bovids direct their attacks on the opponent's head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} Area 51 {{installation}} in Nevada {{after receiving a}} tip from an inside source concerning alien spacecraft. As they drive on the highway, the agents are surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A rumbling noise is heard as a mysterious craft flies overhead and a bright light from the object passes over them. Mulder and Fletcher find that their minds have been swapped <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other's bodies, but nobody else present is aware of this. Fletcher and Scully depart, watched by the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Harry and Sally run <b>into</b> <b>each</b> {{other again}} in a bookstore five years later. They have coffee and talk about their {{previous}} relationships; Sally and Joe broke up because she wanted a family {{and he did not}} want to marry, and Harry's fiancee left him for another man. They take a walk and become friends. They have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together, discussing their love lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, German {{mathematician}} Petra Gummelt {{demonstrated that}} a covering (so called to {{distinguish it from}} a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed. The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling {{can be obtained by}} inscribing a thick rhomb <b>into</b> <b>each</b> decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{a return}} to the format of early seasons, {{virtually}} all serials from Seasons 18 through 20 are linked together, often running directly <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other. Season 18 forms a loose story arc dealing with the theme of entropy. Full Circle, State of Decay, and Warriors' Gate trace the Doctor's adventures in E-Space; they were released in both VHS and DVD boxsets with the umbrella title The E-Space Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for}} the final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15m behind with only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
5|$|McHale was the show's lead {{writer for}} several years, {{and was the}} first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as {{executive}} producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the filmizing technique and introducing musical montage segments <b>into</b> <b>each</b> episode. Eighteen series of Holby City have aired, and the nineteenth began airing from 11 October 2016. The show has run for over 800 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, and from 2004 to 2008 featured annual special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, Holby City moved to high definition broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other. The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E

5|$|Terrestrial {{habitat types}} include forests, grasslands, {{wetlands}} and deserts. Within these broad biomes are more specific habitats with varying climate types, temperature regimes, soils, altitudes and vegetation types. Many of these habitats grade <b>into</b> <b>each</b> other {{and each one}} has its own typical communities of plants and animals. A habitat may suit a particular species well, but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance, on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser.|$|E
5|$|The Australian swellshark is oviparous. Males have larger teeth than females, {{with which}} to bite and hold onto them for copulation. Whether there is a {{specific}} mating season is uncertain, though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts, ovulating a single egg <b>into</b> <b>each</b> at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days {{the rest of the}} year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 1224 hours after the first.|$|E
