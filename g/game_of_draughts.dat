2500|$|English {{draughts}} (American 8×8 checkers) {{has been}} the arena for several notable advances in game artificial intelligence. In the 1950s, Arthur Samuel created {{one of the first}} board game-playing programs of any kind. [...] More recently, in 2007 scientists at the University of Alberta developed their [...] "Chinook" [...] program {{to the point where it}} is unbeatable. A brute force approach that took hundreds of computers working nearly two decades was used to solve the game, showing that a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts</b> will always end in a draw if neither player makes a mistake. The solution is for the draughts variation called go-as-you-please (GAYP) checkers and not for the variation called three-move restriction checkers. As of December 2007, this makes English draughts the most complex game ever solved.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, draughts, with {{superficial}} similarities to chess, {{has long been}} suspected of being [...] "played out" [...] by its expert practitioners. [...] In 2007 Schaeffer et al. proved this to be so by calculating a database of all positions with ten or fewer pieces. Thus Schaeffer has a God's algorithm for all end <b>games</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts</b> and used this to prove that all perfectly played <b>games</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts</b> will end in a draw. [...] However, draughts with only 5×1020 positions and even fewer, 3.9×1013, in Schaeffer's database, is a much easier problem to crack and is of the same order as Rubik's cube.|$|R

40|$|A neuro-inspired multi-chromosomal {{genotype}} for {{a single}} developmental neuron capable of learning and developing memory is proposed. This genotype is evolved so that the phenotype which changes and develops during an agent’s lifetime (while problem solving) gives the agent the capacity for learning by experience. Seven important processes of signal processing and neural structure development are identified from biology and encoded using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP). These chromosomes represent the electrical and developmental aspects of dendrites, axonal branches, synapses and the neuron soma. The neural morphology that occurs by running these chromosomes is highly dynamic. The dendritic/axonal branches and synaptic connections form and change in response to situations encountered in the learning task. The approach has been evaluated {{in the context of}} maze-solving and the board <b>game</b> <b>of</b> checkers (<b>draughts)</b> demonstrating interesting learning capabilities. The motivation underly-ing this research is to, ab initio, evolve genotypes that build phenotypes with an ability to learn...|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{its initial}} release, Crystals of Arborea {{received}} mixed reviews. Some critics praised the graphics and user-interface, remarking, for instance, that the [...] "characters and other creatures are well-drawn {{and accompanied by}} some superb, realistic looking, background artwork." [...] The music and sound effects were also singled out as impressive. Amiga Action acknowledged the developer's attempt to blend strategy and role-playing genres, and noted the influence of Dungeon Master on the game. However, the combat system received mixed reactions, with several commentators comparing battles to repetitive <b>games</b> <b>of</b> chess or <b>draughts.</b> Amiga Action described the combat system as [...] "innovative", whereas Amiga Power commented that the battles were [...] "strange, grid-based strategic affairs," [...] which lacked any violence or pace. Ishar: Legend of the Fortress was released in 1992, prompting the publishers to re-distribute Crystals of Arborea as a budget title in 1993. The re-release received markedly poorer reviews, owing largely to improvements made by its successor.|$|R
60|$|The dealer {{sighed and}} looked mournfully at Mrs. Pullen.

He gave up at the seventh game, and pushing back his chair, said that he thought Mrs. Pullen was the most wonderful draught- player he had ever seen, and took no notice when Mrs. Tidger, in a dry voice charged with subtle meaning, said that she thought he was.|$|E
60|$|Mention {{has been}} made that the <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts,</b> or checkers, was {{permitted}} to be played on board the Neversink. At the present time, while there was little or no shipwork to be done, and all hands, in high spirits, were sailing homeward over the warm smooth sea of the tropics; so numerous became the players, scattered about the decks, that our First Lieutenant used ironically {{to say that it}} was a pity they were not tesselated with squares of white and black marble, for the express benefit and convenience of the players. Had this gentleman had his way, our checker-boards would very soon have been pitched out of the ports. But the Captain--usually lenient in some things--permitted them, and so Mr. Bridewell was fain to hold his peace.|$|E
60|$|Not {{knowing how}} much start he would have, the cook, despite his hunger and fatigue, pushed on {{with all the}} speed {{of which he was}} capable. After an hour’s journey he ventured to ask the {{direction}} of an embryo ploughman, and wheedled out of him a small, a very small, portion of his breakfast. From the top of the next hill he {{caught a glimpse of the}} sea, and taking care to keep this friend of his youth in sight, felt his way along by it to Brittlesea. At midday he begged some broken victuals from a gamekeeper’s cottage, and with renewed vigor resumed his journey, and at ten o’clock that night staggered on to Brittlesea quay and made his way cautiously to the ship. There was nobody on deck, but a light burned in the foc’sle, and after a careful peep below he descended.

60|$|The {{faculty of}} {{re-solution}} is possibly much invigorated by mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and merely {{on account of}} its retrograde operations, has been called, as if par excellence, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at the other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental character, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise, but simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the unostentatious <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts</b> than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have different and bizarre motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound. The attention is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an instant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The possible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In draughts, on the contrary, where the moves are unique and have but little variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior acumen. To be less abstract--Let us suppose a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts</b> where the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be expected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the players being at all equal) only by some recherché movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself {{into the spirit of}} his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.|$|E
6000|$|The proper {{outlet for}} the craving is the playing of games, {{and there is}} a class of men--shadowy, unhappy, unreal-looking men--who gather in coffee-houses, and play with a desire that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched. These gather in clubs and play Tournaments, such tournaments as he of the Table Round could never have imagined. But there are others who have the vice who live in country places, in remote situations--curates, schoolmasters, rate collectors--who go {{consumed}} from day to day and meet no fit companion, and who must needs find some artificial vent for their mental energy. No one has ever calculated how many sound Problems are possible, and no doubt the Psychical Research people would be glad if Professor Karl Pearson would give his mind to the matter. All the possible dispositions of the pieces come to such a vast number, however, that, according to the theory of probability, and allowing a few thousand arrangements each day, the same problem ought never to turn up more than twice in a century or so. As a matter of fact--it is probably due to some flaw in the theory of probability--the same problem has a way of turning up in different publications several times in a month or so. It may be, of course, that, after all, quite [...] "sound" [...] problems are limited in number, and that we keep on inventing and reinventing them; that, if a record were kept, the whole system, up to four or five moves, might be classified, and placed on record {{in the course of a}} few score years. Indeed, if we were to eliminate those with conspicuously bad moves, it may be we should find the number of reasonable games was limited enough, and that even our brilliant Lasker is but repeating the inspirations of some long-buried Persian, some mute inglorious Hindoo, dead and forgotten ages since. It may be over every game there watches the forgotten forerunners of the players, and that chess is indeed a dead game, a haunted game, played out centuries ago, even, as beyond all cavil, is the <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>draughts.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Previously to the {{publication}} of his Dictionary, it was thought advisable by his friends that the degree of Master of Arts should be obtained for him, in order that his name might appear in the title page with that addition; and it was accordingly, through their intercession, conferred on him by the University of Oxford. The work was presented by the Earl of Orrery, one of his friends then at Florence, to the Delia Crusca Academy, who, in return, sent their Dictionary to the author. The French Academy paid him the same compliment. But these honours were not accompanied by that indispensable requisite, [...] "provision for the day that was passing over him." [...] He was arrested for debt, and liberated by the kindness of Richardson, the writer of Clarissa, who became his surety. To prevent such humiliation, the efforts of his own industry were not wanting. In 1756, he published an Abridgement of his Dictionary, and an Edition of Sir Thomas Browne's Christian Morals, to which he prefixed a Life of that writer; he contributed to a periodical miscellany, called the Universal Visitor, by Christopher Smart,[9] and yet more largely to another work of the same kind, entitled, the Literary Magazine; and wrote a dedication and preface for Payne's Introduction to the <b>Game</b> <b>of</b> <b>Draughts,</b> and an Introduction to the newspaper called the London Chronicle, for the last of which he received a single guinea. Yet either conscientious scruples, or his unwillingness to relinquish a London life, induced him to decline the offer of a valuable benefice in Lincolnshire, which was made him by the father of his friend, Langton, provided he could prevail on himself to take holy orders, a measure that would have delivered him from literary toil for the remainder of his days. But literary toil was the occupation for which nature had designed him. In the April of 1758, he commenced the Idler, and continued to publish it for two years in the Universal Chronicle. Of these Essays, he was supplied with Nos. 33, 93, and 96, by Thomas Warton; with No. 67 by Langton, and with Nos. 76, 79, and 82 by Reynolds. Boswell mentions twelve papers being given by his friends, but does not say who were the contributors of the remaining five. The Essay on Epitaphs, the Dissertation on Pope's Epitaphs, and an Essay on the Bravery of the English common Soldiers, were subjoined to this paper, when it was collected into volumes. It does not differ from the Rambler, otherwise than as the essays are shorter, and somewhat less grave and elaborate.|$|E

40|$|The quality <b>of</b> <b>draught</b> beer is {{important}} to consumers but can be inconsistent, ranging from excellent through to unacceptable. The few but dated studies <b>of</b> <b>draught</b> beer quality {{have focused on the}} number of microorganisms that are present in the product. Work reported here, suggests that this approach has its limitations and fails to relate to beer quality post-dispense. An alternative approach using the long-established ‘forcing’ method provides a better but still retrospective assessment <b>of</b> <b>draught</b> beer quality. Samples post dispense are ’forced’ by static incubation at 30 °C for four days and beer quality is ranked by the measurement of absorbance at 660 nm. The increase in absorbance reflects the growth of beer spoilage microorganisms present in the beer at dispense. Four quality bands are proposed, where quality is described as excellent (absorbance increase of 0. 9). The method is straightforward, requires no special skills and enables, for the first time, the robust quantification <b>of</b> <b>draught</b> beer quality. It is anticipated that the method will have widespread application in the measurement and improvement of the quality <b>of</b> <b>draught</b> beer...|$|R
