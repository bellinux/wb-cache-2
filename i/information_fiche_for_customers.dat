40|$|The {{number of}} tools for {{dynamics}} simulation {{has grown in}} the last years. It {{is necessary for the}} robotics community to have elements to ponder which of the available tools is the best for their research. As a complement to an objective and quantitative comparison, difficult to obtain since not all the tools are open-source, an element of evaluation is user feedback. With this goal in mind, we created an online survey about the use of dynamical simulation in robotics. This paper reports the analysis of the participants' answers and a descriptive <b>information</b> <b>fiche</b> <b>for</b> the most relevant tools. We believe this report will be helpful for roboticists to choose the best simulation tool for their researches. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

40|$|In this {{extensive}} report, we {{assess how}} a European unemployment benefit scheme (EUBS) could be designed. To this end, we examine 18 EUBS variants, 4 equivalent and 14 genuine schemes, and their key features. Some {{of these features}} {{can also be found}} in national unemployment benefit schemes, while others are more related to the EUBS context. We analyse the design of a common EUBS in previous literature and combine these insights with results for the legal and operational options as well as constraints and the economic value added obtained as part of our study on the “Feasibility and Added Value of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme”. All this information is integrated into a summary <b>fiche</b> <b>for</b> each of the 18 EUBS variants studied. In addition, the report deals with a range of policy issues including convergence, minimum requirements and accession criteria...|$|R

The dataset comprises annual allocations of state aid, including crisis {{aid to the}} financial sector (2008 - 09), by year, country and objective, between the years 1992 - 2009. The raw data has been obtained from the European Commission's EU State Aid Scoreboard, available on the Commission's website. The State Aid Scoreboard indicates aid expenditure made by Member States which falls under the scope of Article 107 (1) TFEU. based on annual reporting by Member States. Expenditure refers to all existing aid measures to manufacturing industries, services, agriculture and fisheries allocated by national authorities, and for which the Commission adopted a formal decision or received an <b>information</b> <b>fiche</b> from the Member States in relation to measures qualifying for exemption under the General Block Exemption Regulation.

40|$|In a queue {{with several}} {{different}} arrival streams, in general, the expected delay <b>for</b> <b>customers</b> from one stream is not {{equal to the}} expected delay <b>for</b> <b>customers</b> from the other streams. Two approximations are presented here for the expected delay <b>for</b> <b>customers</b> from a particular arrival stream in an arrival process that is the superposition of independent renewal processes. Both approximations yield errors less than 10 percent, on average, when compared to simulation estimates. One approximation, extended from Holtzman (Holtzman, J. M. 1982. Mean delays of individual streams into a queue: the Σ GI i/M/ 1 queue. Applied Probability-Computer Science: The Interface, I, Proc. Conf. in Boca Raton, 417 [...] 430.), yields better results for very sparse arrival streams and the other, empirically derived, is easier to calculate. These approximations are useful in comparing the expected delays <b>for</b> <b>customers</b> from different arrival processes to a single queue and <b>for</b> <b>customers</b> with different routes through a network of queues. queueing, queue approximations, superposition arrival processes, queues with multiple arrival processes...|$|R
