Tiers 1 and 2 companies may be integrated, and ‘cut and sew’ operations may {{be carried out by}} the same company. Fabric laminators supply their services the cut and sew operations (Tier 2). The <b>fabric</b> <b>formation</b> companies may also conduct fabric lamination in-house or out-source. There are many permutations; companies may supply yarn directly to the <b>fabric</b> <b>formation</b> company, foam and scrim directly to a fabric lamination company or only yarn to the <b>fabric</b> <b>formation</b> company and the <b>fabric</b> <b>formation</b> company supplies the scrim to the fabric lamination company. Moreover, the three companies may be integrated (Taylor 2012). An example is the consolidation by tier 1 companies. The OEMs, frustrated by the increasingly longer lead times and operational constraints, only worked with fabric suppliers with cut and sew operations. Tier 1 companies (e.g. Johnson Controls) have bought out fabric companies and become vertically integrated companies with control of upstream and downstream activities making the full range of products from seats, instrument panels, headliners, etc. With 25 % of the market, Johnson Controls vertical integration captures increasing amount of value along the chain but loses flexibility and speed.

The two different <b>fabric</b> <b>formations,</b> the edge-to-face (EF) flocculated structure (i. e., Sample A) and the dispersed and deflocculated structure (i. e., Sample B), were produced {{by changing the}} pH of the pore fluid. The anisotropy of the shear-wave velocity and DC conductivity was not observed in the sediment of Sample A because of EF isotropic fabric associations, but it was detected in Sample B {{as a result of}} face-to-face aggregation. An open card-house structure of the Sample A sediment results in a higher relaxation strength of the bulk water, Delta kappa(w) owing to a higher water content; the smaller Delta kappa(w) measured in the Sample B sediment indicates denser packing. In both samples, sediment consolidation gives rise to a decrease in the bulk-water relaxation strength, but an increase in the bound-water relaxation strength owing to increasing particle content. During sediment consolidation, the sediment conductivity of Sample A continuously decreases because of the reduced contribution from the fluid conductivity. In Sample B, the surface conduction overcompensates such a decreased contribution so that the sediment conductivity increases with increasing particle content...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} on the surface charges and {{structural}} characterization of kaolinite clay, {{it is found that}} the highly pH dependent edge charges are important to the interparticle forces and associated <b>fabric</b> <b>formations.</b> When the pH is below the isoelectrical point of the edge surfaces, IEPedge, the Coulombian attraction between faces and edges dominates, which favors the formation of an opened edge-to-face (EF) association and a higher final sediment volume. At pH > IEPedge, the double-layer repulsion prevails at all surfaces to result in a deflocculated and dispersed fabric, which tends to form denser soil packing in the sediment. Increasing the ionic strength (with NaCl as the electrolyte) leads to the opposite behavior in clay suspensions below and above the IEPedge: the degree of fabric flocculation and the final sediment volume decrease with an increased ionic strength at pH IEPedge. The measured pore-size distribution reveals a distinct dual-porosity characteristic in the pH 4 with salts (0. 15 mol/L NaCl) specimen: it consists of inter-aggregate spaces (similar to 1. 10 mu m) and intra-aggregate pores (similar to 0. 30 mu m).

The Alpine Schist {{is located on}} the eastern margin of the Alpine Fault, which accommodates oblique collision between the Pacific and Australian plates in New Zealand.

Despite this, fabrics of Mesozoic age are inferred to be preserved at the surface. In order to test the age of <b>fabric</b> <b>formation,</b> transects were conducted across the Alpine Schist to measure the foliation.

The structural data displayed two populations of foliations: a dominant foliation tracking towards the orientation of the Alpine Fault and a minor shallower orientation. The geochronological data highlighted ages for the formation and deposition of the Alpine Schist protolith and metamorphism associated with the Rangitata Orogeny.

40|$|Behaviour of {{kaolinite}} clay is intimately {{related to the}} pore-fluid properties, such as the pH value, electrolyte concentration, ion type, and presence of organic compounds among others, because of its charged surfaces and associated interparticle electrical forces. The {{first part of this}} research focuses on the <b>fabric</b> <b>formations</b> and characterizations. The effects of pH and electrolyte concentrations on the interparticle forces and associated <b>fabric</b> <b>formations</b> were studied. Experimental results, including those from sedimentation tests, pore-size measurements, SEM images, and liquid limit tests reveal that the Coulombian attraction force dominates at low pH (pH below the isoelectric point of edge surfaces, IEPedge) and low electrolyte concentrations, which favors the formation of an opened face-to-edge fabric. At high pH (pH > IEPedge) and low electrolyte concentrations, the prevailing double layer repulsion leads to a deflocculated and dispersed fabric which tends to form a denser soil packing with particles in parallel alignment after deposition or consolidation. At high electrolyte concentrations, van der Waals' attraction overwhelms the repulsion due to a shrunk double layer, and therefore soil aggregates and a relatively opened soil packing are formed accordingly. The second part highlights the structure effects on the dynamic properties. The shear modulus and damping ratio of kaolinite with different structures, selected {{based on the results of}} fabric characterizations, were assessed by means of the Energy-Injecting Virtual Mass (EIVM) Resonant Column System. The experimental results demonstrated that the dynamic properties of kaolinite closely interrelate with interparticle forces and associated fabric arrangements. Stronger interparticle forces or higher degrees of flocculated structure lead to a greater shear modulus Gmax and lower damping ratio Dmin. The structure influence on the volumetric change and strain response under isotropic compression is apparent. Specimens with different structures have their individual consolidation lines and the merging trend is not readily seen as the isotropic confinement is up to 250 kPa. Moreover, the compressibility increases with increasing degree of flocculated structure. Anisotropic strain responses due to fabric effects can be found as well. The fabric effects on the critical-state and stress-strain behaviour are discussed in the last part based on the experimental observations of undrained shear tests. The soil structure has no apparent influence on the critical state friction angle (∅c'= 27. 5 °), which suggests the irrelevance between the critical-stress ratio and the interparticle forces. The undrained shear strength is seemly controlled by the initial packing density rather than the interparticle forces. Differences in the effective stress path are evident. Specimens with flocculated structure show a contractive tendency until reaching the critical state, while more complicate behaviour can be observed for the specimens with dispersed structure: showing a contractive tendency initially, passing a phase-transformation state afterwards, and performing dilative shearing towards the critical state in the end. Apart from the substantial influence on the isotropic normal compression line, the soil structure also has a noticeable effect on the volumetric behaviour at critical states for the specimens under confining pressure of 100 kPa...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{behavior}} of mineral mixtures can be {{significantly different from}} the {{behavior of}} the individual components of the mixture due to differences between the mechanical and chemical properties of the individual minerals, and their ensuing effects on interparticle interactions and <b>fabric</b> <b>formation.</b> This study examines mixtures of kaolinite and calcium carbonate at different mass fractions using sedimentation, viscosity, and liquid-limit tests. These macroscale tests represent a wide range of solid-volume fractions and strain levels, with emphasis on high water-content conditions to magnify the effects of electrical forces. The results demonstrate that interparticle interactions depend on mineral surface-fluid effects, particle geometry, relative particle size, and solids content. With small solids contents, the kaolinite/calcium carbonate mixture behavior is a function of electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged mineral particles that promote flocculation; however, with large solids contents, the specific surface area of the minerals is the controlling factor. These results are relevant to many natural soil environments and to the possible development of engineered mineral mixtures for industrial applications...|$|E

In order to achieve all these three objectives concurrently, development of a new process by combining existing methods was focused on in this research. This approach has not been followed in the past. Under this project, combining of Alkaline scouring with Bio scouring and Solvent scouring were separately considered as the approach of the research. Widely used Alkaline (NaOH) scouring method has been chosen as the reference method and aspects of this method were compared with experimental results. Recipes were developed according to general requirements of combining agents and tested with 100 % cotton twill fabric and results were analyzed. Within all tested recipes the most suitable combination was finalized with necessary conditions in order to achieve better results in terms of efficiency, economic and environment friendliness compared to the reference methodology...|$|E
40|$|Recover a {{historic}} center means {{the recovery of}} a culture in its concrete historicity and its specific value, relocating the single element {{in the fabric of}} relations within which it was, in its time, conceived. Through the conservation, rehabilitation and restoration of the urban <b>fabric</b> of ancient <b>formation</b> can also affect, in a positive sense, in relationship community-environment. The proposed case concerns the city of Toulon, which, in many respects, has characteristics not dissimilar to many coastal towns and ports of the Mediterranean. The intent is to emphasize, for the purposes of enhancement, contents that, taken together, constitute the characteristic profile and unrepeatable. The analysis, carried out through the use of paths centered on the historic center of the city, starting from the road system, we analyze the monuments, squares, building types, decorative elements and colors. The study develops the concept of reading of the detail as co-author in the perception of the environment and tended to emphasize the richness and the diversity of the cultural and historical heritag...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} recent {{advances}} {{referring to the}} use of sol-gel processes and layer by layer (LbL) treatments for conferring multifunctional features to cellulosic fabrics (namely cotton and its blends with polyester). In fact, these two approaches, which have been successfully applied to both natural and synthetic fabrics, can be very effective in providing multifunctional features to the treated <b>fabrics,</b> through the <b>formation</b> of a ceramic - or polymer /ceramic-based coating (sol-gel), or by depositing a nanostructured organic, inorganic or hybrid assembly (LbL) on the underlying textile. Sol-gel is based on a bottom-up strategy, starting from different precursors, from which it is possible to tailor the final surface properties of the treated substrates. Conversely, layer by layer exploits a top-down method, suitable for the design of very thin and, at the same time, performing coatings. Among the different possible multifunctional properties the two approaches can provide to cellulosic substrates, fire retardancy, hydrophobicity, wear resistance and anti-bacterial activity seem to fulfill the up-to-date needs coming from either the academic or industrial world. This work thoroughly reviews the development and the recent advances achieved by the two strategies, showing their potentialities and current limitations...|$|R
40|$|A 2. 2 mm {{open-ended}} coaxial probe {{is selected}} {{to explore the}} broadband measurement of complex permittivity ranging from kHz up to GHz. The measurements are conducted in three different frequency ranges, i. e., high frequency (HF, 500 MHz ~ 20 GHz), medium frequency (MF, 10 MHz ~ 1 GHz), and low frequency (LF, 1 kHz ~ 15 MHz), in view of pertinent aperture admittance models, feasible measurement principles, and required calibrations for system biases. These considerations are discussed and described in turn from the high frequency measurements to low frequency tests. Verification of the associated measurement techniques in the three operating frequency regimes is provided by experiments on pure ethanol and methanol liquids {{as well as on}} NaCl solutions of different concentrations. These testing techniques are also applied to measure the broadband dielectric spectrum of kaolinite slurry; simple analyses focusing on subtracting the influence of DC conductivity and multiple relaxations are presented. A complex permittivity spectrum from 1 kHz to 3 GHz is measured in kaolinite sediment of different structures using the slim-form open-ended coaxial probe. The sediment structure is manipulated by changing the pore-fluid pH. When the pH is below the isoelectrical point of the edge surface, IEPedge, the structure of face-to-edge (EF) flocculation is promoted in voluminous sediment (Group A samples). A higher dielectric constant due to bulk water polarization is measured because of the higher water content. As the pH is increased to greater than IEPedge, dense sediment with face-to-face (FF) aggregation is produced (Group B samples) and a lower dielectric constant is obtained. In bound water and spatial polarization, higher relaxation strength and longer relaxation time are observed in the Group B samples, which can be attributed to more negatively charged surfaces and denser packing. Fluid conductivity dominates the global conductivity of the sediment in the Group A samples so that the β value, i. e., the ratio between the conductivities of the sediment and the fluid, is smaller than 1. The β value is greater than 1 in the Group B samples owing to an overcompensation of surface conduction. Sedimentation behavior of two kaolinite samples with distinct fabric associations is characterized using mechanical and electromagnetic wave-based techniques. The two different <b>fabric</b> <b>formations,</b> the edge-to-face (EF) flocculated structure (i. e., sample A) and the dispersed and deflocculated structure (i. e., sample B), were regulated by changing the pH of the pore fluid and are produced. The anisotropy of shear wave velocity and DC conductivity was not observed in the sediment of sample A because of EF isotropic fabric associations but it was detected in sample B as a result of face-to-face (FF) aggregation. An open card-house structure of the sample A sediment results in a higher relaxation strength of the bulk water, ΔKw owing to a higher water content; the smaller ΔKw measured in the sample B sediment indicates denser packing. In both samples, sediment consolidation gives rise to a decrease in the bulk-water relaxation strength but an increase in the bound-water relaxation strength owing to increasing particle content. In response to sediment consolidation, the sediment conductivity of sample A continuously decreases because of the reduced contribution from the fluid conductivity. In sample B, the surface conduction via the overlapped double layer overcompensates such a decreased contribution so that the sediment conductivity increases with increasing particle content. The slim-form open-ended coaxial probe is also used to conduct a local dielectric measurement. The measured results, i. e. dielectric relaxation strength of bulk water, ΔKw, and the DC conductivity of the saturated sample, σmix, are jointly used to characterize the spatial variability of different specimens including glass beads, sand and mica samples, and kaolinte sediments with two different fabric associations. The pore distribution along the sample depth can be reflected from the measured ΔKw, and the local porosity can be estimated based on the mixing rules. The directional feature of the interconnected pores is captured in the totruosity which is derived from the measured σmix. In the kaolinite sediments, the ratio between the sediment and the pore-fluid conductivity not only reveals the spatial variability of the sediment packing but also the relative contribution of the fluid conductivity and surface conduction to the global sediment conductivity...|$|R
