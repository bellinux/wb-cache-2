40|$|Public policy {{debates about}} the risks of new {{technologies}} and substances often hinge on statistical tests of scientic hypotheses. Such tests have the appearance of mechanistic rules but in fact require subjective judge-ment and interpretation. Particular interpretations developed originally for experiments in agricultural research after WW <b>I</b> have <b>become</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>as</b> standard scientic practice across the social and biomedical sciences. Among other aws, these standards ignore the consequences of potential errors of statistical inference, consequences which may be uneven in their distribution, impacts and durations. To begin to redress this situation, the authors propose the use of a form of Dialectical Argumentation, such as Habermas's Discourse Ethics, to frame debate over errors of statistical inference in areas of environmental and health risk. If applied, such a framework could enable wider and more eective democratic participa-tion in risk debates and better understanding by non-experts of the issues involved. Such understanding in turn could lead to greater appreciation of the extent of subjective interpretation and judgment involved in scientic assessments of risk. ...|$|R
