In this paper, we develop the three step method used to assess the environmental impacts of organic spreading using the LCA approach in order to ecodesign organic spreaders (building technological indicators, establishing a link between these indicators and nitrogenous emissions, and assessing fuel consumption of tractors during all the spreading processes). We achieve a LCA study for 45 spreading scenarios and compare <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of spreading machines according to the main LCA environmental impacts.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the {{influence}} of corporate environmental responsibility (CER) and national environmental standards on the location choices of the 600 biggest European firms. By using the environmental score provided by Vigeo, we are able to test the influence of the <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of firms. We find a negative interaction effect between these <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> and national <b>environmental</b> regulations. Thus, we argue that national standards can be a substitute for CER. All things being equal, firms with better <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> tend to be located in dirtier countries. CER can therefore be seen as an answer to the location choices of firms which invest in countries with poor environmental policies. This result is only valid when considering de facto environmental standards, not de jure environmental standards. It suggests a possible strategic behavior of firms which exploit these differences between formal environmental regulations and their effective enforcement...|$|R

Nevertheless, according to the 2014 <b>Environmental</b> <b>Performance</b> Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented.

40|$|International audienceLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a {{methodology}} to assess <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of products throughout their life cycles. Traditionally, LCA-based decision-making focuses on environmental impacts, excluding customer expectations and economic considerations. Moreover, it usually uses generic data while <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of industrial systems often depend on local contexts. The {{aim of this}} paper is to provide a comprehensive framework to identify the solution most adapted to a specific context, considering environmental, economic and commercial aspects. First, <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of competing products are compared thanks to LCA. A sensitivity analysis highlights influential parameters on which operational scenarios are built. Costs are then incorporated into a set of exploitation scenarios. Second, matrix-based approach is used. Products are ranked according to several client profiles. The most suitable solution for a given context is identified. This framework is applied on three burners for forge furnaces. Results show that client profiles and operational contexts (namely client expectations, location and resources availability and costs) affect choices...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{following}} the technological progress in {{wood processing industry}} and {{the increased use of}} wood-based products in construction industry, the scientific community has investigated the <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of wood-base building materials and their substitution potential of energy-intensive material. The article describes and comments the results of a representative sample of LCA studies, most of them published in international journals or in free access research reports. All analyzed LCA studies compare wood, as a building system, with other materials and construction technologies (such as reinforced concrete, steel and masonry); these studies highlight the potential of wood-based building materials to improve the <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of construction industry besides the possible negative aspects related to the wood product manufacturing and the construction process. Some methodological limits are considered comparing LCA results among selected studies, because of the variability of the case studies, the subjectivity of the system boundary definition and the differences between the referenced data sources. However the comparative purpose of this analysis provides an interesting framework of the current research and highlights how timber buildings and wood-based products could still improve their <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> during all life cycle stages. Wood, as construction material, could increase its competitiveness in building industry thanks to its <b>environmental</b> <b>performances,</b> starting from its renewable source and its carbon storing potential...|$|R

40|$|End of life tires require sound {{accounting}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> to design sustainable procedures for material recovery. Their use in rubber modified asphalt provides {{could lead to}} the improvement of technical and <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of asphalt roads, but the effectiveness of simplified procedures is to be proved. During LIFE+ project ROADTIRE, a rubber modified asphalt road prototype, with the upper surface layer containing 10 % crumb rubber in the bituminous binder, was implemented in Lamia, Greece. The prototype was compared to a conventional asphalt road by Life Cycle Assessment to evaluate the <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> and the results were critically interpreted to highlight its benefits. The impact categories considered, assessed with the ReCiPe Midpoint (H) v 1. 06 /Europe ReCiPe H method, were: Climate change, Ozone depletion, Human toxicity, Photochemical oxidant formation, Terrestrial acidification, Freshwater eutrophication, Freshwater ecotoxicity, Terrestrial ecotoxicity, Water depletion, Fossil depletion. Compared to the conventional asphalt road, the global <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of the rubberized asphalt road are improved of 30 - 40 %, depending on the impact category. For both scenarios, the road construction phase, with bitumen production, is the most impacting process, compared to maintenance and end-of-life. The global environmental advantages are proved to depend on the longer lifetime and the less maintenance required for the rubberized asphalt road, as indicated from laboratory tests. It is therefore important to monitor such parameters during the road lifecycle in order to validate this preliminary outcome. Based on these results, policy and management implications are discussed. © 2015, Gh. Asachi Technical University of Iasi. All rights reserved...|$|R
