5|$|The site, a {{steeply sloping}} {{hillside}} between a main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works and goods yard for more than a century. High-density housing was built {{at the same time and}} surrounded the railway buildings. From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard were closed and demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of <b>derelict</b> <b>land</b> which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. Site clearance work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Funded by a <b>Derelict</b> <b>Land</b> Grant, the {{engineering}} consultants Binnies {{carried out a}} feasibility study in 1994, which concluded that full restoration was possible. A new administrative structure for the project was created in 1997, when the Sleaford Navigation Trust was formed, and the Navigation Society was disbanded. The Trust has continued to work on restoring the structures of the canal, campaigning successfully to prevent the Navigation Warehouse from being demolished in 1998. The local council organised funding {{for the restoration of}} the warehouse and the former offices of the canal company in 2002, and Lincolnshire County Council funded a further study which looked at how to provide an adequate water supply for a re-opened canal. The former seed warehouse now forms part of The Hub, housing the National Centre for Craft and Design, which is supported by the Arts Council {{and is one of the}} leading centres for the promotion and exhibition of international craft and design in the UK.|$|E

The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not <b>derelict</b> <b>land.</b> One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. In 1984 Salford City Council used a <b>derelict</b> <b>land</b> grant to {{purchase}} the docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined {{to such an extent}} that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.|$|E

London's docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by containerization and the shipping industry moved to deep-water ports such as Tilbury and Felixstowe.

40|$|Goal, Scope and Background. Efficient and {{environmentally}} friendly technologies for soil reclamation require {{efforts to develop}} innovative processes. Alternative technologies to drastic techniques (containment, total removal of soil) are receiving increasing interest. They are based either {{on the use of}} ameliorants (e. g. lime, fertilizer, organic mulch) and more recently on the spreading of organic wastes (e. g. compost, sewage sludge). This paper presents a new process of soil construction using wastes and industrial by-products which are formulated and stacked in layers to build a new soil profile over in situ degraded substrates. Work was conducted to assess the feasibility of the ecological reclamation, focusing on the major functions of constructed Technosols. Materials and Methods. Two large lysimetric plots (10 x 10 in) were built on a former coking plant, and two strategies of constructed soil profiles were compared: i) a control soil using thermally treated industrial soil available in situ, and ii) a constructed soil with a combination of thermally treated industrial soil mixed with exogenous materials such as green waste compost and paper mill sludge. Rainfall was measured periodically, drainage effluent was collected, and aliquots were sampled per plot. Plants were collected in 8 replicates for each plot. Results. Water balance data showed that about 10 % of the rain water percolated through the constructed soil profiles. Drainage effluent contained a low concentration of contaminants, below the French water drinking standards. Plants grew without any deficiency symptoms on both plots. Apart from the sowed plants, indigenous species developed on the constructed Technosols. Discussion. The experimental set-up was representative of the real conditions for the implementation of such reclamation technologies. In spite of the significant concentrations of trace elements in the parent materials, the fluxes in the drainage effluent were very low because of the high pH. Significantly higher biomass values were recorded on the constructed soil than on the control, as well as a better development of indigenous plants. Conclusions. The constructed soils are examples of Technosols as they are made exclusively of technogenic parent materials. Our results showed that they can behave like natural soils (water cycle, trace elements filtration, biomass production). The process of soil construction is not only an efficient way to reclaim <b>derelict</b> <b>lands,</b> but also a safe alternative for the recycling of wastes and by-products with a minimum use of unpolluted and fertile agricultural soil. Recommendations. The restoration of soil functions, thanks to the soil construction process, must be considered as a primary step for the ecological reclamation of <b>derelict</b> <b>lands.</b> In this way, the pedo-engineering approach should be considered as {{an essential part of the}} global ecological engineering for the reclamation of <b>derelict</b> <b>lands.</b> Perspectives. Two major outlooks appear: i) testing a larger variety of wastes and by-products as parent materials for different constructed soils, ii) generalize the results on constructed soils to the characterization of Technosols...|$|R
25|$|While {{there are}} no plans to build motorway-standard flank of the ring road at {{national}} government level, Glasgow City Council have recently published new plans for what it calls the Glasgow East End Regeneration Route (EERR). This would appear not to be a motorway, but instead an urban corridor which will connect the M74 extension at Polmadie with the M8/M80 at Provan. While the Council has openly voiced its commitment to the plan, it will likely face considerable controversy since its path will dissect the suburbs of Bridgeton, Carntyne and Parkhead making use of <b>derelict</b> <b>land</b> and an abandoned railway embankment. As of summer 2013, phases 1 and 2 of the project from the M74 to Parkhead have been completed. Phase 3 from Parkhead Forge to the M80 at Provan is scheduled for completion in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Within Chesterfield, {{the river}} was navigable, as the Chesterfield Canal joined the river {{and used it to}} access basins on the western bank. The first basin was {{connected}} to the river near Wharf Lane footbridge, but the coming of the railway severed the link, and a new basin was constructed {{to the north of the}} Brimington Road bridge in 1890. The canal company were not authorised by their Act of Parliament to use the river, but did so despite that. This stretch of the river forms part of a £300 million redevelopment project called Chesterfield Waterside, which will provide housing and amenities in an area which is currently <b>derelict</b> <b>land.</b> The project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site.

At the expense of Staffordshire, Worcestershire grew slightly in 1926 to allow for the construction of the Priory Estate on land which was mostly situated in Sedgley.

500|$|Together with British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association and the Waterway Recovery Group, the Society {{began the}} work of {{restoration}} of the canal to navigation, a process which is still ongoing.

The task was completed by a number of Waterway Recovery Group workcamps. New gates were fitted to the top three locks, and rebuilding of Casthorpe bridge was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, opening up [...] of the canal for navigation. Further down the canal, restoration of a [...] section between Hickling Basin and Hose was funded by a <b>derelict</b> <b>land</b> grant of £400,000, received in 1993. The Grantham Canal Partnership was formed in 1997, as a way to take the project forwards. It consisted of representatives from each of the six local authorities through which the route passes, British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Grantham Canal Restoration Society and the Grantham Navigation Association, a group which had split off from the Canal Society in 1992. As a result of the co-operation, British Waterways formulated a draft business plan for the canal.|$|E
500|$|According to author Thomas Telfer, by {{the turn}} of the 1970s, the town of Gateshead was {{suffering}} from [...] "the classic symptoms of decay in its inner-city areas". The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic <b>derelict</b> <b>land</b> reclamation and environmental improvement. While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town, Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration. One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium, where the council believed that investment might raise the region's profile and bring international recognition. In April 1974, Gateshead Council inaugurated a [...] "Sport and Recreation" [...] department. In July 1974, the council appointed Brendan Foster—a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of Tyne and Wear—as the Council's sport and recreation manager. Foster, who according to Gibson became [...] "the father of Gateshead athletics", had been forced to train in Edinburgh during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track. In December 1973, he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two-mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace. At this reception, Foster was told that a new synthetic track was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium. His response was a promise that, if the Council was serious, he would run at the stadium and break a world record (Foster later offered an explanation of that promise: [...] "You know how it is when you've had a few drinksyou promise the world!"). When the track was laid in early1974, Foster became convinced of the Council's sincerity. He was interviewed for the managerial position and, upon appointment, became the [...] "driving force" [...] behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium, which included the building of the main, covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981 and three accompanying stands; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium. This first tranche of improvements cost around £8million, and Foster's proposal to commemorate the re-opening with an athletic event was approved, allowing for the first [...] "Gateshead Games" [...] to be held in 1974.|$|E
