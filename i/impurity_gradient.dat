40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} {{of the impact of the}} tree rings seen in the candidate sensors of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) on galaxy-shape measurements. The tree rings are a consequence of transverse electric fields caused by circularly symmetric <b>impurity</b> <b>gradients</b> in the silicon of the sensors. They effectively modify the pixel area and shift the photogenerated charge around, displacing the observed photon positions. The displacement distribution generates distortions that cause spurious shears correlated with the tree-rings patterns, potentially biasing cosmic shear measurements. In this paper we quantify the amplitude of the spurious shear caused by the tree rings on the LSST candidate sensors, and calculate its 2 -point correlation function. We find that 2 -point correlation function of the spurious shear on an area equivalent to the LSST field of view is order of about $ 10 ^{- 13 }$, providing a negligible contribution to the 2 -point correlation of the cosmic shear signal. Additional work is underway, and the final results and analysis will be published elsewhere (Okura et al. (2015), in prep. ...|$|R
40|$|Impurity {{transport}} {{driven by}} electrostatic turbulence is analyzed in weakly collisional tokamak plasmas using a semianalytical model {{based on a}} boundary layer solution of the gyrokinetic equation. Analytical expressions for the perturbed density responses are derived and {{used to determine the}} stability boundaries and the quasilinear particle fluxes. For moderate impurity charge number Z, the stability boundaries are very weakly affected by the increasing impurity charge for constant effective charge, while for lower impurity charge the influence of impurities is larger, if the amount of impurities is not too small. Scalings of the mode frequencies and quasilinear fluxes with charge number, effective charge, impurity density scale length, and collisionality are determined and compared to quasilinear gyrokinetic simulations with GYRO resulting in very good agreement. Collisions do not affect the mode frequencies, growth rates, and impurity fluxes significantly.

40|$|Density {{profiles}} {{for a light}} impurity, boron, {{are reported}} for internal transport barrier (ITB) discharges in Alcator C-Mod. During the ITB, the light <b>impurity</b> <b>gradient</b> steepens because the impurity pinch increases relative to diffusion. The ITB-induced impurity profile steepening is at approximately the same major radius as that for the main-ion profile. Neoclassical transport does not describe the light impurity profiles but transport is closer to neoclassical in the ITB region. In previous work on C-Mod, profiles of seeded heavy impurities (introduced by puffing) peaked during the ITB, but a marked difference between transport of heavy and light impurities has been reported for other tokamaks. With the addition of light impurity profiles described here, the ITB on C-Mod is shown to share additional profile traits with the ITB on other tokamaks. This confirms that the macroscopic features of the C-Mod ITB {{are similar to those}} on other devices although it leaves open the details of the onset of the ITB. PACS numbers: 52. 25. Fi, 52. 25.

It is essential to have predictive tools to simulate the constitutive behavior of the materials at this length scale taking into account the physical and statistical size effect.

The effect of the impurities on the structural, electrical and optical properties of the grown crystal is also discussed.

The delineation which is accomplished partly by surface attack and partly by sLaining may be markedly enhanced by a subsequent oxidation. Thus, the combination of electrolytic etch-ing and oxidation {{has been found to}} be successful for the delineation of all junctions of practical interest. Furthermore, the existence of doping inhomogeneities can be revealed by this technique. Figure 3 shows an angle lap of an n-type pitaxial SiC layer on an n-type substrate. It is clearly seen that there are impurity striations in the substrate whereas the doping of the epitaxial layer is uniform. In conclusion, it can be stated that the thermal oxidation of silicon carbide is a useful tool for polytype discrimination.

40|$|With the {{enormous}} growth of high performance computing (HPC) {{over the last}} few decades, plasma physicists have gained access to a valuable instrument for investigating turbulent plasma behaviour. In this thesis, these tools are utilised for the study of particle transport in fusion devices of the tokamak variety, focusing in particular on the transport of impurities. The transport properties of impurities is of high relevance for the performance and optimisation of magnetic fusion devices. For instance, the possible accumulation of He ash in the core of the reactor plasma will serve to dilute the fuel, thus lowering fusion power. Heavier impurity species, originating from the plasma-facing surfaces, may also accumulate in the core, and wall-impurities of relatively low density may lead to unacceptable energy losses in the form of radiation. In an operational power plant, such as the ITER device, both impurities of low and high charge numbers will be present. This thesis studies turbulent impurity transport driven by two different modes of drift wave turbulence: the trapped electron (TE) and ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes. Principal focus is on the balance of convective and diffusive impurity transport, as quantified by the <b>impurity</b> density <b>gradient</b> of zero flux (“peaking factor”, PF).

40|$|Diffusion of {{impurities}} {{against the}} direction of gas flow can be {{a significant source of}} contamination in the ultrapure gas systems. The mechanism and the kinetics of impurity transport due to back-diffusion is studied both experimentally and theoretically. A model is developed to simulate the process and calculate the extent of impurity transport due to back-diffusion. Experiments for measuring oxygen back-diffusion i a nitrogen carrier stream are conducted. The data and the model predictions are in good agreement. Back-diffusion i volves both bulk and surface diffusion and is higher for lower pressures, lower flow rates, larger tube diameters, and for smaller nonadsorbing molecules. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the level and complexity of component integration on a single semi-conductor chip. Volume production of 1 Gbit DRAM devices is expected by the year 2003. 1 To meet his expecta-tion, the semiconductor industry faces difficult echnologi-cal challenges. A critically important area is understanding and controlling impurity transport in gas delivery s stems, in various ystem components and finally, in process tools. We focus here on the phenomenon f impurity back-dif-fusion, also known as retrodiffusion i ultrahigh purity gas lines. Impurity back-diffusion refers to the penetration of an impurity against he direction of bulk gas flow and is due to the large <b>impurity</b> concentration <b>gradients</b> in the gas phase near the tube wall and on the tube surface. Several practical examples of back-diffusion are shown in Fig. 1. One common example is in purging a high purity gas into room air; oxygen and moisture have high potential of diffusing back into the gas lines against he purge flow. Another example is when a system component such as a valve or a mass-flow controller is on the delivery line feed-ing high purity gas into a reaction vessel. The back-diffu-sion of reaction products from the vessel may lead to con-tamination and corrosion of the component upstream...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) column is capable of enrichment/pre-concentration of trace impurities in the mobile phase during the column equilibration, prior to sample injection and elution. These <b>impurities</b> elute during <b>gradient</b> elution and result in significant chromatographic peaks. Three types of purified water were tested for their impurity levels, and hence their performances as mobile phase, in HPLC followed by total ion current (TIC) mode of MS. Two types of HPLC-grade water produced 3 - 4 significant peaks in solvent blanks while LC/MS-grade water produced no peaks (although peaks were produced by LC/MS-grade water also {{after a few days}} of standing). None of the three waters produced peaks in HPLC followed by UV-Vis detection. These peaks, if co-eluted with analyte, are capable of suppressing or enhancing the analyte signal in a MS detector. As it is not common practice to run solvent blanks in TIC mode, when quantification is commonly carried out using single ion monitoring (SIM) or single or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM or MRM), the effect of co-eluting impurities on the analyte signal and hence on the accuracy of the results is often unknown to the analyst. Running solvent blanks in TIC mode, regardless of the MS mode used for quantification, is essential in order to detect this problem and to take subsequent precautions.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{has been}} constructed, {{similar to that}} of G. Hertz[3], making use of the difference in the thermal velocities of molecules of different weight to separate the isotopes of a gas. The problems of design and their solution are discussed in detail. Data are given to show the separation and equilibrium time of apparatus of several types, when used to separate mixtures of various initial concentrations of hydrogen and nitrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and carbon dioxide and argon. Mass spectrometer measurements on the end-products of a separation process performed on the neon isotopes, with an apparatus containing fourteen mercury diffusion pumps, show the separation to be the same as for mixtures of carbon dioxide and argon, for which the mass ratio, 44 : 40, {{is the same as the}} 22 : 20 ratio of the neon isotopes. Separation processes performed with an apparatus of twenty-four pumps on carbon dioxide-argon mixtures reveal that the separation factor [...] i. e., the ratio of the relative abundance of the heavy gas at one end of the system to its relative abundance at the other end, when equilibrium has been reached [...] and the equilibrium time are practically independent of the initial mixing ratio of the components. Hertz' approximate theory of the diffusion apparatus is extended to permit the calculation of the "enrichment factor" [...] i. e., the ratio of the relative abundance of the heavy gas at the "heavy" end of the system, after equilibrium is reached, to its relative abundance in the gas initially admitted to the system. The effects of <b>impurities,</b> viscosity, pressure <b>gradients</b> in the system, and insufficient pumping speed are discussed quantitatively. Work done on methane, to concentrate C 13, and on nitrogen, to concentrate N 15, is described. Photographs of the band spectra of C 2, CN, and N 2 are given which show isotope bends of sufficient intensity to make possible quantitative mass measurements on the rare isotopes C 13 and N 15. Methane has been produced containing 16...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} results {{carried out on}} Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU) {{with the use of}} Liquid Lithium Limiter (LLL) show that the presence of lithium impurity can give rise to an improved particle confinement regime in which the main plasma constituents are transported towards the core whereas the impurity particles are driven outwards. The aim of our research was to further investigate this process using gyrokinetic simulations with the GKW code to calculate the particle flux in FTU-LLL discharges, and to provide a physical explanation of the above phenomena with a simplified multi-fluid description. The fluctuations in the FTU tokamak are dominantly electro-static (ES), magnetic perturbations are expected to be important in high beta tokamak plasmas, such as those in the Mega Amp`ere Spherical Tokamak (MAST). The effects of impurities on the electro-magnetic (EM) terms of turbulent particle transport are investigated in a typical MAST H-mode discharge. The first chapter of the thesis is dedicated to provide an understandable but thorough introduction to the gyrokinetic equation and the code GKW. It summarizes the concept of the Lie- transform perturbation method which forms the basis of the modern approach to gyrokinetics. The gyrokinetic Vlasov–Maxwell system of equations including the full electro-magnetic perturbation is derived in the Lagrangian formalism in a rotating frame of reference. The simulation code GKW is briefly introduced and the calculation of the particle fluxes is explained. In the second chapter the FTU-LLL and MAST experiments are introduced and the gy- rokinetic simulations of the two discharges are presented. It is shown that in an ES case the ITG driven electron transport is significantly reduced at high lithium concentration. This is accom- panied by an ion flow separation in order to maintain quasi-neutrality, and an inward deuterium pinch is obtained by a sufficiently high <b>impurity</b> density <b>gradient.</b> The EM terms are found to be negligible in the ion particle flux compared to the ExB contribution even at relatively high plasma beta. However, the EM effects drive a strong non-adiabatic electron response and thus prevent the ion flow separation in the analyzed cases. The third chapter provides a detailed description of a multi-fluid model that is used to gain insight into the diffusive, thermo-diffusive and pinch terms of the anomalous particle transport. It is based on the collisionless Weiland model, however, the trapped electron collisions are introduced (Nilsson & Weiland, NF 1994) in order to capture the micro-stability properties of the gyrokinetic simulations. The model is compared with analytical and numerical results in the two-fluid, adiabatic electron and large aspect ratio limits, showing good qualitative agreement. In the fourth chapter the fluid analysis of the FTU-LLL discharge is presented. It is shown that the inward deuterium pinch is achieved by a reduction of the diffusive term of the ITG driven main ion flux in presence of lithium impurities. The ITG mode responsible {{for the majority of the}} radial particle transport has been found to be the only unstable eigenmode rotating in the ion diamagnetic direction. Eigenmodes associated with the deuterium and lithium temperature gradients can be separately obtained when the Larmor-radius of the two ion species are more distinct, in which case the effect of lithium on the main ion transport is reduced and the inward deuterium flux is weaker...|$|R
