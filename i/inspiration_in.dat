5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin {{was concerned about the}} impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E

5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} several {{significant}} works of modern literature. Her romantic attachment with Pericles has inspired {{some of the}} most famous novelists and poets of the last centuries. In particular the romanticists of the 19th century and the historical novelists of the 20th century found in their story an inexhaustible source of <b>inspiration.</b> <b>In</b> 1835 Lydia Maria Child, an American abolitionist, novelist, and journalist, published Philothea, a classical romance set in the days of Pericles and Aspasia. This book is regarded as the most successful and elaborate of the author's productions, because the female characters, especially Aspasia, are portrayed with great beauty and delicacy.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative <b>inspiration.</b> <b>In</b> later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E

5|$|Dean's other {{dream is}} a major {{turning point in the}} character's storyline, after which he starts gaining self-respect and realizes that he truly wants to live. He begins the season with little self-worth, and the writers {{realized}} that this outlook stems from his father, John Winchester. Initially, they planned to have Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprise his role as John, who would browbeat Dean within the dreamscape. When they learned that Morgan was busy filming Watchmen, the writers instead found <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> the junkyard scene from the film Superman III, in which good and evil versions of Superman confront one another. Kripke noted, however, that the conversation between the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{is usually}} {{considered}} the great master of Catalan Modernism, but his works go beyond any one style or classification. They are imaginative works that find their main <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> nature. Gaudí studied organic and anarchic geometric forms of nature thoroughly, {{searching for a}} way to give expression to these forms in architecture. Some of his greatest inspirations came from visits to the mountain of Montserrat, the caves of Mallorca, the saltpetre caves in Collbató, the crag of Fra Guerau in the Prades Mountains behind Reus, the Pareis mountain in the north of Mallorca and Sant Miquel del Fai in Bigues i Riells.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Washington D.C. to {{establish}} the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved {{to be too much}} for him and he dropped out of the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political <b>inspiration.</b> <b>In</b> Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to exhibitions of the Four Freedoms by Rockwell, {{there have been}} tribute exhibitions of works by other artists depicting these themes. For example, in 2008 at the Wolfsonian museum at Florida International University, 60 artists exhibited 80 works that represented their takes on the Four Freedoms. Other artists, such as Thomas Kinkade, have found individual <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> Rockwell's patriotic works, resulting in their own works using different symbols to present similar themes.|$|E
5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> Achaemenid art, as exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Timess Agustin Gurza {{described}} {{the creative process}} between the pair as Chan creating the instrumental first, followed by Chana crafting the lyrics and melodies alongside him. Chana based her lyrics on her previous relationships and break-ups, while Chan found <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> the music of Manu Chao. Chana reported that she had some difficulties during the production process due to the personal nature of the lyrics. Although she {{said that it was}} more challenging to write lyrics in Spanish, Chana expressed a preference for it as she felt that it was more poetic than English. She often consulted a Spanish-English dictionary to translate her ideas.|$|E
50|$|Dashwood {{grew up in}} Boronia, {{a suburb}} of Melbourne, Victoria. Dashwood has an older brother named Jake, who {{introduced}} her to wrestling.

5|$|Casino da Póvoa is a gaming and {{entertainment}} venue since the 1930s. In 2006, {{it was the}} second casino in revenues, with 54 million euros and the third most popular with 1.2 million customers.

5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Boyd Rice was {{influenced}} by the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture. Z'EV cited Christopher Tree (Spontaneous Sound), John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Tim Buckley, Jimi Hendrix, and Captain Beefheart, among others together with Tibetan, Balinese, Javanese, Indian, and African music as influential in his artistic life. Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of musique concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited a long list of obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti and Miles Davis's On the Corner. Many industrial groups, including Einstürzende Neubauten, took inspiration from world music.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as a student, Gaudí was able to study a {{collection}} of photographs of Egyptian, Indian, Persian, Mayan, Chinese and Japanese art owned by the School of Architecture. The collection also included Moorish monuments in Spain, which left a deep mark on him and served as an <b>inspiration</b> <b>in</b> many of his works. He also studied the book Plans, elevations, sections and details of the Alhambra by Owen Jones, which he borrowed from the School's library. He took various structural and ornamental solutions from nazarí and mudéjar art, which he used with variations and stylistic freedom in his works. Notably, Gaudí observed of Islamic art its spatial uncertainty, its concept of structures with limitless space; its feeling of sequence, fragmented with holes and partitions, which create a divide without disrupting the feeling of open space by enclosing it with barriers.|$|E
50|$|In {{the same}} year that Øidne {{published}} the article, the first election survey in Norway was held, administered by the Norwegian Institute of Social Research in conjunction with the Norwegian parliamentary election of 1957. <b>Inspirations</b> <b>in</b> addition to Øidne include Paul Lazarsfeld et al.'s book The People's Choice.|$|R
