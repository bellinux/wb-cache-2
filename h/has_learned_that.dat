5|$|In Cold Blood is {{situated}} in Volgia, a fictional state {{on the east coast}} of the former USSR. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Dmitri Nagarov, chief of intelligence and security, took the opportunity to overthrow existing powers and declared independence. After his coup, Volgia started to invade its neighbors. The Volgian Freedom Fighters (VFF) is a resistance movement that is run by Gregor Kostov. The VFF <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the Volgians have acquired some special technology and has informed the Americans. They sent a spy named Kiefer to investigate, but communications were lost while he was investigating a uranium mine.

25|$|A {{series of}} {{political}} attacks were reportedly staged against {{him by the}} Serbian lobby in BiH who tried to discredit and remove him from the political scene. One attempt was made by Vojislav Šešelj in the early 1980s, who <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{one of the students}} of Pozderac at the University of Sarajevo, plagiarized portions of his dissertation, but was not punished for by Pozderac. Because the student Brano Miljuš, was a high-ranking individual within the Communist party, controversy ensued but Šešelj's efforts were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|After {{meeting with}} Pizarro, Rocco reenters and tells Fidelio that Pizarro {{will allow the}} marriage, and Fidelio will also be {{permitted}} to join Rocco on his rounds in the dungeon (Nun sprecht, wie ging's?—"Speak, how did it go?"). Rocco and Fidelio prepare to go to Florestan's cell, {{with the knowledge that}} he must be killed and buried within the hour. Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the prisoners were allowed to roam, and is furious (Ach, Vater, Vater, eilt!—"O, father, father, hurry!").|$|E
25|$|The BMW i3 has two pedals {{like all}} cars with {{automatic}} transmission. The accelerator pedal acts as both accelerator and engine brake. When the driver releases the pedal, the vehicle's kinetic energy is regenerated by the vehicle drivetrain to recharge the battery. This {{has the effect}} of slowing the car down. During the field testing of the Mini E, which features an accelerator that recharges the battery in this way, and consists of brakes that only apply to the rear wheels, BMW <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> drivers tend to rely on the engine brake: around 75% of all deceleration maneuvers are initiated without the brake pedal in urban traffic areas. BMW also expected the i3 to use the same type of battery and powertrain that is being tested in the BMW ActiveE trials.|$|E
25|$|Belle <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{the monster}} that took Robin was a Fury. Someone had used magic in Camelot to save Robin {{and did not}} pay the price, which is a life, and the monster has arrived to collect Robin's soul as payment. It {{will return to the}} Underworld when the moon reaches its zenith, but can be stopped if someone gives their life in his place. Regina confronts Emma, believing that she had summoned the Fury, but Emma reveals that Regina was the one {{responsible}} for its appearance. That night near the pond, the Fury begins pulling out Robin's soul, and Charon the boatman appears as the moon reaches its zenith. Regina sacrifices herself for Robin, and is joined by Mary Margaret, David, Leroy and Arthur. As all five band together, they successfully pull Robin from the Fury (and since the price of a single soul was equally divided among them), which disappears back into the underworld with Charon. While everyone celebrates this latest victory at Granny's, a worried Mary Margaret notes that if they win, Emma will lose. At Granny's, Henry introduces himself to Violet again and shows her what a jukebox is, and plays the same song he had played in Camelot, which, somehow, seems familiar to her. At her house, Emma opens the locked door and goes downstairs, at the behest of Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, revealing the stone with the sword Excalibur in it. Rumplestiltskin, the manifestation of her darkness, says that she can make it whole again and use it to vanquish all of the light forever. Emma tries to pull the sword from the stone but fails, being repelled by the sword's magic. After this failed attempt, the Dark One taunts her, and tells her that in order to complete the task, she will have to pay the price, and it will cost someone dearly.|$|E
60|$|But Nebuchadnezzar {{required}} another lesson. He <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the God of the Jews was wiser {{than all}} the planets and heavenly lords and gods whom the Babylonian magicians consulted; he <b>had</b> not <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> that same God of the Jews was the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth. He <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the God of heaven favoured him, and had helped him toward his power and glory; but he thought that {{for that very reason}} the power and glory were his own--that he had a right over the souls and consciences of his subjects, and might make them worship what he liked, and how he liked.|$|R

500|$|Coward {{completed}} a one-act satire, The Better Half, about a man's relationship with two women. It {{had a short}} run at The Little Theatre, London, in 1922. The critic St John Ervine wrote of the piece, [...] "When Mr Coward <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> tea-table chitter-chatter had better remain the prerogative of women he will write more interesting plays than he now seems likely to write." [...] The play {{was thought to be}} lost until a typescript was found in 2007 in the archive of the Lord Chamberlain's Office, the official censor of stage plays in the UK until 1968.|$|E

They {{formulate}} a plan to recover the shard {{and use it to}} revive Megatron. Long Haul captures men who may know Mikaela's location, who are then interrogated by Starscream. Starscream is able to discover Mikaela's location, and he sends Long Haul to retrieve her. Starscream receives word that the Decepticon troops transporting Mikaela have been intercepted by the Autobots. [...] In the wake of defeat, the Decepticons learn of another shard held by American armed forces which is retrieved.|$|E

Carol <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Harge is petitioning the judge to consider a [...] "morality clause" [...] against her, threatening to expose her homosexuality and give him full custody of Rindy. She decides to take a road trip to escape {{the stress of the}} divorce proceedings and invites Therese to join her. Richard accuses Therese of being infatuated with Carol and predicts Carol will soon tire of her. The two argue and their relationship comes to an end. On the second night of the trip, Therese meets a traveling salesman, Tommy Tucker.|$|E

500|$|Season five {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Martha and Lionel. Both Annette O'Toole and Al Gough said Lionel was slightly attracted to Martha, but {{that she would never}} act on that feeling. The producers had no intentions to create a romantic relationship between the two characters. Most of Lionel's motivations in season five are shrouded in mystery. Glover said he could not determine whether his character is good or bad, so when he is portraying him in season five he tried to present everything as if it was [...] "good". Glover said he believes Lincoln Cole's (Ian Tracey) actions in [...] "Mercy" [...] made Lionel rethink everything his past behavior and his own character. By the end of the fifth season, Lionel <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> people have a responsibility to each other.|$|E
500|$|With Elizabeth's death, James VI becomes {{ruler of}} both England and Scotland. James is distrustful of [...] "witchbreed" [...] (people born with magical powers and the mutants of this reality) and collaborates with Spanish High Inquisitor Enrique {{to blame the}} witchbreed of England, headed by Carlos Javier, for Elizabeth's death. Fury, a friend of Carlos and his students, is forced to take the witchbreed to the Tower. Strange, Javier, and Fury meet there and discuss how {{to save the world}} — an act which will almost surely lead to them being branded traitors by James. Strange <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the {{treasure}} of the Templars and its keeper Donal, and Murdoch, have been betrayed and are {{now in the hands of}} Doom. Strange also learns that Doom has been holding captive four heroes from the ship Fantastick, including Fury's friend Sir Richard Reed. Knowing that James will never give him an army to march on Latveria, he conspires with the witchbreed, taking a ship levitated by Javier and his page John Grey across the continent.|$|E
500|$|Most of the glee club <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Puck (Mark Salling), not Finn (Cory Monteith), is {{the father}} of Quinn's baby. They hide this fact from Rachel (Lea Michele), believing that she will tell Finn. Emma takes over as faculty advisor of the club as they start working on their set list for sectionals. With two group songs selected, Rachel says that she'll sing the solo ballad; Mercedes (Amber Riley) strenuously objects to this, and sings [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] to wild applause. Rachel agrees that Mercedes deserves to sing the solo and the two hug. Meanwhile, Rachel has deduced that Puck {{impregnated}} Quinn and tells Finn; he attacks Puck and confronts Quinn, who tearfully admits the truth. Angered by their betrayal, Finn quits the club on the eve of sectionals, and has to be replaced by school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman). New Directions arrive at the event to discover their competitors have received an advance copy of their set list, and are performing all three of their chosen songs. Emma calls Will, who convinces Finn to help his New Directions teammates. Will finds Finn in the locker room, and talks to him about how special he is and that the club needs him.|$|E

500|$|The Covenant {{board the}} Autumn; {{deprived}} of defensive options, the Autumns captain, Jacob Keyes, tells {{the crew to}} abandon ship. The Master Chief is entrusted with the artificial intelligence Cortana; given the wealth of tactical information the A.I. contains, Keyes cannot allow Cortana to fall into enemy hands. The Master Chief leaves for the surface of Halo in a lifeboat; other soldiers, including a squad of shock troops led by Antonio Silva and his second-in-command, Melissa McKay, land by special drop pods, and take a strategic bluff from the Covenant {{to use as a}} base of operations. Captain Keyes is captured by the Covenant, and taken aboard the Covenant cruiser Truth and Reconciliation; the Master Chief and a squad of Marines board the Truth and Reconciliation, rescuing the captain. Keyes <b>has</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the ringworld they are on has vast significance to the Covenant- they believe that [...] "Halo", as they call the ring, is a weapon of unimaginable power. Escaping from the Covenant cruiser, Keyes gives the Master Chief the mission of finding the Control Room of Halo before the Covenant. The Master Chief and Cortana discover the location of the Control Room, {{and with the help of}} some Marines, insert Cortana into Halo's computer network. However, Cortana realizes that the ring is not a weapon as they understood at all- but before the Chief can press her with questions, Cortana tells the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes.|$|E

However, in an aria (Pietà, rispetto, amore / [...] "Compassion, honour, love") he contemplates {{the fact that he is}} already hated and feared: there will be no compassion, honour and love for him in his old age even if he wins this battle, nor kind words on a royal tomb, only curses and hatred. He receives the news of the Queen's death with indifference. Rallying his troops he learns that Birnam Wood has indeed come to his castle. Battle is joined.|$|E

2500|$|Quicksilver {{appears in}} the films [...] (2014) and [...] (2016), played by Evan Peters.

Director Bryan Singer shot all of Quicksilver's scenes in 3,600 frames per second. Returning in Apocalypse, Quicksilver takes on a much larger narrative role, rescuing almost the entire student body of the Xavier School single-handedly from an explosion caused when Havok accidentally destroys the X-Jet with a blast aimed at Apocalypse.
