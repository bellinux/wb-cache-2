Phytoplankton biomass increased with total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and decreased with submerged macrophyte cover across the three regions. Generic richness was significantly negatively related to submerged macrophyte cover and related environmental variables. Zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratios were positively related to submerged macrophyte cover and negatively to phytoplankton generic richness in DK and BNL, suggesting that the low generic richness in lakes with submerged macrophytes was due to a higher zooplankton grazing pressure in these regions. In SP, phytoplankton generic richness was not influenced by zooplankton grazing pressure but related to conductivity. We observed no relationship between phytoplankton generic richness and TP concentration {{in any of the}} three regions. The three regions differed significantly with respect to mean local and regional generic richness, with BNL being more diverse than the other two regions.

A brief introduction describes the current world wide status of {{organic production}} and consumption.

Organic dairy farming is very developed within DK, whereas it is only just beginning in NZ. The Danish experiences are used to define scenarios for future development within NZ. These scenarios are modelled in the Lincoln Trade and Environment Model (LTEM), resulting in estimates of NZ dairy producer returns derived from a shift towards organic production. Assumptions on development within NZ's main trade partner countries – United States, European Union and Japan – are included in the modelling. The LTEM modelling shows how the NZ dairy sector could benefit overall from some conversion to organics. Even very conservative estimates of organic consumption and consumers' preference for organic dairy products result in increases in NZ organic and total producer returns. We argue, therefore, that {{it is important for the}} NZ dairy sector to commit itself towards organic production and signal this to the NZ dairy farmers...|$|E

We assessed taxon richness {{of a large}} variety of food-web components at different trophic levels (bacteria, ciliates, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, macro-invertebrates, and water plants) in 98 shallow lakes from three European geographic regions: <b>Denmark</b> (<b>DK),</b> Belgium/The Netherlands (BNL), and southern Spain (SP). Lakes were selected along four mutually independent gradients of total phosphorus (TP), vegetation cover (SUBMCOV), lake area (AREA), and connectedness (CONN). Principal-components analysis (PCA) indicated that taxon diversity at the ecosystem level is a multidimensional phenomenon. Different PCA axes showed associations with richness in different subsets of organism groups, and differences between eigenvalues were low. Redundancy analysis showed a unique significant contribution to total richness variation of SUBMCOV in all three regions, of TP in DK and SP, and of AREA in DK and BNL. In DK, several organism groups tended to show curvilinear responses to TP, but only one was significantly hump shaped. We postulate that the unimodal richness responses to TP that are frequently {{reported in the literature}} for many organism groups may be partly mediated by the unimodal response of macrophyte vegetation to lake productivity.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{increased}} attention {{has been devoted to}} the utilisation and excretion of phosphorus (P) in pig farming. In The Netherlands (NL), restrictions on manure P application have been introduced, and since the mid- 1980 s, NL has focused intensively on research aimed at reducing P excretion. In <b>Denmark</b> (<b>DK),</b> such systematic research was not initiated until the beginning of the 1990 s. As a result, the P loss per pig produced is lower in NL than in France (F) or DK. The loss amounts to 1. 3, 1. 0 and 1. 2 kg per produced standard pig in NL and DK, respectively. Most of the P consumed is not retained in the pig's body, but is excreted with faeces and urine. The mean excretion amounts to 70, 52 and 64 % of the P intake in sows, weaners and growing pigs, respectively. The reasons for such low P utilisation can be related to two major causes. First, the dietary P digestibility is low, and second, the dietary P recommendations may be too high. The low P digestibility is the dominant problem and applies to all pig categories, whereas inaccurate recommendations are mainly an issue in sow feeding.

RESULTS: The mean change in 24 -h EE from before to after treatment did not differ significantly between groups (92 +/- 586 and 86 +/- 512 kJ/ 24 h for the L- 796568 and placebo groups, respectively). The change in 24 -h nonprotein respiratory quotient from before to after treatment did not differ significantly between groups (0. 009 +/- 0. 021 and 0. 009 +/- 0. 029, respectively). No changes in glucose tolerance were observed, but triacylglycerol concentrations decreased significantly with L- 796568 treatment compared with placebo (- 0. 76 +/- 0. 76 and 0. 42 +/- 0. 31 mmol/L, respectively; P < 0. 002). Overall, treatment-related changes in body composition were not observed, but higher plasma L- 796568 concentrations in the L- 796568 group were associated with greater decreases in fat mass (r = - 0. 69, P < 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with L- 796568 for 28 d had no major lipolytic or thermogenic effect but it lowered triacylglycerol concentrations. This lack of chronic effect on energy balance is likely explained by insufficient recruitment of beta(3) -responsive tissues in humans, down-regulation of the beta(3) -adrenergic receptor-mediated effects with chronic dosing, or both.

This deliverable provides a “synthetic report on international meetings at which [we have] presented on the development of the curriculum framework for vocational training in digital curation”. We had the opportunity to describe the work of DigCurV at more than eight events. The eight events described here provide an indication of the audiences that we reached through our presentations and our discussions—there were other venues we could have included. The communities included Libraries, archives and information education sectors, digital preservation and information researchers and practitioners, and specialists in digital humanities and the preservation and access to the cultural heritage. Several of these meetings brought together key influencers, decision makers and education leaders in fields from information management to cultural studies.
