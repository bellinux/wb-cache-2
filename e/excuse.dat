The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{representation}} of <b>excuses</b> {{in the context of}} multiagent systems. We distinguish five classes of <b>excuses,</b> taking as starting point both jurisprudential and philosophical studies about this topic, and we discuss their acceptance criteria. We highlight the following classes of excuses: epistemic <b>excuses,</b> power-based <b>excuses,</b> norm-based <b>excuses,</b> counts as-based <b>excuses</b> and social-based <b>excuses</b> and we represent them using social dependence networks. The acceptance criteria individuate those <b>excuses</b> which success in maintaining the trust of the other agents, e. g. in the context of social networks, <b>excuses</b> based on norms seem better than counts as-based ones in achieving this aim. ...|$|R

5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful <b>excuse</b> defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful <b>excuse</b> within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|The College found a patroness in Mary I, {{although}} {{it must have}} been embarrassing for both sides, after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival Lady Jane Grey to the throne. When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later, first in Cheapside then in Fleet Street by two heralds, trumpets blowing before them. However, when popular support swung to Mary's side, the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms, two other heralds, and four trumpeters returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary's ascension as rightful queen instead. The College's <b>excuse</b> was that they were compelled in their earlier act by the Duke of Northumberland (Lady Jane's father-in-law, who was later executed), an <b>excuse</b> that Mary accepted.|$|E

40|$|The {{distinction}} between justifications and <b>excuses</b> is a much-debated topic in legal doctrine. Justifications {{are said to}} negate the wrongfulness of the act; <b>excuses</b> negate the blameworthiness of the actor. This article discusses the (moral and legal) significance of distinguishing between justifications and <b>excuses</b> and explores the value this dichotomy has for international criminal law...|$|R
40|$|Tort law {{has little}} {{patience}} for <b>excuses.</b> Criminal law is more forgiving. It recognizes complete <b>excuses</b> such as duress and provocation, {{as well as}} <b>excuses</b> that temper punishment. <b>Excuses</b> are also commonplace in ordinary morality. Like criminal law and morality, tort law seems concerned with holding persons accountable for their wrongs, and <b>excuses</b> seem to go hand-in-hand with accountability. So why—or in what sense—are torts inexcusable wrongs? This Article explains how tort law, understood as law that enables victims to hold wrongdoers answerable to them, cogently can refuse to recognize <b>excuses.</b> In doing so, it offers a unified account of many of tort law’s core features, including the objectivity of negligence law’s ordinary care standard, the courts’ insistence on injury {{as a condition of}} liability, and the strictness of certain forms of tort liability. More generally, it invites us to broaden our understanding of what it means for law to identify conduct as wrongful, and for law to set up schemes for holding wrongdoers accountable...|$|R

40|$|Can the state, {{as opposed}} to its {{individual}} human members in their personal capacity, intelligibly seek to avoid blame for unjustified wrongdoing by invoking <b>excuses</b> ({{as opposed to}} justifications) ? Insofar as it can, should such claims ever be given moral and legal recognition? While a number of theorists have denied it in passing, the question remains radically under-explored. In this article (in its penultimate draft version), I seek to identify the main metaphysical and moral objections to state <b>excuses,</b> and begin to investigate their strength. I work from the ecumenical assumption that general understandings of modern states as group moral agents proper or as mere fictional points of imputation for individual behavior are both plausible, and {{that the question of}} state <b>excuses</b> should be asked in terms of both paradigms. Issues addressed include: the lack of state consciousness/affect, the nature and relevance of developmental and executive defects in group agents, the value of state interests and how interests relate to plausible claims of <b>excuses,</b> the shortfall of responsibility argument for group responsibility and its interface with state <b>excuses,</b> the symbolic and consequential (dis) value that state <b>excuses</b> may have, as well as concerns that states are entities that should live up to outstandingly high virtuous standards of impartiality and equanimity. I conclude that even if the range of <b>excuses</b> available to states does not overlap neatly with <b>excuses</b> available to ordinary individuals, some <b>excuses</b> may still be morally available to states. More generally, I emphasize the need for a systematic discussion of group <b>excuses</b> writ large, and of their relationship with the wider question of when group entities may legitimately be singled out to bear adverse normative consequences for wrongdoing...|$|R

Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an <b>excuse</b> to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
