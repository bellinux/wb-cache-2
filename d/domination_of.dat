Let G be {{a simple}} graph of order n, the vertex <b>domination</b> {{polynomial}} <b>of</b> G is the polynomial D 0 (G, x) = ∑n i=γ 0 (G) d 0 (G, i) xi, where d 0 (G, i) {{is the number of}} vertex dominating sets of G with size i, and γ 0 (G) is the vertex <b>domination</b> number <b>of</b> G.

5|$|In the Early Middle Ages, {{from the}} end of the 4th century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the {{territory}} of the Kings of the Burgundians. The Alemanni settled the Swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps in the 8th century, forming Alemannia. Modern-day Switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of Alemannia and Burgundy. The entire region became part of the expanding Frankish Empire in the 6th century, following Clovis I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504 AD, and later Frankish <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> the Burgundians.|$|E
5|$|Like the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, Salamis {{has gained}} {{something}} of a 'legendary' status (unlike, for instance, the more decisive Battle of Plataea), {{perhaps because of the}} desperate circumstances and the unlikely odds. A significant number of historians have stated that Salamis {{is one of the most}} significant battles in human history (though the same is often stated of Marathon). In a more extreme form of this argument, some historians argue that if the Greeks had lost at Salamis, the ensuing conquest of Greece by the Persians would have effectively stifled the growth of Western Civilization as we know it. This view is based on the premise that much of modern Western society, such as philosophy, science, personal freedom and democracy are rooted in the legacy of Ancient Greece. Thus, this school of thought argues that, given the <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> much of modern history by Western Civilization, Persian <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> Greece might have changed the whole trajectory of human history. It is also worth mentioning that the celebrated blossoming of hugely influential Athenian culture occurred only after the Persian wars were won.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} history of medieval Karnataka spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that {{evolved in the}} Karnataka region of India made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of Tamilakam over the Vengi region; and the <b>domination</b> <b>of</b> the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins {{of the rise of}} the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi, the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of Kannada in addition to the official Sanskrit. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.|$|E
