40|$|A firm {{understanding}} of how the human visual system recognises and categorises objects is important in order to build a successful cognitive vision system. We have reviewed the relevant literature both on visual object recognition <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> (chapter 1). Based on this review and the technical annex of this project we have addressed several topics in a series of psychophysical experiments, focusing on structural aspects of recognition memory, object similarity in the context of categorisation, shape transformations in categorisation, the role of context in recognition <b>and</b> <b>categorisation,</b> <b>and</b> the interplay between object motion <b>and</b> shape for <b>categorisation</b> decisions (chapter 2). Based on our psychophysical results we present our view on recognition <b>and</b> <b>categorisation,</b> proposing an integrative framework that serves as a theoretical basis for a computational recognition system grounded in cognitive research (chapter 3) ...|$|R

The importance {{of being able to}} recognise an individual at risk of compromised skin integrity and being able to implement timely and effective, evidence-based measures to prevent skin breakdown cannot be overstated.

40|$|Quick and {{successful}} recognition <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> {{of a potential}} social or sexual partner as well as dangerous predators is an essential ability for each animal. Creation of categories and cognitive processes {{required to do so}} are of great importance to uderstanding to cognition of other species than human. This thesis aims primarily on categorisation experiments using pigeons. Recognition <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> might be exercised via a concept (a mental representation). Exercise of this highly evolved approach in pigeons is a subject of a dispute.

It answers what type of concept is utilised and introduces a conclusion of pigeons having a concept and an ability to exercise it. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To assess initial {{experience}} {{with the use of}} a new single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) in the evaluation of lesions. Methods: The folder number, radiopharmaceutical used and type of scan of patients examined with a new Siemens T 6 SPECT-CT between 02 April 2016 and 31 December 2013 were retrieved. The number of 99 mTc-MDP bone scans was sufficient for a detailed analysis. The scans were re-processed and reported by the observer before he was given any clinical information. Whole body planar, whole body planar plus SPECT and whole body planar plus SPECT-CT images were assessed successively in three separate sessions at least 2 weeks apart. At each session, the certainties of detection, localisation <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> of each lesion were recorded. Results: A total of 539 lesions were seen on the whole body, SPECT and computed tomography (CT) images in 133 patients. The whole body images showed no lesions in 3 patients and 378 lesions in 130 patients. SPECT detected 122 additional lesions in 79 patients. Thirty-nine (12. 2 %) lesions were seen only on CT in 32 (24. 1 %) patients. For the 261 lesions seen on the planar images in the SPECT field of view, lesion detection was definite in 233 (89. 3 %), localisation definite in 151 (57. 9 %) <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> definite in 123 (47. 1 %) lesions. On the SPECT, definite lesion detection, localisation <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> were recorded, respectively, for 259 (99. 2 %), 228 (87. 4 %) and 176 (67. 4 %) of the 261 lesions. Lesion detection, localisation <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> certainties were definite for 100 %, 99. 1 % and 94. 7 % of the SPECT-CT lesions, respectively.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{representation}} <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> of old age and elderly care and their changes in media discourse of daily newspaper Blesk. Theory focuses on definitions of elderly and description of seniors and practices of elderly care in the Czech Republic. It describes changes of old age discourse {{in connection with the}} development of social policy and expert knowledge. It describes the concepts of representation <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> <b>and</b> their possible impacts in the form of stigmatisation, stereotyping and ageism. It discusses media as resources of symbolic power, ideology and discourse and sets out media representation of elderly. Related empirical part is based on qualitative discourse analysis of articles from Blesk in years 2007 and 2011. It discusses the outcomes with respect to changes of discourse and representation, stereotypes and active old age. It distinguishes three types of senior representation - like normal, stigmatized and active. Thematic distribution and stigmatisation of elderly constructs symbolic subordination of elderly as a population category. Care is described only rarely and isn't offered as the solution of the elderly's frailty...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{tackle the}} problem of {{embedding}} a set of relational structures into a metric space for purposes of matching <b>and</b> <b>categorisation.</b> To this end, we view the problem from a Riemannian perspective and {{make use of the}} concepts of charts on the manifold to define the embedding as a mixture of class-specific submersions. Formulated in this manner, the mixture weights are recovered using a probability density estimation on the embedded graph node coordinates. Further, we recover these class-specific submersions making use of an iterative trust-region method so as to minimise the L 2 norm between the hard limit of the graph-vertex posterior probabilities and their estimated values. The method presented here is quite <b>general</b> in nature <b>and</b> allows tasks such as matching, <b>categorisation</b> <b>and</b> retrieval. We show results on graph matching, shape <b>categorisation</b> <b>and</b> digit classification on synthetic data, the MNIST dataset and the MPEG- 7 database. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|High-frequency {{words have}} been found to benefit speech {{segmentation}} (Bortfeld, Morgan, Golinkoff, & Rathbun, 2005) <b>and</b> grammatical <b>categorisation</b> (Monaghan, Christiansen, & Chater, 2007) - possibly simultaneously (Frost, Monaghan & Christiansen, 2016). Previous studies have tested the effect of high-frequency words on language acquisition by presenting them reliably within the experimental language, however natural language contains noise and variability that may provide further opportunities for robust learning (Monaghan, 2017). We tested the effect of variability on learning by familiarising adults with continuous speech comprising repetitions of target words, which were preceded by one of two high-frequency marker words 100 %, 67 %, or 33 % of the time, with marker words distinguishing targets into two categories. Participants completed speech segmentation <b>and</b> <b>categorisation</b> tests, followed by a cross-situational word learning task where the same target words present in the continuous speech were mapped onto referents from two different grammatical categories. There was a clear advantage of variability: the 67 % group performed best on measures of segmentation, <b>categorisation,</b> <b>and</b> learning the meaning of words in the cross-situational learning task. The data indicate that variability can help learners to use the same high-frequency words to inform both speech segmentation <b>and</b> grammatical <b>categorisation...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper a {{theoretical}} discussion is presented regarding the fundamental concept of similarity and its relation to cue abstraction <b>and</b> <b>categorisation.</b> It is maintained that similarity is by definition context-dependent and strongly interrelated to cue abstraction <b>and</b> <b>categorisation.</b> Emphasis is given to determining the “musical surface ” that can act as a musically pertinent lowest level of abstraction on which similarity between musical entities can be measured. Then, each of these concepts is examined in more detail with respect to a number of research studies presented in the recent special issue of Musicæ Scientiæ on musical similarity (Discussion Forum 4 A, 2007). Views claiming that a geometric piano-roll-like representation is the most appropriate choice for polyphonic pattern matching, or that musical repetition is structurally significant if at least fifty percent of a pattern is equivalent (i. e. if it is more similar than dissimilar), or that “dramatic disparities ” between musical similarities and corresponding categories can be found in empirical studies, are critically re-examined with a view to clarifying the fundamental concept of similarity...|$|R
