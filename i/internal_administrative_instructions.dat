5000|$|The United Nations Secretariat, in April 2010, {{pursuant}} to Secretary-General's bulletin ST/SGB/2002/5, promulgated United Nations Staff Selection System <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> (ST/AI 2010/3) dated 22 April 2010. [...] <b>Administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> ST/AI 2010/3 supersedes and abolishes the <b>administrative</b> <b>instructions</b> titled [...] "Staff selection system" [...] (ST/AI/ 2006/3/Rev.1), [...] "Technical cooperation personnel and OPAS officers" [...] (ST/AI/297 and Add.1), and [...] "Movement of staff from the Field Service category to the Professional category" [...] (ST/AI/360/Rev.1 and Corr.1). The new <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> {{will remain in}} effect [...] "until specifically amended or abolished". ST/AI 2010/3 applies to all appointments up to the D-2 level that have contracts of 1 year or longer. It excludes appointments at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General levels, temporary appointments, and appointment of staff selected through a competitive examination.|$|R
5000|$|Affirmative {{measures}} to achieve gender {{equality in the}} UN system are contained in <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> ST/AI/1999/9, [...] "Special Measures for the Achievement of Gender Equality". This remains in force, and is listed under the heading Appointments, placement and promotion in the Annual Index to Administrative Issuance along with the <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> on the Staff Selection System (ST/AI/2010/3). [...] Since 2010, the UN Secretariat has contended that section 13.3 of the new Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3) supersedes the <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> on gender equality (ST/AI 1999/9), especially its section 1.8 on affirmative action as it is inconsistent with 2010/3. Similar provisions for gender equality existed in earlier Staff Selection System <b>administrative</b> <b>instructions</b> (ST/AI/2006/3). However, {{it has been reported}} that <b>administrative</b> <b>instruction</b> addressing gender equality in the UN has become a more prominent issue since 2010 and has been implemented reluctantly with diminishing enthusiasm by UN entities. UN Women, in contrast, continues to affirm that ST/AI/1999/9 is in effect and applicable. [...] The Secretary General has also reiterated to the general assembly that ST/AI/1999/9 remains in effect.|$|R
40|$|For years, {{administrative}} {{law has been}} identified as the external review of agency action, primarily by courts. Following in the footsteps of pioneering {{administrative law}} scholars, a growing body of recent scholarship has begun to attend to the role of internal norms and structures in controlling agency action. This Article offers a conceptual and historical account of these internal forces as <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law. <b>Internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law consists of the internal directives, guidance, and organizational forms through which agencies structure the discretion of their employees and presidents control the workings of the executive branch. It is the critical means for shaping the discretion of officials and ensuring accountability within agencies. <b>Internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law’s binding status in structuring agency decision marks it as a form of law. This Article’s project is one of recovery more than invention. The decade-long debate culminating in enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) reflected consistent recognition of internal controls’ contributions to agency accountability. Despite this history, judicial enforcement of the APA undermined <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law and constrained its content by treating the agency’s articulation of internal norms that bind agency actors as triggering external judicial enforcement. At the same time, expanded White House control has made <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law more centralized. Given the importance of <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law to agency accountability and administrative legitimacy, {{the time has come for}} more sustained engagement with the idea of <b>internal</b> <b>administrative</b> law and measures to foster its development...|$|R

[...] The UN Secretariat since 2010, citing section 13.3 of the new Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3), has, some times, contended that provision of section 13.3 supersede Gender Equality A/I(ST/AI 1999/9), especially section 1.8 on affirmative action, as Gender A/I is inconsistent with 2010/3. UN Women, the agency designated to implement UN Gender Policy, however, continues to assert, including on its web site, that affirmative action for women remain in effect, {{and continues to be}} list it as applicable law. [...] The Secretary General has also affirmed to the general assembly, as noted above, that Gender A/I, remains in effect. As a result of the secretariat's reservation, and reluctance to implement gender A/I, it has been implemented with diminishing enthusiasm, and become a frequent cause of litigation.|$|R
