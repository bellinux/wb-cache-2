A competitor is given a set area of wood to cut, and a time limit, usually two minutes. Holding the saw at eye level, the competitor saws off successive disks, leaving previous cuts stacked {{on top of the}} log. The event is scored {{based on the number of}} whole disks left on top of the log at the time the competitor announces they are done. Time is used as a secondary tie-breaker. Performed well, it is not unusual for a competitor to cut in excess of 20 disks. During the event, the competitor is not allowed to manipulate the disks in any fashion other than sawing off additional disks.|$|E
50|$|Rain sensors for {{irrigation}} systems {{are available in}} both wireless and hard-wired versions, most employing hygroscopic disks that swell {{in the presence of}} rain and shrink back down again as they dry out — an electrical switch is in turn depressed or released by the hygroscopic <b>disk</b> <b>stack,</b> and the rate of drying is typically adjusted by controlling the ventilation reaching the stack. However, some electrical type sensors are also marketed that use tipping bucket or conductance type probes to measure rainfall. Wireless and wired versions both use similarmechanisms to temporarily suspend watering by the irrigation controller— specifically they are connected to the irrigation controller's sensorterminals, or are installed in series with the solenoid valve common circuit such that they prevent the opening of any valves when rain has been sensed.|$|E

40|$|A fast, {{regenerative}} {{light scattering}} signal from bovine ROS, the PA-signal, reflects the light-induced, transient activation of transducin. Its {{rate of recovery}} depends {{on the number of}} photolysed rhodopsin molecules, indicating that rhodopsin deactivation and not GTPase activity is rate limiting in our in vitro system. When rhodopsin deactivation is accelerated (in the presence of NH 2 OH), PA-signal recovery is also accelerated. A GTPase turnover number of more than 2 s− 1 (at 37 °C) can be derived from these experiments. This is more than one order of magnitude faster than the GTPase rates so far described in the literature and is rapid enough for a physiological shut-off mechanism.

With the growth of this class of biomolecules, significant thought on the most efficient downstream processing steps for monoclonal antibodies has been taken into the highly consideration by the manufacturer in order to obtain the highest yield with the highest purity of the product which is why the simulation study are crucial in this development. The objectives of this study are to propose the most suitable framework of downstream processing for monoclonal antibodies production in order to achieve highest purities of mAbs and to stimulate the propose framework using SuperPro Designer® simulator. The process was initially done via the <b>disk</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuge and followed by microfiltration in order to harvest the protein. Three column of chromatography (Protein A affinity, anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction) were used to obtain the highest purity of the therapeutic.

40|$|Olive oil {{extraction}} is mainly carried out using continuous extraction by decanter centrifuge with efficiency of approximately 80 – 90 %. After centrifugal extraction, olive oil is generally cleaned using a vertical disc stack centrifuge separator, which {{is suspected of}} being the major cause of decreased final olive oil quality. Experiments were carried out at industrial scale to compare the olive oil properties after improved processes of sedimentation (Sedoil) or centrifugation (Cenoil) with respect to raw olive oil obtained at the decanter exit (Control). Peroxide, polyphenol, chlorophyll, carotenoid, turbidity and K 232 average values were significantly different between Sedoil and Cenoil, which confirmed {{that the use of}} disc stack centrifuges represents an important source of oxidative reactions. Analysis showed that storage time dramatically affects the oxidation level of the olive oil. All parameters used to monitor the oxidation level (i. e., free acidity, peroxide value and K 232) increased after 180 d of storage, and the content of natural antioxidants and pigments decreased as expected. The residual presence of water during long-term storage represented the most important source of oxidation, and an effective cleaning operation is necessary to preserve oil quality during its storage life. The analyses performed using 1 H and 13 C NMR showed that Sedoil was more similar in composition to Control than to Cenoil. The use of sedimentation plant allows the employment of the <b>disk</b> <b>stack</b> centrifuge to be reduced improving both energy saving and the quality of clean olive oil...|$|E
50|$|In general, for {{a puzzle}} with n disks, there are 3n nodes in the graph; every node has three edges to other nodes, except the three corner nodes, which have two: {{it is always}} {{possible}} to move the smallest disk {{to one of the}} two other pegs; and it is possible to move one disk between those two pegs except in the situation where all <b>disks</b> are <b>stacked</b> on one peg. The corner nodes represent the three cases where all the <b>disks</b> are <b>stacked</b> on one peg. The diagram for n + 1 disks is obtained by taking three copies of the n-disk diagram—each one representing all the states and moves of the smaller disks for one particular position of the new largest disk—and joining them at the corners with three new edges, representing the only three opportunities to move the largest disk. The resulting figure thus has 3n+1 nodes and still has three corners remaining with only two edges.|$|R
50|$|The {{input of}} the clutch is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a shaft, chain, or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and clutch <b>disks</b> <b>stacked</b> together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|R

For the novel <b>stacked</b> <b>disk</b> resonator design, an analytical model for the frequency separation is derived and verified using finite element analysis. The model provides useful insight into the coupling mechanisms of two or more vertically <b>stacked</b> <b>disks</b> connected via a central stem. One unsuccessful and one incomplete fabrication trial is presented and analyzed. In addition, an analytical model for support losses adapted from a simple model for soil-structure interaction is investigated and found useful for estimating the support losses. The novelty of <b>stacked</b> <b>disk</b> resonator is vertical integration of devices previously only demonstrated integrated in-plane. Vertical integration allows smaller footprint. Although fabrication has yet proved unsuccessful, useful models have been developed and insight into the coupling mechanisms gained. Two different designs of the miniaturized microphones have been designed, fabricated and characterized. Both designs feature released membranes, but of different thickness. They are designed for high sensitivity at low frequencies. Compared to a similar microphone published in the literature, the microphones presented here feature a doubling and thirty fold improvement in sensitivity for the frequency range of interest for the two designs...|$|R
40|$|Current {{landing and}} braking systems are {{associated}} with the approach, flare and rollout. Automatic and independent brake systems prevent skidding but do not restore the aircraft to the original trajectory. None use the normal aerodynamic surfaces to augment braking effectiveness to steer the aircraft during sudden changes in runway surface conditions. Many aircraft accidents occur during landing. The task of bringing the aircraft to a safe taxing speed from touchdown in variable weather conditions is the most difficult manoeuvre that a pilot has to make. There is no opportunity to recover or reattempt the manoeuvre. It is the only phase of the aircraft operation that has not been effectively improved through the use of autopilot control systems. Improving this regime of operation through the use of formally redundant aerodynamic control surfaces {{is the subject of this}} thesis. This thesis describes the development and testing of a controller, auto-pilot and ABS combination that uses ailerons to control the normal loading differential between the main gear of a B 747 - 100 for the purpose of increasing the directional control so that is it possible to either minimising the centre line off-set or to maintain heading of a landing aircraft. The aileron based differential normal loading controller uses the brake line pressure differential as an input variable to control the ailerons during touchdown. During the maximum braking case, the brake line pressure is proportional to the difference in runway friction coefficient, normal loading, and brake <b>disk</b> <b>stack</b> friction coefficient. Landing aircraft are extremely non-linear in function. To overcome this, a model and controller that generates the appropriate non-linear mathematical description of the aircraft during the landing phase and generates an effective controller that effectively generates an increase in normal gear force on touch down of 100...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} the phase {{behavior}} of discotic molecules in various circum-stances. We first study the thermodynamics of disk-coil molecules. The system shows rich phase {{behavior as a}} function of the relative attractive strength of coils (A), the stacking interaction strength of disks (p), the number of coarse-grained monomers of the coil (Nc), and the reduced temperature (T*). At high T*, a disordered phase is dominant. At intermediate T*, lamellar, perforated lamellar, and cylinder phases appear as y and Nc are increased. At low T*, disks crystallize into ordered lamellar, ordered perforated lamellar, and ordered cylinder phases. We find that the confine-ment imposed on the disks by the attached coils strongly contributes to the ordered <b>stacking</b> of the <b>disks.</b> In particular, the ordered cylinder phase contains highly ordered <b>disks</b> <b>stacked</b> in parallel due to the cylindrical confinement of the coils that restricts the system to a single degree of freedom associated with the director vector of the disks.

In the present work, large eddy simulation (LES) and unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions are compared to other workers’ measurements from an engine representative test rig. The Smagorinsky-Lilly model was employed in the LES simulations, and the RNG k- turbulence model was used in the RANS modeling. Three test cases were investigated in a range of Grashof number Gr= 1. 87 to 7. 41 108 and buoyancy number Bo= 1. 65 to 11. 5. Consistent with experimental observation, strong unsteadiness was clearly observed in the results of both models; however, the LES results exhibited a finer flow structure than the RANS solution. The LES model also achieved significantly better agreement with velocity and heat transfer measurements than the RANS model. Also, temperature contours obtained from the LES results have a finer structure than the tangential velocity contours. Based on the results obtained in this work, further application of LES to flows of industrial complexity is recommended...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{coat protein}} of tobacco mosaic virus {{is known to}} form three {{different}} classes of aggregate, depending on environmental conditions, namely helical, disk, and A-protein. Among the disk aggregates, there are four-layer, six-layer, and long stacks, which {{can be obtained by}} varying the ionic strength and temperature conditions during the association process. The four-layer aggregate has been crystallized, and its structure solved to atomic resolution. The <b>stacked</b> <b>disk</b> aggregate had been presumed to be built of a polar two-layer disk related to the crystalline A and B rings. A study using monoclonal antibodies specific to the bottom surface of TMV protein demonstrated that the <b>stacked</b> <b>disk</b> aggregate is bipolar, and suggested that the repeating two-layer unit might be similar to the dihedrally symmetrical A-ring pair in the disk crystal. In this paper we present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the <b>stacked</b> <b>disk</b> aggregate obtained by electron microscopy of ice-embedded samples. After modeling of the structure, we found the ring pairs to have the same quaternary structure as the A-ring pair of the four-layer aggregate. The resolution achieved in the image processing of the electron micrographs is on the order of 9 Å in the meridional direction and 12 Å in the equatorial. The identification {{of the structure of the}} <b>stacked</b> <b>disk</b> with the A-ring pair of the disk crystal provides an explanation of the observation that the axial periodicity of the disk pair, which is ∼ 53 Å when fully hydrated, can shrink to ∼ 43 Å in the dry state...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel technique to precisely determine the Raman enhancement factor in single nanoplasmonic resonators (TNPRs). TNPRs are lithographically defined metallodielectric nanoparticles composed of two silver <b>disks</b> <b>stacked</b> vertically, separated by a silica layer. At resonance, the local electromagnetic fields are enhanced at the TNPR surface, making it an ideal surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrate. The ability to control {{the dimensions of the}} metallic and dielectric layers offers the unique advantage of fine-tuning the plasmon resonance frequency to maximize the enhancement of the Raman signal. Furthermore, by selective shielding of the outer surface of the metallic structure, the efficiency can be further enhanced by guiding the molecular assembly to the locations that exhibit strong electromagnetic fields. We experimentally demonstrate SERS enhancement factors of (6. 1 (0. 3) × 10 10, with the highest enhancement factor being achieved by using an individual nanoparticle. By using nanofabrication techniques, we eliminate the issues such as large size variations, cluster aggregation, and interparticle effects common in preparing SERS substrates using conventional chemical synthesis or batch fabrication methods. TNPRs produce very controllable and repeatable SERS signals at the desired locations and, thus, make an ideal candidate for device integration...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the properties of neutral hydrogen (HI) in 248 nearby (0. 02 30 mJy and for which optical spectroscopy is available. The observations were carried out with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope as the last large project before the upgrade of the telescope with phased array feed receivers (Apertif). The sample covers almost four orders of magnitude in radio power from P_ 1. 4 GHz= 22. 5 W Hz^- 1 and 26. 2 W Hz^- 1. We detect HI in absorption in 27 %± 5. 5 % of the objects. The distribution and kinematics of the absorbing HI gas appear to depend on radio power, the properties of the radio continuum emission, and the dust content of the sources. Among the sources where HI is detected, gas with kinematics deviating from regular rotation is more likely found as the radio power increases. In these cases, the HI profile is often asymmetric with a significant blue-shifted component. This is particularly common for sources with P_ 1. 4 GHz> 24 W Hz^- 1, where the radio emission is small, possibly because these radio sources are young. The same is found for sources that are bright in the mid-infrared, i. e. sources rich in heated dust. In these sources, the HI is outflowing likely under the effect of the interaction with the radio emission. Conversely, in dust-poor galaxies, and in sources with extended radio emission, at all radio powers we only detect HI distributed in a rotating <b>disk.</b> <b>Stacking</b> experiments show that in sources for which we do not detect HI in absorption directly, the HI has a column density that is lower than 3. 5 × 10 ^ 17 (T_ spin/c_f) cm^- 2.

40|$|Cryogenic Solid Propellants (CSP) are the {{propellants}} {{of choice}} {{when it comes}} to combining the advantages of solid and liquid propellants. CSP based solid rocket motors are as simple and as reliable as conventional solid monopropellant rocket motors while on the other side they deliver the same high specific performance that normally is only available when liquid bipropellants are used. The prize to be paid is of course that all the liquids have to be frozen and kept so until application. Most of High Energy Density Matter (HEDM) Propellants require permanent cooling anyway, rendering them as natural candidates for CSP technology. The paper focuses on Polynitrogens as examples of HEDM with chances of mid term application. The degree of "Greenness" of propellants can vary depending on various environmental and toxicological criteria. Using a figure of merit that combines these rather unrelated properties, the paper presents results of an evaluation of propellants that are more or less green with respect to these properties. For short term application, best bipropellants were based on H 2 O 2 as the overall winning oxidizer along with storable fuels such as Polyethylene. The CSP bipropellant sH 2 O 2 / Polyethylene was hence chosen for further experimental investigations towards a high thrust propulsion system.
