40|$|This study {{investigated}} the neural basis {{of the effect of}} gaze direction on facial expression processing in children with and without ASD, using event-related potential (ERP). Children with ASD (10 – 17 -year olds) and typically developing (TD) children (9 – 16 -year olds) were asked to determine the emotional expressions (anger or fearful) of <b>a</b> facial stimulus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direct or averted gaze, and the ERPs were recorded concurrently. In TD children, <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> congruent expression and gaze direction in approach–avoidance motivation, such as <b>an</b> angry <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direct gaze (i. e., approaching motivation) and <b>a</b> fearful <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> averted gaze (i. e., avoidant motivation), were recognized more accurately and elicited larger N 170 amplitudes than motivationally incongruent facial stimuli (<b>an</b> angry <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> averted gaze and <b>a</b> fearful <b>face</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> direct gaze). These results demonstrated the neural basis and time course of integration of facial expression and gaze direction in TD children and its impairment in children with ASD...|$|R

5|$|Prior to the {{expiration}} of the NEP in 1990, {{there was much}} debate over whether the policy should be renewed, replaced, or scrapped altogether.

5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command.

Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, convinced the Germans another landing had taken place there.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} {{consisted of}} about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island {{who had not yet}} accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. However, less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Resurrection was {{originally}} {{set for a}} Christmas 2004 release. However, Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games before the release for trademark and copyright infringement. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> threat of legal action, the project was publicly closed on September 6, 2004. According to the development team, the website of the project had received significant hits from Square Enix Japanese IP addresses {{for a period of}} three months before the letter issuing. They assumed these visits were mostly from employees rather than top executives, and hoped the company would see the demo as how the team sees it, a tribute to Chrono Trigger rather than a replacement.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient military experience, consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E

5|$|During the period, he also faced a Russian Bolshevik {{military}} action: {{just before}} Averescu came to power, as Russia's Leon Trotsky negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, the Rumcherod administrative body in Odessa, led by Christian Rakovsky, ordered an offensive {{from the east}} into Romania. In order to prevent further losses, Averescu signed his name to a much-criticized temporary armistice with the Rumcherod; eventually, Rakovsky was himself <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> German offensive (sparked by the temporary breakdown of negotiations at Brest-Litovsk), and had to abandon both his command and the base in Odessa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poor {{economy in}} 1974, Filipino President, Ferdinand Marcos {{implemented}} a labour code which began his country's export of labour {{in the form}} of overseas workers. The Philippine government encouraged this labour export to reduce the unemployment rate and enrich its treasury with the workers' remittances. The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export; in 1978 labour-export recruiting agencies were privatised, and became a cornerstone of the economy.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} the BBCAU {{detachment}} and 24th Brigade were <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> significant humanitarian challenge. The Allied air and naval attacks had destroyed {{almost all of}} the buildings on Labuan, rendering large numbers of civilians homeless. Within days of the invasion, about 3,000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead. The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians, and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies.|$|E

The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E

5|$|Puccini {{had long}} {{considered}} writing {{a set of}} one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lack of suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy Il tabarro and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera Suor Angelica. Gianni Schicchi, a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of Rossini, {{and it has been}} praised for its inventiveness and imagination.|$|E

5|$|The admirals, however, were {{reckoning}} {{without their}} sailors.
