By the time of the 14th edition of the Systema Naturae in 1784, there were fourteen. The 1819 Encyclopaedia Londinensis lists sixteen (see illustration <b>here</b> <b>of</b> three species) and by 1831 Adrian Haworth had described 150 species.|$|E

25|$|A railway {{crossing}} {{point in the}} area later called Ostkreuz was created in 1871 with the commissioning of the Ringbahn which crossed the tracks <b>here</b> <b>of</b> the Lower Silesian–Markish Railway, which was opened 1842, and the Eastern Railway, which was extended to Berlin in 1867.
