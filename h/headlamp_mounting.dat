2500|$|Headlamps {{must be kept}} {{in proper}} {{alignment}} (or [...] "aim"). Regulations for aim vary {{from country to country}} and from beam specification to beam specification. In the US, SAE standard headlamps are aimed without regard to <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height. This gives vehicles with high-mounted headlamps a seeing distance advantage, at the cost of increased glare to drivers in lower vehicles. By contrast, ECE headlamp aim angle is linked to <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height, to give all vehicles roughly equal seeing distance and all drivers roughly equal glare.|$|E
40|$|This {{nighttime}} {{field study}} addressed the relative visibility of retroreflective pavement markings from trucks and cars. To do that, both low-beam <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height and observer eye height were varied. The task involved detecting {{the presence of}} a strip of retroreflective pavement marking that was moved towards a stationary observer. The main finding is that <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height had a statistically significant effect on detection distance. Increasing the mounting height from the lowest tested level (0. 6 m) to the highest tested level (1. 2 m) resulted in a 19 % increase in detection distance. On the other hand, there was no effect of eye height over the range tested (1. 2 m to 2. 4 m). Because truck headlamps are generally mounted higher than car headlamps, the present findings imply that retroreflective pavement markings are more visible (and thus more effective) for truck drivers than car drivers. Furthermore, these findings are in support of higher <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height for all types of vehicles. However, higher <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> heights lead to more glare for both oncoming drivers and preceding drivers via rearview mirrors. Consequently, determining an optimal <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height would require a complex weighing of both visibility and glare considerations...|$|E

40|$|This study {{measured}} {{direct and}} rearview-mirror glare illuminances produced by low-beam headlamps {{in a sample}} of 22 passenger vehicles. The glare illumi-nances were measured for 12 common glare situations that were de ned by a full factorial combination of three scenarios (oncoming driver, center rearview mirror of a preceding driver, or driver-side mirror of a preceding driver one lane to the right), two longitudinal distances (25 m or 50 m), and two vertical locations (illuminated vehicle being either a car or a light truck/van/sport utility vehicle). The measurements were made outdoors at night on asphalt pavement. The median illuminances (not taking into account window transmittance or mirror re ectance) ranged from 0. 5 lux for an oncoming driver of a light truck/van/sport utility vehicle at a distance of 50 m, to 3. 4 lux at the driver-side mirror of a preceding car at 25 m one lane to the right. The ratios of the maxima and the minima measured for each of the 12 glare situations were large, ranging from about 5 : 1 to 36 : 1. The median actual illuminances were compared to the median expected illuminances based on a recent, laboratory-measured, representative sample of US low-beam patterns, taking into account the possible effects of dirt, voltage, misaim, and pavement re ectance. This analysis indicates that the actual illuminances could be very well modeled using the laboratory-measured beam patterns and assuming a linear relationship between the light output of clean and dirty headlamps. Additional analyses evaluated the relationships between <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> height and glare illuminance. 1...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{amount of}} light {{reflected}} from a retroreflective traffic sign decreases {{with an increase in}} the observation angle&mdash;the angle between the headlamp, the sign, and the eyes of the driver. Mainly because of the increased seated eye height of truck drivers, the actual observation angles are greater for them than they are for car drivers. Consequently, there is concern about the impaired night-time detection and legibility of retroreflective signs for truck drivers. The present study evaluated the relative {{amount of light}} reaching drivers of different types of vehicle by using survey data collected in 1989 by the Transport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) in England. The TRRL data included driver eye heights and <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounting</b> heights for 445 vehicles. The present analysis considered three sign locations on a straight roadway: left shoulder, centre, and right shoulder. Two viewing distances were included: 152 m (500 feet) (typical of a sign-legibility distance), and 305 m (1000 feet) (typical of a sign-detection distance). The analysis considered both the differential amount of illumination impinging on the signs from headlamps of trucks and cars, as well as the differential amount of the light reflected from the signs in the direction of truck drivers and car drivers. The main results are that for the viewing distance of 152 m, the amount of light reaching a truck driver can be as low as 25 % of the light reaching a car driver; the corresponding percentages for the viewing distance of 305 m are as low as 68 %. These reductions were then related to the expected effects on sign legibility and detection. The results imply that the increased eye height of truck drivers could have a major effect on the legibility of retroreflective traffic signs, but only a modest effect on their detection. ...|$|E

50|$|In 1976, at the Earl's Court Commercial Motor Show, the F2300 appeared. This model {{had been}} {{developed}} due to pressure from the British sales network, and DAF, seeing a sales potential in Europe as well, was happy to oblige. The facelifted 2300 received an all new front appearance, looking like a smaller version of the DAF 2800 (which is exactly what it was). The 2300 was available with two, three, or four axles. The new cab design was called the F220. It replaced the F2200, and soon thereafter a series of smaller variations appeared, replacing the old F218 cabs entirely. Either a short or a sleeper design were available. The heavier 2100 and up models have twin round headlights mounted down low, while the lighter F1600 and 1800 have single rectangular <b>headlamps</b> <b>mounted</b> in the bumper.|$|R

25|$|As {{with many}} large classes of locomotive, {{there were some}} {{variations}} during the Class 24s' lifetime, some affecting all of the class (nominally), and others just individual locos. One such locomotive was 24133, {{one of the last}} survivors of the class and easily recognised as it had different headcode boxes on each end, the standard one for the class at one end and that at the other end matching those used on the Class 27. This was not unique, as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s. In each case, this is likely to be due to collision damage repairs. Some Inverness-based locomotives had 'car lights' fitted to each nose. These were after-market car <b>headlamps</b> <b>mounted</b> in the plated-over nose doors, to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines. D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose. These were removed between 1975/6, with small plates welded over the apertures. 12 Class 26s had similar modifications, some having pairs and others having a single lamp. Examples of Class 37s, Class 47s and a solitary Class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the Class 24s and Class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps.|$|R
5000|$|Structurally it is {{generally}} an American design in its features, with the first dome being a sandbox, and the second being for steam. The firebox is located above the trailing axle. After the first four were completed, the design was modified, resulting {{in a slightly different}} appearance of the smokestack and the steam dome, and smoke deflectors were added. The tender is a four-axle type, running on two four-wheel bogies of American Bettendorf design. Four units, numbers パシシ981-パシシ984, were built in 1936 with partial streamlining, featuring a shroud on top of the boiler from the chimney to the cab, giving an appearance similar to the JNR's D51 22-23 locomotives. Further, they had a fully enclosed cab, a <b>headlamp</b> <b>mounted</b> at the centre of the smokebox door, and the idler wheels and tender wheels had roller bearings.

5000|$|A {{total of}} 50 {{identical}} experimental Turbine Cars were built between October 1963 and October 1964. Huebner {{referred to the}} experimental cars as uniquely designed. Each body was finished and shipped to Detroit and then the employees installed the gas turbine engines, Torqueflite transmissions, and electrical components to prepare the cars for use. There were 203 nationwide motorists - 23 of them women - who were chosen to test the uniquely designed automobiles. Suspension did not follow Chrysler's ubiquitous independent front longitudinal torsion bar system of the time, but rather featured contemporary designs using independent front suspension with a coil spring at each wheel. Rear suspension was more typical of Chrysler, with leaf springs and direct-acting shock absorbers.The Turbine Car is a two-door hardtop coupe with four individual bucket seats, power steering, air-over-oil power brakes, and power windows. Its most prominent design features are two large horizontal taillights and nozzles (back-up lights) mounted inside a very heavy chrome sculptured bumper. Up front, the single <b>headlamps</b> are <b>mounted</b> in chrome nacelles with a turbine styling theme which is carried through to the center console and the hubcaps. Even the tires were specially made with small turbine vanes molded into the white sidewalls. The body is finished in a metallic, root beer-colored paint dubbed [...] "turbine bronze". The roof is covered in black vinyl, and the interior features bronze-colored [...] "English calfskin" [...] leather upholstery with plush-cut pile bronze-colored carpet. Front suspension is upper and lower wishbones with coil springs and shock absorbers.|$|R
40|$|In 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{introduced an}} option of having headlamps labeled as visually/optically aimable (VOA). To be so labeled, the vertical gradient {{of the light}} output needs to meet certain minimum requirements. A concern with VOA lamps is that they might provide less light above the horizontal than conventional U. S. lamps, thus reducing the effectiveness of retroreflective signs. This study examined 36 first-generation VOA lamps, to assess the reduction of light above the horizontal. Furthermore, this study addressed the possibility of maintaining the status quo of light for sign visibility, by supplementing light from VOA lamps with light from either parking lamps or an auxiliary lamp mounted just above the driver. A comparison of the first-generation VOA lamps in our sample with marketweighted U. S. low beams from 1997 indicates that, {{on the right side}} of the beam pattern, just above the horizontal, the mean deficit from VOA lamps can reach 1, 400 cd per lamp. Two considerations lead to the conclusion that parking lamps will not be able to make up for this deficit. First, current U. S. requirements limit the output of parking lamps above the horizontal to no more than 125 cd. Second, the retroreflective geometry for parking lamps (i. e., the resultant observation angle) provides either no advantage or only a marginal advantage over <b>headlamps.</b> A lamp <b>mounted</b> on the roof just above the driver would provide a substantial advantage over headlamps in terms of retroreflective geometry, because the observation angles for such a lamp are smaller than for either headlamp. Taking into account this advantage, a single such lamp would need to have a peak intensity between 1, 500 and 2, 000 cd to make up for the deficit created by both VOA headlamps...|$|R
