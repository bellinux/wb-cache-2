2500|$|The terms {{scanning}} aperture and sampling aperture {{are often}} {{used to refer to}} the opening through which an image is sampled, or scanned, for example in a <b>Drum</b> <b>scanner,</b> an image sensor, or a television pickup apparatus. [...] The sampling aperture can be a literal optical aperture, that is, a small opening in space, or it can be a time-domain aperture for sampling a signal waveform.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, Russell A. Kirsch {{produced}} {{a device that}} generated digital data that could be stored in a computer; this used a <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> and photomultiplier tube.|$|E
50|$|Input {{was usually}} from {{high-end}} scanners, i.e. the Itek 310-I. From the Indigo/Crimson versions the Howtek D4000 (4000dpi) <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> was usually offered as an option. Version 7 supported both the D4000 and the D7500 (5000dpi) scanner.|$|E
50|$|While <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> {{are capable}} of {{scanning}} both reflective and transmissive artwork, a good-quality flatbed scanner can produce good scans from reflective artwork. As a result, <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> are rarely used to scan prints now that high-quality, inexpensive flatbed scanners are readily available. Film, however, is where <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> {{continue to be the}} tool of choice for high-end applications. Because film can be wet-mounted to the <b>scanner</b> <b>drum,</b> which enhances sharpness and masks dust and scratches, and because of the exceptional sensitivity of the PMTs, <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> {{are capable of}} capturing very subtle details in film originals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{situation}} [...] {{was that}} only a few companies continued to manufacture and service <b>drum</b> <b>scanners.</b> While prices of both new and used units dropped {{from the start of the}} 21st century, they were still much more costly than CCD flatbed and film scanners. Image quality produced by flatbed scanners had improved to the degree that the best ones were suitable for many graphic-arts operations, and they replaced <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> in many cases as they were less expensive and faster. However, <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> with their superior resolution (up to 24,000 PPI), color gradation, and value structure continued to be used for scanning images to be enlarged, and for museum-quality archiving of photographs and print production of high-quality books and magazine advertisements. As second-hand <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> became more plentiful and less costly, many fine-art photographers acquired them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>scanners</b> capture image {{information}} with photomultiplier tubes (PMT), {{rather than the}} charge-coupled device (CCD) arrays found in flatbed scanners and inexpensive film scanners. [...] "Reflective and transmissive originals are mounted on an acrylic cylinder, the <b>scanner</b> <b>drum,</b> which rotates at high speed while it passes the object being scanned in front of precision optics that deliver image information to the PMTs. Modern color <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> use three matched PMTs, which read red, blue, and green light, respectively. Light from the original artwork is split into separate red, blue, and green beams in the optical bench of the scanner with dichroic filters." [...] Photomultipliers offer superior dynamic range {{and for this reason}} <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> can extract more detail from very dark shadow areas of a transparency than flatbed scanners using CCD sensors. The smaller dynamic range of the CCD sensors, versus photomultiplier tubes, can lead to loss of shadow detail, especially when scanning very dense transparency film. While mechanics vary by manufacturer, most <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> pass light from halogen lamps though a focusing system to illuminate both reflective and transmissive originals.|$|R
50|$|Proscan 60030 â€” The Proscan 60030 is a {{precision}} <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> for printed copies and lantern slides of topographic and special-purpose maps and city schemes. It provides input with resolution {{of up to}} 600 dpi within the frame, geometrical precision. The scanner was developed in 1999 and 2000. More than 200 devices have been produced since 2000.|$|E
50|$|The 1000 {{system also}} {{featured}} an optional font editing package, allowing not only modification of existing fonts but {{the creation of}} entirely new designs. This software displayed individual font characters for pixel-based editing, in conjunction with an attached stylus. An optional <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> facilitated the input of new designs to create new fonts or pi characters.|$|E
50|$|Higher-quality LVT film {{recorders}} use {{a focused}} {{beam of light}} to write the image directly onto a film loaded spinning drum, one pixel at a time. The LVT will record pixel beyond grain. Some machines can burn 120-res or 120 lines per millimeter. The LVT is basically a reverse <b>drum</b> <b>scanner.</b> The exposed film is developed and printed by regular photographic chemical processing.|$|E
5000|$|Digital halftoning {{has been}} {{replacing}} photographic halftoning since the 1970s when [...] "electronic dot generators" [...] were {{developed for the}} film recorder units linked to color <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> made by companies such as Crosfield Electronics, Hell and Linotype-Paul.|$|R

Supported models {{include the}} Chromagraph 3300/3400, Tango/XL, Topaz, Nexscan, and Primescan.|$|R
50|$|Purity can be {{diminished by}} scanner noise, optical flare, poor analog to digital conversion, scratches, dust, Newton's rings, {{out of focus}} sensors, {{improper}} scanner operation, and poor software. <b>Drum</b> <b>scanners</b> are said to produce the purest digital representations of the film, followed by high end film scanners that use the larger Kodak Tri-Linear sensors.|$|R

50|$|Karl-Heinz Zahorsky {{published}} many {{articles about}} image processing in several professional journals.In 1990 Hell Graphics, the world's leading <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> developer in Kiel, hired {{him as an}} independent consultant {{to keep up with}} the rapidly proceeding desktop technologies. In 1991 LaserSoft Imaging became a registered GmbH and moved into a large Prepress house to help in setting up color reproduction on the desktop and to link Chromacom systems to Macintosh Computers.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The first image scanner {{developed}} {{for use with}} a computer was a <b>drum</b> <b>scanner.</b> It was built in 1957 at the US National Bureau of Standards by {{a team led by}} Russell A. Kirsch. The first image ever scanned on this machine was a 5 cm square photograph of Kirsch's then-three-month-old son, Walden. The black and white image had a resolution of 176 pixels on a side.|$|E
50|$|He {{has contributed}} {{in the fields}} of Digital Image Processing, Remote Sensing, Control Systems, {{artificial}} intelligence, computer science, computer vision, machine learning, game theory, power systems, pattern recognition, neural networks. He designed and fabricated {{for the first time in}} India, Grey Scale and color <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> for computer picture processing that has won him NRDC Award.|$|R
50|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} SPI ratings may differ {{for a given}} scanner; typical flatbed scanners use a horizontal array of sensors that are passed across the bed using an electric stepper motor. The density of the array of sensors determines the horizontal scanning resolution, while the minimum step size of the motor determines the vertical resolution. Similar characteristics are present in <b>drum</b> <b>scanners,</b> which continuously spin the item being scanned past the sensor array for numerous imaging passes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{qualifying}} parameter for {{a scanner}} is its resolution, measured in pixels per inch (ppi), sometimes more accurately {{referred to as}} Samples per inch (spi). Instead of using the scanner's true optical resolution, the only meaningful parameter, manufacturers like {{to refer to the}} interpolated resolution, which is much higher thanks to software interpolation. , a high-end flatbed scanner can scan up to 5400 ppi and <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> have an optical resolution of between 3,000 and 24,000 ppi.|$|R
50|$|If a {{high-resolution}} {{digital image}} is required, {{it can be}} achieved inexpensively {{without the use of}} a digital back by taking a large-format photograph on film and scanning the result; for best results a high-quality <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> is required. This can be used to create a much larger very high resolution computer file than is feasible with a single-shot digital back, and quality is high, though {{it has been argued that}} the resolution is not much better than a digitally photographed image.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{scanners}} typically use a {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or a {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas drum scanners, developed earlier and still used for the highest possible image quality, use a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the image sensor. A rotary scanner, used for high-speed document scanning, {{is a type of}} <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> that uses a CCD array instead of a photomultiplier. Non-contact planetary scanners essentially photograph delicate books and documents. All these scanners produce two-dimensional images of subjects that are usually flat, but sometimes solid; 3D scanners produce information on the three-dimensional structure of solid objects.|$|E
50|$|In 1957, a {{team led}} by Russell A. Kirsch at the National Institute of Standards and Technology {{developed}} a binary digital version of an existing technology, the wirephoto <b>drum</b> <b>scanner,</b> so that alphanumeric characters, diagrams, photographs and other graphics could be transferred into digital computer memory. One of the first photographs scanned was a picture of Kirsch's infant son Walden. The resolution was 176x176 pixels with only one bit per pixel, i.e., stark black and white with no intermediate gray tones, but by combining multiple scans of the photograph done with different black-white threshold settings, grayscale information could also be acquired.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|R
25|$|The {{combination}} of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion picture film scanning (telecine), radar jamming, and high-end image <b>scanners</b> known as <b>drum</b> <b>scanners.</b> Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, {{are the basis}} of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution often use a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.|$|R

The motivation of {{the paper is the}} investigation as to what extent low-priced DTP scanners, which are rapidly improving during the few last years, can be used for such applications. The paper will mainly concentrate on flatbed scanners with aim the scanning of films. However, many of the topics mentioned in the paper are also valid for <b>drum</b> <b>scanners.</b> The paper gives a review of recent technological developments with respect to these scanners, describes advantages and disadvantages, presents characteristics, tests and problems of such scanners, and investigations on their geometric and radiometric accuracy.

5000|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> {{gets its}} name from the clear acrylic cylinder, the drum, on which the {{original}} artwork is mounted for scanning. Depending on size, it is possible to mount originals up to 20"x28", but maximum size varies by manufacturer. [...] "One of the unique features of drum scanners is the ability to control sample area and aperture size independently. The sample size is the area that the scanner encoder reads to create an individual pixel. The aperture is the actual opening that allows light into the optical bench of the scanner. The ability to control aperture and sample size separately is particularly useful for smoothing film grain when scanning black-and-white and color negative originals." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the first}} {{programmable}} digital computers was SEAC (the Standards Eastern Automatic Computer), which entered service in 1950 at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Maryland, USA. In 1957, computer pioneer Russell Kirsch and his team unveiled a <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> for SEAC, to [...] "trace variations of intensity over the surfaces of photographs", and so doing made the first digital image by scanning a photograph. The image, picturing Kirsch's three-month-old son, consisted of just 176Ã—176 pixels. They used the computer to extract line drawings, count objects, recognize types of characters and display digital images on an oscilloscope screen. This breakthrough {{can be seen as}} the forerunner of all subsequent computer imaging, and recognising the importance of this first digital photograph, Life magazine in 2003 credited this image as one of the [...] "100 Photographs That Changed the World".|$|E
50|$|A {{detailed}} comparison in 2006 by {{a professional}} photographer of drum-scanned 10Ã—12.5 cm (4Ã—5&Prime;) images and digital 39-megapixel images on a medium-format camera found resolution very similar, with the scanned images slightly better. Color accuracy was not compared as digital profiles for the digital back were not available, but the author was of the considered opinion that the digital camera would ultimately be more accurate. For sustained professional use the apparent cost advantage of scanning film was very much reduced on careful analysis; including expensive 10Ã—12.5 cm (4Ã—5&Prime;) film and processing {{and the cost of}} use of a <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> brought the projected cost over three years to about 80% of the cost of a digital back at the time. The digital back also had the advantage that the incremental cost of taking huge numbers of exposures was nil, while each 10Ã—12.5 cm (4Ã—5&Prime;) photograph cost over US$3. Both the scanned and the 39-megapixel images were noticeably better than images with a 22-megapixel back.|$|E
40|$|Scanners {{have been}} used as input devices in photogrammetric and cartographic {{applications}} mainly for digitisation of aerial images and maps.

50|$|In the {{professional}} and advanced amateur segments, Photo CD had been eclipsed by low cost desktop scanners such as those from Nikon and Minolta in the mid range, and by <b>drum</b> <b>scanners</b> at the very high end. While the pixel resolution of Photo CD was still comparable or better than the alternatives, Photo CD suffered {{from a number of}} other disadvantages. Firstly, the Photo CD color space, designed for TV display, is smaller than what can be achieved by even a low cost desktop scanner. Secondly, the color rendition of Photo CD images changed over time and with different scanner versions; 4050 scanners had different color rendition to earlier versions. Thirdly, the dynamic range of scans was lower than for desktop scanners. Tests at the time indicated that the dmax rating (a measure of maximum density obtainable) of Photo CD was 2.8-3.0, while commonly available desktop scanners were reaching 4.2, a substantial difference. As a result of this, and Photo CDâ€™s problems with color rendering, by 2004 {{the professional}} segment of the user community had generally turned against Photo CD.|$|R
50|$|Vuescan is {{intended}} {{to work with a}} large number of image scanners (over 2,400 as of 2016), excluding specialised professional <b>scanners</b> such as <b>drum</b> <b>scanners,</b> on many computer operating systems (OS), even if drivers for the scanner are not available for the OS. These scanners are supplied with device drivers and software to operate them, included in their price. A 2014 review considered that the reasons to purchase VueScan are to allow older scanners not supported by drivers for newer operating systems to be used in more up-to-date systems, and for better scanning and processing of photographs (prints; also slides and negatives when supported by scanners) than is afforded by manufacturers' software. The review did not report any advantages to Vuescan's processing of documents compared to other software. When compared to SilverFast, a similar program, the reviewer considered the two programs to be comparable, with support for some specific scanners better in one or the other. Vuescan supported more scanners, with a single purchase for the full range, and cost less.|$|R

We are using this scanner to acquire data sets of mock-waste drums at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNIL). In this paper, we discuss some issues associated with gamma-ray spectroscopy assay, NDA imaging, describe the design and construction of an NDA <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> and report on code development for image reconstruction. We also present representative A&PCT assay results of well characterized mock-waste drums.

40|$|A scanner {{characterization}} method {{based on an}} analytic spectral model was derived. The method first modeled the spectral formation of each medium using either Beer-Bouguer Law or Kubelka-Munk theory. Scanner digital counts were then empirically related to dye concentrations. From these estimated dye concentrations, either spectral transmittance or spectral reflectance factor could be predicted. These estimated spectral data were used to calculate tristimulus values and then color differences for the target object. A Howtek D 4000 desktop <b>drum</b> <b>scanner</b> was colorimetrically characterized accordingly. The average characterization errors were all less than CIELAB color difference of 1. 0 for Kodak IT 8. 7 / 1, Kodak Q- 60 C, Fuji IT 8. 7 / 1, and Fuji IT 8. 7 / 2 targets via this method...|$|E
5000|$|Consumer-level flatbed photo {{scanners}} have {{a dynamic}} {{range in the}} 2.0-3.0 range, which can be inadequate for scanning all types of photographic film, as Dmax can be and often is between 3.0d and 4.0d with traditional black-and-white film. Color film compresses its 12 stops of a possible 16 stops (film latitude) into just 2.0d of space via the process of dye coupling and removal of all silver from the emulsion. Kodak Vision 3 has 18 stops. So, color negative film scans the easiest of all film types on the widest range of scanners. Because traditional black-and-white film retains the image creating silver after processing, density range can be almost twice that of color film. This makes scanning traditional black-and-white film more difficult and requires a scanner {{with at least a}} 3.6d dynamic range, but also a Dmax between 4.0d to 5.0d. High-end (photo lab) flatbed scanners can reach a dynamic range of 3.7, and Dmax around 4.0d. Dedicated film scanners [...] have a dynamic range between 3.0d-4.0d. [...] Office document scanners can have a dynamic range of less than 2.0d. <b>Drum</b> <b>scanners</b> have a dynamic range of 3.6-4.5.|$|R
25|$|In computing, {{an image}} scanner is {{a device that}} {{optically}} scans images (printed text, handwriting, or an object) and converts it to a digital image which is transferred to a computer. Among other formats, flat, <b>drum</b> and film <b>scanners</b> exist, {{and most of them}} support RGB color. They can be considered the successors of early telephotography input devices, which were able to send consecutive scan lines as analog amplitude modulation signals through standard telephonic lines to appropriate receivers; such systems were in use in press since the 1920s to the mid-1990s. Color telephotographs were sent as three separated RGB filtered images consecutively.|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} example of digital rectification of tilted photographs using a drum scanning micro densitometer and general purpose computers is depicted. The present research covers rectification of projective distorsions, occuring {{when the camera}} axis is not truly vertical, and affine distorsions due to curvature of a <b>drum</b> of a <b>scanner.</b> For this purpose, fundamental mathematical expressions were derived. And some pixel interpolation methods necessary for image reconstruction were compared experimentally. The examples revealed, however, that the film was deformed so complexly {{that they could not}} be corrected sufficiently only by affine transformation. Accuracy of rectification was checked by use of stereo aerial photographs in terms of residual y-parallaxes. The result showed residual y-parallaxes of Â± 1 pixel (Â± 50 Î¼m) and sometimes Â± 2 pixels were observed. They seem to be caused mainly by film deformations which have not been eliminated, and their amount seems to exceed the photogrammetric tolerance...|$|R
