These costs lead firms to import infrequently and hold substantially larger inventories <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>goods</b> than domestic goods. Using multiple sources of data, the authors document these facts. They then {{show that a}} parsimoniously parameterized model economy with importers facing an (S, s) -type inventory management problem successfully accounts for these features of the data. Moreover, the model can account for import and import price dynamics {{in the aftermath of}} large devaluations. In particular, desired inventory adjustment in response to a sudden, large increase in the relative price <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>goods</b> creates a short-term trade implosion, an immediate, temporary drop in the value and number <b>of</b> distinct varieties <b>imported,</b> as well as a slow increase in the retail price <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>goods.</b> The authors' study of 6 current account reversals following large devaluation episodes in the last decade provides strong support for the model’s predictions.

The model is estimated using quarterly data from Canada and the United States. It predicts a remarkably similar dynamic relationship between the nominal {{exchange rate}} and prices {{in response to the}} different structural shocks: the nominal exchange rate overshoots its long-run level, and changes in the nominal exchange rate are passed through slowly to the domestic price level. The authors show that, although pricing to market (the slow adjustment of the domestic-currency prices <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>goods)</b> is necessary to generate slow pass-through to the prices <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>goods,</b> {{it is not necessary to}} generate slow pass-through to the overall price level.

5000|$|Tariffs: Typically, tariffs (or taxes) {{are imposed}} on <b>imported</b> <b>goods.</b> Tariff rates usually vary {{according}} to the type <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>imported.</b> Import tariffs will increase the cost to importers, and increase the price <b>of</b> <b>imported</b> <b>goods</b> in the local markets, thus lowering the quantity <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> <b>imported,</b> to favour local producers. Tariffs may also be imposed on exports, and in an economy with floating exchange rates, export tariffs have similar effects as import tariffs.
