5|$|A {{characteristic}} that distinguishes Cetiosauriscus {{is that it}} has axially concave summits on the cranial and middle caudal neural spines. Barosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> it in having a more complex sculpting laterally and ventrally in the caudals; in having a larger humerus-femur ratio; and in having differently developed chevrons.|$|E
60|$|Science is, I believe, {{nothing but}} trained and {{organised}} common sense, <b>differing</b> <b>from</b> the latter {{only as a}} veteran may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> a raw recruit: and its methods <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> those of common sense only {{so far as the}} guardsman's cut and thrust <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> the manner in which a savage wields his club.|$|R

5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} {{extensively}} about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story. He <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.|$|E
50|$|Pellets <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> oolites and intraclasts, {{which are}} also found in limestones. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> oolites in that pellets lack the radial or {{concentric}} structures that characterize oolites. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> intraclasts in that pellets lack the complex internal structure, which is typical of intraclasts. In addition, pellets, quite unlike intraclasts, are characterized by a remarkable uniformity of shape, extremely good sorting, and small size.|$|R
5000|$|But if absolutes do <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> relatives, {{then they}} are relative, because all things that <b>differ</b> must <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> {{something}}; and to [...] "differ" [...] from something is to be relative to something. (Empiricus:67) ...|$|R

5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> the {{bites of}} other pets.

5|$|Falco peregrinus ernesti, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1894, is found from Indonesia to Philippines and south to Papua New Guinea {{and the nearby}} Bismarck Archipelago.

It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> the nominate subspecies in the very dark, dense barring on its underside and its black ear coverts.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> classical mechanics in {{a number}} of predictions concerning orbiting bodies.

5|$|Leucism <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> {{albinism}} in {{that the}} melanin is, at least, partially absent but the eyes retain their usual color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of chromatophore (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.|$|E
5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting.

5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the refractive index in {{the plane of the}} bilayer <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> that perpendicular by as much as 0.1 refractive index units. This has been used to characterise the degree of order and disruption in bilayers using dual polarisation interferometry to understand mechanisms of protein interaction.|$|E

5|$|PRKACA {{is found}} on {{chromosome}} 19 in humans. There are two well-described transcripts of this gene, arising from alternative splicing events.

5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
