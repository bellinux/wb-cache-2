5|$|Although the {{preparation}} of pisco-based mixed beverages possibly {{dates back to the}} 1700s, historians and drink <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> the cocktail as it is known today was invented in the early 1920s in Lima, the capital of Peru, by the American bartender Victor Vaughen Morris. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.|$|E

This measure, however, was not enough, and the government was unable to hold this line, and decided to let the exchange rate float. While <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> devaluation was necessary, some critics of Zedillo's 22-day-old administration argue that, although economically coherent, the way the crisis was handled was a political mistake. By having announced its plans for devaluation, they argue that many foreigners withdrew their investments, thus aggravating the effects.

25|$|Platinum coins are {{a popular}} investment, {{and each year}} {{the number of such}} coins sold by Sberbank of Russia {{increases}} by 30–50%. Most <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> such investments should have a long-term character, as the rise of the platinum price is relatively slow– about 80% over the last 5 years, except for a rapid rise followed by decline in 2008. Also, whereas most banks can sell platinum coins, only a few buy them, as this requires evaluation by an experienced professional. For example, only 5% of offices of Sberbank (the major bank of Russia) in the capital city of Moscow redeem precious metal coins. The selling price is also much affected by visible scratches, spots, patina, and other defects introduced by bad handling. For this reason, most bullion coins are sealed in transparent plastic right after removal from the press. They are then stored in a dry room with relative humidity below 80% and at temperatures between 15 and 40°C. If a coin is removed from its plastic seal, it is recommended not to store it in PVC albums, as PVC molecules gradually break down, releasing organochlorine compounds which produce patina on the coins. These compounds may also form acids by reacting with moisture. Unlike silver, platinum does not corrode. However, as is true for all unprotected coins, platinum coins are prone to contamination which can be caused even by washing with (chlorine-containing) tap water.|$|E

40|$|There are {{currently}} no definitions regarding "Optimal testosterone control in Prostate Cancer". Therefore an Expert Consensus Meeting (May 22 2005, San Antonio, USA) {{and an expert}} consultation at a Discussion Forum during the 6 th International Consultation on New Developments in Prostate Cancer and Prostate Diseases (June 25 2005, Paris, France), have been organised to discuss definitions regarding "Optimal testosterone control in Prostate Cancer". The experts attending the Expert Consensus Meeting received background information based on recently published data and the predefined definitions and/or recommendations {{that needed to be}} discussed. During this meeting, the <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> the term "castration" is misleading in case of luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, as castration stands for "surgical removal of the testes", by bilateral orchiectomy. The experts believe that bilateral orchiectomy should be used as a benchmark for introducing the appropriate testosterone level that needs to be achieved with LHRH agonists. As most patients will achieve and maintain a testosterone level of ≤ 20 ng/dL after bilateral orchiectomy, the <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> this level should be used for defining chemical castration. Furthermore, the <b>experts</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> a testosterone rise from nadir above 50 ng/dL could be considered as clinically relevant and could have implications on treatment. In order to reflect previous agreements with a larger group of experts in the field, questions regarding "Optimal testosterone control in Prostate Cancer" were asked to the delegates of the Discussion Forum using an interactive voting system. Before the interactive voting session, the currently published data were presented to the audience. Similar to the experts, the delegates also indicated that achieving "the lowest testosterone level possible" is their main goal of hormone therapy. 64 % of the delegates <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> they would consider a castrate level of below or equal to 20 ng/dL to be optimal.

500|$|The {{aquarium}} {{should be}} decorated {{to mimic the}} natural environment and include rocks and artificial caves for breeding. Most <b>experts</b> <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> a pair of convicts {{should be kept in}} a 20-gallon aquarium or larger. The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted. The species also consumes aquatic plants so plastic plants or robust plants such as java fern are recommended. [...] Convict cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone. Brood care is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the species' tendency to dig, external filtration is superior to undergravel filter systems. Its relatively small size, along with ease of keeping and breeding, make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care.|$|E

The research data were collected through in-depth interviews and observation.
