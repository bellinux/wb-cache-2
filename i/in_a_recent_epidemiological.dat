40|$|The {{process of}} goitrogenesis {{is likely to}} be the {{consequence}} of an increased TSH stimulation linked to an initial reduction of circulating thyroid hormone caused by iodine deficiency (ID). Other growth factors associated to TSH may have a role in the pathogenesis of goiter. Natural history of goiter is the evolution towards nodularity and functional autonomy. This phenomenon is due to the heterogeneity of thyroid follicular cells, some of which, with an intrinsic elevated growth rate, under the stimulation of ID progress to nodule formation and hyperfunction. In multinodular goiter TSH receptor mutations activating adenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway were found. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> survey it was shown that nodular goiter increased with the age, being about 1 % in schoolchildren and 23 % in the adults (56 - 75 years).

In Europe minor neuropsychological impairments and cognitive deficits were described in areas of moderate ID. The exposure to a mild ID during fetal life causes minor neuropsychological damage.

Fibrous phases were detected in 71 % of the samples, and fiber concentrations ranged from a few thousand to more than 4 x 10 (4) fibers/mg of material. In addition, we conducted a study on the mineral fiber lung burden in a pleural mesothelioma case. Many mineral fibers that were classified as the same tremolite-actinolite fibrous amphibole found in the quarries and in the building materials were detected in the lung tissue.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Oxidative {{stress is}} a major {{contributing}} factor {{in the development of}} diabetic nephropathy. Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor � heterozygous mice and Pro 12 Ala polymorphism in PPARG exhibited increased resistance to oxidative stress. Smoking increases the production of reactive oxygen species, which accelerates oxidative stress under hyperglycemia. To determine whether the Pro 12 Ala polymorphism, alone or in combination with smoking, contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy, a case-control study was performed in 760 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Among patients, 532 had diabetic nephropathy with microalbuminuria (n � 245) or overt albuminuria (n � 287), and 228 did not show either of these symptoms but had had diabetes for � 10 years and were not undergoing antihypertension treatment. RESULTS — After adjustment for confounders, the Pro/Pro genotype was significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy (odds ratio 2. 30 [95 % CI 1. 18 – 4. 45], P � 0. 014); smoking was also an independent risk factor for diabetic nephropathy (1. 99 [1. 08 – 3. 68], P � 0. 029). In addition, we identified possible synergistic effects; i. e., the high-risk group (smokers with the Pro/Pro genotype) showed 4. 52 times higher risk (1. 78 – 11. 48, P � 0. 002) of diabetic nephropathy than the low-risk group (nonsmokers with the Pro/Ala genotype) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multiple logistic regression analysis controlled for the confounders. CONCLUSIONS — Our results indicated that the Pro/Pro genotype and smoking were significant independent risk factors for diabetic nephropathy.

40|$|Urinary oxalate {{excretion}} {{increases with}} body size and decreases with increasing dietary calcium intake among healthy adults. Increasing dietary calcium intake decreases urinary oxalate excretion by increasing intestinal precipitation of dietary oxalate as calcium oxalate. This mechanism was speculated {{to account for}} the decreased prospective incidence of kidney stones as estimated dietary calcium intake, adjusted for caloric intake, increased among men <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> large <b>epidemiological</b> study. To further assess the relationship between estimated diet calcium and urinary oxalate, we studied 94 healthy adults, 50 women and 44 men, ages 20 to 70 years with weights ranging from 47 to 104 kg while they ate their customary diets. Each subject completed a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and collected three 24 -hour urines preserved with HCl. The urines were collected accurately as judged by a mean intra-subject CV for creatinine excretion of 9. 8 % and direct relations between urinary creatinine excretion and body wt (r = 0. 62; P < 0. 0001), or predicted urine creatinine content for sex, age and weight using the Cockcroft and Gault formulas (r = 0. 76; P < 0. 0001). Estimated diet calcium intake ranged from 6. 8 to 68 mmol/day (272 to 2720 mg/day) and averaged 29. 5 mmol/day (1180 mg/day). Individual mean urinary oxalate excretion ranged from 0. 079 to 0. 332 mmol/day (7 to 29 mg/day) and averaged 0. 198 mmol/day (17 mg/day). Among all subjects, daily oxalate excretion was directly related to creatinine excretion as an estimate of lean body mass (r = 0. 61; P < 0. 0001). Thus, oxalate excretion among men averaged 0. 228 ± 0. 051 SD mmol/day, a value significantly higher than the average among women of 0. 173 ± 0. 045 mmol/day (P < 0. 001). Daily urine oxalate excretion/creatinine decreased curvilinearly as estimated dietary Ca intake increased (r = - 0. 30; P = 0. 0035) and as the ratio of estimated dietary calcium to dietary oxalate increased (r = - 0. 39; P = 0. 0001). We conclude that body size is the major determinant of urinary oxalate excretion among healthy adults, presumably reflecting variations in endogenous oxalate synthesis with lean body mass. Increasing estimated diet calcium intake, especially up to the range of 15 to 20 mmol/day (600 to 800 mg/day) has an additional effect to decrease urinary oxalate excretion, presumably by limiting intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate...|$|R

Although precise mechanisms involved in the development of glucose intolerance are not well understood, it seems that the virus itself, through its core protein can modify the metabolic profile of HCV-infected patients which leads to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mechanistic studies have revealed that HCV encoded proteins may cause post-receptor defects in insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS- 1). It may also associate with the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin signaling defects in hepatic IRS- 1 tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 k) activation that may contribute to development of insulin resistance and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with HCV infection (7) (Fig. 1).

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{major health}} problem and is sometimes complicated by lethal pulmonary embolism (PE). Disturbances of the coagulation and anticoagulation systems are important {{risk factors for}} VTE. Comparative studies suggest that coagulation and innate immunity have a shared evolutionary origin. It is therefore unsurprising that the immune and coagulation systems are linked, with many molecular components being important for both systems. Systemic inflammation modulates thrombotic responses by suppressing fibrinolysis, upregulating procoagulant, and downregulating anticoagulants, and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and Behçet's syndrome {{have been linked to}} an increased risk of VTE. Recent reports have further shown that a majority of autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders are linked to an increased risk of venous thrombosis, PE, or VTE. For instance, a Swedish nationwide study found that the risk of PE was increased in the first year after hospitalization for 33 different autoimmune disorders. Especially high risks were noted for several autoimmune diseases such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, polyarteritis nodosa, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, ulcerative colitis, and SLE. Another study from England, also based on hospitalization data, found that immune-mediated disorders were associated with an increased risk of VTE compared with other medical causes of hospitalization. Multiple mechanisms may operate and disease-specific factors, such as cardiolipin antibodies, have been identified. However, inflammation by itself appears to change the hemostatic balance <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thrombogenic direction. <b>Recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> studies, together with previous experimental and clinical studies, indicate that autoimmune disorders should not only be viewed as inflammatory disorders, but also hypercoagulable disorders.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Dengue fever is {{the most}} {{important}} arboviral infection that affects humans, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Here, we provide the first comprehensive overview of the severity of dengue epidemics in French Guiana. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We monitored hospitalized cases between 2008 and 2013. Detailed clinical features and biological parameters were collected on a daily basis from all cases. Among the 1, 356 cases, 216 (16 %) were classified according to the WHO 2009 classification as dengue without warning signs (WS), 926 (68 %) were classified as dengue with WS and 214 (16 %) were classified as severe dengue. The severity rates were similar between the three major epidemics that occurred during the study period, whereas the hospitalization rate was highest in 2013. Fluid accumulation, aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) counts> 193 IU/L and platelet counts< 75, 000 cells/mm 3 were associated with dengue severity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings provide <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> description of the severity of dengue epidemics in French Guiana.

During <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> survey <b>in</b> {{southern}} Italy some morphological and taxonomical doubts arose {{concerning the}} identification of Rhinoestrus third stage larvae {{on the basis of}} the features of the posterior spiracles and the distribution of dorsal spines on the third segment. Four different morphotypes were retrieved: R. usbekistanicus-like, R. purpureus-like and two morphotypes with shared features. The genes encoding for the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and for the ribosomal subunits 16 S and 28 S of the four morphotypes of Rhinoestrus were investigated to determine whether they belonged to a single taxon or they displayed genetic differences indicative of more than one species. The three genes showed a very low level of sequence variation (COI 0 - 0. 43 %, 16 S 0 - 1. 45 %, 28 S 0 - 0. 23 %) falling within the intraspecific ranges previously described for Oestridae species. Finally, the peritreme features and the spinulation of the third segment of the four morphotypes examined could not be used to differentiate the two specie...|$|R

Por esse processo, o colesterol dos tecidos periféricos, {{inclusive}} da parede arterial, é removido das membranas celulares pelas HDL, esterificado pela lecitina colesterol-aciltransferase e, posteriormente, captado pelo figado (transporte reverso direto de colesterol). O colesterol celular também é removido por via indireta, ou seja, pela transferência do-colesterol esterificado das HDL para as lipoproteínas que contém apo B (lipoproteínas de muito baixa e baixa densidade, respectivamente VLDL e LDL) as quais são captadas por receptores específicos hepáticos. Essa etapa é mediada pela proteína de transferência de éster de colesterol. (CETP). As lipoproteínas de baixa densidade são quantitativamente as maIS importantes lipoproteínas carreadoras de colesterol. Elas estão positivamente associadas ao desenvolvimento da aterosclerose e, desta forma, altas concentrações de LDL plasmáticas e/ou modificações químicas destas lipoproteínas, como a oxidação, são condições relacionadas diretamente ao aumento da incidência da doença aterosclerótica. Com o objetivo de avaliar a atividade da CETP frente a modificações químicas induzi das artificialmente nas LDL, foram feitos experimentos de medida de transferência de éster de colesterol radioativamente marcado entre as lipoproteínas. Lipoproteínas obtidas a partir de "pool" de plasma de indivíduos nonnais, foram modificadas "in vitro" por acetilação ou oxidação e foram incubadas com HDL 2 e HDL 3 previamente marcadas com éster de colesterol radioativo, na presença de CETP contida na fração do plasma de d> 1, 21 g 1 rnL. Após vários períodos de incubação, as lipoproteínas foram reisoladas por precipitação das LDL com sulfato de dextrana/MgCh e a radioatividade medida no sobrenadante. Os resultados obtidos mostraram diminuição média significativa na transferência de éster de colesterol das subpopulações de HDL (HDL 2 e HDL 3 em conjunto) para as LDL modificadas por acetilação (p=O,OOOI) ou por oxidação (p=O,OO 88), quando comparadas às respectivas LDL normais. A diminuição encontrada na porcentagem de transferência das HDL para a LDL acetilada foi de 1, 8 vezes e para a LDL oxidada foi de 1, 5 vezes em relação às respectivas LDL normais. A via inversa, ou seja,. transporte de éter de colesterol da LDL oxidada para as subpopulações de HDL, apresentou um aumento médio significativo (p=O,OOO 5) de cerca de 2 vezes, quando comparado à LDL normal. A diminuição da transferência de colesterol esterificado (CO) das HDL para as LDL modificadas contribui para que estas lipoproteínas aterogênicas ganhem menos colesterol do que as LDL não modificadas. Por outro lado, a maior transferência de colesteril-oleato das LDL oxidadas para as HDL, resulta na redistribuição do colesterol oxidado para uma fração lipoprotéica antiaterogênica. Como o destino metabólico das LDL modificadas é a captação por macrófagos na parede arterial (ateroma) e o das LDL e das HDL normais é o hepatócito (excreção de colesterol do corpo), os resultados mostraram que a CETP favoreceu a redistribuição do colesterol plasmático para as lipoproteínas íntegras, antiaterogênicas, indicando um possível papel antiaterogênico da CETP o que também foi recentemente descrito em um estudo populacionalAbstract:Reverse {{transport of}} cholesterol is a mechanism that possibly explains an inverse correlation between high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and {{the incidence of}} atherosclerosis. In this process peripheral cholesterol tissue, including that of the arterial wall, is removed from cellular membranes by HDL, esterified by lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase and thereafter {{taken up by the}} liver (direct reverse transport of cholesterol). Cellular cholesterol is also transported by an indirect way, that is, by means of the transfer of esterified cholesterol from HDL to the lipoproteins that contain apo B (low and very low density lipoproteins, respectively, VLDL and LDL) and that is intemalized by specific hepatic receptors. Thisstep is mediated by the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP). Low density lipoproteins quantitatively are the most important carriers of cholesterol. They are positively associated with the development of atherosclerosis, and in this way, high concentrations of plasma LDL and chemical modification of these lipoproteins are conditions direct 1 y related to atherogenesis. In order to study the activity of CETP on LDL particles chemically modified, experiments were made to measure the transfer of radioactive cholesteryl ester between lipoproteins. Lipoproteins obtained from the plasma pool of normal individuaIs were modified "in vitro" by acetylation or oxidation, and were incubated with HDL 2 and HDL 3 containing radioactive cholesteryl ester in the presence of CETP from plasma fraction of d > 1. 2 1 g/rnL. After various incubation periods, the lipoproteins were isolated again by pr. ecipitation of LDL with dextran sulfate/MgCh and the radioactivity measured in the supematant. 	The results obtained showed a significant average diminution in the transfer of cholesteryl ester from HDL 2 and HDL 3 to the LDL modified by acetylation or by oxidation, when compared to the nonnal LDL. In the inverse direction that is, the transport of oxidized LDL cholesteryl ester to the subpopulations of HDL presented a significant average increase, when compared to nonnal LDL. The diminished transfer rate of esterified cholesterol (CO) from HDL to the modified LDL brings about a significantly smaller enrichment of the latter with cholesterol. On the other hand, the faster transfer rate of CO from oxidized LDL to HDL lessens the atherogenic pot~ntial of the fonner lipoproteins. Taking into account that modified LDL is bound to accumulate into the arterial wall whereas nonnal LDL and HDL are preferentially taken up by the hepatocyte, the data suggest that CETP plays a benefical role favoring the excretion of cholesterol from the body, which is <b>in</b> agreement with <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> study suggesting <b>an</b> antiatherogenic role of CET...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> {{analysis}} on {{premenstrual dysphoric disorder}} (PMDD) in the community revealed increased rates of DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women suffering from PMDD. Aims: To explore whether this association is artifactual or might have important pathogenic implications. Methods: Data come from a prospective, longitudinal community survey of an original sample of N¼ 1488 women aged 14 – 24, who were followed-up {{over a period of}} 40 to 52 months. Diagnostic assessments are based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) using the 12 -month PMDD diagnostic module. Data were analyzed using logistic regressions (odds ratios) and a case-by-case review. Results: The age adjusted odds ratio between PTSD and threshold PMDD was 11. 7 (3. 0 – 46. 2) at baseline. 10 women with full PTSD and at least subthreshold PMDD were identified at follow-up. Most reported an experience of abuse in childhood before the onset of PMDD. Some had experienced a life-threatening experience caused by physical attacks, or had witnessed traumatic events experienced by others. 3 women reported more than one traumatic event. Conclusions: A case-by-case review and logistic regression analyses suggest that women with traumatic events and PTSD have an increased risk for secondary PMDD. These observations call for more in-depth analyses in future research...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) {{is likely to}} result from the interaction between environmental exposures, including cigarette smoke, and genetic predisposition. This review focuses on clues provided by recent genetic association studies and other selected data and hypotheses. In IPF, association with surfactant mutations has highlighted the importance of type II epithelial cells, while shortened telomeres in some patients suggest that accelerated aging may play <b>a</b> role <b>in</b> the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis, possibly by affecting the renewal/differentiation potential of epithelial cells. The finding that <b>a</b> common variant <b>in</b> mucin 5 B predisposes individuals to both familial and sporadic IPF suggests a hitherto under-investigated role of bronchiolar cells and mucins. Although the pathogenetic link between mucins and lung fibrosis is not known, {{it is possible that}} MUC 5 B overexpression interferes with physiological mucosal host defense, with reduced clearance of micro-organisms or inorganic noxious agents, or induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Other components of innate and adaptive immunity are likely to be involved in IPF pathogenesis/progression. Finally, the importance of the clotting cascade in IPF pathogenesis has been confirmed by <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>epidemiological</b> study, <b>in</b> which patients with IPF were almost five times more likely than general population controls to have at least one inherited or acquired clotting defect...|$|R
