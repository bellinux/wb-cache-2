50|$|The journey resumed. The help of Duarte Barbosa {{was crucial}} in facing the riot in Puerto San Julian; Magellan {{appointed}} him as {{captain of the}} Victoria. The Santiago was sent down the coast on a scouting expedition and was wrecked in a sudden storm. All of its crew survived and made it safely to shore. Two of them returned overland to inform Magellan of what had happened, and to bring rescue to their comrades. After this experience, Magellan decided to wait <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more</b> before resuming the voyage with the four remaining ships.|$|R

50|$|The New England Revolution started {{training}} camp in Arizona culminating with a scrimmage against the PDL club FC Tucson which the Revolution won 2-1.

50|$|As {{part of the}} show's concept, Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up's Big Five housemates {{were told}} {{to stay in the}} House <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b> The series focuses on Cantiveros and Francisco, who entered into a {{relationship}} during Double Up. Over the course of the series, scripted or simulated situations would be presented to Francisco and Cantiveros.|$|R
50|$|The United States exerted intense {{pressure}} on the Soviet Union in stages to force {{the withdrawal of the}} Red Army from Iran and reduce Soviet influence. Following an official US protest, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2, on January 30, 1946; the Soviets replied on March 24, 1946 and pledged immediate withdrawal, but in fact remained <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} later, Harris started weliveinpublic.com, {{a project that}} entailed himself and his then girlfriend, Tanya Corrin, living at home under 24-hour {{internet}} surveillance viewable by anyone. After a few months Corrin left Harris and the project citing mental and emotional stress.

50|$|One more ship, Goliah, {{was sent}} to help out to salvage as much {{merchandise}} {{as possible from the}} wreck. Goliah first checked on the safety of Sea Bird before coming to Carrier Pigeon. Goliah was able to transport both the crew of Carrier Pigeon and 1,200 packages of her merchandise north to San Francisco.

At Court one has to be so careful, and you know I am already considered far too much of a Bohemian here. I was even given to understand, a little time ago, by a very great lady, that my position was quite precarious." ...|$|R
5000|$|Also on 28 January, Conservative Party {{supporter}} Michael Bliss, {{a historian}} {{and member of}} the Order of Canada, wrote in the Globe and Mail that the opposition's response to prorogation was [...] "to keep the pot boiling, largely by playing on public ignorance of the workings of government" [...] and that the effect of prorogation will be that [...] "Some useful government bills {{are going to have to}} be reintroduced. The Afghan hearings, into events of several years ago, will be delayed <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b> And that's about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Karl Albert {{has turned}} off, leftwards, towards his Bohemian Enterprises: French, Bavarians, Saxons, by their several routes, {{since the last}} days of October, are all on march that way. We will mark an exact date here and there, as fixed point for the reader's fancy. Poor Karl Albert, he had sat some six weeks at Linz,--about three weeks since that Homaging there (October 2d);--imaginary Sovereign of Upper Austria; looking over to Vienna and the Promised Land in general. And that fine Pisgah-view was all he ever had of it. Of Austrian or other Conquests earthly or heavenly, there came none to him in this Adventure;--mere MINUS {{quantities}} they all proved. <b>For</b> a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> there are, blended with awful portents, an imaginary gleam or two in other quarters; after which, nothing but black horror and disgrace, deepening downwards into utter darkness, for the poor man.

2500|$|Minesweeping {{operations}} {{would continue}} for months, the UN ships constantly swept various areas {{to ensure that}} no new mine fields were laid. Incidents of shore batteries scoring hits on allied warships also became less common and for weeks no vessels were damaged until October 29 when the [...] was engaged. The Ospreys engine room flooded after being hit three times and communications went out, one man was seriously wounded though the ship was saved from sinking. By November 9, the minesweeping mission was eighty percent complete, accurate shore battery fire delayed the UN ships from completing the operation <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Double-tailed web spiders mate during summer. After mating, {{the female}} will lay her eggs in an egg sac (an ovoid ball of spider silk) in her sanctuary. She then {{stretches}} her body {{over the surface}} of the egg sac and guards it. This behavior is distinctive and makes the species easy to recognise. The mother does not feed nor leave the sanctuary until the eggs have hatched, which is usually after two or three weeks. Only then will she return {{to the center of the}} web and resume her normal activities. The spiderlings will remain in her sanctuary <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before setting out on their own.|$|R
5000|$|He {{attempted}} {{to revive the}} play in late November, with attention from David Belasco and investors from Texas. The Amsterdam News published lists of contributors to the revival. Anderson was invited to address churches, and appeared on WNYC. The revival continued <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> thanks to the unexpected contributors from Texas. Anderson supported a new church in December; two weeks later there was favorable critical publicity, and he spoke at another church. However, the revival closed in mid-January 1926. [...] Anderson appeared on WRNY in March, and in May he was in Los Angeles exploring movie rights and future productions of Appearances.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} Stuyvesant {{dismissed the}} local government and chose new Dutch replacements as leaders. Four who signed were arrested by order of Stuyvesant. Two immediately recanted, but the writer of the remonstrance, Edward Hart, and sheriff of Flushing Tobias Feake remained firm in their convictions. Both men were remanded to prison where they survived in isolation on rations of bread and water for over a month. After friends and family petitioned Stuyvesant {{on behalf of the}} elderly Hart, the clerk was released on penalty of banishment. Feake held out <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> but eventually recanted and was pardoned after being fined and banned from holding public office.|$|R
50|$|The Americans {{suffered}} no {{casualties in}} the engagement and it is unknown {{if any of the}} Johannans were hurt. USS Dale and her crew successfully extracted redress for the imprisonment of Captain Moores. Captain Pearson remained off the island <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> but no further fighting occurred. In late August, Pearson easily suppressed a mutiny aboard the American whaler Paulina off Johanna with his detachment of twenty-seven marines and some sailors. The mutineers were taken off the ship and placed in confinement. Captain Charles R. Cutler, master of the American bark Dolphin, was at Johanna {{at the time of the}} bombardment and later he submitted a detailed account of the engagement to the New York Times.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, [...] "Girls' School"/"Mull of Kintyre" [...] was {{initially}} tracked as a double A-side, and reached #44 on the pop charts before [...] "Mull of Kintyre" [...] was {{dropped from the}} chart listings as of 21 January 1978. [...] "Girls' School" [...] continued its chart climb <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> reaching #34 in Canada. After the single {{fell out of the}} top 40, it was once again tracked as a double A-side (with [...] "Mull of Kintyre" [...] getting first billing) for one week in April, but it did not better its previous #44 chart peak. [...] "Mull of Kintyre" [...] alone (without [...] "Girls' School") did reach #30 on Canada's Adult Contemporary chart.|$|R
40|$|After {{receiving}} {{more than}} 5 inches of precipitation {{last week in}} central Iowa, many were thinking back to 1993. Last week 2 ̆ 7 s rainfall was not like 1993. Fortunately, very few acres were planted last week in central Iowa prior to the rain. About 10 to 15 percent of the corn was planted last Sunday when it started to rain, and the soybean acres planted were not measurable by USDA. Probably it was just soybean research plots that were planted! Many producers may be fortunate that they still have their seed in the bag. Poorly drained fields and fields in river bottoms will stay wet <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> and there may even be areas that cannot be planted this year...|$|R
50|$|The {{siege of}} Naples {{continues}} on land {{as well as}} on sea. On May 1, the French captain in charge of the Gascon musketeers at the battle of Capo d'Orso is killed under the walls of the city. But the long-awaited Venetian fleet arrives on June 11, thus tightening a bit more the blockade of the city. On May 13, the news of the battle reach the French king in Paris and a te deum mass is immediately held in Notre Dame de Paris. In Naples, food supplies are being quickly exhausted, on June 14, the Prince of Orange already writes about scarcities. At best the city can hold <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before famine forces the Spanish troops to surrender.|$|R
50|$|Six American sailors {{were killed}} in action and {{eighteen}} others went into the water without lifeboats because lowering them meant being exposed to accurate enemy fire and the liferafts had all been shot away. The U-701 was slightly damaged though no casualties were sustained. The fate of USS YP-389 is most remembered by how such a small vessel could resist an attack by a much larger U-boat {{for so long and}} sustain so much damage before being destroyed. The battle {{was also one of the}} more significant surface engagements to have taken place in Torpedo Alley. U-701 continued to scour the American East Coast <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> until being sunk by United States Army bombers not far from Diamond Shoals (7 July 1942).|$|R

After finding Mick's body and finding information on hunters being chased by the British Men of Letters, Mary confronts Arthur who claims {{he was killed by}} a werewolf. However, Mary quickly realizes that Arthur is lying and in fact killed Mick himself since he {{was shot in the head}} which a werewolf is unlikely to do.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Ackerman said, [...] "I aim at hitting 100 and {{becoming}} the George Burns of science fiction". His health, however, had been failing. He was susceptible to infection {{in his later}} life and, after one final trip {{to the hospital in}} October 2008, informed his best friend and caregiver Joe Moe {{that he did not want}} to go on. Honoring his wishes, his friends brought him home to hospice care. However, it turned out that in order to get Ackerman home, the hospital had cured his infection with antibiotics. So Ackerman went on <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> holding what he delighted in calling [...] "a living funeral". In his final days he saw everyone he wanted to say good-bye to. Fans were encouraged to send messages of farewell by mail.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1985 Dixon began {{supporting}} the idea of leaving the party and setting up a think tank in Washington, D.C. Many in the party at this point became increasingly irate at Dixon's behavior, citing her alcoholism and paranoia making her increasingly erratic and too unstable to speak to. She encouraged her lieutenants to launch a [...] "Quality of Life" [...] campaign within the party so that party members could assess their own lives. Lieutenants took this at face value and in late October members of the party began {{talking to each other}} on various party issues and their own lives regardless of party rules and regulations, this being made possible by Dixon's absence from the country while on a trip to Eastern Europe. The party's lieutenants called together various members and began speaking out against aspects of the party while discussing its [...] "real nature." [...] Party sessions continued <b>for</b> some <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>more,</b> until the night before Dixon was scheduled to return. On that night party members convened and unanimously voted to expel the General Secretary (Dixon) from the party, and then to dissolve it. A vote by mail was held in April 1986 amid heated discussions {{on the future of the}} party and a majority voted to confirm the party's dissolution and to liquidate its assets, to be shared among former cadres (which was achieved in August 1987).|$|R
500|$|With Norwich {{back in the}} Premier League, Hooper was {{struggling}} to hold down {{a place in the}} team. By September 2015 he had only played ten minutes in the opening league match against Crystal Palace, and an 89th-minute substitute appearance against Southampton. A loan move to Sheffield Wednesday fell through despite the Yorkshire club agreeing to pay Norwich £500,000 and match Hooper's £32,000 weekly wage. Hooper denied press reports that the move collapsed due to his demand for Sheffield Wednesday to provide him with a VIP box at their stadium for his family and friends. [...] He remained at Norwich <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks,</b> but sustained an ankle injury in training.

50|$|The adult weevil {{is black}} and covered in a thin black and {{yellowish}} mottled coat of hairs. It is a short-snouted beetle up to 6 millimeters in total body length. The female lays over 100 eggs {{on or near the}} bracts of the thistle flower head. She covers the eggs with masticated plant tissue to protect them from predators. When the white larva emerges from its egg it burrows into the flower head and feeds on the flower parts and developing seeds. As it grows it deposits frass and chewed plant tissue on the walls of its chamber, producing a rigid protective shell in which it will pupate. Pupation takes up to two weeks and when the weevil emerges as an adult it remains inside the chamber <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before tunneling out of the plant.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, with no {{acceptable}} takers {{for either}} station and facing a deadline {{to close down}} the company, Field announced on July 15, 1983, that it would shut down WKBS-TV {{at the end of}} August. Field held onto WKBD in Detroit <b>for</b> a <b>few</b> <b>more</b> <b>weeks</b> before selling it to Cox Communications that fall (the sale was finally consummated in February 1984). Most of channel 48's programming (except for shows provided by syndication firm Viacom) and some production equipment were sold to WPHL-TV, while the station's license was returned to the FCC. On August 30, 1983, following the telecast of a college football game, WKBS-TV signed off for the final time. The sign-off sequence, usually a film of The Star-Spangled Banner, was instead replaced by a video of the employees saying farewell accompanied by Simon and Garfunkel's [...] "The Sound of Silence".|$|R
50|$|Strained yogurt {{has been}} {{strained}} through a filter, traditionally made of muslin {{and more recently}} of paper or non-muslin cloth. This removes the whey, giving a much thicker consistency. Strained yogurt is becoming more popular with those who make yogurt at home, especially if using skimmed milk which results in a thinner consistency. Yogurt that has been strained to filter or remove the whey is known as Labneh in Middle Eastern countries. It has a consistency between that of yogurt and cheese. It is popular for sandwiches in Middle Eastern countries. Olive oil, cucumber slices, olives, and various green herbs may be added.

5000|$|In {{the weeks}} {{surrounding}} 21 June, {{in the northern}} polar region, the sun is at its highest elevation, appearing to circle the sky there without going below the horizon.
