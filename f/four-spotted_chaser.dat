5|$|Of {{the many}} bird species {{found in the}} Mendips, the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus), which has gradually recolonised the area since the 1980s, is particularly significant. It breeds on sea and inland cliffs and {{on the faces of}} active and disused quarries. The upland heaths of the west Mendips have recently increased in ornithological importance due to colonisation by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata), which can be found at Black Down and Crook Peak. In Britain, this species is usually associated with lowland heath. The woodlands at Stock Hill are a breeding site for nightjars (Caprimulgus europaeus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus). The Waldegrave Pool, part of Priddy Mineries, is an important site for dragonflies, including downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula quadrimaculata). Waldegrave Pool is the only Mendip breeding site for downy emerald dragonflies. In 2007 the first confirmed sighting of a red kite (Milvus milvus) on the Mendips was made at Charterhouse.|$|E
500|$|Dragonflies {{as a group}} {{occupy a}} {{considerable}} variety of habitats, but many species, and some families, have their own specific environmental requirements. Some species prefer flowing waters, while others prefer standing water. For example, the Gomphidae (clubtails) live in running water, and the Libellulidae (skimmers) live in still water. Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level, desiccation, and the resulting variations in temperature, but some genera such as Sympetrum (darters) [...] have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm, shallow pools, also often benefiting from the absence of predators there. Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged, floating, emergent, or waterside are also important. Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs. Requirements may be highly specific, as in Aeshna viridis (green hawker), which lives in swamps with the water-soldier, Stratiotes aloides. The chemistry of the water, including its trophic status (degree of enrichment with nutrients) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies. Most species need moderate conditions, not too eutrophic, not too acid; a few species such as Sympetrum danae (black darter) and Libellula quadrimaculata (<b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser)</b> prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs, while others such as Libellula fulva (scarce chaser) need slow-moving, eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants.|$|E

50|$|The <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula quadrimaculata), {{known in}} North America as the four-spotted skimmer, is a {{dragonfly}} {{of the family}} Libellulidae found frequently throughout Europe, Asia, and North America.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of dragonflies in the north-eastern {{end of the}} lake documented a presence of red-eyed damselfly, northern damselfly, azure damselfly, brown hawker, club-tailed dragonfly, downy emerald, and <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nesting birds include mallard. Common frog, {{palmate newt}} and smooth newt breed in the pools. Dragonflies {{recorded}} include <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser,</b> broad-bodied chaser, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor, common darter {{and the small}} red damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} also known for its insects. Eleven species of dragonflies and damselflies have been recorded, {{including}} the black darter (Sympetrum danae) (Britain's smallest dragonfly) and the <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula quadrimaculata). They are joined by 19 species of butterfly, including the green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi).|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{species of}} dragonflies and damselflies {{have been recorded}} at Black Lake: white-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia last recorded 1997), brown hawker (Aeshna grandis), <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula quadrimaculata), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), black darter (Sympetrum danae), large red damselfly (Pyrrhosoma nymphula) and common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum).|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} a mix of wetland habitats, {{including}} reedbeds, fens, dykes and pools. It was designed to provide a breeding site for bitterns. Other key species seen at the site include marsh harriers, herons, bearded tits, <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> dragonflies and hairy dragonflies as well as mammals including otters and water voles. Large roosts of starlings have been common at the reserve during autumn since 2003.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser,</b> broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} gravel {{workings}} {{which are now}} disused and filled with water, {{as well as the}} river. Thirteen species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded, including one which is rare in Britain, the ruddy darter dragonfly, and two which are locally uncommon, the <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> dragonfly and the red-eyed damselfly. Aquatic plants include the yellow water-lily and mare's tail. Rabbits graze acidic grassland, and there are also areas of woodland, scrub herb and fen.|$|E
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser,</b> eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), broad-bodied chaser (Libellula depressa), <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E

50|$|Priddy Pools {{supports}} {{a very rich}} fauna. Fifteen species of dragonfly have been recorded; as well as supporting the only population of downy emerald in the Mendips, the site hosts the notable <b>four-spotted</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula quadrimaculata) and ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum). Five British species of amphibian occur and there are good populations of great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris) and palmate newt (Triturus helveticus). Three species of reptile, viviparous lizard (Lacerta vivipara), adder (Vipera berus), grass snake (Natrix natrix), {{and at least two}} species of fish; European perch, (Perca fluviatilis) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are present. Breeding birds include moorhen (Gallinula chloropus), coot (Fulica atra), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus). Priddy Pools is an important research site. Detailed study of the algae in the northern pool was carried out in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as part of the International Biological Programme.|$|E
