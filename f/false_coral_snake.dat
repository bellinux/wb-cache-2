5|$|Some {{harmless}} {{milk snake}} (Lampropeltis triangulum) subspecies, the moderately toxic <b>false</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> (genus Erythrolamprus), and the deadly <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> (genus Micrurus) {{all have a}} red background color with black and white / yellow rings. In this system, both the milk snakes and the deadly <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are mimics, whereas the <b>false</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> are the model. It has also been suggested that this system could be an instance of pseudomimicry, the similar colour patterns having evolved independently in similar habitats.|$|R

25|$|Hognose snakes are {{extremely}} variable {{in color and}} pattern. Heterodon nasicus and H. kennerlyi tend to be sandy colored with black and white markings, while H. platirhinos varies from reds, greens, oranges, browns, to melanistic (i.e. black) depending on locality. They are sometimes blotched and sometimes solid-colored. Leiohetereodon geayi is a brown or tan colored snake with dark speckling on it. Leioheterodon madagascariensis is typically green and yellow with a black checkerboard pattern along its back. Leioheterodon modestus is normally a gold-brown color. Some species in the genus Lystrophis {{are referred to as}} tri-color hognose snakes and sometimes as <b>false</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snakes</b> because they display alternating bands of red, white, and black.|$|R

50|$|Oxyrhopus guibei is {{a species}} of {{colubrid}} snake. It is often called the <b>false</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snake,</b> but this common name can refer to any of {{a long list of}} other species, genera, and even entire families of snakes. Many nonvenomous snakes have evolved coloration that mimics that of venomous true coral snakes, a trait which helps them avoid predation.|$|E

Common names include American pipe snake and <b>false</b> <b>coral</b> <b>snake.</b> It is found in South America. This snake possesses a vestigial pelvic girdle that is visible {{as a pair of}} cloacal spurs. It is ovoviviparous. It is non-venomous, and its diet consists mainly of amphibians and other reptiles. Currently, two subspecies are recognized, including the typical form described here.|$|E
50|$|This lizard lives {{mainly in}} open habitat types, {{especially}} restinga, {{part of the}} Atlantic Forest biome. It may occupy disturbed and degraded restinga. It is also known from the Abrolhos Archipelago, indicating that it can colonize offshore islands. It lives in the Cerrado.
