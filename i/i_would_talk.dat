Woods wrote, [...] "I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{recruited}} artist Jeff Koons for {{the project}} in early 2013; the two had met previously at a Metropolitan Museum of Art fashion event three years earlier, where Gaga had a live performance. According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
500|$|Plath's fellow confessional {{poet and}} friend Anne Sexton commented: [...] "Sylvia and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> {{at length about}} our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the {{opposite}} of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in The Bell Jar is just that same story." [...] The confessional interpretation of Plath's work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, Theodore Dalrymple asserted that Plath had been the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization" [...] and of self-pity. Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath's material.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed," [...] Andrew said. [...] "I {{never so}} much as dreamt of it. If I had done so he and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>talked</b> {{together}} to a purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I made {{a kind of}} vow," [...] he said, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> seriously, {{which always}} means {{answering}} silly questions. But the strong man will always be gentle with politicians.|$|R
500|$|While {{searching for}} investors, Nagy and Berwin {{learned that the}} {{homosexuality}} of the characters was not {{as much of an}} obstacle for securing financing as {{the fact that they were}} women. [...] "Having two women leads was the issue," [...] Nagy noted. In 2015, Berwin said that, in those days, it was a risky idea to play the role of Carol. [...] "As a project it came together with Cate Blanchett. You needed to always start with her role". Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E

According to Koons, she [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist [...] " [...] and replied, [...] "You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan of yours, and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to my friends about your work." [...] Following her hip surgery in February 2013, the singer was forced into a six-month hiatus, during which she studied literature and music with the Haus of Gaga in addition to sharing [...] "creative gifts". This stage allowed her to review and enhance her creative direction, which she admitted to be a meticulous [...] "gazing process". [...] "I have to gaze into the work {{for long periods of time}} for it to be good," [...] adding that upon analyzing her ideas, she received [...] "that wonderful feeling" [...] which told her [...] "that's the one".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> {{aloud to}} these notes and wrangle over {{them in my}} workroom--while the plans of Lord Roberts B waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed! {{why should}} I,--I {{who have been}} preaching that {{comfortable}} doctrine of hypocrisy? I will say nothing hard. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>talk</b> of your good things than of my evil ones." ...|$|R
60|$|B., however, {{refuses to}} {{entertain}} this theory, {{and says he}} wishes <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> so much when I see how harassed he is. That's all the thanks I get for trying to help him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Da Souza," [...] he said, [...] "if I had {{you just}} {{for five minutes}} at Bekwando we <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> {{together}} of black-mail, you and <b>I,</b> we <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> of marrying your daughter. We <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> then to some purpose--you hound! Get {{out of the room}} as fast as your legs will carry you. This revolver is loaded, and I'm not quite master of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{let me go}} on. You made me {{always go}} and talk with him for her, and you didn't think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to him for myself. Well, I didn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I greet you, Husband. I have {{returned}} from doing your business afar, {{and if this}} foolishness is finished, and the white man can spare you, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> with you alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind how I {{have become}} rich," [...] {{answered}} Saduko. [...] "I am rich; {{that is enough}} for the present. Be pleased to send for Mameena, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> with her." ...|$|E
60|$|And so John Carter, Prince of Helium, meekly {{surrendered}} {{to a single}} antagonist. The others now swarmed about us, asking many questions, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> to them, and finally my captor {{announced that he would}} lead me back to my cell.|$|R
3000|$|... “At {{first it}} (SE) was low. <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> need grammar…that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>talk</b> properly. But {{you said we}} don’t need grammar.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, the Bairds are not--but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{rather not}} <b>talk</b> of them. They are near neighbours, and among my very best customers." ...|$|R
60|$|Walkirk's plan amused me very much, and I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to my {{grandmother}} about it. When I did so, I was much {{surprised to find that}} she received the idea with favor.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We indeed!' {{cried the}} Mouse, who was {{trembling}} {{down to the}} end of his tail. 'As if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> on such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!' ...|$|E
60|$|Then I, too, called {{across the}} river, asking where was that fat captain of theirs, as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> with him. One {{of the men}} shouted back that he had stopped behind, very sick, because of a ghost that he had seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{go so far}} as that," [...] he declared, [...] "but boxing isn't {{altogether}} one of my hobbies. Can't {{we leave}} your father and his tastes alone for the present? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>talk</b> about--ourselves. Tell me what you care about most in life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless {{we can go}} as far as {{possible}} before it begins, and then take shelter under a bush or hedge, or in a house if we chance to be near one. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>talk</b> in rain any day than drive in a kittereen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But do {{not leave}} your {{grandfather}} this evening. Give him my love, and say that I think it best that I should remain at Orley Farm till the trial be over. And, Peregrine, if I were you <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>talk</b> to him much about the trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Ah yes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> with thee, but be thou seated. It wearies {{me to look}} so high," [...] and {{she made}} room for me {{beside her on the}} couch, placing herself with her back against the end, so as to have a view of my face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Albinia! I {{am afraid}} it {{is a hard}} task: but these are still early days, and we see things at a disadvantage. We shall be able to judge whether there be really too great a strain on her spirits, and if so, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to Kendal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The talk {{of white}} men is wholly lacking in dignity,' said the lama, who judged only by tone. 'But I {{considered}} the countenance of that priest and I think he is learned. Is it likely that he will understand our talk? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> to him of my Search.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are not boring me," [...] she said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>talk</b> of {{something}} else.

6000|$|... "Maclutha, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>talk</b> {{these matters}} over with my counselors.

6000|$|... "You {{would say}} so, of course--very natural. As {{a matter of}} fact I haven't heard very much. Strictly speaking, it was Martin. He {{collects}} information, and so on.
