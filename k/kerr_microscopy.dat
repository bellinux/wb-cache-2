Strongly inhomogeneous magnetic behavior of ribbons in as-quenched state is improved by field-annealing and stress-annealing processes that induce weak uniaxial longitudinal and transverse anisotropy. It was shown that values of coercive and anisotropy field increase with increasing annealing temperature. Inclination of easy axis from the ribbon axis is estimated by comparing the measured surface hysteresis loops with the Stoner–Wohlfarth model, and is supported also by the <b>Kerr</b> <b>microscopy.</b> Method with the current flowing through the ribbon is proposed for magnetic domains observations...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the magnetic-field {{dependence}} of the magnetic microstructure of the nanocrystalline soft magnet Vitroperm (Fe 73 Si 16 B 7 Nb 3 Cu 1), which was treated so as to exhibit a macroscopic magnetic anisotropy. The samples were analysed using <b>Kerr</b> <b>microscopy</b> and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). As the applied magnetic field is decreased starting from saturation, we find that two processes occur independently: the formation of a domain structure with the net magnetisation of the domains aligned along the macroscopic easy axis and the increase in magnitude of static, nanometer-scale fluctuations of the spin orientation. The domain structure observations from <b>Kerr</b> <b>microscopy</b> are in excellent agreement with the results of the SANS experiments...|$|E

40|$|The {{microscopic}} magnetization {{variation in}} magnetic domain walls in thin films {{is a crucial}} property when considering the torques driving their dynamic behaviour. For films possessing out-of-plane anisotropy normally the presence of Néel walls is not favoured due to magnetostatic considerations. However, {{they have the right}} structure to respond to the torques exerted by the spin Hall effect. Their existence is an indicator of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI). Here we present direct imaging of Néel domain walls with a fixed chirality in device-ready Pt/Co/AlOx films using Lorentz transmission electron and <b>Kerr</b> <b>microscopies.</b> It is shown that any independently nucleated pair of walls in our films form winding pairs when they meet that are difficult to annihilate with field, confirming that they all possess the same topological winding number. The latter is enforced by the DMI. The field required to annihilate these winding wall pairs is used to give a measure of the DMI strength. Such domain walls, which are robust against collisions with each other, are good candidates for dense data storage...|$|R

The benefit of this new method of contrast separation is demonstrated for permalloy films, a NdFeB sinter magnet, and a cobalt crystal. Moreover, the {{new technique}} is shown to strongly enhance the sensitivity of <b>Kerr</b> <b>microscopy</b> by eliminating parasitic contrast contributions occurring in conventional setups.
