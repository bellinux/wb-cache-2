5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. <b>Genetic</b> <b>polymorphism</b> and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research has discovered that the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effects of <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in {{cytochrome}} P 450, subfamily 1, polypeptide 1 (C 1 P 1 B 1) on primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods: A systematic literature search was performed, and random-effects meta-analyses were used to evaluate <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in CYP 1 B 1 with POAG. A gene-based analysis was conducted to investigate the cumulative effects of <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in CYP 1 B 1. Results: A total of six studies from published papers were included in our analysis. Random-effects meta-analyses failed to detect any significant association of POAG with <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in CYP 1 B 1, including rs 180040, rs 1056836, rs 10012, rs 1056827, rs 1056837, and rs 2567206. The gene-based analysis indicated that the cumulative effect of <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in CYP 1 B 1 is not associated with POAG (p> 0. 50). Conclusions: We did not find any evidence of strong association of POAG with CYP 1 B 1 <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> and their cumulative effect.

40|$|Background: Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease driven by exaggerated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interleukins. Various <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> including IL- 1 are implicated in pathogenesis of psoriasis. The exact role of IL- 1 gene polymorphisms and their interaction with NFκB {{is not yet}} determined. We aimed to study various <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> of IL- 1 in psoriasis and their influence on NFκB and histopathological features. Materials and Methods: 112 newly diagnosed cases of psoriasis vulgaris were included in this prospective study. Histology was done on sections and genotyping was done for the IL- 1 β and IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 RA) <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms.</b> In addition, NFκB immunostaining was performed on 89 sections {{and the intensity of}} staining was evaluated in the epidermis, basal cells, and the lymphocytes. Results : A strong association of IL- 1 β 511 C/T polymorphism was found with both genotypes and alleles in psoriasis. A strong correlation was also detected between the IL- 1 β genotype and the grade of NFκB immunostaining in the epidermis (P = 0. 012). The grade of NFκB lymphocyte staining showed a strong correlation with the IL- 1 RA genotype (P = 0. 025) but not with the IL- 1 β genotype (P = 0. 226). The <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> did not show any correlation with the histological features. Conclusions: IL- 1 <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> may not play a very direct role in pathogenesis of psoriasis. However, their interaction with NFκB appears to be a significant factor in this direction as NFκB is activated by pro-inflammatory <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> and therefore may influence the severity of psoriasis...|$|R

25|$|Since E. imperialis is a euglossine species, {{they are}} a non-social bee, and {{therefore}} lack the formation of colonies. Studies have shown that significant barriers to establish stable perennial colonies arise from two main factors: high diploid male production and <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphism.</b> There could be no supply of truly altruistic workers (or drones), since the supply would be inconsistent, with up to 50% of the intended diploid females actually being males. Therefore, with no drone class, colonies {{would not be able}} to adequately form. Another reason why there is such a high diploid male population is because diploid male larva live within thick, closed off resinous cells which are not readily eliminated by the females. Diploid males are therefore seen as a ‘waste’ in energy and resources, and have no adaptive value to other bees.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a balance}} is seen more simply in sickle-cell anaemia, which is found mostly in {{tropical}} populations in Africa and India.

The sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills {{a huge number of}} people each year. This is balancing selection or <b>genetic</b> <b>polymorphism,</b> balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. The heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) so long as malaria exists; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time. Because the heterozygote survives, so does the HgbS allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate (see and refs in Sickle-cell disease).|$|E
