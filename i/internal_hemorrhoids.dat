This study is a comparison between two methods of treatment of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoid,</b> Monopolar low voltage instrument (Ultroid) and Rubber Band Ligation. This method has been carried out prospectively in which 50 patients who were treated with rubber band ligation and 50 patients with Ultroid were compared according to the incidence of complications, post-operative pain and treatment response. According to this study complete success rate with Ultroid was 82 % and partial success rate was 10 % and no response to treatment was seen in 8 %. In Rubber Band method the complete response rate was 94 % (P= 0. 2). With Ultroid, 74 % of patient reported no postoperative pain, 24 % reported mild and moderate pain and 2 % of patients complained of severe pain. With Rubber band ligation, 72 % of patients reported no post-operative pain, 26 % reported mild and moderate pain and 1 % complained of severe pain (P= 0. 00). Rubber Band ligation and Ultroid are both considered as outpatient procedures for treatment of hemorrhoids. Both methods are mostly used for grade 1, 2 and sometime grade 3 hemorrhoids. In Ultroid method the operator is required to hold the probe for a period of time, and in most cases, the surgeon should spend between 20 - 25 minutes for the coagulation of three piles.

A 19 -year-old girl presented with venous malformation of the rectosigmoid colon. She showed severe anemia due to rectal hemorrhage; her hemoglobin (Hb) level was 4. 9  g/dl. A large venous malformation connected to an <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoid</b> was evident by endoscopy. Neither surgical resection nor sclerotherapy was indicated because of high blood flow in the venous malformation. Octreotide was initiated. However, the bleeding continued and she required persistent blood transfusions. We started propranolol in the 5 th week of hospitalization. Celecoxib, which was started for her knee pain {{was found to be}} predictably effective, and we administered it regularly. Propranolol and celecoxib were gradually increased, the rectal bleeding decreased, and her anemia improved. Five months after the initiation of propranolol and celecoxib, she could maintain Hb at 15  g/dl without transfusion. Propranolol can contract blood vessels and celecoxib can inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to result in anti-angiogenesis.

50|$|Hemorrhoids are {{typically}} diagnosed by physical examination. A visual {{examination of the}} anus and surrounding area may diagnose external or prolapsed hemorrhoids. A rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors, polyps, an enlarged prostate, or abscesses.

Methods: this is a cross-sectional study on 32 patients undergoing colonoscopy; 16 patients of colorectal cancer (CRC) while the other 16 patients are not (colitis and <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoid).</b> The composition of microbiota in stool samples was examined using 16 S rRNA Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DDGE) while expression of HSP 70 was examined by immunohistochemistry and Caspase- 3 by using Haematoxylin-Eosin(HE) staining to determine the morphological changes in colon tissue. Results: analysis of PCR-DDGE shows a different composition of microbiota between patients with CRC and non-CRC. All CRC patients showed disappearance of dominant band from Bifidobacterium groups. Histological observation based on Inter Class Correlation (ICC) test from all slide showed a high scores (5. 2 - 9. 2) in CRC patients and low scores (1. 7 - 2. 4) in non-CRC patients. HSP 70 expression was increased significantly in CRC patients with {{the highest percentage of}} 84 %, while expression of caspase- 3 decreased with the highest percentage of 21 %. Statistical analysis showed that the incidence of colorectal cancer was associated with the expression of HSP 70 (p< 0. 001), and Caspase 3 (p< 0. 001).

40|$|SUMMARY Rubber band {{ligation}} [RBL] {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular nonsurgical procedures available for hemorrhoids. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of RBL in respect to eradication percentages, post-procedure pain, and complications as well as the simplicity of the technique. Eighty-seven patients with 2 nd and 3 rd degree <b>internal</b> symptomatic <b>hemorrhoids</b> - denying surgical procedure - were enrolled in this study. Four patients stopped treatment after the 1 st session; 24 patients required one banding session [3 bands]; 49 patients two sessions [mean 5. 36 bands] and 14 patients three sessions [mean 6. 78 bands]. Forty-two patients [rate 52. 5 %] experienced no pain at all; 25 patients [31. 2 %] slight pain and 13 [16. 2 %] moderate pain, needing analgesics. There were three complications, all managed conservatively: one bleeding, one thrombosis and one patient experienced severe rectal pain. After termination of the treatment, and for a one-year follow up, hemorrhoids remained reduced by at least one grade, in comparison with that of the initial assessment. We conclude that rubber band ligation is a safe and effective procedure, easy to perform, thus it is advised as an office-procedure for hemorrhoid treatment...|$|R
40|$|Rubber band {{ligation}} is a {{well established}} treatment of <b>internal</b> second-degree <b>hemorrhoids.</b> Up to now, the long-term results (> 5 years) of this method have not been assessed. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the long-term success rate of rubber band ligation in patients with a first episode of second-degree hemorrhoids not responding to medical treatment (local cream with laxative). A total of 92 patients who were treated between 1979 and 1997 for second-degree hemorrhoids responded to a questionnaire. The need for complementary conservative (sclerotherapy, cryotherapy or rubber band ligation) or surgical treatment was considered indicative of relapse. The collected data were analyzed according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The average follow-up time was 5. 6 years. There were 21 patients who suffered a relapse. The probability of successful treatment was 0. 77 (range: 0. 67 - 0. 88) after 5 years and 0. 68 (range: 0. 5 - 0. 86) after 10. 6 years.

40|$|Background and objectives: Bleeding from {{hemorrhoids}} is the commonest {{cause of}} rectal bleeding in adults. Injection sclerotherapy of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{is one of}} the non-surgical treatments, and is simple, safe and feasible. Conventionally sclerotherapy is performed with rigid proctoscope which has limitations of maneuverability, narrower field of vision and documentation compared to flexible videoendoscope. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of video-colonoscopic sclerotherapy for bleeding internal hemorrhides. Methods: Seventy-nine patients of bleeding <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> were subjected to colonoscopic sclerotherapy using 1. 5 % polidocanol in retroflexed or forward viewing positions. Success of treatment was defined as cessation of bleeding for six weeks. Patients were observed for complications and were followed up regularly for 3 months. Results: A total of 79 evaluable patients, 61 had grade II and 18 had grade III hemorrhoids. There was no statistically significant differences in achieving excellent or good results for control of bleeding between patients with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids (100 % vs 94, 5 %; p> 0. 05). The number of sessions of sclerotherapy required were significantly more in grade II than grade III hemorrhoids (1. 1 ± 0. 3 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 7; p = 0. 04). No significant complications were noted except for bloating in ten patients (12. 6 %) and rectal pain in 6 (7. 6 %) patients. Median time taken for the procedure was 30 minutes.

40|$|Injection {{therapy has}} a long history of being used for the treat-ment of hemorrhoids. However, the {{previous}} results on injec-tion therapy for its complication rates and severity were not promising [1]. In this respect, aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) therapy could be a new promising option for the treatment of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> [2]. However, some complications have been reported for ALTA therapy [3]. Thus, the learning of a precise surgical procedure and careful selec-tion of the patients are vital. In addition, over-dosage and injec-tion at an inappropriate location or depth frequently lead to se-rious complications. Application of ALTA therapy for the treat-ment of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> may be a good choice, but still its efficacy for the treatment of external hemorrhoids and skin tags is limited. Thus, the surgeon should consider combined therapy (a hemorrhoidectomy and ALTA therapy) for the treat-ment of mixed hemorrhoids. Even though ALTA therapy has better treatment results than PAO therapy, well-controlled sur-gery and patient selection are still needed.
