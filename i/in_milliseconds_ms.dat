50|$|Response time is {{the amount}} of time a pixel in a display takes to change. It is {{measured}} <b>in</b> <b>milliseconds</b> (<b>ms).</b> Lower numbers mean faster transitions and therefore fewer visible image artifacts. Older monitors with long response times would create display motion blur around moving objects, making them unacceptable for rapidly moving images. Response times are usually measured from grey-to-grey transitions, but there is no industry standard.|$|E
50|$|Motor NCS are {{performed}} by electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve and recording from a muscle supplied by this nerve. The {{time it takes}} for the electrical impulse to travel from the stimulation to the recording site is measured. This value is called the latency and is measured <b>in</b> <b>milliseconds</b> (<b>ms).</b> The size of the response - called the amplitude - is also measured. Motor amplitudes are measured in millivolts (mV). By stimulating in two or more different locations along the same nerve, the NCV across different segments can be determined. Calculations {{are performed}} using the distance between the different stimulating electrodes and the difference in latencies.|$|E
50|$|In online {{multiplayer}} video games, ping {{refers to}} the network latency between a player's client and the game server. Ping is reported quantitatively as an average time <b>in</b> <b>milliseconds</b> (<b>ms).</b> The lower one's ping is, the lower the latency is and the less lag the player will experience. High ping and low ping are commonly used terms in online gaming, where high ping refers to a ping that causes a severe amount of lag; while any level of ping may cause lag, severe lag is usually caused with a ping of over 100 milliseconds. In games where timing is key, such as first-person shooter and real-time strategy games, a low ping is always desirable, as a low ping means smoother gameplay by allowing faster updates of game data between the players' clients and game server.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effects of different machine mounted area lighting technologies on visual performance. The primary objective was to conduct a comparative evaluation of the lighting technologies based on the visual performance of thirty-six human subjects in a simulated underground mine environment. Incandescent (Incand), fluorescent (Fluor), and light-emitting diode (LED) technologies were used to create four lighting combinations. Visual performance was quantified {{for the detection of}} movement in the peripheral field of view and the identification of ground hazards. Measurements were made of the speed [response time measured <b>in</b> <b>milliseconds</b> (<b>ms)</b> ], the accuracy (the number of targets and objects missed), and the subjective discomfort rating of the glare experienced for each lighting combination. A secondary objective explored {{the effects of}} aging on visual performance. The results indicate that lighting combinations which consisted of LED area lights significantly improved visual performance for the detection of hazards found in the peripheral field of view, as well as those found on the ground. They furthermore, indicate that age plays a significant role in visual performance...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that a stimulus with larger size, digit number or luminance was judged to last longer than a stimulus with smaller size, digit number or luminance <b>in</b> <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms).</b> However, there is limited research investigating whether a larger stimulus was judged to last longer than a small stimulus was due to the perceptual effect of attribute or decisional bias. This study aimed to investigate whether both the perceptual and decisional processes were involved in time judgments of visual stimuli with application of Signal Detection Theory (SDT). Experiment 1 aimed to verify that a large square was judged to last longer than a small square and a bright square was judged to last longer than a dim square. A set of novel stimuli (a large and bright square and a small and dim square) was also tested. In Experiment 1, two squares were presented consecutively on the screen, half of the participants were asked which of the two stimuli was presented for a shorter duration. The other half were asked which of the two stimuli was presented for a longer duration. Results were in line with the past research that a large stimulus was judged to last longer than a small stimulus. Experiment 2 aimed to apply SDT to differentiate the perceptual and decisional processes that were involve in time perception of visual stimuli. In Experiment 2, each time there was only one square presented on the display, participants were asked to classify a square to either a short duration group or a long duration group. Results revealed that only perceptual processes were involved in time judgment of visual stimuli. Limitations and theoretical implications of present study are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} the effects of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) on multifocal electroretinogram (MF-ERG) parameters, to correlate MF-ERG and standard electroretinogram (ERG) and to correlate MF-ERG with findings of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in cases of RVO. MethodsBoth eyes of 50 patients with RVO and 50 eyes of 25 normal subjects were examined using MF-ERG, standard ERG, fluorescein angiography and OCT. The latency <b>in</b> <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms)</b> and response density in nanovolt (nv/degenerations) were measured for each of four quadrant areas and central area. OCT was used to measure the foveal retinal thickness. Fluorescein angiography was used to measure retinal ischemia. ResultsCentral retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) markedly affected all parameters of MF-ERG. In pathological quadrants in branch retinal vein occlusion, the response densities of MF-ERG were decreased and latencies of p-wave were prolonged. The MF-ERG responses obtained from eyes with RVO were significantly different (P> 0. 05) from derived from the fellow eyes. The amplitude of MF-ERG were abnormal in 40 eyes and implicit times were delayed in 48 eyes compared with normal subjects. While 30 Hz flicker implicit were abnormal in only 24 eyes with RVO. Implicit times were prolonged in eyes with macular ischemia than in eyes without ischemia. There were significant correlation between foveal retinal thickness measured by OCT and P response density MF-ERG in cases of retinal vein occlusion. ConclusionMF-ERG is more susceptible than standard ERG to eye changes of RVO due to the multiple frequencies of stimulation used to record MF-ERG response. MF-ERG could be sensitive indicator of underlying disease affecting the retinal in eyes with RVO. MF-ERG is useful for detecting local retinal dysfunction in patients with RVO and sensitive to morphological changes and functional disorders induced by RVO...|$|R
40|$|Context. Source codes {{with lower}} level of {{readability}} impose a higher cost to software maintainability. Research also exposed the importance of readability as a vital factor on software maintainability. Therefore, readability has recently investigated by software engineers. Readability involves humanâ€™s interactions making the study on readability difficult. In this study, we explore the readability of method chain and non-method chain in Java source codes with the means of an eye tracking device as a newly-introduced approach. Objectives. Objectives of this study are: 1. we investigated {{if the number of}} methods in a method chain affects the readability of Java source codes, and 2. we investigated the readability of two programming styles: method chain and non-method chain. Methods. To achieve both objectives of this study, two controlled experiments were conducted inside a laboratory with the means of an eye tracker device. In the first experiment, treatment groups were exposed separately to method chains with different number of methods. In the second experiment, the treatment groups were exposed separately to two different programming styles: method chain and non-method chain. Results. Participants of this study were students with the average age of 24. 56 years old. Fixation durations of participantsâ€™ reading was measured <b>in</b> <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms).</b> <b>In</b> the first experiment, the average of fixation durations per method with lower number of methods was 600. 93 ms, and with higher number of methods was 411. 53 ms. In the second experiment, the average of fixation durations per method for non-method chain style was 357. 94 ms, and for method chain style was 411. 53 ms. Conclusions. In the first experiment, the analysis of fixation durations indicates that method chains with higher number of methods are slightly more readable. Analysis of t-test (t âˆ’ value = âˆ’ 0. 5121, significance level = 0. 05, and two-tailed prob-ability) confirms that the results of the first experiment does not show a significant difference at p < 0. 05. The results of the second experiment show that non-method chain style is slightly more readable in comparison with method chain style. Analysis of t-test (t âˆ’ value = 3. 1675, significance level = 0. 05, and two-tailed probability) confirms that the results of the second experiment show a significant difference at p < 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|The trans-polyproline (PII) {{oligomers}} (Figure 1) are unusually rigid peptide structures {{which have}} been extensively studied by our group for peptide mediated intramolecular electron transfer (ET) at long distances. We have previously studied ET across a series of metal ion donor (D) acceptor (A) oligoproline peptides with different distances, driving forces and reorganizational energies. The majority of these experiments involve generating the ET intermediate using pulse radiolysis methods, although more recently photochemical methods are also used. Results of these studies showed that ET across peptides can vary by more than twelve orders of magnitude. Using ruthenium bipyridine donors, ET reaction rate constants across several proline residues (n = 4 - 9) occurred <b>in</b> the <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms)</b> to {micro}s timescale, thus limiting the proline peptide conformational motions to only minor changes (far smaller than the large changes that occur on the ms to sec timescale, such as trans to cis proline isomerization). The present report describes our large data base of experimental results for D-peptide-A complexes {{in terms of a}} model where the involvement of both superexchange and hopping (hole and electron) mechanisms account for the long range ET rate constants observed. Our data shows that the change from superexchange to hopping mechanisms occurs at different distances {{depending on the type of}} D and A and their interactions with the peptides. Our model is also consistent with generalized models for superexchange and hopping {{which have been}} put forward by a number of theoretical groups to account for long range ET phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} have been {{associated}} with temporal processing <b>in</b> ranges of <b>milliseconds</b> and seconds. However, results from PD patient studies are elusive. Time perception in these patients has been tested with different approaches including repetitive movement tasks (i. e. finger tapping) and cognitive tasks (i. e. time reproduction), and both abnormal and normal performances have been reported for different time intervals. Furthermore, when PD patients were required to learn two target durations in the same session when they were off medication, they overestimated the short duration and underestimated the long duration in the seconds range. This pattern of temporal accuracy was described as a "migration effect" and was interpreted as a dysfunctional representation of memory for time (Malapani, C., Rakitin, B. C., Levy, R., Meck, W. H., Deweer, B., Dubois, B., et al. (1998). Coupled temporal memories in Parkinson's disease: A dopamine-related dysfunction. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 10, 316 - 331). Here, we controlled the emergence of similar behaviour also during <b>millisecond</b> time processing <b>in</b> PD patients. A time reproduction task was employed in which subjects were required to estimate intervals <b>in</b> <b>millisecond</b> (500 <b>ms)</b> and few second (2000 ms) ranges. In the first experiment, these intervals were tested in the same session to verify whether the migration effect was present also between time intervals <b>in</b> different <b>millisecond</b> and few second ranges. In a second experiment, they were not intermingled but were tested in two separate sessions to verify whether abnormalities depended on a selective perceptual deficit of the time intervals tested (i. e. millisecond or second ranges). All experiments were performed in both off and on therapy conditions. Our results demonstrated that PD patients showed no deficits in time estimation for time intervals <b>in</b> either the <b>millisecond</b> or few second range when the different time intervals were tested in separate sessions. This negative finding was obtained in both on and off conditions. However, when the different ranges were tested in the same session, we found that PD patients were impaired selectively for time intervals in the seconds range. Our data seem to indicate that time processing in PD patients for time intervals spanning up to 2 s is unimpaired and that abnormalities in such temporal scale may emerge only when patients have to deal with different durations, when timing involves further cognitive processes such as memory and attention...|$|R

40|$|The {{previous}} decade {{witnessed the}} increased popularity and rapid development of {{graphical user interface}} (GUI). GUI {{is a type of}} computerâ€“ human interface that allows users to communicate with their computers. This interface has significantly contributed to the popularity of recently developed software applications. Given the importance of working under an error-free GUI, the correctness of such GUI must be tested at all times. GUI testing involves checking the screens for controls, such as menus, buttons, icons and all types of bars, including tool bars, menu bars, dialog boxes and software windows. Event Flow Graph (EFG) and Behavior Explorer Testing (BXT) are two of the techniques used to generate test cases on GUI components. The correctness and time required for these two techniques to generate GUI test cases are compared in this project by using the techniques in Paint and Present applications. EFG and BXT obtained correctness rates of 9. 61 % and 36. 81 % respectively for the paint application and 5. 18 % and 39. 33 % respectively for the Present application. Therefore, BXT exhibits more correctness than EFG. In term of elapsed time, EFG and BXT spent 0. 16 <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms)</b> and 0. 18 ms in the paint application respectively and 0. 14 <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms)</b> and 0. 17 <b>millisecond</b> (<b>ms)</b> <b>in</b> the Present application respectively.

40|$|Traditional enzyme {{kinetics}} provide a poor {{explanation for the}} increased risk of lung injury in Î± 1 -antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. Millimolar concentrations of leukocyte elastase, when released from single azurophil granules of activated neutrophils, lead to evanescent quantum bursts of proteolytic activity before catalysis is quenched by pericellular inhibitors. Herein, we tested the possibility that quantum proteolytic events are abnormal in AAT deficiency. We incubated neutrophils on opsonized fluoresceinated fibronectin in serum from individuals with various AAT phenotypes, and then measured and modeled quantum proteolytic events. The mean areas of the events in serum from heterozygous individuals (Pi MZ and Pi SZ) were slightly, but significantly, larger than those in serum from normal patients (Pi M). In marked contrast, mean areas of events in serum from AAT-deficient individuals were 10 -fold larger than those in serum from normal patients. Diffusion modeling predicted that local elastase concentrations exceed AAT concentrations for less than 20 milliseconds and for more than 80 <b>milliseconds</b> <b>in</b> Pi <b>M</b> and Pi Z individuals, respectively. Thus, quantum proteolytic events are abnormally large and prolonged in AAT deficiency, leading directly to {{an increased risk of}} tissue injury in the immediate vicinity of activated neutrophils.
