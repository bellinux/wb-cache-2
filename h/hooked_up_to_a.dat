5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} with full camera control in most areas {{and the ability to}} use a first-person perspective for looking around a location, with the players able to use a widescreen mode, provided that their console is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> television set that has widescreen capabilities. The game's story focuses on two different styles of gameplay which the player switches between at various points.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck {{in some sort of}} limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E

25|$|Savage {{was known}} for his {{advertising}} skills and soon capitalized on Dan Patch's growing fame. Rather than charging an exhibition fee, Savage received a proportion of the gate receipts for crowds that grew to between 40 and 50 thousand. In most of his exhibition races, Dan Patch started behind galloping horses who were <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sulky, which gave Dan Patch a target to beat and also acted as a wind breaker. The pace makers would eventually swing wide, leaving Dan Patch alone against the clock.|$|E
25|$|Compact Disc + Graphics is {{a special}} audio compact disc that {{contains}} graphics data {{in addition to the}} audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for karaoke performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.|$|E

This was followed by Princess Raccoon (2005), starring Zhang Ziyi, a musical love story. In a 2006 interview, {{he said that he}} had no plans to direct any further films, citing health concerns. He had been diagnosed with pulmonary emphysema and was permanently <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> portable respirator. However, he attended the 2008 Tokyo Project Gathering, a venue serving film financing and international co-productions, and pitched a film titled A Goldfish of the Flame.|$|E
25|$|As {{they head}} to the Galeos, they {{encounter}} Echidna. They fight and defeat her, but Volt spares her life as she admits killing Master Mikado and framing Volt for the murder. The Galeos takes off, but as it leaves, it is attacked {{by a group of}} fighters led by Leann, who tells the trio to use an airship to catch up to it. They again confront Mugetsu, this time killing him by knocking him into the Galeos engine. Meanwhile, on board the Galeos, Dominique is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> computer, with Dauragon using her circuitry to have the satellite fire massive lasers down onto the earth, beginning with the hospital that turned him away as a boy.|$|E
25|$|The {{transplantation}} process starts {{after the}} donor lungs are inspected {{and the decision}} to transplant has been made. An incision is then made from under the patient's armpit, around to the sternum, and then back towards the other armpit; {{this is known as}} a clamshell incision. In the case of a sequential transplant the recipients lung with the poorest lung functions is collapsed, the blood vessels tied off, and cut at the corresponding bronchi. The new lung is then placed and the blood vessels reattached. To make sure the lung is satisfactory before transplanting the other a bronchoscopy is performed. When the surgeons are satisfied with the performance of the new lung, surgery on the second lung will proceed. In 10% to 20% of double-lung transplants the patient is <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> heart-lung machine which pumps blood for the body and supplies fresh oxygen.|$|E
50|$|The weak {{electrical}} impulses {{generated by}} this fish {{can be made}} audible by placing two electrodes in the fish tank that are then <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> audio amplifier or a piezoelectric earbud.

500|$|The {{brain in}} a vat {{argument}} {{has also been}} subject to criticism. Crispin Wright argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat—speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world—prior to her [...] "envatment" [...] by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., [...] "tree" [...] and [...] "grass") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment. In another scenario, a brain in a vat may be <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> supercomputer that randomly generates perceptual experiences. In this case, one's words and thoughts would not refer to anything, and would therefore be devoid of content. Semantics would no longer exist and the argument would be meaningless.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair's {{first home}} {{computer}} was the MK14, which {{was launched in}} kit form in June 1978. It {{was a long way}} from being a mass-market product. Its very name – MK standing for [...] "Microcomputer Kit" [...] – was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists. It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display (though Science of Cambridge did produce an add-on module allowing it to be <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> UHF TV); it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board; it had no built-in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory; and input was via a 20-key hexadecimal keyboard. Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10–15,000 units; by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low-cost computers that could profitably be exploited.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut {{believed}} that ideas, and the convincing communication of those {{ideas to the}} reader, were vital to literary art. He did not always sugarcoat his points: much of Player Piano leads up to the moment when Paul, on trial and <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lie detector, is asked to tell a falsehood, and states, [...] "every new piece of scientific knowledge {{is a good thing}} for humanity". Robert T. Tally Jr., in his volume on Vonnegut's novels, wrote, [...] "rather than tearing down and destroying the icons of twentieth-century, middle-class American life, Vonnegut gently reveals their basic flimsiness." [...] Vonnegut did not simply propose utopian solutions to the ills of American society, but showed how such schemes would not allow ordinary people to live lives free from want and anxiety. [...] The large artificial families that the U.S. population is formed into in Slapstick soon serve as an excuse for tribalism, with people giving no help to those not part of their group, and with the extended family's place in the social hierarchy becoming vital.|$|E
50|$|The Space Center employs {{technologies}} {{and equipment to}} achieve its simulations. In each ship, there is a powerful sound system (including a powerful bass response to simulate {{the feeling of the}} reactor core) <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> industry standard mixing board which combines input from a combination of sound sources heard through the main speakers, such as, sound effects, music, DVD players, CD players, microphones, and voice distorters.|$|R

5000|$|The CAR {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} upon multilateral foreign aid {{and the presence}} of numerous NGO's which provide numerous services which the government fails <b>to</b> provide. <b>As</b> one UNDP official put it, the CAR is a country [...] "sous serum," [...] or <b>a</b> country <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> IV. (Mehler 2005:150) The very presence of numerous foreign personnel and organizations in the country, including peacekeepers and even refugee camps, provides an important source of revenue for many Central Africans.|$|R
500|$|Anthem Visual Effects {{resumed their}} duties of {{producing}} the visual effects {{for the second}} season. The company's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season [...] "increased exponentially" [...] over the first, with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots. The produce decided to [...] "re-jig" [...] the opening title sequence, which {{they wanted to do}} each year. The photograph where Magnus meets Albert Einstein changed to aviation pilot Amelia Earhart. The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made [...] "more wonderous than we did the season before," [...] as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before. The steno in [...] "Eulogy" [...] was designed to look adorable, harmless and bunny-like in its infancy, but more menacing when it grows up. In making the Adjuster fly in [...] "Hero", both visual and practical effects were used; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> velocity rig, but in order to make him fly over the city skyline, a computer-generated avatar was created. The design of the coleanthropus in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur.|$|E
500|$|Next, they {{recorded}} {{a song that}} Barrett had written in a few minutes, [...] "Here I Go", which required no overdubs at all. This session for [...] "No Man's Land" [...] and [...] "Here I Go" [...] lasted just three hours. When {{asked if he had}} any new songs for the following week's session, on 23 April, Barrett's replied that he had [...] "a weird idea I want to try out" [...] and that other musicians would not be required. Afterwards, Barrett mentioned that he was interested in revisting one of the Jenner tracks − [...] "Rhamadam". On the morning of the 23rd, Barrett arrived at the studio with a cassette player, on which he had recorded motorbike sounds; these, he told Jones, were [...] "all ready to [...] put onto the 'Rhamadam' four track". The producer described the sound quality as [...] "terrible", an opinion that was confirmed once Barrett's player had been <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 4-track machine. Instead it was decided that Barrett should source the motorbike sounds from EMI's large sound effects library. The selection process took up to an hour, at which point Jones started to lose faith in Barrett. Later on, Barrett changed his mind and abandoned the idea.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} the Selectric mechanism natively used {{a unique}} code {{based on the}} [...] "tilt/rotate" [...] commands to the golf ball. That and the bit-parallel interface and peculiar timing requirements meant the Selectric could not be directly <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> modem. [...] Indeed, it needed a relatively large amount of logic to reconcile the two devices, and the interface logic often outweighed the printing mechanism in the early years.|$|E
25|$|Wang's {{first attempt}} at a word {{processor}} was the Wang 1200, announced in late 1971, but not available until 1972. The design consisted of the logic of a Wang 500 calculator <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> OEM-manufactured IBM Selectric typewriter for keying and printing, and dual cassette decks for storage. Harold Koplow, who had written the microcode for the Wang 700 (and its derivative, the Wang 500) rewrote the microcode to perform word processing functions instead of number crunching.|$|R

2500|$|Dobelle's first {{prototype}} was implanted into [...] "Jerry", a man blinded in adulthood, in 1978. A single-array BCI containing 68 electrodes was implanted onto Jerry’s {{visual cortex}} and succeeded in producing phosphenes, {{the sensation of}} seeing light. The system included cameras mounted on glasses to send signals to the implant. Initially, the implant allowed Jerry to see shades of grey in a limited field of vision at a low frame-rate. This also required him to be <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mainframe computer, but shrinking electronics and faster computers made his artificial eye more portable and now enable him to perform simple tasks unassisted.|$|E
2500|$|After {{her sister}} died of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Currie founded {{a group in}} New Zealand called Mothers Against Genetic-Engineering in Food and the Environment (also known as MADGE), which soon had {{thousands}} of members. Currie described this group as a [...] "rapidly growing network of politically non-aligned women who are actively resisting the use of genetically-engineered material in our food and on our land". An advert for this group featuring {{a young woman with}} four breasts <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> milking machine became famous after appearing on billboards across New Zealand. Bailey and Currie split up in 2003, and are now divorced. They both left New Zealand to live separately in Britain, but are still close friends.
