After a brief investigation of its chaotic dynamics, we propose an active adaptive <b>feedback</b> <b>coupling</b> which accomplishes the synchronization of tunnel diode based chaotic systems with and without the presence of delay(s), basing ourselves on Lyapunov and on Krasovskii-Lyapunov stability theories.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{the nature of}} {{transition}} to generalized synchronization (GS) {{in a system of}} two coupled scalar piecewise linear time-delay systems using the auxiliary system approach. We demonstrate that the transition to GS occurs via on-off intermittency route and also it exhibits characteristically distinct behaviors for different coupling configurations. In particular, the intermittency transition occurs in a rather broad range of coupling strength for error <b>feedback</b> <b>coupling</b> configuration and in a narrow range of coupling strength for direct <b>feedback</b> <b>coupling</b> configuration. It is also shown that the intermittent dynamics displays periodic bursts of period equal to the delay time of the response system in the former case, while they occur in random time intervals of finite duration in the latter case. The robustness of these transitions with system parameters and delay times has also been studied for both linear and nonlinear coupling configurations. The results are corroborated analytically by suitable stability conditions for asymptotically stable synchronized states and numerically by the probability of synchronization and by the transition of subLyapunov exponents of the coupled time-delay systems. We have also indicated the reason behind these distinct transitions by referring to unstable periodic orbit theory of intermittency synchronization in low-dimensional systems.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{biological}} networks such as protein-protein interaction networks, signaling networks, and metabolic {{networks have}} topological {{characteristics of a}} scale-free degree distribution. Preferential attachment has been considered as the most plausible evolutionary growth model to explain this topological property. Although various studies have been undertaken to investigate the structural characteristics of a network obtained using this growth model, its dynamical characteristics have received relatively less attention. Results In this paper, {{we focus on the}} robustness of a network that is acquired during its evolutionary process. Through simulations using Boolean network models, we found that preferential attachment increases the number of <b>coupled</b> <b>feedback</b> loops in the course of network evolution. Whereas, if networks evolve to have more <b>coupled</b> <b>feedback</b> loops rather than following preferential attachment, the resulting networks are more robust than those obtained through preferential attachment, although both of them have similar degree distributions. Conclusion The presented analysis demonstrates that <b>coupled</b> <b>feedback</b> loops may {{play an important role in}} network evolution to acquire robustness. The result also provides a hint as to why various biological networks have evolved to contain a number of <b>coupled</b> <b>feedback</b> loops. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{nonlinear}} <b>feedback</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism between unsteady low-Reynolds-number aerodynamics and structural response. Structural-response models addressing one-degree-of-freedom and two-degrees-of-freedom aeroelastic oscillations were {{coupled with an}} in-house-developed computational fluid dynamics code to perform large-eddy simulations for flows past a rigid airfoil in free-to-rotate and free-to-rotate-and-heave conditions at a low Reynolds number. As observed in the experiments, the numerical simulations confirmed the presence of self-sustained low-amplitude limit-cycle oscillations of a NACA 0012 airfoil. It was understood that this behavior in the transitional Reynolds-number regime resulted from the unsteadiness of the laminar boundary-layer separation and its delayed recovery {{when compared to the}} corresponding static conditions. The <b>feedback</b> <b>coupling</b> mechanism between the laminar-separation-bubble behavior and the structural response caused negative aerodynamic damping; thus, the aerodynamic forces did positive work and fed energy from the flow to the airfoil, sustaining the low-amplitude aeroelastic oscillations. The amplitude in pitch of the limit-cycle oscillations was of the order of 5 - 7 deg. As the operating angles of attack in unmanned-air-vehicle flights are within close range of the limit-cycle-oscillation occurrence, understanding and controlling the limit-cycle oscillation of the wings could ensure unmanned-air-vehicle stability so that it could acquire high-quality camera images and other data, for instance.
