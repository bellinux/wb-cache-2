5000|$|Radicchio ( [...] or [...] ) is a {{cultivated}} form of {{leaf chicory}} (Cichorium intybus, Asteraceae), sometimes known as <b>Italian</b> <b>chicory,</b> {{and is a}} perennial. It is grown as a leaf vegetable which usually has white-veined red leaves. It has a bitter and spicy taste, which mellows when it is grilled or roasted.|$|E
40|$|The quick {{dynamics}} of the vegetable production sector, characterized by rapid cropping successions and species with very different cultural needs, usually results in intensive soil tillage and management. These processes are necessary to ensure the best conditions for the crop and adequate development throughout the crop cycle from sowing, or transplanting, to harvest. Different types of soil tillage are often used {{in the creation of}} raised seed- or transplant beds. The reported experiment was aimed at evaluating the effect of raised beds, in comparison to traditional soil management, on the morpho-dimensional traits of different vegetable species. Seven vegetable crops were considered: lettuce, zucchini, green beans, rocket salad, variegated-leaved <b>Italian</b> <b>chicory,</b> long-stemmed <b>Italian</b> <b>chicory</b> and chard, transplanted and seeded in raised beds and on flat soil. At marketable size the crops were harvested and sampled in order to evaluate morphological and dimensional characteristics specific for each crop including the root system. Results showed the positive effect of raised beds, especially for transplanted crops (lettuce and zucchini), which increased yield by more than 15 % in the first case. Direct sown crops were more variable. Positive results for raised bed were recorded for rocket salad, with a weight gain of the aerial part higher than 50 %; whereas green bean did not respond significantly to soil tillage. The tillage effect was also significant on root system dimensions that, in the case of beds, was generally higher compared to the flat soil...|$|E
40|$|Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) embryo {{maturation}} {{in vitro}} was achieved in B 5 medium without growth regulators. Immature embryos were collected at different developmental stages 4 – 168 h after pollination. Only a few plantlets {{were obtained from}} ovules collected shortly after pollination since the embryos at these early stages developed abnormal leaves and roots which regenerated shoots ‘via’ organogenesis. Zygotic embryos collected 24 – 72 h after pollination needed one month of culture in vitro before acclimation. Embryos collected at the heart or early torpedo stage of development (three days after pollination) produced green plantlets {{after two weeks of}} in vitro culture and thus they could be transferred to the greenhouse for acclimation. Culture of zygotic embryos in vitro has shown to be a suitable technique to accelerate the breeding process in biennial cultivated <b>Italian</b> red <b>chicory.</b> In fact it is possible to obtain plantlets ready for performing the selection for the desired agronomic traits one month after pollination. Since flowering occurs after vernalization, the selection can be performed in the correct season before flowering...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dental caries is an {{infectious}} disease which {{results from the}} acidic demineralisation of the tooth enamel and dentine {{as a consequence of}} the dental plaque (a microbial biofilm) accumulation. Research showed that several foods contain some components with antibacterial and antiplaque activity. Previous studies indicated antimicrobial and antiplaque activities in a low-molecular-mass (LMM) fraction of extracts from either an edible mushroom (Lentinus edodes) or from <b>Italian</b> red <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus). Methods: We have evaluated the antimicrobial mode of action of these fractions on Streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of human dental caries. The effects on shape, macromolecular syntheses and cell proteome were analysed. Results: The best antimicrobial activity has been displayed by the LMM mushroom extract with a bacteriostatic effect. At the MIC of both extracts DNA synthesis was the main macromolecular synthesis inhibited, RNA synthesis was less inhibited than that of DNA and protein synthesis was inhibited only by roughly 50 %. The partial inhibition of protein synthesis is compatible with the observed significant increase in cell mass. The increase in these parameters is linked to the morphological alteration with transition from cocci of the untreated control to elongated cells. Interestingly, these modifications were also observed at sub-MIC concentrations. Finally, membrane and cytosol proteome analysis was conducted under LMM mushroom extract treatment in comparison with untreated S. mutans cells. Significant changes were observed for 31 membrane proteins and 20 of the cytosol fractions. The possible role of the changed proteins is discussed. Conclusions: This report has shown an antibiotic-like mode of action of mushroom and chicory extracts as demonstrated by induced morphogenetic effects and inhibition of specific macromolecular synthesis. This feature as well as the safe use of this extract as result of its natural origin render the LMM both mushroom and chicory extracts suitable for the formulation into products for daily oral hygiene such as mouthwashes or toothpastes...|$|R

The {{effect of}} dietary forage on the {{development}} and survival of helminth parasites in ovine faeces. Veterinary Parasitology, 118, (1 - 2), 93 - 107. Sponsorship: DEFRA/BBSRCStudies in New Zealand and the UK have shown that lambs grazing birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) or chicory (Cichorium intybus) have reduced parasite intensities compared to lambs grazing ryegrass swards. However, data {{in the literature on}} the influence of forages on helminth parasites is equivocal and the underlying mechanisms by which different forage diets may affect these parasites have not been fully determined. The aim of the experiments reported here was to investigate the hypothesis that the consumption of these forages does not affect the hatching and development of helminth eggs in the faeces subsequently produced by the host animal. Lambs grazed monoculture swards of birdsfoot trefoil, <b>chicory,</b> <b>Italian</b> ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) /red clover (Trifolium pratense) or perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) for 5 weeks and faecal samples collected on days 14, 21, 28 and 35 directly from the rectum of each lamb were used to prepare replicate cultures for each forage type on each occasion. The experiment was repeated over two consecutive years but ryegrass/red clover was not included in Year 2. The dry matter of all faeces was made constant and the faeces were cultured at 27 ?C for 7 days, before larvae were extracted, counted and identified according to genus or, where possible, species. Overall, the results showed that forage diet had no effect on egg hatchability but significantly affected the development/survival of infective helminth larvae in the faeces of the host animal. Furthermore, feeding birdsfoot trefoil to lambs was found to increase the percentage of helminth parasites that reached the infective stage in the subsequent faeces compared to other forages. Further work is needed to assess whether this would increase the number of larvae on birdsfoot trefoil swards overall under field conditions and to understand the implications of these findings in an applied farming system.
