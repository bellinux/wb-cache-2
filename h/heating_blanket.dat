50|$|Active {{external}} rewarming involves applying {{warming devices}} externally, {{such as a}} <b>heating</b> <b>blanket.</b> These may function by warmed forced air (Bair Hugger is a commonly used device), chemical reactions, or electricity. In wilderness environments, hypothermia may be helped by placing hot water bottles in both armpits and in the groin. These methods are recommended for moderate hypothermia. Active core rewarming {{involves the use of}} intravenous warmed fluids, irrigation of body cavities with warmed fluids (the chest or abdomen), use of warm humidified inhaled air, or use of extracorporeal rewarming such as via a heart lung machine or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Extracorporeal rewarming is the fastest method for those with severe hypothermia. Survival rates with normal mental functioning have been reported at around 50%.

40|$|The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) is {{building}} an accumulator ring to store antiprotons for high energy physics proton-antiproton collisions in the Tevatron accelerator. The accumulator ring, approximately 474 m in circumference, consists of many quadrupole and dipole magnets connected with stainless steel vacuum chambers for beam circulation. The vacuum pressure required {{is in the}} low 10 {sup - 10 } Torr range. To reach this pressure, the vacuum chambers are baked at 300 C each time they have been opened to atmospheric pressure. The critical problem is to bake the chambers in the magnets at high temperature without overheating the laminated magnets. Some of the magnets are 5 m long with very restrictive space for the heaters and insulation. An average space of only 7. 5 mm around the chambers is available. In this space a heating system has been designed and tested to heat the chamber to 300 C and allow a maximum temperature of 65 C next to the magnet components. This was accomplished by using a <b>heating</b> <b>blanket</b> completely covered with water cooled copper heat sink jacket to protect the magnet from the high temperatures. The design of a final selected <b>heating</b> <b>blanket</b> is discussed. A prototype test results are given with comparison of calculated and measured temperature distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{optimisation}} of {{the performance}} of products with smart/active functionalities (e. g. in protective clothing, home textiles products, automotive seats, etc.) is still a challenge for manufacturers and developers. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the thermal performance of a heating product by a numerical approach, by analysing several opposing requirements and defining solutions for the identified limitations, before the construction of the first prototype. A transfer model was developed to investigate the transport of heat from the skin to the environment, across a <b>heating</b> <b>blanket</b> with an embedded smart heating system. Several parameters of the textile material and of the heating system were studied, in order to optimise the thermal performance of the <b>heating</b> <b>blanket.</b> Focus was put on the effects of thickness and thermal conductivity of each layer, and on parameters associated with the heating elements, e. g. position of the heating wires relative to the skin, distance between heating wires, applied heating power, and temperature range for operation of the heating system. Furthermore, several configurations of the blanket (and corresponding heating powers) were analysed in order to minimise the heat loss from the body to the environment, and the temperature distribution along the skin. The results show that, to ensure an optimal compromise between the thermal performance of the product and the temperature oscillation along its surface, the distancebetween the wires should be small (and not bigger than 50 mm), and each layer of the <b>heating</b> <b>blanket</b> should have a specific thermal resistance, based on the expected external conditions during use and the requirements of the heating system (i. e. requirements regarding energy consumption/efficiency and capacity to effectively regulate body exchanges with surrounding environment). The heating system should operate in an ON/OFF mode based on the body heating needs and within a temperature range specified based on the blanket total thermal resistance, external temperature during use, and observed temperature on the blanket outer surface (safety and energy efficiency aspects). The approach described in this work enabled the definition of the textile properties, the features of the embedded heating system, and the overall design of the system thus reducing substantially the number of prototypes needed for the final performance optimisation and fine-tuning...|$|E

40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} {{systems have been}} developed {{over the past several}} decades and now include patches for birth control, nicotine addiction, and pain relief. The local application of heat can increase the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the skin and result in faster delivery of the drug and shorter time to reach a steady state concentration of the drug. While this procedure is desirable for some systems where a faster dose will aid in alleviating pain and/or symptoms, it can also be a cause of concern for some drugs. Fentanyl, a chronic pain relief drug, can cause accidental death by overdose. We report herein an analysis of the effects of various heating situations on transdermal fentanyl delivery based upon a model developed using COMSOL Multiphysics. The utilization of such a model allows for the determination of situations which may be potentially dangerous for fentanyl drug users, and enables the development of usage guidelines and safety mechanisms for transdermal delivery systems. Using the computer model, the following cases were simulated: no applied heat, ThermaCare heat pad, fever, and <b>heating</b> <b>blanket.</b> The <b>heating</b> <b>blanket</b> and ThermaCare heat pad simulations showed the most dangerous increases in fentanyl blood concentration above no-heat levels: about 180 % and 100 %, respectively, over 30 hours; by contrast, the patient fever model reported a 40 % increase in fentanyl blood concentration. These simulations demonstrate the dangers of fentanyl transdermal pain patches when skin temperature is increased, and can be used to develop better patient guidelines for patch use and to improve fentanyl transdermal systems. Lastly, this computer model may be used to model other transdermal {{drug delivery}} systems for the improvement of patient guidelines and/or the development of new systems, thus decreasing the need for experimentation on subjects...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} thermal {{state of the}} neutron star in the Cassiopeia A {{supernova}} remnant using the recent result of Ho & Heinke (Nature, 462, 71 (2009)) that the thermal radiation of this star is well-described by a carbon atmosphere model and the emission comes from the entire stellar surface. Starting from neutron star cooling theory, we formulate a robust method to extract neutrino cooling rates of thermally relaxed stars at the neutrino cooling stage from observations of thermal surface radiation. We show how to compare these rates with the rates of standard candles [...] stars with non-superfluid nucleon cores cooling slowly via the modified Urca process. We find that the internal temperature of standard candles is a well-defined function of the stellar compactness parameter x=r_g/R, irrespective of the equation of state of neutron star matter (R and r_g are circumferential and gravitational radii, respectively). We demonstrate that the data on the Cassiopeia A neutron star can be {{explained in terms of}} three parameters: f_ℓ, the neutrino cooling efficiency with respect to the standard candle; the compactness x; and the amount of light elements in the <b>heat</b> <b>blanketing</b> envelope. For an ordinary (iron) <b>heat</b> <b>blanketing</b> envelope or a low-mass (≲ 10 ^- 13 M_) carbon envelope, we find the efficiency f_ℓ∼ 1 (standard cooling) for x ≲ 0. 5 and f_ℓ∼ 0. 02 (slower cooling) for a maximum compactness x≈ 0. 7.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Keeping {{abdominal}} surgery patients warm is common and warming methods {{are needed in}} power outages during natural disasters. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low-cost, low-power warming methods for maintaining normothermia in {{abdominal surgery}} patients. METHODS: Patients (n = 160) scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were included in this prospective clinical study. Five warming methods were applied: heated blood transfusion/fluid infusion vs. unheated; wrapping patients vs. not wrapping; applying moist dressings, heated or not; surgical field rinse heated or not; and applying heating blankets or not. Patients' nasopharyngeal and rectal temperatures were recorded to evaluate warming efficacy. Significant {{differences were found in}} mean temperatures of warmed patients compared to those not warmed. RESULTS: When we compared temperatures of abdominal surgery patient groups receiving three specific warming methods with temperatures of control groups not receiving these methods, significant differences were revealed in temperatures maintained during the surgeries between the warmed groups and controls. DISCUSSION: The value of maintaining normothermia in patients undergoing abdominal surgery under general anesthesia is accepted.
