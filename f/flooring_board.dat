50|$|With {{the help}} of the Rail Heritage Trust, the station <b>floor</b> <b>boards</b> have been {{completely}} renewed and the building repaired. The flooring job was a major task, as it was discovered that the station had been built with the floor lying straight on top of the dirt. There was no space for air circulation or drainage. Before the <b>floor</b> <b>boards</b> could be laid, the whole area had to be dug out, with large amounts of dirt being removed to allow for adequate space underneath the <b>floor</b> <b>boards.</b> The original wall, floors, and ceiling were beautifully constructed in native tongue and groove timber. All wiring, including underfloor, was completely renewed and new plumbing installed, with the addition of three new toilets.|$|R
