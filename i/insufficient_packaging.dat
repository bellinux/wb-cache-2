40|$|Analysis and {{presentation}} of this thesis {{is supported by}} studies of many relevant cases where the major arguments are set around the exclusion clauses concerning the ‘all risks cover’ policy as found in Institute Cargo Clauses. Two cases are especially emphasized, namely Mayban General Assurance BHD v. Alstom Power Plants Ltd. and Global Process Systems Inc v. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad, {{mainly because of the}} special nature of the subject matter insured in these cases. The legal issues arising from claims of loss during sea transportation of large technical equipments turn out to be complicated and might lead to different application of the law due to the special nature of the subject-matter insured. All risks insurance policies have many exclusion clauses expressly listed, however, most arguments about liabilities for damage to large equipments arise from application of these two clauses, namely inherent vice and improper or <b>insufficient</b> <b>packaging.</b> Inherent vice as well as insufficiency or improper packing are both exclusion clauses for insurer's liability under an all risk insurance policy. Different interpretation of the terms themselves might lead to different judgements regarding liability. Thus identifying the sources of such terms in different legislative works becomes very important. More often than not, the causes of such types of loss are complicated and involve mutual interaction between causes, and so it is necessary to discuss how the exclusion clauses are applied as well as their interactions. In practice, damage from inherent vice can and often will develop with the assistance of a fortuitous external circumstance such as harsh weather conditions which, if qualified as a peril of the sea and considered the sole proximate cause of the loss, could guarantee the insurance cover, even if inherent vice is an excluded clause in the all risks cover policy. It is very important to discuss the causational link between perils and losses, to identify the proximate causes to the loss and to discuss the insurance cover under situations where concurrent proximate causes of similar efficiency contribute to a loss. The purpose of this thesis is to make a presentation of these two exclusion clauses for ‘all risks’ insurance cover under British marine cargo insurance policy and discuss their application in previous cases. Frequent reference to the Marine Insurance Act 1906 and the Institute Cargo Clauses will be found in this thesis. There will also be found a discussion from perspectives of British maritime legislation, Norwegian maritime legislation, as well as Chinese Maritime legislation. At the end of this thesis, I’d like to enclose a simple legislative comparison between British marine cargo insurance and Chinese PICC insurance policy, through which a better understanding of different approaches for solutions under different jurisdiction will be gained...|$|E
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} the National Open Apprenticeship Scheme on youth employment in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State, Nigeria. Data were collected with the aid of the structured questionnaire administered to 120 randomly selected youths in the study area. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results revealed high (79. 2 %) level of awareness and high (84. 2 %) level of participation by respondents in the scheme. More participation by the respondents in the scheme were on catering with 11. 3 % response and welding and fabrication with 10. 0 % response. Socio-economic effect of the scheme was more on employment generation with 87. 5 % response. Major problems of respondents in the scheme were, exclusion of some participants from resettlement benefits which accounted for 76. 3 % of the problem and <b>insufficient</b> resettlement <b>package</b> which accounted for 71. 3 % of the problem. Increasing the number of participants to benefit from the scheme’s resettlement package and improving the content of the resettlement package are recommended...|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{substrate}} {{provides a}} cost effective solution to BGA assembly with high density I/Os. It also {{acts as a}} buffer to the mismatch of {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between die and printed circuit board, releasing thermal stress. To meet the new challenge from the high reflow temperatures due to the use of Pb-free solder, substrates made of high performance engineering plastic materials with sophisticated microstructures are increasingly employed in the packaging industry. However, we have limited knowledge on many newly invented substrates, for instance, their thermal and mechanical properties, their performance under difference conditions including temperature and stresses, particularly the structure-property relationships. With <b>insufficient</b> database, <b>packaging</b> engineers have difficulty in package structure design, performance simulation and service life prediction. In this study, five different plastic substrates manufactured for Pb-free PBGA assembly were tested. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscope (SEW and X-Ray analysis were employed to disclose the material compositions, microstructure and filler loading. Elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the substrates were determined at room temperature by tensile tests. Thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) was performed to determine the CTE and the glass transition temperature in x-, y- and z-directions. Dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) was used to determine the dynamic behavior under cyclic loadings. The effects of the glass fibers, polymer matrix, fillers and plated through hole (PTH) on the thermal and mechanical properties of the substrates were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The endomembrane {{system is}} the {{defining}} feature of eukaryotic cells and ensures that the appropriate proteins are sorted and transported to their correct subcellular location where they perform their biological functions. The coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates the formation of COPII vesicles, which are responsible for exporting proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The core COPII coat consists of five proteins: the small GTPase Sar 1, the Sec 23 / 24 heterodimer, and the Sec 13 / 31 heterotetramer. The recognition and subsequent packaging of cargo into COPII vesicles is mediated by interaction with the Sec 24 subunit. The development of a cell-free vesicle budding reaction has facilitated a biochemical analysis of COPII trafficking. Initial experiments examining COPII packaging of mammalian cargo proteins suggested that while some cargo proteins could be packaged directly by the core COPII components, other cargo proteins seemed to require additional cytosolic factors for efficient packaging. Whether auxiliary cytosolic factors exist to promote the COPII packaging of a specific subset of cargo proteins is the central question that motivated the work described in this dissertation. This question was first approached using Vangl 2, a cell surface localized transmembrane protein involved in planar cell polarity signaling, as a model cargo molecule. However, {{during the course of}} characterizing COPII packaging of Vangl 2 in vitro, it was determined that this was not the appropriate system to address this question. As a result, proTGFα, the precursor form of transforming growth factor alpha, was chosen as a model cargo protein to continue to address the central question. Here, I describe the key observations that show the existence of auxiliary cytosolic factor(s) that are required for efficient COPII packaging of specific cargo. In the particular case of proTGFα, both its recruitment by the COPII machinery and its final packaging into COPII vesicles require the cooperation of one or more auxiliary cytosolic factors and a transmembrane cargo receptor, Cornichon- 1. Moreover, I present evidence showing that interaction of cargo proteins with the COPII coat is <b>insufficient</b> for <b>packaging</b> into COPII vesicles. This suggests that cargo recruitment and vesicle packaging are two distinct steps of COPII vesicle formation. Taken together, these observations provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of COPII vesicle formation in mammals...|$|R
40|$|In most countries, {{domestic}} {{transport of}} products is predominantly made on roads. Protective packaging {{is used to}} protect the freight from the shocks and vibration encountered during this type of transportation. Inefficient packaging constitutes a significant problem that costs {{hundreds of billions of}} dollars and has an important environmental impact. An <b>insufficient</b> level of <b>packaging</b> increases the occurrence of product damage during transport, whereas excessive packaging increases the packages weight and volume which is costly throughout the supply chain. In order to reduce these costs, packaging protection is currently optimised by simulating the vibration produced by road vehicles. Despite these simulations being prescribed by many standards, it is broadly acknowledged that these methods oversimplify the Road Vehicle Vibration (RVV) which imposes a significant limit on packaging optimisation. More complex RVV models have been recently developed to enhance simulations. However, the fundamental problem still remains; none of these alternatives consider the different excitation modes contained in RVV: i. e. the nonstationary random vibration induced by pavement’s profile and vehicle speed random variations; the shocks caused by pavement’s aberrations and discontinuities; and the sinusoidal (harmonic) vibration caused by unbalanced wheels and the engine-borne vibration. These excitation modes should be included in the RVV simulation to ensure that simulations are realistic and accurate and that the packaging will protect against vibration during transport without being too excessive. Each of these modes is represented by a different mathematical model and cannot be analysed with the same statistical tools. This means that they have to be characterised separately in order to create an accurate RVV simulation model. This task is challenging because all the excitation modes are simultaneously present in the acceleration signal recorded on a vehicle. This PhD thesis proposes to use machine learning to separate these modes from a signal. Being a first attempt to apply this approach to index RVV, the most common classification algorithms are used to identify the two predominant modes; i. e. the nonstationary vibration and the shocks. The important novelty of this approach is that algorithms integrate many RVV analysis methods such as moving statistics, the Discrete Wavelet Transform and the Hilbert-Huang Transform. A comprehensive evaluation and optimisation of the classification algorithms was performed using synthetically generated RVV signal. The best performing algorithm was applied on a real measurement dataset. The RVV mode decomposition will greatly increase the ability to correctly optimise the level of packaging required. An accurate model comprising all the characteristics inherent to RVV will be a considerable step forward to reduce unnecessary level of protective packaging without risking damage to products...|$|R
