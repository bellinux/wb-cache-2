I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I think it would be presumptuous and wrong on my part if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States. I believe this, and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.He was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a [...] "security risk", to which he testified: ...|$|E

500|$|The ensuing feud between Conrad and Montag {{received}} extensive {{media attention}} since its beginning; Conrad was doubtful {{of the possibility}} of a reconciliation, noting that [...] "I can see us getting to not hating each other but I don't think we would ever go back to being best friends." [...] When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television, Conrad stated that [...] "I wouldn't fight for the camera. If anything <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> not to." [...] In a separate interview, she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began, stating [...] "it wasn't so much about the filming, but I didn't want to do a show with the other people on it", which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the miners}} had {{converted}} their overtime ban into an all-out strike, Prime Minister Edward Heath called a snap general election. Two days before polling day, on Tuesday 26 February, Adamson addressed {{a conference of}} senior managers organised by the Industrial Society at which he was asked what the Conservatives should do, if re-elected, about the Industrial Relations Act. Adamson replied [...] "if I were them <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> {{to get close to}} the unions and hammer out something better (than the Act)", going on to say that amendment of the Act was not possible because [...] "it is so surrounded by hatred that we must have a more honest try at another Act".|$|E
2500|$|On {{choosing}} {{a career in}} chess, Duchamp said, [...] "If Bobby Fischer came to me for advice, I certainly would not discourage him—as if anyone could—but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to make it positively clear that he will never have any money from chess, live a monk-like existence and know more rejection than any artist ever has, struggling to be known and accepted." [...] Duchamp left a legacy to chess {{in the form of}} an enigmatic endgame problem he composed in 1943. The problem was included in the announcement for Julian Levi's gallery exhibition Through the Big End of the Opera Glass, printed on translucent paper with the faint inscription: [...] "White to play and win". Grandmasters and endgame specialists have since grappled with the problem, with most concluding that there is no solution.|$|E
2500|$|According to Weiner, {{he chose}} the 1960s because [...] "every time <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> and find {{something}} interesting that I wanted to do, it happened in 1960. It will blow your mind {{if you look at}} the year on the almanac. And it's not just the election [...] The pill came out in March 1960, that's really what I wanted it to be around.... That's the largest change in the entire world. Seriously, it's just astounding. Especially {{if you look at the}} movies from the 50s. Once it was acceptable to talk about this idea that teenagers were having sex, which they have been doing, obviously, since time immemorial, there were all these movies like Blue Denim, and Peyton Place ... he central tension in every movie that does not take place on the battlefield is about a girl getting pregnant. So all of a sudden that entire issue [...] has been removed from society. That was what I was interested in in 1960." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1936 the Swedish {{composer}} Gösta Nystroem, that was curator at Göteborgs Konsthall 1934-36, organizes a scholarship to Billman. Billman was {{given the opportunity to}} study art in March and April in Antwerp. The journey gave inspiration for new motifs. But above all had the harbour environments strongly reminded him of his years as a sailor. Within a year after the trip he made some of his classic black and white woodcuts with sailor motifs such as: Through the Red Sea - Changing of the guard in the stokehole (1936) and The newly signed on sailors (1936), which is one of Billman's best-known woodcuts. About the woodcut [...] Stoker watch goes over deck in the storm (1936/37) the artist said: [...] "I remember the first scene I got inspiration from. It was when the watch came up and the boat was filled with water and there they stood up to their necks in water, so to speak. That I thought, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> to portray. But it took many years. I had stored such motifs." [...] "I've experienced all my images myself", Torsten Billman often underlined.|$|E

[...] Straw is quoted as stating that an application under the prisoner transfer agreement was turned down. Straw denied that the release was part of any deal, while Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond reiterated that the release had been granted on compassionate grounds and not as part of any deal struck by the British Government.|$|E
