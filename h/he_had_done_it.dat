5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

Meanwhile, all the other boys passed theirs, and he felt isolated. Just before the ceremony marking their departure Suzuki went to the Rinzai teacher and blurted out his answer.

While watching the Kraft Music Hall anthology television show some months before, Cagney had noticed Jack Lemmon performing left-handed. The first thing that Cagney asked Lemmon when they met was {{if he was still}} using his left hand. Lemmon was shocked; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> on a whim, and thought no one else had noticed.

500|$|Following Pakistan, Boycott and the England team {{travelled}} to New Zealand. England {{were defeated}} in the opening Test {{for the first time}} in 48 years. Boycott took seven hours and 22 minutes to score 77 runs, and England were bowled out for 64 when chasing 137 to win. In the second match, Botham's first Test century took England to 418, but by the end of the match England needed to score quickly to force a win. Boycott, however, told his team that he would play the way he always had, and proceeded to accumulate runs very slowly. Derek Randall was run out, and Botham went out to bat with his captain, informing the dressing room that [...] "Boycs will be back in here before the end of the over." [...] Botham then ran Boycott out, later claiming in his autobiography that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> deliberately. Indeed, some have suggested that this was a team order. Boycott disputes the suggestion that the run-out was deliberate in his autobiography, referring to Botham's account as [...] "a story that gets bigger and more fanciful with every telling". The tale does nevertheless remain a renowned story. Boycott then delayed his declaration, much to the frustration of England bowler Bob Willis. England did eventually declare, and Willis took 4/14. New Zealand were bowled out for 105 and England won by 174 runs. Boycott suffered a scratch on his cornea and missed the last two days of the final match, and by the start of the 1978 season, Brearley had taken the captaincy back from Boycott.|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{also claimed}} that Lodge put Diệm on hold {{in order to}} inform Conein where the Ngô {{brothers}} were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane {{would have to go}} directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: [...] "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." [...] The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that [...] "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> to induce Diệm to give up {{at a time when the}} outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Romances was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews by music critics. Terry Jenkins of AllMusic praised the collaborative work of Silvetti and Manzanero and called Romances [...] "a sensuous, enchanting album". Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune called Miguel's voice the album's strong point and noted the [...] "presence of electronic instruments and the darker, more somber mood". On the other hand, she felt that Miguel was beginning [...] "to slip", citing the tracks [...] "Jurame" [...] and [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] as examples. Fernando Gonzalez wrote for the Orange County Register noting although the album is [...] "Impeccably produced, arranged and recorded", he felt that boleros [...] "demand more than that". Gonzalez elaborated: [...] " [...] He sounds simply loud, rather than romantic, in [...] "Sabor a Mi; he comes across as (soap) operatic rather than tormented in [...] "El Reloj [...] "; he is a star -- not a humble student -- in [...] "Contigo Aprendi"." [...] The Corpus Christi Caller-Times music critic Rene Carbrera wrote a positive review of the album praising the string arrangements as [...] "elegantly done" [...] and complimented Miguel's take on [...] "Sabor a Mí" [...] and [...] "La Gloria Eres Tu" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> [...] "delightfully done in the traditional way and flavored with Trio Los Panchos requinto [...] "cling" [...] endings." [...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News wrote an unfavorable review of the recording; he criticized its productions for having all the tracks [...] "awash in silky keyboards and airy strings with {{just a hint of}} percussion in the background". He also panned its lead single [...] "Por Debajo de la Mesa" [...] for coming off as a [...] "love song for the chaste" [...] due to its arrangements being [...] "so stifling, so precious, it's difficult to feel any sensuality".|$|E
500|$|After a brief {{run as a}} {{face that}} saw him {{defeating}} Chris Benoit at No Mercy, Triple H reverted to his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi to run down Austin at Survivor Series, causing {{him to take a}} year off. While in the storyline Triple H said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10feet high. Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin. In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven. The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock, forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!, and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy. Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship {{for the first time at}} Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a [...] "Winner Take All" [...] tag team match. As Triple H was still Intercontinental Champion, the win made him a double champion.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the Australian innings the {{temperature}} dropped and a breeze came up which helped the Australian bowlers Alan Davidson and Ray Lindwall with their swing. Peter Richardson and Trevor Bailey were soon out and at 11/2 Peter May (37), promoted to number 3 to protect the other batsmen, and Colin Cowdrey (84) were back at the crease. They attacked the bowling with finely tuned strokes and with Graveney (41) took England to 170/3, May was bowled by Richie Benaud (5/91) when he tried to hit him for six. On the fourth day England collapsed to 188/9, Gordon Rorke (3/23) starting the rot by bowling Cowdrey, who edged the ball onto his stumps, and having Graveney caught by Benaud despite the ball coming off the bat at high speed. Tom Graveney recalled [...] "I had a personal experience of Richie's tactical genius...he held up play while he moved the short leg round a couple of yards. It interrupted my flow because I was forced to wonder why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> and whether I should be expecting a new direction from the bowler. This was exactly the reaction that Richie had wanted. There was no reason for the move other than to apply psychological pressure. He was a master at upsetting the concentration of batsman and reach their subconscious" [...] Benaud then dismissed Trueman, Lock, Tyson and Evans, two caught by Wally Grout, one by Burke and the other by the bowler himself. England were 89 runs short of saving the follow on, but Willie Watson and Brian Statham stayed at the crease for 70 minutes. Statham, who batted left-handed, hit 6 fours in a new highest Test score of 36 not out. Lindwall was given the new ball, but could only shave the stumps as Statham hit out. Davidson tripped in one of Trueman's foot marks and had to retire from the field. In the end Rorke bowled Watson to end the 52 run last wicket stand 37 runs short of their target. Rorke on debut returned figures of 18.1–7–23–3, his low economy due to his large number of almost wides and high pace and in one three over spell only one ball could have been played.|$|E
