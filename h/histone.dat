5|$|In nuclear polyadenylation, a poly(A) tail {{is added}} to an RNA {{at the end of}} transcription. On mRNAs, the poly(A) tail protects the mRNA {{molecule}} from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm and aids in transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation. Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated, with the exception of animal replication-dependent <b>histone</b> mRNAs. These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly(A) tail, ending instead in a stem-loop structure followed by a purine-rich sequence, termed <b>histone</b> downstream element, that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3' end of the <b>histone</b> mRNA is formed.|$|E
50|$|Five major {{families}} of <b>histones</b> exist: H1/H5, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. <b>Histones</b> H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 {{are known as}} the core <b>histones,</b> while <b>histones</b> H1/H5 are known as the linker <b>histones.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Histones</b> {{are small}} polycationic {{proteins}} {{located in the}} cell nucleus. Together, DNA and <b>histones</b> are integral constituents of the nucleosomes. Upon apoptosis, necrosis and infection - induced cell death, <b>histones</b> are released from the cell. The extracellular <b>histones</b> have strong antimicrobial activity but are also cytotoxic and thought as mediators of cell death in sepsis. The antimicrobial activity of the cationic extracellular <b>histones</b> is inhibited by the polyanionic DNA and F-actin, which also become extracellular upon cell death. DNA and F-actin protect <b>histones</b> from degradation by the proteases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. However, though {{the integrity of the}} <b>histones</b> is protected, the activity of <b>histones</b> as antibacterial agents is lost. The inhibition of the <b>histone's</b> antibacterial activity and their protection from proteolysis by DNA and F-actin indicate a tight electrostatic interaction between the positively charged <b>histones</b> and negatively charged DNA and F-actin, which may have physiological significance in maintaining the equilibrium between the beneficial antimicrobial activity of extracellular <b>histones</b> and their cytotoxic effects...|$|R

5|$|Components of the RNAi pathway {{are used}} in many eukaryotes in the {{maintenance}} of the organization and structure of their genomes. Modification of histones and associated induction of heterochromatin formation serves to downregulate genes pre-transcriptionally; this process is referred to as RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS), and is carried out by a complex of proteins called the RITS complex. In fission yeast this complex contains argonaute, a chromodomain protein Chp1, and a protein called Tas3 of unknown function. As a consequence, the induction and spread of heterochromatic regions requires the argonaute and RdRP proteins. Indeed, deletion of these genes in the fission yeast S. pombe disrupts <b>histone</b> methylation and centromere formation, causing slow or stalled anaphase during cell division. In some cases, similar processes associated with <b>histone</b> modification have been observed to transcriptionally upregulate genes.|$|E
5|$|The {{expression}} of genes {{is influenced by}} how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the <b>histone</b> protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and <b>histone</b> modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.|$|E
30|$|The {{cellular}} {{source of}} extracellular <b>histones</b> remains unclear. <b>Histones</b> {{are reported to}} be released from apoptotic/necrotic cells in vitro [3, 12]. Therefore, <b>histones</b> may be released by damaged cells during ALI. In addition to this possibility, <b>histones</b> are known to be associated with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [13]. NETs are structures composed of DNA, <b>histones,</b> and granular proteins (e.g., elastase, myeloperoxidase) released by neutrophils in response to a variety of agonists. NET release has been demonstrated during experimental ALI [9]. Therefore, <b>histones</b> in the extracellular space may be from dead/dying cells, from neutrophils, or from both sources. Further investigation is needed to clarify the source of extracellular <b>histones</b> during ALI.|$|R
40|$|<b>Histones</b> {{are known}} for their ability to bind to and {{regulate}} expression of DNA. However, <b>histones</b> are also present in cytoplasm and extracellular fluids where they serve host defense functions and promote inflammatory responses. <b>Histones</b> are a major component of neutrophil extracellular traps that contribute to bacterial killing but also to inflammatory injury. <b>Histones</b> can act as antimicrobial peptides and directly kill bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, in vitro and in a variety of animal hosts. In addition, <b>histones</b> can trigger inflammatory responses in some cases acting through Toll-like receptors or inflammasome pathways. Extracellular <b>histones</b> mediate organ injury (lung, liver), sepsis physiology, thrombocytopenia and thrombin generation and some proteins can bind <b>histones</b> and reduce these potentially harmful effects...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism. This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the <b>histone</b> protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the <b>histone</b> and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E

5|$|RNA {{sequences}} (siRNA and miRNA) {{that are}} complementary {{to parts of}} a promoter can increase gene transcription, a phenomenon dubbed RNA activation.

5|$|The ancestral {{function}} of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes.

25|$|Although <b>histone</b> {{modifications}} occur {{throughout the}} entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called <b>histone</b> tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation and citrullination. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 lysines of the tail of <b>histone</b> H3 by <b>histone</b> acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally related to transcriptional competence.|$|E
25|$|Chromatin {{undergoes}} various {{structural changes}} during a cell cycle. <b>Histone</b> proteins {{are the basic}} packer and arranger of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing (<b>Histone</b> modification). Most of the modifications occur on the <b>histone</b> tail. The consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified {{and the type of}} modification. For example, <b>Histone</b> acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription. Lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of <b>histone</b> H3 Lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (tri-methylation of <b>histone</b> H3 Lysine 9 or 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously. For example, it was proposed that a bivalent structure (with tri-methylation of both Lysine 4 and 27 on <b>histone</b> H3) was involved in mammalian early development.|$|E

40|$|By {{selective}} dissociation of <b>histones</b> {{with the}} ionic detergent sodium deoxycholate, we {{have demonstrated that}} these basic chromosomal polypeptides, which are effective inhibitors of transcription, are more tenaciously bound to DNA in mitotic than in S-phase chromatin. Evidence is presented which suggests that cell-cycle-stage-specific non-histone chromosomal proteins can account for such variations in the association of <b>histones</b> with DNA. When chromatin is reconstituted with DNA and <b>histones</b> are pooled from S-phase and mitotic cells and either S-phase or mitotic non-histone chromosomal proteins, a preferential extraction of <b>histones</b> with sodium deoxycholate from chromatin reconstituted with S-phase rather than mitotic non-histone chromosomal proteins is observed. In contrast, the extractability of <b>histones</b> with sodium deoxycholate from nucleohistone complexes reconstituted with DNA pooled from S-phase and mitotic cells and either S-phase or mitotic <b>histones</b> is identical. Since non-histone chromosomal proteins rather than <b>histones</b> {{are responsible for the}} differences in chromatin template activity during S-phase and mitosis, we propose that non-histone chromosomal proteins may modify gene expression during the cell cycle by mediating the binding of <b>histones</b> to DNA...|$|R

Additionally, a <b>histone</b> variant called macroH2A (H2AFY) is exclusively found on nucleosomes along the Xi.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>histone</b> {{chaperone}} that {{associates with}} the replisome is Asf1, which {{interacts with the}} Mcm complex dependent on <b>histone</b> dimers H3-H4. Asf1 is able to pass newly synthesized H3-H4 dimer to deposition factors behind the replication fork and this activity makes the H3-H4 <b>histone</b> dimers available {{at the site of}} <b>histone</b> deposition just after replication. Asf1 (and its partner Rtt109) has also been implicated in inhibiting gene expression from replicated genes during S-phase.|$|E
25|$|Another {{implication}} of <b>histone</b> acetylation {{is to provide}} a platform for protein binding. As a posttranslational modification, the acetylation of histones can attract proteins to elongated chromatin that has been marked by acetyl groups. It has been hypothesized that the <b>histone</b> tails offer recognition sites that attract proteins responsible for transcriptional activation. Unlike <b>histone</b> core proteins, <b>histone</b> tails {{are not part of the}} nucleosome core and are exposed to protein interaction. A model proposed that the acetylation of H3 histones activates gene transcription by attracting other transcription related complexes. Therefore, the acetyl mark provides a site for protein recognition where transcription factors interact with the acetylated <b>histone</b> tails via their bromodomain.|$|E
40|$|<b>Histones</b> are primary {{components}} of eukaryotic chromatin and highly abundant in all animal cells.

Several mechanisms regulating and facilitating the antimicrobial action of <b>histones</b> against pathogens have been described in vertebrate and some invertebrate species, including the production of Extracellular Traps (ETs) and the accumulation of <b>histones</b> in lipid droplets that can be selectively released in response to immune stimuli.

25|$|Acetylation has {{the effect}} of {{changing}} the overall charge of the <b>histone</b> tail from positive to neutral. Nucleosome formation is dependent on the positive charges of the H4 histones and the negative charge on the surface of H2A <b>histone</b> fold domains. Acetylation of the <b>histone</b> tails disrupts this association, leading to weaker binding of the nucleosomal components. By doing this, the DNA is more accessible and leads to more transcription factors being able to reach the DNA. Thus, acetylation of histones is known to increase the expression of genes through transcription activation. Deacetylation performed by HDAC molecules has the opposite effect. By deacetylating the <b>histone</b> tails, the DNA becomes more tightly wrapped around the <b>histone</b> cores, making it harder for transcription factors to bind to the DNA. This leads to decreased levels of gene expression and is known as gene silencing.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that the <b>histone</b> lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is {{responsible}} for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 & H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the <b>histone</b> tail and causes the methylation of the <b>histone.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{also has}} <b>histone</b> deacetylase-inhibiting effects.
