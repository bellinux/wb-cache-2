5|$|In April 2013, Sutton met Kevin Spacey's filmmaker-in-residence Grigorij Richters while rehearsing {{as part of}} {{the drummer}} group for the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final at Wembley Stadium. They quickly became friends. Richters and his team began following him around for several months, filming Sutton at home with his family and at several fundraisers. In the summer of 2013 Sutton went on holiday to Ibiza (his last travel) with his close friends. Richters equipped him with several <b>GoPro</b> cameras. The documentary is in development, as of 2016, and will be made into a feature-length film.|$|E
5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used <b>GoPro</b> cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E

500|$|The title design, {{that was}} awarded Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest, {{was made by}} Allison and Anthony Brownmoore of Blue Spill {{production}} studio. Kijak's requirement was to [...] "blow people off their seats". According to Anthony Brownmoore, the project was a challenge, since he [...] "was very taken by their [...] look but that can also be quite daunting. To try to make something and be creative with something that's already so mad and so creative". They worked on the title design for months, syncing it to the song [...] "Jade" [...] {{the way that the}} images would pulsate to Yoshiki's drum beats. When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a <b>GoPro</b> camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E

2500|$|While making Everest, {{which was}} filmed using {{equipment}} such as <b>GoPro</b> cameras and 4K technology, the producers collaborated with the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) in Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand (India), to shoot the telenovela. Filmed in Nepal and India, the filming locations included Lukla and Everest Base Camp (which is located at [...] above sea level) in Nepal and Pokhran, Jaipur and Jodhpur, in Rajasthan, Uttarkashi and the Dokriani Glacier (which is located at [...] above sea level) in India. The crew of Everest had to shoot the telenovela in extreme temperatures and required additional oxygen {{to cope with the}} increased altitude, making {{it difficult for them to}} shoot. They had to trek in Uttarakhand for 10 days to film the telenovela.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{performing}} such {{a sequence}} {{proved to be}} very dangerous. If one person crashes with the other, {{it could lead to}} the disproportion of the flight pattern and subsequently could result in death. Due to this, safety became a top priority for Core. Prior to shooting, the stuntmen went to the location, and to other locations which were similar, to start training in groups. In order to get comfortable with the wingtip-to-wingtip flights necessary to pull the scene off, the wingsuiters initially jumped from planes, racking up more than 500 jumps {{over the course of the}} year leading up to filming. They would fly in tight formations over and over again, simply as a way of getting accustomed to the idea of having someone nearby at all times. The production team also went to Switzerland 12 days prior to shooting to practice. [...] During the shoot, there were ground-based cameras with long lenses, and a helicopter with a gyro-stabilized camera as well. Since Core needed a series of shots to create the sequence, from point of view shots to profile shots of the wingsuiters cruising past the mountain to close-ups – unlike filming <b>GoPro</b> cameras – one of the wingsuiters needed to wear a cinema-quality camera on his head, rather than a <b>GoPro.</b> The task went to Florez and Boole, who had never done camera work before. The Red camera used in the flights weighed an astounding 15 pounds, enough to significantly alter the way pilots normally flew. The wingsuiters made over 60 jumps in the course of two weeks to get all the shots. Corliss called it the most dangerous stunt that has ever been filmed for a movie.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike some of {{the smaller}} {{adjustments}} though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence. In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence, using a camera crane on a truck. When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four <b>GoPro</b> cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on Gravity, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying [...] "instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen [...] the proper red bounce from the red bricks and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well." [...] Rodeo FX then completed the final shots. The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrone commented that before the sequence was finished they [...] "had only imagined what it was going to feel like", but once it was completed [...] "it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away." ...|$|E
30|$|Taking {{photos and}} video clips {{has never been}} easier. One can record videos at high frame rates (e.g., 240 fps are {{available}} on the iPhone), in high resolution (4 K resolution available on <b>GoPros),</b> or even in 360 ° [1]. Such technical convenience yields a sheer amount of user-generated visual data being shared over the Internet. For example, over 400 h of videos are uploaded to YouTube every minute [2]. Accordingly, such a huge amount of visual data poses great challenges on storing, analyzing, indexing, and searching these unstructured photo/video collections. To unleash the wealth of information embedded within the ever expanding corpora of visual media, we need efficient and effective content-based data association algorithms for large-scale unordered photo/video collections.|$|R
50|$|Specialized {{omnidirectional}} {{cameras and}} rigs {{have been developed}} for the purpose of filming 360-degree video, including rigs such as <b>GoPro's</b> Omni and Odyssey, the Nokia OZO, the Facebook Surround 360, the Kodak Pixpro SP360 4K Dual Pack Pro and the Axon's AZilPix Studio.One (all of which consist of multiple cameras installed into a single rig), the Vuze camera, handheld dual-lens cameras such as the Ricoh Theta S, Samsung Gear 360, Garmin VIRB 360, and the Kogeto Dot 360—a panoramic camera lens accessory developed for the iPhone 4, 4S, and Samsung Galaxy Nexus.In videoconferencing, 360° cameras are used, so that all participants on one location can be recorded with one camera.

2500|$|Aragno {{said that}} he and Godard did not want to use 3D as a typical special effect or gimmick. Instead, they wished to use it [...] "to express new things." [...] Several cameras were used, but the {{majority}} was shot on the Canon 5D and the Canon 1DC. Other cameras included <b>GoPros</b> and Lumixes. Aragno used Leica lenses on the Canons [...] "because the Canon lenses are too perfect... How can {{you fall in love with}} a digitally perfect person? To err is human! The Leica lenses have some involuntary imperfections." [...] The Canon cameras allowed them to shoot most of the film using natural or available light sources. Godard intentionally framed shots for 3D images, such as when the character's shadows are in 2D but the sidewalk is in 3D. The dog in the film is Godard's own pet Roxy Miéville, whom Godard would film whenever he took him for a walk. Godard used consumer cameras from Fujifilm and Sony for these shots. Aragno also shot some footage independently before production officially began, including shots of his two children running around olive trees.|$|R
