25|$|The {{church is}} {{rectangular}} in plan with an entrance foyer in the north-west corner, {{linked to a}} brick and concrete bell tower by a covered walkway. The main elevation {{of the church is}} asymmetrical, with the end walls of the wings flanking the central arch being constructed of different materials. The concrete parabolic arch is in-filled with a timber framed glazed wall, with a reinforced concrete cross forming the central spine and a raised brick <b>garden</b> <b>bed</b> running along the base. A series of horizontal ridges on {{the outer edge of the}} parabolic arch are remnants of the original roof cladding system. To the side of the arch is the end wall of the eastern aisle, which features small, cross-shaped openings in the brickwork, in-filled with glass. A plaque commemorating the laying of the foundation stone is located here. The entrance foyer on the western side is fully glazed with timber framing and a low brick <b>garden</b> <b>bed</b> along the north side.|$|E
25|$|The {{main feature}} of Lions Park {{is a series}} of long terraces, formed by boulder walls and garden beds that descend the steep slope falling from Canberra Terrace. A number of trees are planted {{throughout}} this area, including wind-stunted endemic Eucalypt species and Grevillea robusta. Along the Canberra Terrace boundary is a small car park with a <b>garden</b> <b>bed</b> at the southern end. A sandstone block in this garden displays a plaque containing historical information about the lighthouses. To the east of the <b>garden</b> <b>bed</b> is a boulder set in a round concrete footing with a memorial plaque dedicated to World War II servicemen attached (erected 1991). With the exception of the memorial, none of the remainder of these elements is considered to be of state-level cultural heritage significance. It is the extent of the largely undeveloped site (part of the original lighthouse reserve) that is significant, rather than the elements that comprise the park.|$|E
25|$|The {{bell tower}} is {{approximately}} 11 metres high, surmounted by an aluminium cross. The tower is constructed from two parallel reinforced concrete walls with decorative brickwork {{on the outer}} faces. The two walls are linked by horizontal concrete beams and a bell is hung near the top. A rough render {{has been applied to}} the concrete surfaces, with a raised cross ornamenting to the top of each side. A low, rectangular, brick <b>garden</b> <b>bed,</b> originally a reflection pool, projects {{from the front of the}} tower.|$|E

6000|$|SCENE: [...] A {{fairly large}} room in DR. JONATHAN's house in Foxon Falls, which [...] has been {{converted}} into a laboratory. The house antedates the [...] PINDAR mansion, having been built {{in the first decade of}} the [...] nineteenth century, and though not large, has a certain distinction [...] and charm. The room has a panelled wainscoting and a carved wooden [...] mantel, middle left, painted white, like the doors. Into the [...] fireplace is set a Franklin stove. The windows at the rear have [...] small panes; the lower sashes are raised; the tops of the hollyhocks [...] and foxgloves in the <b>garden</b> <b>bed</b> may be seen above the window sills, [...] and the apple trees beyond. Under the windows is a long table, on [...] which are chemical apparatus. A white enamelled sink is in the rear [...] right corner. The walls are whitewashed, the wooden floor bare. A [...] door, left, in the rear, leads into DR. JONATHAN'S office; another, [...] middle right, into a little front hall.|$|E
6000|$|But {{they must}} decay very quickly, these roots, {{to leave their}} quite fresh graves thus empty: and--now one thinks of it--how few fallen trees, or even dead sticks, there are about. An English wood, if left to itself, would be cumbered with fallen timber; and one has heard of forests in North America, through which it is all but {{impossible}} to make way, so high are piled up, among the still- growing trees, dead logs in every stage of decay. Such a sight {{may be seen in}} Europe, among the high Silver-fir forests of the Pyrenees. How is it not so here? How indeed? And how comes it--if you will look again--that there are few or no fallen leaves, and actually no leaf-mould? In an English wood there would be a foot-- perhaps two feet--of black soil, renewed by every autumn leaf fall. [...] Two feet? One has heard often enough of bison-hunting in Himalayan forests among Deodaras one hundred and fifty feet high, and scarlet Rhododendrons thirty feet high, growing in fifteen or twenty feet of leaf-and-timber mould. And here, in a forest equally ancient, every plant is growing out of the bare yellow loam, as it might in a well- hoed <b>garden</b> <b>bed.</b> Is it not strange? ...|$|E

6000|$|MARY sat musing on the lamp-flame at {{the table}} [...] Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step, [...] She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage [...] To meet him in the doorway with the news [...] And put him on his guard. [...] "Silas is back." [...] She pushed him outward with her through the door [...] And shut it after her. [...] "Be kind," [...] she said. [...] She took the market things from Warren's arms [...] And set them on the porch, then drew him down [...] To sit {{beside her on the}} wooden steps. [...] "When was I ever {{anything}} but kind to him? [...] But I'll not have the fellow back," [...] he said. [...] "I told him so last haying, didn't I? [...] 'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.' [...] What good is he? Who else will harbour him [...] At his age for the little he can do? [...] What help he is there's no depending on. [...] Off he goes always when I need him most. [...] 'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay, [...] Enough at least to buy tobacco with, [...] So he won't have to beg and be beholden.' [...] 'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay [...] Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.' [...] 'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.' [...] I shouldn't mind his bettering himself [...] If that was what it was. You can be certain, [...] When he begins like that, there's someone at him [...] Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,-- [...] In haying time, when any help is scarce. [...] In winter he comes back to us. I'm done." [...] "Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," [...] Mary said. [...] "I want him to: he'll have to soon or late." [...] "He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove. [...] When I came up from Rowe's I found him here, [...] Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep, [...] A miserable sight, and frightening, too-- [...] You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him-- [...] I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed. [...] Wait till you see." [...] "Where did you say he'd been?" [...] "He didn't say. I dragged him to the house, [...] And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke. [...] I tried to make him talk about his travels. [...] Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off." [...] "What did he say? Did he say anything?" [...] "But little." [...] "Anything? Mary, confess [...] He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me." [...] "Warren!" [...] "But did he? I just want to know." [...] "Of course he did. What would you have him say? [...] Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man [...] Some humble way to save his self-respect. [...] He added, if you really care to know, [...] He meant to clear the upper pasture, too. [...] That sounds like something you have heard before? [...] Warren, I wish you could have heard the way [...] He jumbled everything. I stopped to look [...] Two or three times--he made me feel so queer-- [...] To see if he was talking in his sleep. [...] He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember-- [...] The boy you had in haying four years since. [...] He's finished school, and teaching in his college. [...] Silas declares you'll have to get him back. [...] He says they two will make a team for work: [...] Between them they will lay this farm as smooth! [...] The way he mixed that in with other things. [...] He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft [...] On education--you know how they fought [...] All through July under the blazing sun, [...] Silas up on the cart to build the load, [...] Harold along beside to pitch it on." [...] "Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot." [...] "Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream. [...] You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger! [...] Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him. [...] After so many years he still keeps finding [...] Good arguments he sees he might have used. [...] I sympathise. I know just how it feels [...] To think of the right thing to say too late. [...] Harold's associated in his mind with Latin. [...] He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying [...] He studied Latin like the violin [...] Because he liked it--that an argument! [...] He said he couldn't make the boy believe [...] He could find water with a hazel prong-- [...] Which showed how much good school had ever done him. [...] He wanted to go over that. But most of all [...] He thinks if he could have another chance [...] To teach him how to build a load of hay----" [...] "I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment. [...] He bundles every forkful in its place, [...] And tags and numbers it for future reference, [...] So he can find and easily dislodge it [...] In the unloading. Silas does that well. [...] He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests. [...] You never see him standing on the hay [...] He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself." [...] "He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be [...] Some good perhaps to someone in the world. [...] He hates to see a boy the fool of books. [...] Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk, [...] And nothing to look backward to with pride, [...] And nothing to look forward to with hope, [...] So now and never any different." [...] Part of a moon was falling down the west, [...] Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills. [...] Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw [...] And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand [...] Among the harp-like morning-glory strings, [...] Taut with the dew from <b>garden</b> <b>bed</b> to eaves, [...] As if she played unheard the tenderness [...] That wrought on him beside her in the night. [...] "Warren," [...] she said, [...] "he has come home to die: [...] You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time." [...] "Home," [...] he mocked gently. [...] "Yes, what else but home? [...] It all depends on what you mean by home. [...] Of course he's nothing to us, any more [...] Than was the hound that came a stranger to us [...] Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail." [...] "Home is the place where, when you have to go there, [...] They have to take you in." [...] "I should have called it [...] Something you somehow haven't to deserve." [...] Warren leaned out and took a step or two, [...] Picked up a little stick, and brought it back [...] And broke it in his hand and tossed it by. [...] "Silas has better claim on us you think [...] Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles [...] As the road winds would bring him to his door. [...] Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day. [...] Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich, [...] A somebody--director in the bank." [...] "He never told us that." [...] "We know it though." [...] "I think his brother ought to help, of course. [...] I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right [...] To take him in, and might be willing to-- [...] He may be better than appearances. [...] But have some pity on Silas. Do you think [...] If he'd had any pride in claiming kin [...] Or anything he looked for from his brother, [...] He'd keep so still about him all this time?" [...] "I wonder what's between them." [...] "I can tell you. [...] Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him-- [...] But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide. [...] He never did a thing so very bad. [...] He don't know why he isn't quite as good [...] As anyone. He won't be made ashamed [...] To please his brother, worthless though he is." [...] "I can't think Si ever hurt anyone." [...] "No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay [...] And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back. [...] He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge. [...] You must go in and see what you can do. [...] I made the bed up for him there to-night. [...] You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken. [...] His working days are done; I'm sure of it." [...] "I'd not be in a hurry to say that." [...] "I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself. [...] But, Warren, please remember how it is: [...] He's come to help you ditch the meadow. [...] He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him. [...] He may not speak of it, and then he may. [...] I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud [...] Will hit or miss the moon." [...] It hit the moon. [...] Then there were three there, making a dim row, [...] The moon, the little silver cloud, and she. [...] Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her, [...] Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited. [...] "Warren," [...] she questioned. [...] "Dead," [...] was all he answered.|$|E
