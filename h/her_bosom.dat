25|$|The myth of Huitzilopochtli {{is uniquely}} Aztec. Huitzilopochtli is {{therefore}} {{considered to be}} the cult god or the patron god of the Aztec. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with Tonatiuh. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was Coatlicue, or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near Tula, Hidalgo) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground. She decided to save them and placed them in <b>her</b> <b>bosom.</b> Without her realizing, the feathers impregnated her.|$|E

500|$|As a music critic, Cardus's romantic, instinctive {{approach}} {{was the opposite}} of Newman's objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman's reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman [...] "probed into Music's vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against <b>her</b> <b>bosom</b> {{and listened to the}} beating of her heart." [...] Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman's own prose showed the influence of Cardus's style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he [...] "reminds us that there is an understanding of the heart {{as well as of the}} mind... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally". Colin Davis highlighted [...] "the quality and verve of Cardus's writing", which had made him a household name.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that <b>her</b> <b>bosom</b> {{was a major}} force behind the {{development}} of the 1950s brassieres, including the whirlpool bra, cuties, the shutter bra, the action bra, latex pads, cleavage-revealing designs, and uplifted outlines. R. L. Rutsky and Bill Osgerby have claimed that it was Mansfield, along with Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot, who made the bikini popular. Drawing on the Freudian concept of fetishism, British science fiction writer and socio-cultural commentator J. G. Ballard commented that Mae West, Mansfield and Monroe's breasts [...] "loomed across the horizon of popular consciousness." [...] According to Dave Kehr, as the 1960s approached, the anatomy that had made her a star turned her into a joke. In this decade, the female body ideal shifted to appreciate the slim waif-like features popularized by supermodel Twiggy, actress Audrey Hepburn and others, demarcating the demise of the busty blonde bombshells.|$|E
500|$|The verdict {{did nothing}} to assuage the ferocity of the debate. [...] Transcripts of the trial were {{extremely}} popular, and portraits of the implacable young maid were offered for sale from shop windows. [...] A reward was offered for information on anyone who had attacked Gascoyne, but mainly the Grub Street press concerned itself with {{the fallout from the}} affair. [...] The Gazeteer was filled with satirical letters between such authors as Aristarchus, Tacitus, and T. Trueman, Esq. [...] One such, a Canningite called Nikodemus, complained that without gypsies, [...] "what would become of your young nobility and gentry, if there were no bawds to procure young girls of pleasure for them?" [...] Those on Squires's side were not the only ones to come under such attacks; John Hill wrote a short song celebrating his and Gascoyne's role in the affair, and pictures of Canning in the loft, her bodice loosened to reveal <b>her</b> <b>bosom,</b> were readily available. [...] Another showed Wells and Squires held aloft by a broomstick, an obvious allusion to witchcraft.|$|E

500|$|<b>Her</b> <b>bosom</b> {{was so much}} a part of {{her public}} persona that talk-show host Jack Paar once welcomed the actress to The Tonight Show by saying, [...] "Here they are, Jayne Mansfield", a line written for Paar by Dick Cavett that became the title of her {{biography}} by Raymond Strait. Joan Jacobs Brumberg describes the 1950s as [...] "an era distinguished by its worship of full-breasted women" [...] and attributes the paradigm shift to Mansfield and Monroe. Almost half a century after her death, a biographer of Nikolaus Pevsner (a German-born writer on British architecture), noted the improbable coincidence that Pevsner and Mansfield had once stayed at the same hotel in Bolton, Lancashire. [...] There, she had [...] "electrified the dining room with her imposing bosom". Patricia Vettel-Becker makes that observation more specific by attributing the phenomenon to Playboy and the appearance of Mansfield and Monroe in the magazine. Anita Ekberg and Bettie Page are also added to the list of catalysts besides Mansfield and Monroe. Drawing on the Freudian concept of fetishism, British science fiction writer and socio-cultural commentator J. G. Ballard commented that Mae West, Mansfield and Monroe's breasts [...] "loomed across the horizon of popular consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{published}} {{synopsis of}} the film was listed in Reel Life states: [...] "Sparks learns, upon visiting his fiancee, Bianca, an art student, that his friend, Tom Brown, a writer, is living across the court. He soon sees that Bianca and Brown are mutually attracted and plans to play a joke upon his friend, which shall make the latter doubt his own sanity. He persuades Bianca to enact a scene with him before the drawn window curtain in which she is attacked by {{a man with a}} pistol and drawing a dagger from <b>her</b> <b>bosom,</b> defends herself, killing her assailant. Brown, seeing all this in silhouette on the shade, rushes to Bianca's assistance. He finds her reading peacefully, and is told that the incident must have been an hallucination of his own brain. A few evenings after this Bianca actually is attacked by a burglar. Brown, who now is [...] "on" [...] to {{the fact that in the}} former instance his friend Sparks had designs upon him, at first thinks this also is another of Sparks' [...] "jokes". However, he goes stealthily to investigate and is just in time to save the girl, who breaks her engagement to Sparks and marries Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|Rutter {{inserted}} {{an anonymous}} English poem from the 15th century, Of a Rose, a lovely Rose, {{as the second}} movement. Marked [...] "Tranquil and flowing", it imitates chant singing, with flexible times and in doric mode. The poet imagines Jesus as a rose springing from Mary, comparable to [...] "". She {{is seen as a}} rose bush with five branches: the Annunciation, the Star of Behlehem, the three Kings, the fall of the devil's power, and heaven. The last stanza asks Mary to “shield us from the fiendes bond”. The eight stanzas, in four lines of which three rhyme, are set as variations of an old tune. The short refrain is first sung by the soprano alone, immediately repeated by soprano, alto and tenor, the voices in unison but for triads on [...] "lovely". It is repeated after the first stanza by soprano and tenor in unison. After the fourth stanza, it appears again, now in three different parts, and a last time before the final prayer, again slightly different. The first stanza ("... this rose began to spring ...") is sung by the bass, the second ("... out of <b>her</b> <b>bosom</b> ...") by the alto, the third ("... an angel from heaven's tower ...") by two sopranos and alto, the fourth ("... star shone over Bethlehem ...") by tenor and bass, the fifth ("... three kinges ...") by the bass, the sixth ("... sprang to hell ...") by four parts SATB, the seventh ("... sprang to heaven ...") by soprano and alto, the final prayer ("Pray we to her ...") by four parts again but mostly in unison.|$|E

500|$|... "Gerald {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his father announcing the death of Claude and calling him home to assume his position as the heir of the estates of Sir James. Gerald places the letter in his pocket together with the newspaper account of the marriage of Claude and decides not to return to England but to remain {{and care for the}} lawful wife of his brother, whom he has grown to love fondly. Some time afterward he goes to his mine, wheeling the girl along with him. He wheels her to the mouth of the shaft and leaves her, after throwing his coat over the arm of her chair. His devotion has caused her to love him. She tries to change her position and the coat falls to the ground. She picks it up and the letter from England and the paper falls out. She reads the announcement of the marriage of Claude and then, feeling justified, she reads the letter announcing the death of Claude and of Gerald being heir to the estates and a gentleman. She reflects and then draws the forged letter from <b>her</b> <b>bosom</b> and sees that it was written after the announcement of the marriage. It is all revealed to her. The sacrifice of Gerald — the double duty, love and a desire to uphold the honor of the proud English family. She cries to Gerald but cannot make him hear. In her desperation she tries to wheel her chair down the slope and it is overturned. Her cries bring Gerald and when he comes she shows him the newspaper and the letter. He is silent. He cannot explain. She reaches out her arms to him and is clasped to his heart." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{started with}} a {{performance}} by Level 42. As their performance ended, the lights started blinking all around the stadium and Finch appears on stage, looking for Madonna. He is followed by two other dancers, who jump around the stage and disappear. Then Madonna's silhouette is visible behind a screen which has paintings by Tamara de Lempicka on it. She performs dance moves behind the screen, which starts going up slowly. She wore a black pointy corset and fishnets like the costume in the music video of [...] "Open Your Heart". After dancing on the stairs, using a chair as a prop, Madonna descends and starts singing the song. Later Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends. This {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] during which [...] a disco ball spun above the stage; as Madonna and her dancers moved around it, the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. For [...] "True Blue", Madonna came up on the stage wearing a blue, silk taffeta dress over her corset and a blue scarf hidden in <b>her</b> <b>bosom.</b> The stage had a similar blue setting like the original music video. Madonna is backed up by her singers who play her girlfriends. At the end of the song Madonna is asked to dance again by the dancer playing her man in the performance. During [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] Madonna wore a black leather jacket over her dress and walked around the stage while singing. The screen in the background showed portraits of Pope John Paul II and then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan, along with scenes of John Perry III's short film, The Nightmare, ending with the words [...] "Safe Sex", as Madonna finished the song. She dedicated the song to the Pope, marking her first conflict with the Vatican, as Pope John Paul II urged Italian fans to boycott her concerts.|$|E
