25|$|The major flaw of {{this law}} was {{that it could be}} used only when the {{majority}} of municipal councils in a province petitioned for it. Since landowners usually controlled such councils, no province <b>ever</b> <b>asked</b> that the law be applied. Therefore, Quezon ordered that the act be mandatory in all Central Luzon provinces. However, contracts were good for only one year. By simply refusing to renew their contract, landlords were able to eject tenants. As a result, peasant organizations clamored in vain for a law that would make the contract automatically renewable {{for as long as the}} tenants fulfilled their obligations.|$|E

Shatner said that another reason they decided to make the film was because Nimoy was visibly getting old. Shatner asked Nimoy if {{he would be willing to}} discuss his experiences with alcoholism in the film, and Nimoy agreed. Nimoy later said that no one had <b>ever</b> <b>asked</b> him about this part of his past, and that discussing it in Mind Meld [...] "was an opportunity to put out some information that might be helpful to some people." ...|$|E
500|$|Green {{was arrested}} on November 22 in Kansas City, Missouri, shortly after {{dropping}} off her daughter for ballet practice. Though Green's attorneys had requested that if arrested, Green be allowed to turn herself in voluntarily, the police and district attorney felt that her behavior was too unpredictable, and chose to arrest her without warning. [...] Green was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of aggravated arson. In a subsequent press conference, District Attorney Paul J. Morrison cited a [...] "domestic situation" [...] as the motive for Green's alleged crimes. Green was initially held in a Missouri jail, then extradited to Johnson County Adult Detention Center in Kansas, on $3,000,000 bond, the highest bail <b>ever</b> <b>asked</b> for in Johnson County.|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody <b>ever</b> <b>asked</b> me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E

2500|$|Mitchel {{wrote in}} his The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps), on the same subject, that no one from Ireland <b>ever</b> <b>asked</b> for charity during this period, {{and that it was}} England who sought charity on Ireland's behalf, and, having {{received}} it, was also responsible for administering it. He suggested that it has been carefully inculcated by the British Press [...] "that the moment Ireland fell into distress, she became an abject beggar at England's gate, and that she even craved alms from all mankind." [...] He affirmed that in Ireland no one <b>ever</b> <b>asked</b> alms or favours of any kind from England or any other nation, but that it was England herself that begged for Ireland. He suggested that it was England that [...] "sent 'round the hat over all the globe, asking a penny for the love of God to relieve the poor Irish", and, constituting herself the agent of all that charity, took all the profit of it.|$|E

Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or the looters who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce." ...|$|E
