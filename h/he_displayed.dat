5|$|Ernest Emerson {{was born}} on March 7, 1955 in {{northern}} Wisconsin. While attending high school <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> athletic ability as a wrestler and baseball player, being drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals to play professional baseball {{at the age of}} 17 in the Midwest League.|$|E
5|$|Sunday's {{speed was}} his {{greatest}} asset, and <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> it {{both on the}} basepaths and in the outfield. In 1885, the White Stockings arranged a race between Sunday and Arlie Latham, the fastest runner in the American Association. Sunday won the hundred-yard dash by about ten feet.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. <b>He</b> <b>displayed</b> aggression but often attempted difficult shots and consequently lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Berger had {{achieved}} {{the rank of}} Major der Reserve in the Wehrmacht by 1938, but his initial rank upon joining the Allgemeine SS was SS-Standartenführer, based upon his SA service. Berger {{played a key role}} in directing the fifth column Sudetendeutsches Freikorps during the Sudeten Crisis in Czechoslovakia in 1938, and the organisational skills <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> there marked him as highly suitable for the SS recruiting role.|$|E
5|$|Moore and Nash {{were on the}} organising {{committee}} of the International Surrealist Exhibition, {{which took place in}} London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709 13 December 1784) was an English author born in Lichfield, Staffordshire. He was {{a sickly}} infant who early on began to exhibit the tics that would {{influence}} how people viewed {{him in his}} later years. From childhood <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> great intelligence and an eagerness for learning, but his early years were dominated by his family's financial strain and his efforts to establish himself as a school teacher.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{appeared}} in regional theatres in Bristol, Liverpool and Hull. In 1925, he performed in London as the Archangel in The Sign of the Sun, and played first Lewis Dodd {{and then the}} Major in separate productions of The Constant Nymph. He received instruction in verse speaking under famed theatre director William Bridges-Adams in the Stratford Festival Company at Stratford-upon-Avon, where he played some of his early Shakespeare roles, including Romeo in Romeo and Juliet, Ferdinand in The Tempest and Prince Hal in Henry IV in 1926. He was criticised for the audacity <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> in the latter role. When Prince Hal takes on his kingship and rejects the self-indulgent character Falstaff, convention of the day called for Prince Hal to change from a jovial drinking partner to an arrogant snob, but Shaw saw the view as simple-minded and contradictory toward Shakespeare's script. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> inward regrets about leaving Falstaff and accepting the new responsibilities. The interpretation was criticised at the time but, years later, became the standard approach to the character.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Craig {{was unable}} to maintain the level of performances that <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> in the previous Australian summer. In a season which contained no international cricket, he scored 395runs {{at an average of}} 35.90 in eight matches, placing him 20th in the season's run scoring list. He scored 93 in an eight-wicket victory over South Australia, and 106 for Arthur Morris's XI in a testimonial match against Lindsay Hassett's XI, his first century against Australian opposition.|$|E

5|$|After {{years in}} the tag team division, Hardy took on The Undertaker in a ladder match for the WWE Undisputed Championship. Hardy came up short in the intense match, but earned The Undertaker's respect when <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> courage by {{attempting}} to rise to his feet after the bout and challenge The Undertaker to continue. Hardy competed for singles titles on several occasions and defeated William Regal for the European Championship. Hardy was defeated {{a few weeks later}} by Rob Van Dam in a ladder match to unify the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and the European Championship was retired. Finally, the Hardy Boyz split apart, as Hardy continued to pursue his singles ambitions on Raw and his brother, Matt left Raw for his own singles pursuits signing with Stephanie McMahon's SmackDown! brand. On Raw, Hardy would compete in WWE's Hardcore division until the title's unification with the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through the degrees according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor of Castile {{had died}} on 28November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple loved each other. Moreover, like his father, Edward was very {{devoted to his}} wife and was {{faithful}} to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. <b>He</b> <b>displayed</b> his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night. As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister Margaret, but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war.|$|E

5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> for the lives and well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 2011, Challinor {{signed for}} Kettering's Conference Premier rivals York City on a {{contract}} until January 2012, having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier. He made his debut a day later, coming on as a 56th-minute substitute for Patrick McLaughlin in a 0–0 draw away to Fleetwood Town. Challinor was soon converted into a right back at York, a position in which <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> composure {{and an ability to}} start attacking moves. His first goal for York came in a 4–2 win away to Hayes & Yeading United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom right corner of the goal {{from the edge of the}} penalty area.|$|E

5|$|The artistic {{community}} appreciated {{his work}} in this vein, and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer Léon Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> the loquaciousness and temperament {{for which he is}} better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him when they met at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} {{of seven children}} of Hjálmtýr E. Hjálmtýsson, a bank clerk, and Margrét Matthíasdóttir, a writer, Paul Oscar was born on 16 March 1970 in Reykjavík. As a child <b>he</b> <b>displayed</b> artistic talent in drawing, writing fairy tales and singing – his mother had him sing for the women in her sewing club and at family birthday parties. He also spent much time singing in choirs and in media commercials, and recorded his first album {{at the age of}} seven. His first leading role in a professional theatre production was at 12years of age in the musical version of Rubber Tarzan, a popular Danish children's novel by Ole Lund Kirkegaard (1940–1979). His voice broke two weeks after the musical's last performance, and he did not sing for the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Unaware of the American intentions, the British and Canadians {{thought that}} King, Boerstler and Winder had been {{intended}} {{as the first}} wave of Smyth’s invasion rather than as a preparatory raid. The Canadian press praised the “gallant achievement” of the defenders in apparently repulsing the Americans and singled out Bisshopp for particular congratulation. In his dispatch to Prevost, Major General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, the British commander in Upper Canada, wrote that “Lieut.-Colonel Bisshopp deserves high commendation for the spirit and activity <b>he</b> <b>displayed,</b> and great credit is due the officers and men who acted under his orders.” Bisshopp was killed the following summer while leading the Raid on Black Rock.|$|E
