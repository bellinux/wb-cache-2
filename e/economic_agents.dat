Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output.

5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Paul Krugman {{released}} his book The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008, arguing that economic {{conditions similar to}} what existed during the earlier part of the 20th century had returned, making Keynesian policy prescriptions more relevant than ever. In February 2009 Robert J. Shiller and George Akerlof published , a book where they argue the current US stimulus package is too small as {{it does not take}} into account Keynes's insight on the importance of confidence and expectations in determining the future behaviour of businesspeople and other <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|E
5|$|Keynesians and monetarists {{recognized}} that people based their economic decisions on {{expectations about the}} future. However, until the 1970s, most models relied on adaptive expectations, which assumed that expectations were based on an average of past trends. For example, if inflation averaged 4% over a period, <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> were assumed to expect 4% inflation the following year. In 1972 Lucas, influenced by a 1961 agricultural economics paper by John Muth, introduced rational expectations to macroeconomics. Essentially, adaptive expectations modeled behavior {{as if it were}} backward-looking while rational expectations modeled <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> (consumers, producers and investors) who were forward-looking. New classical economists also claimed that an economic model would be internally inconsistent if it assumed that the agents it models behave as if they were unaware of the model. Under the assumption of rational expectations, models assume agents make predictions based on the optimal forecasts of the model itself. This did not imply that people have perfect foresight, but that they act with an informed understanding of economic theory and policy.|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b> No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b> This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E

25|$|Helpful here is J. K. Gibson-Graham's complex {{topology}} of {{the diversity}} of contemporary market economies describing different types of transactions, labour, and <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b> Transactions can occur in black markets (such as for marijuana) or be artificially protected (such as for patents). They can cover the sale of public goods under privatization schemes to co-operative exchanges and occur under varying degrees of monopoly power and state regulation. Likewise, there are a wide variety of <b>economic</b> <b>agents,</b> which engage in different types of transactions on different terms: one cannot assume the practices of a religious kindergarten, multinational corporation, state enterprise, or community-based cooperative can be subsumed under the same logic of calculability. This emphasis on proliferation can also be contrasted with continuing scholarly attempts to show underlying cohesive and structural similarities to different markets.|$|E

25|$|Many {{nourishment}} {{projects are}} advocated via economic impact studies {{that rely on}} additional tourist expenditure. This approach is however unsatisfactory.

25|$|Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the real worthiness of an amount of money today after a given period of time, <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> compound {{the amount of money}} at a given interest rate.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{critical}} review of Adam Smith's notion of an <b>economic</b> <b>agent.</b> Using Jean Jacques Rousseau's arguments, I show the shortcomings of Smith's hypothesisregarding individuals' economic behavior within market society.

A careful reading of Rousseau shows the historical character of Smith's construction, and thereby its failure to recognise the influence of social, cultural and economic development on the formation of this <b>economic</b> <b>agent.</b> Rousseau refuses the possibility of constructing economic theory based on this agent and denounces {{it as a way}} of justifying irresponsibility and tyranny. Two possible paths in economics are thus open: economics as an independent field of action or economics as a field regulated by politics. Adam Smith...|$|R

25|$|During the {{classical}} period of economics, microeconomics was {{closely linked to}} psychology. For example, Adam Smith wrote The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which proposed psychological explanations of individual behavior, including concerns about fairness and justice, and Jeremy Bentham wrote extensively on the psychological underpinnings of utility. However, during the development of neo-classical economics economists sought to reshape the discipline as a natural science, deducing economic behavior from assumptions {{about the nature of}} <b>economic</b> <b>agents.</b> They developed the concept of homo economicus, whose psychology was fundamentally rational.|$|E

The incentive problem of moral hazard—when <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> maximise their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess internationally valuable collateral anyway.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} argument {{in favour of}} reservation is basically economic in nature. If there is discrimination and exclusion prevailing {{in any of the}} institutions, whether industry, educational institutions, it has a negative impact on the economic growth. In the absence of equal opportunity, a sizeable section of the society remain either unemployed or underemployed. The burden will be taken by a minuscule <b>economic</b> <b>agents</b> accessing opportunity to the mentioned institutions. Reservation as a form of positive discrimination should be welcomed for the national interest. But this shouldn't mean reducing the opportunity for the general categories. Government should try to accommodate all by creating more number of educational institutions.|$|E
