The officers of the crew were later tried and convicted of several illegal fishing offences. The captain, Luis Alfonso Rubio Cataldo of Chile, was given a three-year sentence. The ships chief engineer, Agustín <b>Dosil</b> Rey of Spain, was given a two-year and nine-month sentence. The ships second mechanic, Luis Miguel Pérez Fernández of Spain, was given a two-year and eight-month sentence. Together, they were fined a total of over $17 million. Interpol believes that the vessel was part of a fleet of six operating through shell corporations under Vidal Armadores, a company based in Spain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Attitude {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} predictor variables in relation to behavioral intentions regarding physical activity. Thus, this study aims to determine the influence of attitudes towards physical activity. The study comprised a sample of 1129 individuals (507 men and 622 women) age between 12 and 58 years (= 18 sd = 4. 03). To collect the data, the Scale of Attitudes Towards Physical Activity and Sports (<b>Dosil,</b> 2002) was based on the Portuguese version (Cid, Alves, & <b>Dosil,</b> 2008). The results show that attitudes towards physical activity and sports are more positive in younger male individuals, who do not attend higher education, who regularly engage in physical activity and whose parents engage in physical/sports activity themselves...|$|E

Exploratory Factor Analysis and Cronbach’s Alpha the focus of several publications, reflecting a growing field of interest and research (<b>Dosil,</b> 2008). Some sports demand a strict compliance to restrictive diets {{at different times of}} the competitive season, while others like, some types of gymnastics emphasize the thinness of the athletes. Hence {{there is a need to}} develop sound measures to evaluate the athletes eating habits and possible eating disorders. The Cuestionario de Hábitos Alimentarios del Deportista (CHAD), is one of these measures. It comprises 5 dimensions: i) Weight Gain Anxiety (e. g. If I eat too much I regret it afterwards; 12 items); ii) Body Image Worries (e. g., I’m always thinking about my body; 6 items,); iii) Irritability (e. g., If the coach speaks about weight matters, I feel anxious; 7 items); iv) Satisfaction/Dissatisfaction with Body Image (e. g., I’m satisfied with my appearance; 5 items); and v) Dieting (e. g., When the season ends, I keep practicing so that I don’t gain weight, 4 items) ...|$|E

Stability of Aerobic Granular Biomass Treating the Effluent from A Seafood Industry. International Journal of Environmental Research, 7 (2), 265 - 276, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposesThe aerobic granular systems represent a good alternative to substitute the conventional activated sludge process in the treatment of industrial effluents due to the lower surface requirements. In this work the effluent from a seafood industry, characterized by a high variability and the presence of residual amounts of coagulant and flocculant reagents, was used to study the development of aerobic granular biomass and its stability. In a first stage with OLRs between 2 and 5 kg CODS/m 3 ∙d the development of aerobic granular biomass was promoted with good physical properties: SVI of 35 mL/g TSS, density of 60 g VSS/Lgranule and average diameter of 2. 8 mm. In a second stage the continuous change in the OLR applied from 3 to 13 kg CODS/m 3 ∙d, to simulate the real conditions of the industry, showed that the removal of organic matter was not affected (90 %) but the aerobic granules disintegrated. The maximum OLR treated in the system without granules disintegration was around 4. 4 kg CODS/m 3 ∙d. The nitrogen removal was 30 % (for biomass assimilation) and the maximum ammonia removal was around 65 % and depending on the solids retention time, the free ammonia concentration and the average granule diameterThis work was funded by the Spanish Government (TOGRANSYS CTQ 2008 - 06792 -C 02 - 01, NOVEDAR_Consolider CSD 2007 - 00055), Xunta de Galicia (project coordinated by Espina y Delfin S.
