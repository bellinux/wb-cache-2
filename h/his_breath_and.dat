25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos. Kekaumenos commanded the left wing, Romanos Skleros the right, and Komnenos positioned {{himself in the}} centre. On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing. Pursuing their troops to the rebel camp, he proceeded to capture Romanos Skleros {{and was on the}} cusp of victory when he hesitated, unsure of his next move. Komnenos, on the verge of fleeing to Nicaea, was able to catch <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> review what was happening on his left.|$|E
500|$|The stoor worm {{is likely}} to be an Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, or world serpent, also known as the Midgard Serpent. The Orcadian folklorist Marwick {{highlights}} the similarity between the method Assipattle used to kill the mythical creature and those recounted in the slaying of the Worm of Linton and the Cnoc na Cnoimh of Sutherland tales. He also notes that in Bel and the Dragon, the dragon is killed by Daniel using [...] "fat and hair" [...] instead of peat. In Shetland there was a long-standing belief that [...] "away, far out to sea, {{near the edge of the}} world, lived a monstrous sea-serpent that took about six hours to draw in <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> six hours to let it out", which Marwick speculates was probably an explanation for the cycle of the tides.|$|E

60|$|I ran slap {{into the}} arms of a young {{policeman}} wot was passing. Nasty, short-tempered chap he was, but I don't think I was more glad to see anybody in my life. I hugged 'im till 'e nearly lost <b>'is</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> then he sat me down on the kerb-stone and asked me wot I meant by it.|$|R
500|$|In 2004, Ruiz {{spent the}} entire season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, posting a [...]284 batting average and hitting 17 home runs, the latter of which was second among {{catchers}} in the Eastern League. In addition to his strong offensive numbers, he threw out 25 of 76 attempted base stealers (32.9%). Off the field, it was in 2004 that Ruiz first gained the original form of his nickname [...] "Chooch". [...] Though a quiet individual, Ruiz frequently muttered [...] "chucha" [...] (a word equivalent to the f-bomb in Panama) under <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> teammate Anderson Machado thus began to address Ruiz as [...] "chucha", which was later shortened to [...] "Chooch", and the nickname's usage snowballed from there. His strong performance earned him another promotion in 2005 when he played for the Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons, and posted a better batting average but fewer home runs than in Reading: [...]300, 4 home runs, 40 RBIs in 100 games. Before the 2006 season, he played for his native Panama in the first World Baseball Classic. His final season {{in the minor leagues}} was 2006. During 100 games, he hit [...]307 with 16 home runs and 69 RBIs, earning International League all-star accolades. He moved back and forth between Triple-A and the major league Phillies all year long, making his MLB debut on May 6, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Two teams occupy {{opposite}} {{halves of}} a small field and take turns sending a raider into the other half to win points by tagging and wrestling members of the opposing team. The raider then attempts {{to return to his}} own half while holding <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> chanting [...] "kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi" [...] during the whole raid.|$|E
2500|$|Jesse Kilmartin (Forbes March) {{can alter}} the density of his body at will. Kilmartin is the only known New Mutant to have surpassed his [...] "expiration date." [...] As a Molecular New Mutant, he can become intangible, or super-dense, making him nearly {{impervious}} to harm. He can only maintain these forms {{for as long as}} he can hold <b>his</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> is able to extend his powers to people or objects through physical contact.|$|E

2500|$|The {{short film}} starts out with Wallace’s song {{playing in the}} {{background}} while a comical band of Nazi [...] "super-duper supermen" [...] perform. [...] Disney pokes fun of Hitler’s Germany by depicting Donald eating breakfast by only spraying the scent of bacon and eggs onto <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> dipping a single coffee bean into his cup of water. [...] Hitler had promised the Germans great wealth and vast stores of food. [...] Disney and the Army knew this and wanted to depict the Germans living in a land that was hollow of all the wonderful promises that Hitler made. [...] Producers of the cartoon also wished {{to show that the}} working conditions of the factories were not as glorious as Hitler was making them sound in his speeches. [...] Donald is worked continuously with very little compensation and time off. [...] Though it seems Donald goes crazy he soon wakes up from his [...] nightmare and is forever thankful for being a citizen of the United States of America.|$|E
2500|$|While Butt-Head's main {{interest}} {{in life is}} [...] "chicks", Beavis {{seems to be more}} interested in toilet humor and displays of violence. Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying [...] "Boi-oi-oi-oi-oiiing!!!") indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker ("Speech Therapy"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy ("Manners Suck/Candy Sale"), and Woody Woodpecker ("Top O' the Mountain"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in [...] "Vidiots", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so {{by the end of the}} video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word [...] "poop", or will say the word [...] "plop" [...] to indicate a bowel movement. He frequently pulls down his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would get diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous bowel movement which he saved in his dresser drawer, much to Butt-Head's disgust. Beavis sometimes displays examples of the idiot savant when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by holding <b>his</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> blowing into his thumb, in which cases Beavis starts to make intellectual statements usually regarding the music videos he is viewing.|$|E
