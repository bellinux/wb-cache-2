This model takes into consideration the spatial position characteristic of ASHPW, and used the heat transfer and mass transfer phenomena during welding process to explain the weld geometry mechanism in order to correctly design the bevel geometry. The final {{results show that the}} predicted geometry, such as the weld cross-section, weld width and weld cross section area, are in good agreement with experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|The three {{boiling water}} {{reactors}} (BWR) in Oskarshamn produce about 10 % of the electrical power in Sweden. The combination of intense radiation fluxes and high temperatures in nuclear reactors creates an extraordinary environment. Therefore, {{a number of}} material challenges arise at {{a nuclear power plant}} that needs to be solved {{in order to maintain the}} nuclear power production, safety and reliability. Dissimilar metal welds can be found at a lot of places in nuclear power plants and due to reparations or replacement some dissimilar metal welds need to be welded on site. The technical regulations for the Swedish nuclear power plants specifies that welding of dissimilar joints shall be made with gap of at least 1. 5 mm and in <b>horizontal</b> <b>position.</b> <b>Welding</b> a dissimilar joint on site makes it difficult to follow the technical regulations, therefore, the aim with this study is to determine if different welding positions of dissimilar metal welds affect the structure and composition of the weld metal in a negative way and to investigate the importance of a gap in the root. In this study six samples were welded in three different welding positions, horizontal, vertical and reversed vertical with or without a gap of 1. 5 mm in the root. The samples were evaluated by non-destructive testing, optical microscopy, chemical analysis, tensile testing, bend testing and hardness measurements. The results shows that two of the samples welded without gap failed the transverse root bend test, the same samples did also have high hardness values in the root bead. The conclusions are that the welding position, horizontal, vertical or reversed vertical does not affect the weld negative in a noticeable way. However, the gap and a good dilution with the filler metal are important...|$|E
40|$|Laser welding {{has been}} {{increasingly}} utilized to manufacture {{a variety of}} components thanks to its high quality and speed. For components with complex shapes, the <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> needs be continuously adjusted during laser welding, which makes it necessary to know {{the effects of the}} <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> {{on the quality of the}} laser welds. In this paper, the weld quality under two (flat and <b>horizontal)</b> <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> were studied comparatively in the laser welding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy, in terms of weld profiles, process porosity, and static tensile strengths. Results show that the flat <b>welding</b> <b>position</b> led to better weld profiles, less process porosity than that of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>welding</b> <b>position,</b> which resulted from the different actions of gravity on the molten weld metals and the different escape routes for pores under different <b>welding</b> <b>positions.</b> Although undercuts showed no association with the fracture positions and tensile strengths of the welds, too much porosity in horizontal laser welds led to significant decreases in the strengths and specific elongations of welds. Higher laser powers and travel speeds were recommended, for both flat and <b>horizontal</b> <b>welding</b> <b>positions,</b> to reduce <b>weld</b> porosity and improve mechanical properties...|$|R

5000|$|SAW is {{normally}} operated in the automatic or mechanized mode, however, semi-automatic (hand-held) SAW guns with pressurized or gravity flux feed delivery are available. The process {{is normally}} {{limited to the}} flat or horizontal-fillet <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> (although <b>horizontal</b> groove <b>position</b> <b>welds</b> have been done with a special arrangement to support the flux). Deposition rates approaching 45 kg/h (100 lb/h) have been reported [...] - [...] this compares to ~5 kg/h (10 lb/h) (max) for shielded metal arc welding. Although currents ranging from 300 to 2000 A are commonly utilized, currents of up to 5000 A have also been used (multiple arcs).|$|R
500|$|Also, {{because of}} the large weld pool, it is often limited to flat and <b>horizontal</b> <b>welding</b> <b>positions</b> and {{sometimes}} also used for vertical-down welds. It is generally not practical for root pass welds. When a smaller electrode is used in conjunction with lower heat input, its versatility increases. [...] The maximum deposition rate for spray arc GMAW is relatively highâ€”about 60mm/s (150in/min).|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{mixed reality}} system {{was created to}} allow a human to make a virtual gas metal arc fillet weld in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>welding</b> <b>position.</b> The system records process parameters that are displayed after welding for critique and instruction. This represents a {{first of its kind}} welder training approach that leverages current state-of-the-art virtual reality technology. The first year of project work validated virtual reality technology to simulate gas metal arc welding. The second year of work is aimed at enhancing simulation fidelity. Welding is the key technology for fabrication and assembly of metal structures. In some industries, notably automotive, welding is done primarily by robots or automated machinery. In many industries such as shipbuilding, heavy equipment production, and small parts fabrication, welding is a value added operation that is a manual process applied by humans...|$|R
5|$|GMAW with {{globular}} {{metal transfer}} {{is considered the}} least desirable {{of the three major}} GMAW variations, because of its tendency to produce high heat, a poor weld surface, and spatter. The method was originally developed as a cost efficient way to weld steel using GMAW, because this variation uses carbon dioxide, a less expensive shielding gas than argon. Adding to its economic advantage was its high deposition rate, allowing welding speeds of up to 110mm/s (250in/min). As the weld is made, a ball of molten metal from the electrode tends to build up {{on the end of the}} electrode, often in irregular shapes with a larger diameter than the electrode itself. When the droplet finally detaches either by gravity or short circuiting, it falls to the workpiece, leaving an uneven surface and often causing spatter. As a result of the large molten droplet, the process is generally limited to flat and <b>horizontal</b> <b>welding</b> <b>positions,</b> requires thicker workpieces, and results in a larger weld pool.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} result of study on the {{strength}} behaviour of welded joint both destructive and nondestructive testing. The parent metal choosen for the testing was AISI 1045 steel with main parameters of single-V welded form and <b>horizontal</b> <b>welding</b> <b>position.</b> The electrodes used for each parameter were AWS E- 7016 LB- 52 with diameter/amperes of 2. 6 mm/ 80 Amp, 3. 2 mm/ 110 Amp, and 4. 0 mm/ 130 Amp. The specimens were nondestructively tested using the well-known radiography X-ray according to ASTM- 1 A for detecting welding flaws and its size. Chemical composition test was performed for the material of parent and welding metal. Tensile testing was performed to destructive based on the ASTM E- 8 standard for tensile test. The {{results show that the}} tensile strength of the weld joint is reduction by about 28 % compared to the parent metal without welding. The reduction in tensile strength is believed to be caused by welding defect, include porosity, inclusion, incomplete penetration, and reduction in carbon content from 0. 5 % in parent metal to about 0. 1 % in the welding region...|$|R

40|$|The static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> {{accuracy}} of a mapping-grade GNSS receiver was tested in two forest types over two seasons, and subsequently was tested in one forest type against open sky {{conditions in the}} winter season. The main objective {{was to determine whether}} the holding position during data collection would result in significantly different static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy. Additionally, we wanted to determine whether the time of year (season), forest type, or environmental variables had an influence on accuracy. In general, the F 4 Devices Flint GNSS receiver was found to have mean static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy levels within the ranges typically expected for this general type of receiver (3 to 5 m) when differential correction was not employed. When used under forest cover, in some cases the GNSS receiver provided a higher level of static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy when held vertically, as opposed to held at an angle or horizontally (the more natural positions), perhaps due to the orientation of the antenna within the receiver, or in part due to multipath or the inability to use certain satellite signals. Therefore, {{due to the fact that}} numerous variables may affect static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy, we only conclude that there is weak to moderate evidence that the results of holding position are significant. Statistical test results also suggest that the season of data collection had no significant effect on static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy, and results suggest that atmospheric variables had weak correlation with <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy. Forest type was found to have a significant effect on static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy in one aspect of one test, yet otherwise there was little evidence that forest type affected <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> accuracy. Since the holding position was found in some cases to be significant with regard to the static <b>horizontal</b> <b>position</b> {{accuracy of}} positions collected in forests, it may be beneficial to have an understanding of antenna positioning within the receiver to achieve the greatest accuracy during data collection...|$|R

This research will explain the differences of three welding methods consist of SMAW, FCAW and SAW weld methode based on strengthening and economic value. The strengthening of welding result are tested by dectructive test consist of tensile, bending and impact test. It carried out the calculation of weld cost per kgs, weld speed per meter and electrode consumption to know the differences of economic value for all that welding material. The test result showed that no differences of tensile strength between SMAW, FCAW and SAW welding methode, max. 1 %, but SMAW weld methode have yield strength 4 % better than FCAW weld methode and 14 % better than SAW weld methode. FCAW weld methode ductility value 34 % mare than SMAW weld methode and 37 % more than SAW weld methode.
