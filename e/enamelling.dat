5|$|Music and minstrels {{were very}} popular at Edward's court, but hunting {{appears to have}} been a much less {{important}} activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events. Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court. There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and <b>enamelling</b> at court, which would have been richly decorated. Edward kept a camel as a pet and, as a young man, took a lion with him on campaign to Scotland. The court could be entertained in exotic ways: by an Italian snake-charmer in 1312, and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.|$|E

25|$|In 1916,Cliff {{made the}} rather unusual {{decision}} {{to move to the}} factory of A.J. Wilkinson at Newport, Burslem, to improve her career opportunities. This necessitated a lengthy journey to work. This was an unusual start to an unusual career; most young women in the Staffordshire Potteries were on 'apprentice wages', and having mastered a particular task, stayed with that to maximise their income. However, Cliff was ambitious and acquired skills in modelling figurines and vases, gilding, keeping pattern books and hand painting ware: outlining, <b>enamelling</b> (filling in colours within the outline) and banding (the radial bands on plates or vessels). In the early 1920s her immediate boss Jack Walker brought Cliff to the attention of one of the two factory owners, Colley Shorter, who managed it with his brother Guy. Colley Shorter was 17 years older than Cliff, and as well as playing a major role in nurturing her skills and ideas, he was later to be her husband.|$|E

500|$|The reliquary exuberantly {{exploits}} the ronde bosse or [...] "encrusted" [...] <b>enamelling</b> technique, {{which involves}} creating small three-dimensional figures coated in enamel {{on a metal}} core, often just gold wire. [...] The technique was a recent innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits {{at the end of}} the 14th century. [...] The main colour of enamel used is a lead-based white, which had also only been developed a decade or two at most before the date of the reliquary, and was evidently very fashionable {{at the end of the}} century. [...] White dominates the few surviving large enamels in ronde bosse dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410, used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures. [...] Gold is used for their hair, and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh; [...] "throughout, colour is used in a very considered way"; [...] "a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls", except where [...] "a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm" [...] above God the Father. [...] Blue, an important enamel colour in other works, is almost entirely absent here, perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires.|$|E

2500|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern Europe, lead glass {{was used as}} a base in {{coloured}} glasses, specifically in mosaic tesserae, enamels, stained-glass painting, and bijouterie, where it was used to imitate precious stones.

In the late 11th-early 12th century, Schedula Diversarum Artium (List of Sundry Crafts), the author known as [...] "Theophilus Presbyter" [...] describes its use as imitation gemstone, and the title of a lost chapter of the work mentions the use of lead in glass. The 12–13th century pseudonymus [...] "Heraclius" [...] details the manufacture of lead enamel and its use for window painting in his De Coloribus et artibus Romanorum (Of Hues and Crafts of the Romans). This refers to lead glass as [...] "Jewish glass", perhaps indicating its transmission to Europe. A manuscript preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice, describes the use of lead oxide in enamels and includes recipes for calcining lead to form the oxide.

2500|$|The {{addition}} of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about [...] ), with a working point of [...] The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, {{but that of}} lead glass is roughly 100 times {{less than that of}} ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to [...] ). From the glassmaker’s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in <b>enamelling,</b> and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a soda-lime glass, the former when struck absorbs more energy. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.|$|E
