He wrote to Lady Bradford that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E

All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much {{at home in}} semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As {{long as it was}} not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E

25|$|Michael VIII's {{foreign policy}} {{relied heavily on}} diplomacy; nevertheless, his {{construction}} projects and military campaigns against the remaining Latins were extensive as well as expensive; the Nicaean army was modeled around the Komnenian army, and while {{it was not as}} effective, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> burdensome on the treasury. The result was that heavy taxes were levied on the peasantry, something that the Ottomans would later use to their advantage, winning over these poverty-stricken peasants with promises of lower taxes.|$|E

25|$|Two {{investigations}} were conducted. The {{first by}} Ron Lieberman, her husband, and private investigator Ken Gallant, a former FBI agent, initially presumed her disappearance and possible death were {{unrelated to the}} attacks but later concluded {{it was the most}} likely outcome. A later investigation by New York City police delved into her life leading up to September 11 and found details of a double life, a history of marital problems, possible affairs with other women, job difficulties and alcohol and drug abuse by Philip, as well as a pending criminal charge against her, in the months before her disappearance. This led them to conclude <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely that she had met a different fate.|$|E
500|$|In {{her first}} appearance, Laura San Giacomo plays Harmony Chase, {{a woman who}} hires Keith to {{investigate}} her cheating husband. The two were both series regulars on the NBC sitcom Just Shoot Me!. The two actors had maintained a close friendship after their sitcom was cancelled, and when Rob Thomas brought up a romantic storyline for Keith to Colantoni, he suggested Giacomo for the role. Giacomo accepted the role, later stating, [...] "It {{was kind of a}} no-brainer situation for me. I love Rico, love working with him, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much fun as I thought it would be." [...] In addition to sharing in-jokes about Just Shoot Me! while on set, Colantoni also remembered what a good actress he thought she was in their earlier days. After the first appearance, both Colantoni and Giacomo lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, [...] "I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out." [...] Giacomo would go on to appear on three episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|Service {{stated that}} Lenin could be [...] "moody and volatile", and Pipes deemed {{him to be}} [...] "a thoroughgoing misanthrope", a view {{rejected}} by Read, who highlighted many instances in which Lenin displayed kindness, particularly toward children. According to several biographers, Lenin was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from his own. He could be [...] "venomous in his critique of others", exhibiting a propensity for mockery, ridicule, and ad hominem attacks on those who disagreed with him. He ignored facts that did not suit his argument, abhorred compromise, and very rarely admitted his own errors. He refused to change his opinions, until he rejected them completely, after which he would treat the new view as if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> unchangeable. Lenin {{showed no sign of}} sadism or of personally desiring to commit violent acts, but he endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for the revolutionary cause. Adopting an amoral stance, in Lenin's view the end always justified the means; according to Service, Lenin's [...] "criterion of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution?" ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{message to}} reach Bonaparte {{regarding}} the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his {{camp on the}} road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports {{that when he was}} handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced [...] "Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens" [...] ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed [...] "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" [...] Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering Franklin while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were [...] "marvellous," [...] Bonaparte responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well, since he would have them shot if they continued [...] "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." [...] To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{important}} to raise troops; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important to provide capable officers to command them. With few exceptions the Confederacy secured excellent general officers. Efficiency in the lower officers was [...] "greater than could have been reasonably expected". As with the Federals, political appointees could be indifferent. Otherwise, the officer corps was governor-appointed or elected by unit enlisted. Promotion to fill vacancies was made internally regardless of merit, even if better officers were immediately available.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian hero Giuseppe Garibaldi {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous people in Europe as a proponent of liberty; Washington sent a diplomat to invite him to become an American general. [...] Garibaldi {{declined}} the offer because he would not be given supreme power over all the armies, and because the United States was not yet committed to abolishing slavery. [...] Historians agree that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well because he was too independent in thought and deed to have worked smoothly with the U.S. government.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{wrote of}} the Court's {{proposed}} alternatives that, [...] "aside from being constitutionally unnecessary, [...] are also burdensome, impractical, and {{no more likely to}} effect notice than the methods actually employed by the State." [...] Regular mail lacks the paper trail of certified mail, and Thomas thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely that mail addressed to [...] "occupant" [...] would be thrown out as junk mail as opened and read as the Court had speculated. He also stated that the Court had previously concluded that posting notices was [...] "an inherently unreliable method." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} for the Sunday Telegraph on 3 April Powell {{expressed}} {{his opposition to the}} Labour Party's manifesto pledge to outlaw fox hunting. He claimed that angling was much crueler and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> logical to ban the boiling of live lobsters or eating live oysters. The ceremonial part of fox hunting was [...] "a side of our national character which is deeply anti-pathetic to the Labour party". In the 1983 general election, Powell had to face a DUP candidate in his constituency and Ian Paisley denounced Powell as [...] "a foreigner and an Anglo-Catholic".|$|E
2500|$|Ji favored {{trade with}} Western Europe and foreign investment, {{one of the}} first in the {{government}} to do so, because he believed that China needed Western technology in order to develop. But he also insisted that this foreign trade should be balanced, adding that Beijing would have to conduct marketing efforts to promote Chinese goods abroad. Some criticized him for this openness to the West and for his American education and contacts, saying that he [...] "drank too much American water." [...] His brother, Chaoji, later commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well that Chaoding was divorced from his wife, Harriet, for their marriage would have prevented him from playing {{a major role in the}} Party. He then married Luo Jingyi, another Chinese student activist who had joined the Communist Party in the United States in the 1920s.|$|E

2500|$|The Brotherhood's {{publications}} expressed unrelenting hostility {{towards the}} government and its policies, and the Brothers were {{a major force in}} strikes and nationalist demonstrations. In October 1945, the Society organised a [...] "people's congress" [...] on national liberation in Cairo and seven other cities. [...] The Brotherhood and the Wafd were now the two main opposition parties; now that the Wafd was no longer in power, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> eager to champion the nationalist cause, and was supported on this issue by the communists. [...] The Brothers therefore found themselves in direct competition with the Wafd for leadership of the nationalist movement. [...] Despite their deep mutual distrust, the two groups joined in the same mass demonstrations on occasion. [...] However, the Brotherhood's refusal to cooperate with communists led to the breakdown of a united front, and to accusations that the Brothers were tools of {{the government and}} of the ruling class. [...] The Society strongly rebutted these charges, and indeed organised strikes of its own; this deeply strained its already poor relations with the government, and the Brotherhood ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{interview}} that Wilbur Chamberlin of the New York Sun conducted with Ament elevated the indulgences issue into a cause célèbre. Chamberlin had first met Ament in Beijing on 14 October 1900. In {{a letter to}} his wife, Chamberlin indicated: The Rev. A. is a missionary, and he appears {{to be a very good}} sort of a fellow, but I cannot for the life of me approve of his methods....You see, when the soldiers came to Peking and these missionaries were safe, some of them began at once to clamor for damages that they said they had sustained. The first thing that they did was to get for living places the palaces of the rich Chinese Princes, and when they had them they started in clearing them out. They took everything of value and sold it for a song. Then they let their native Christians go out hunting and stealing more loot, and then they sold that. They said it was no sin and eased their consciences by saying they had the right to reimburse themselves for the losses they sustained. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> if a man had stolen something from me, and, to get square, I went and stole something from him. In other words, two wrongs make a right. That may be all right, but I don't think so. At A.'s home, which was the palace of Prince Pei, a Manchu, before the trouble, I met a lot more missionaries." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{fast-moving}} nighttime tornado that {{devastated the}} town of Guin, was the longest-duration F5 tornado recorded in the outbreak, and considered {{to be one of}} the most violent ever recorded. The Guin Tornado traveled over [...] to just west of Huntsville before lifting just after 10:30pm CDT. It formed at around 8:50pm CDT near the Mississippi-Alabama border, striking the Monterey Trailer Park, resulting in major damage at that location. The tornado [...] then became extremely violent as it approached and entered Guin, with multiple areas of F5 damage noted in and around town. The tornado first struck the Guin Mobile Home Plant as it entered the town, completely obliterating the structure. Nothing was left of the plant but a pile of mangled steel beams. The town's downtown area was also heavily damaged, with many businesses and two churches completely destroyed. Residential areas in Guin suffered total devastation, with many homes swept completely away and scattered across fields. According to NWS damage surveyor Bill Herman, the damage in one 6-block area was particularly extreme, and remarked that [...] "It was just like the ground had been swept clean. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much of a total wipeout as you can have." [...] Surveyor J.B. Elliot noted that the destruction was so complete, that even some of the foundations were [...] "dislodged, and in some cases swept away." [...] A total of 23 people were killed in Guin.|$|E
