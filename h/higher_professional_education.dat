In the article we claim that HPE systems have features of bio-systems: self-preservation and adequate response to external stimuli.

To make a diagnostics of the HPE system and to create a model of HPE adaptation to the environmental challenges we use the method of fuzzy logics, comprising a base of rules and membership functions. The proposed algorithm of fuzzy output is based on the expert assessment data of the Russian Association of Engineering Universities received during the accreditation of engineering specialties in 10 universities of Russia...|$|R
