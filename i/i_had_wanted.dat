25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E
500|$|He recounted {{his career}} as a thief, {{confirming}} Kloepfer's long-time suspicion that he had shoplifted virtually everything of substance that he owned. [...] "The big payoff for me," [...] he said, [...] "was actually possessing whatever it was I had stolen. I really enjoyed having something ... that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> and gone out and taken." [...] Possession proved to be an important motive for rape and murder as well. Sexual assault, he said, fulfilled his need to [...] "totally possess" [...] his victims. At first, he killed his victims [...] "as a matter of expediency ... to eliminate the possibility of [...] caught"; but later, murder became part of the [...] "adventure". [...] "The ultimate possession was, in fact, the taking of the life", he said. [...] "And then ... the physical possession of the remains." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> to strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{seen her}} play, {{as we all}} have, and oh, that is divine; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always <b>wanted</b> to know Madame Bernhardt herself--her fiery self. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> to know that {{beautiful}} character.|$|R
6000|$|Her hands clenched. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, very faintly. And then: [...] "Of course! Always. It is what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted,</b> what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> meant all along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the little}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen of you {{it appears to}} me, Dr. Hardacre," [...] said he, [...] "that you are the very man <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> to meet." ...|$|R
500|$|As Caragiale senior died, Mateiu {{initially}} {{planned to}} join the mainstream Conservative Party and demand a post from Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino, the Mayor of Bucharest and a close associate of Bogdan-Pitești. Nevertheless, he came to define this position as [...] "a bad solution", and, as Maiorescu and Ionescu formed an alliance, he successfully requested appointment from Bădărău, eventually obtaining it through the means of a decree signed by King Carol I. Caragiale later commented: [...] " [...] entrusted me with this golden key, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> for so long, and which, for all of this, I had not been desperate to obtain." [...] This contradicted another one of his accounts, in which he confessed that, initially received with indifference by Bădărău, he had claimed that him joining the Conservative-Democrats had been Ion Luca's dying request. Șerban Cioculescu would comment: [...] "There {{could not have been}} a more complete distortion of a parent's last wish!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, 2015, T.I. {{announced}} his departure from Columbia Records. In {{an interview with}} HitsDailyDouble.com, he addressed his situation: [...] "Having just exited my deal at Columbia, I was a rogue artist, busting creativity, just waiting to put music in the marketplace, so while I'm sorting out my next situation, I'm blessed {{enough to be able}} to control my destiny and put music out as quickly as I want to, and was able to release a Tip album, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> to do for a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 6, 2007, Calò and his co-defendants {{were cleared}} of murdering Calvi. The {{presiding}} {{judge in the}} trial threw out the charges because of [...] "insufficient evidence" [...] in a surprise verdict after 20 months of evidence. Calò, who gave evidence from his high security prison, denied the charges. [...] "I {{had no interest in}} killing Calvi," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't have the time, nor the inclination. Besides, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> him dead do you not think I would have picked my own people to do the job?" [...] Calò's defence argued there were others who had wanted Calvi silenced.|$|E

2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later. I {{remember}} when he came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy {{to catch a glimpse of}} him when he was going to his studio." [...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times. Once <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|Koceski was {{recruited}} {{as a football}} player by Pitt, Penn State, Army, Navy, Notre Dame, Alabama, Tennessee, and Columbia, but he chose the University of Michigan. [...] In a 1948 interview, Koceski explained his selection of Michigan, [...] "Ever since I was {{in the sixth grade}} at First Ward public school, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> to go to Michigan. [...] It seemed {{too good to be true}} when they accepted me." [...] In 1947, he played on the freshman team coached by Wally Weber. [...] Koceski joined the varsity team in 1948 and helped the Wolverines to an undefeated season and national championship. [...] In Michigan's 28–0 victory over Northwestern in 1948, Koceski scored three touchdowns. [...] Michigan's fourth touchdown in the Northwestern game resulted from a Koceski fumble as he crossed the goal line, with the ball being recovered in the end zone by teammate Bob Erben. [...] Following the Northwestern game, the Associated Press wrote:"Koceski carried the ball only six times for 20 yards, a running figure exceeded by both Ortmann and End Dick Rifenburg, but the little right halfback who stepped into the man-sized shoes of the departed Bump Elliott and fills 'em like they were made for him caught three passes for 40 yards more." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a May 17, 2010 {{article in}} The Daily Bruin, writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both {{supporters}} and {{critics of the}} protest movement were increasing: [...] "The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong. Both are gaining members rapidly." [...] In a May 18, 2010 article, [...] "Why We're Having an Everybody Draw Mohammed Contest on Thursday May 20", Reason editor Nick Gillespie explained: [...] "No one {{has a right to}} an audience or even to a sympathetic hearing, much less an engaged audience. But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats." [...] Gillespie asserted, [...] "Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what {{is at the core of}} a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights." [...] As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, [...] "I'm against my own concept becoming a reality.... If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> to be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day. The one-off cartoon is not good as a long term plan because it's offensive." [...] Fox News Channel reported that on May 19, 2010, a Facebook group supporting the protest movement had 41,000 members, and The Register reported this increased to 43,000 the same day. Norris told Fox News Channel in a statement on May 19, [...] "It's turned into something completely different, nothing I could've imagined it morphing into. I'm happy some people are talking, because obviously this needs to be addressed." [...] By May 20, the Toronto Sun reported that both the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] group and the [...] "Against 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" [...] Facebook group protesting against the initiative had attracted more than 100,000 supporters, at 101,870 members and 106,000 members respectively.|$|E
