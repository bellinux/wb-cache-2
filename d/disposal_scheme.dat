This paper presents the outcomes of a risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for a proposed community wastewater system for a small town in central Gippsland, Victoria. Preliminary modelling suggests that very limited improvement in environmental/human health performance can be expected with the provision of large storage facilities (i. e. wet weather dam) and restriction of deep drainage. Recent experiences from New Zealand support the outcomes of this assessment. Current Victorian guidelines, however, discourage deep drainage in effluent irrigation and therefore the benefits that such schemes can deliver in the future. The outcomes illustrate the need for case by case risk analysis and triple bottom line assessment of wastewater servicing options...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{pursuit of}} better {{coordination}} schemes {{is crucial for}} contemporary supply chains {{to survive in a}} highly competitive environment. A supply chain may employ revenue sharing, information sharing and quantity discounts etc. to gain that viable edge. Another recent trend is to store vendor's inventory at the buyer's warehouse, known as vendor-managed-inventory (VMI) with consignment stock (CS) agreement. This paper brings the present literature in with consignment stock closer to real life by introducing the notion of screening defective items. A single-vendor single-buyer supply chain is considered where the vendor ships every production batch in a number of lots to the buyer's warehouse. The buyer withdraws and screens these products while fulfilling the market demand. An analytical model is developed to depict this scenario. The impact of different fractions of defective items, storage costs as well as <b>disposal</b> <b>schemes</b> is also studied. The results indicate that the prominence of the proposed storage scheme over the conventional one remains proportional to the size and number of shipments in a cycle. Besides, the non-financial component of storage costs has a critical impact on the cost of the supply chain...|$|R
40|$|Sand/bentonite {{mixtures}} {{are considered}} as buffer material in low and medium radioactive waste <b>disposal</b> <b>schemes.</b> While the bentonite provides low permeability and swelling capacity, the sand {{is intended to}} improve mechanical stability and {{to reduce the amount}} of bentonite required. One of the requirements of the buffer is to ensure the isolation of the gas-emitting waste. The pressurized gas may migrate towards the host geological media through several mechanisms (dissolution, two-phase flow, preferential paths). This paper is a contribution to this topic and presents experimental results as well as some modelling work. Laboratory experiments were performed on statically compacted 80 / 20 sand/bentonite mixture recovered from the in situ large scale GMT (Gas Migration Test) buffer. The sample was tested in a specifically designed Perspex test cell which allows the visualization of the boundary of the sample. Two needles inserted inside the sample are used to inject and recover gas. The formation of preferential paths following the compaction layers and the sample-wall interface were detected in the test. The test is analyzed by hydro-mechanical numerical simulations considering randomly distributed properties (porosity, permeability and hardening parameter) and the possibility of opening discontinuities in the permeability law are considered. Also a computational experiment inspired in the conditions prevailing on the in situ large scale GMT test, is presented. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the Strategic Sewage <b>Disposal</b> <b>Scheme</b> (SSDS) Stage 1 Tunnel F in Hong Kong was carried out {{as it is a}} great example of deep sub-sea hard rock TBM {{tunnelling}} through unfavourable, fault-affected ground conditions with heavy water inflows. The main objective {{of this study was to}} document events that took place during Tunnel F excavation and collate geological and geotechnical data related to the excavation, to aid future tunnel designers and contractors to assess the risk involved with such tunnelling projects. Data relevant to Tunnel F was collected from many personnel involved with the excavation, and from the Hong Kong Geological Survey (HKGS) of the Geotechnical Engineering Office. Geological maps, ground investigation data, tunnel mapping records, ground water inflow records and grouting records were reviewed and used to summarise the ground conditions and to analyse various potential relationships. Knowledge of ground conditions is the most important requirement for any tunnelling project. This dissertation addresses the differences between actual and predicted ground conditions and the consequences of lack of ground investigation data. The major difference between predicted and observed ground conditions during Tunnel F excavation was the amount of water ingress into the tunnel. Hundreds of liters per minute of water at up to 13 bar pressure was encountered from a few probe and grout holes. In the Tolo Channel Fault area, low Q values and very high ground water inflows were experienced, and heavy temporary support and large grout volumes were required to complete the tunnel. published_or_final_versionApplied GeosciencesMasterMaster of Scienc...|$|E

Primarily, the coal ash is disposed off using either dry or wet <b>disposal</b> <b>scheme.</b> In wet disposal, the fly ash and bottom ash are transported as slurry through pipe and disposed off in pond ash. Main reason for failure of ash dyke is due to ineffective functioning of filter or internal drains. Natural river sand is used as the conventional filter material.

According to WHO; about 30000 people die every day in the world due to unsafe water consumption and insufficient sanitation. (environmental sanitation 2001) Tens of millions of women spend half of their day walking in hot sun to carry home polluted water which poisons them and their families. Etymologically the word sanitation is from French sanitas, which means health. Thus environmental sanitation is an act or process of making the environment sanitary, health or hygienic. Various definitions of sanitation given by the National Sanitation foundation of U. S A is follows;“Sanitation is away of life. It is quality of living that is expressed in the clean community. Being the way of life,it must come from within the people, it is nourished by knowledge and grows as an obligation and an ideal in human relation”. The WHO defines environmental sanitation as “ the control of all those factors in mans physical environment which exercise or may exercise a deleterious effect on his physical development, health and survival. the design construction and management of water supply and wastewater <b>disposal</b> <b>schemes</b> can be associated with the growth of capital cities and commercial centers {{that took place in the}} wake of the industrial revolution of 19 th century.

The herds were matched on the basis of herd type and the shortest geographical distance between pairs of herds. Data on management, hygienic measures, experiences during the depopulation of an infected nearest neighbour, and the frequency of contact with professionals and other agencies were collected by means of a questionnaire taken by personal interview. There {{were no significant differences between}} the infected and uninfected herds in the median total number of contacts per year with professionals and other agencies either with or without contact with the pigs. On the basis of a multivariable analysis, five variables were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of infection: (1) the presence of commercial poultry on the premises; (2) visitors entering the pig units without wearing an overcoat or overalls and boots supplied by the farm; (3) the driver of the lorry transporting pigs for the Pig Welfare <b>Disposal</b> <b>Scheme</b> (PWDS) using his own boots instead of boots supplied by the farm; (4) herds of moderate size (500 to 1, 000 animals) and very large herds (> 7, 000 animals) were at greater risk than small herds (< 500 animals); and (5) an aerosol, produced during high-pressure cleaning of the electrocution equipment used to kill the pigs on a neighbouring infected herd less than 250 m away was carried by the wind on to the premises.

40|$|Tunnel B of the Stage I Strategic Sewage <b>Disposal</b> <b>Scheme</b> (SSDS) has an {{excavated}} {{diameter of}} 3. 2 m {{and it was}} excavated with a hard rock tunnel boring machine 75 m below the Eastern Harbour Crossing Tunnel (EHC) in the Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong. The EHC is an immersed tube structure built in 1990 and the structure {{was made up of}} fifteen rectangular reinforced concrete box segments, each of about 125 m long, connected together by flexible joints that are under compression at working condition. The major risk that had been identified was that if any ground movement in the EHC tunnel boxes had occurred, as a result of groundwater drawdown due to large inflow into Tunnel B, the flexible joints connecting the two adjacent boxes of the structure could have lost its effectiveness in water-sealing, with the consequence of seawater entering the boxes under full hydrostatic pressure. The EHC is a major trunk road in Hong Kong and should water seeps into the structure, traffic would have been devastated resulting in huge financial loss to the city. To identify and to manage the risk of potential movement when Tunnel B was approaching under the EHC, site specific ground investigation comprising of a 800 m long horizontal exploratory drill hole and geophysical survey had been carried out to identify the geological condition and groundwater regime ahead of the tunnel. The geophysical survey was specifically carried out to investigate any accretion of silt above the EHC box segments in order to properly model the correct boundary condition in a seepage analysis. Sensitivity analysis on the effect of different boundary conditions to settlement prediction using a full range of soil parameters has been considered. It is found from this study that the presence of a blanket of marine deposit (above the tunnel box segment) is an important factor that could increase the settlement prediction by many orders of magnitude as compared to the case without marine deposit. The marine deposit is a very low permeability material, which could act as a cap and retard or prevent the downward flow of the seawater from recharging into the system. The best estimate of ground settlement likely anticipated due to tunnelling was arrived, based on engineering judgment and experience consistent with other project studies. When Tunnel B was 600 m away from the EHC, additional probing and shortening of cuts were exercised; settlement and joint opening were continuously monitored on a bi-daily basis; and inflow into Tunnel B was measured daily. All of these measures were carried out in accordance with the risk management plan. Three different levels of warning systems (Alert, Action and Alarm) are described in this paper. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{evolution}} of government and public roles in salinity management within the Goulburn Valley, an important agricultural region of north central Victoria. I argue that approaches to salinity management in the Goulburn Valley have altered over time to reflect variations in the connection between government and local communities. From 1905, the Victorian Government (as represented through its administrative body for water resources, the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission (SRWSC) was led {{by a combination of}} developmentalist ideology and financial caution to install throughout north-central Victoria the fatal combination of extensive irrigation systems without adequate drainage. Despite early evidence of salinity problems resulting from their actions, the SRWSC did not experience a serious challenge to its institutionalised pattern of top-down advice and authority until the 1970 s, when proposals for large-scale evaporative <b>disposal</b> <b>schemes</b> for salinity management met with angry responses from the farming community. Following an examination of community responses to two of the most controversial of these, the Lake Tyrrell and Mineral Reserve Basins salinity management schemes, I re-evaluate the subsequent Girgarre salinity control project in its historical context as a turning-point in government attitudes to community consultation. Through a close analysis of key policy documents, I then show how salinity management in the Goulburn Valley has developed since Girgarre to incorporate increasing levels of community participation, and proceed to examine the Australian Landcare movement as an effective, though flawed, system for community based natural resource management. The thesis concludes with an assessment of the Goulburn Valley's current situation, and emphasises very strongly the need for genuine community participation to ensure effective salinity management.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{evolution and}} environmental impact in MEO {{of all the}} abandoned spacecraft and upper stages associated with the GPS and GLONASS navigation constellations were analyzed. The orbits of the disposed objects, as of 1 May 2011, were propagated for 200 years and snapshots of their evolving distribution were obtained, together with an estimation of the changing collision probability with the spacecraft of the operational navigation systems existing or planned in MEO, i. e. GLONASS, GPS, Beidou and Galileo. The probability that the abandoned objects considered will collide with the operational spacecraft of the navigation constellations is very low, even {{taking into account the}} intrinsic eccentricity instability of the disposal orbits. Assuming the present or envisaged configuration of the constellations in MEO, the probability of collision, integrated over 200 years, would be < 1 / 300 with a GLONASS spacecraft, < 1 / 15, 000 with a GPS or Beidou spacecraft, and < 1 / 250, 000 with a Galileo spacecraft. The worst disposal strategy consists in abandoning satellites and upper stages close to the altitude of the operational constellation (GLONASS), while a re-orbiting a few hundred km away (GPS) is able to guarantee an effective long-term dilution of the collision risk, irrespective of the eccentricity instability due to geopotential and luni-solar perturbations. The disposal strategies applied so far to the GPS satellites should be able to guarantee for at least a few centuries a sustainable MEO environment free of collisions among intact objects. Consequently, there would be no need to adopt <b>disposal</b> <b>schemes</b> targeting also the optimal value of the eccentricity vector. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that the GPS disposal strategy was devised well in advance of the Beidou constellation announcement, so most of the abandoned satellites were re-orbited fairly close to the altitude of the new Chinese system.

40|$|Any {{migration}} of radionuclides from nuclear waste repositories {{is expected to be}} mitigated by adsorption to the host rocks surrounding hydraulically conductive fractures. Fluid rock interfaces are considered to be important barriers for nuclear waste <b>disposal</b> <b>schemes</b> but their adsorptive capacity can be affected by the growth of microbial biofilms. This study indicates that biofilms growing on fracture surfaces decrease the rocks adsorption capacity for migrating radionuclides except for trivalent species. Potential suppression of adsorption by biofilms should, therefore, be accounted for in performance safety assessment models. In this study, the adsorptive capacity of in situ anaerobic biofilms grown 450 m underground on either glass or granite slides was compared to the capacity of the same surfaces without biofilms. Surfaces were exposed to the radiotracers Co- 60 (II), Pm- 147 (III), Am- 241 (III), Th- 234 (IV), and Np- 237 (V) for a period of 660 h in a pH neutral anaerobic synthetic groundwater. Adsorption was investigated at multiple time points over the 660 h using liquid scintillation and ICP-MS. Results indicate that these surfaces adsorb between 0 and 85 % of the added tracers under the conditions of the specific experiments. After 660 h, the distribution coefficients, R (ratio between what is sorbed and what is left in the aqueous phase), approached 3 x 10 (4) m for Co- 60, 3 x 10 (5) m for Pm- 147 and 24 'Am, I x 106 m for 234 Th, and 1 x 103 m for 237 Np. The highest rate of adsorption was during the first 200 h of the adsorption experiments and started to approach equilibrium after 500 h. Adsorption to colloids and precipitates contributed to decreases of up to 20 % in the available Co- 60, Pm- 147, Am- 241, and Np- 237 in the adsorption systems. In the 234 Th system 95 % of the aqueous 234 Th was removed by adsorbing to colloids. Although the range of R values for each surface tested generally overlapped, the biofilms consistently demonstrated lower R values except for the trivalant Pm- 147 and Am- 241 adsorption systems...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the sixth}} {{day of his}} {{confinement}} Waverley found himself so well {{that he began to}} meditate his escape from this dull and miserable prison-house, thinking any risk which he might incur in the attempt preferable to the stupefying and intolerable uniformity of Janet's retirement. The question indeed occurred, whither he was to direct his course when again at his own <b>disposal.</b> Two <b>schemes</b> seemed practicable, yet both attended with danger and difficulty. One was to go back to Glennaquoich and join Fergus Mac-Ivor, by whom he was sure to be kindly received; and in the present state of his mind, the rigour with which he had been treated fully absolved him, in his own eyes, from his allegiance to the existing government. The other project was to endeavour to attain a Scottish seaport, and thence to take shipping for England. His mind wavered between these plans, and probably, if he had effected his escape in the manner he proposed, he would have been finally determined by the comparative facility by which either might have been executed. But his fortune had settled that he was not to be left to his option.|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Innovation in Technology and ManagementThe Proceedings can {{be viewed}} at: [URL] Construction and Demolition WasteSolid waste arisen from {{construction}} activities is a grave concern in many economies. Given its negative impacts to the natural environment as a public good, construction waste is often heavily regulated by authorities including Hong Kong. Over the past decades, a series of construction waste management (CWM) policies have been introduced by the Government and her executive arms. It comes to an opportune time to retrospectively examine {{the effectiveness of these}} policies with a view to providing insights for further improvement. The aim of this paper is thus to examine CWM policies and their effectiveness in Hong Kong by conducting a longitudinal study. It is found that Hong Kong is actively trying new CWM policies, which have formed an interlocking, and relatively effective policy framework for CWM. However, new initiatives are desired if aiming to change the gloomy situation since 2006 after the construction waste <b>disposal</b> charging <b>scheme</b> was effectively implemented. This research provides insightful understanding of CWM policies and their effectiveness, which is often concerned policies makers, researchers, and the like...|$|R
40|$|In general, South Australian country towns {{have not}} been {{provided}} with conventional sewerage schemes. Since 1962, lower capital and operating cost septic tank effluent <b>disposal</b> (STED) <b>schemes</b> have been constructed. STED schemes were first developed to overcome public health and amenity problems associated with failing or inadequate septic tank soakage trenches. “Temporary ” drains were laid to convey septic tank effluent to a central treatment facility (typically an oxidation lagoon), {{with the expectation that}} a "permanent " sewerage scheme would replace them. However, as it became evident that these schemes offered an affordable alternative to sewerage, they have been retained and developed for the majority of towns in SA. In most cases, simple oxidation lagoons provided secondary treatment. More recently, reuse schemes have been developed, often in conjunction with small scale extended aeration plants. There are over 110, 000 people in SA now served by STED schemes, with the largest town being Mt Barker with a connected population of 10, 000. This paper describes briefly the development of STED schemes over the last 36 years by the Department of Public Health (now Department of Human Services), the Engineering and Wate...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of solid wastes is generated every year from construction and demolition (C&D) activities in Hong Kong. The C&D waste can be classified into inert and noninert wastes, in which the inert waste is normally disposed of in public fills as reclamation materials and the noninert waste is dumped at landfills. Under the current waste generation trend, all landfills and public fills in Hong Kong will be used up within a few years. To tackle this problem, in December of 2005, the Hong Kong Government implemented the Construction Waste <b>Disposal</b> Charging <b>Scheme</b> (CWDCS) to provide financial incentives to C&D waste generators to reduce waste and encourage reuse and recycling. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study to explore the perceptions of the Hong Kong construction participants toward the CWDCS after three years of implementation. The study was conducted by a survey with follow-up interviews to experienced professionals in the building industry. The results revealed no consensus view among the construction participants on C&D waste reduction, especially regarding on-site waste sorting and recycling. The findings also revealed that 40 % of the survey respondents believed that waste reduction is less than 5 % after CWDCS was implemented. The interviewees expressed that some waste generation was unavoidable, although a waste disposal charge has been imposed. In addition, 30 % of survey respondents agreed that the cost of CWDCS was not high enough to raise awareness about waste management on construction sites.
