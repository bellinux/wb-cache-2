5|$|MDOT is {{the agency}} {{responsible}} for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the State Trunkline Highway System, which includes the U.S. <b>Highways</b> in Michigan. The numbering for these <b>highways</b> is coordinated through AASHTO, an organization composed of the various state departments of transportation in the United States. Under the scheme finalized in 1926, two-digit US <b>Highways</b> are numbered in a grid; east–west <b>highways</b> have even numbers while north–south routes have odd numbers. The lowest numbers are {{in the east and}} the north. The east–west <b>highways</b> in Michigan number in the single digits up to the low 20s. The north–south <b>highways</b> range from the low 20s into the 40s. There are also three three-digit <b>highways</b> numbered in the 100s and one in the 200s as branches of related two-digit <b>highways.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} U.S. {{national}} defenses, {{to support}} military transport, the National Highway System was expanded with Interstate <b>highways,</b> beginning in 1955, across {{many parts of the}} United States. The wider, multi-lane <b>highways</b> allowed traffic to move at faster speeds, with few or no stoplights on the way. The wide-open spaces along the <b>highways</b> became a basis for numerous billboards showing advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Before 1998, several {{additional}} King's <b>Highways</b> {{and secondary}} <b>highways</b> {{were located in}} what was then known as Victoria County. These were transferred to the county in 1998. All county roads, including the former provincial <b>highways,</b> were renamed when Victoria County was abolished in 2001 and replaced with the City of Kawartha Lakes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 106 also {{connects with}} <b>Highway</b> 691, <b>Highway</b> 692, <b>Highway</b> 928, <b>Highway</b> 120, <b>Highway</b> 912, <b>Highway</b> 913, <b>Highway</b> 932, <b>Highway</b> 933, <b>Highway</b> 165, <b>Highway</b> 911, <b>Highway</b> 135.|$|R
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 165 {{connects with}} <b>Highway</b> 155, <b>Highway</b> 918, <b>Highway</b> 914, <b>Highway</b> 910, <b>Highway</b> 935, <b>Highway</b> 2, <b>Highway</b> 969, <b>Highway</b> 912, and <b>Highway</b> 106.|$|R
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 600 intersects <b>Highway</b> 18, <b>Highway</b> 361, <b>Highway</b> 13, <b>Highway</b> 48, <b>Highway</b> 1, <b>Highway</b> 709, <b>Highway</b> 308, and <b>Highway</b> 8.|$|R
5|$|Highway36 {{was first}} assumed by the Department of <b>Highways</b> (DHO) on July 1, 1931, {{and was one}} of several <b>highways</b> {{completed}} as part of a depressionrelief program. The highway initially connected downtown Lindsay with Bobcaygeon.|$|E
5|$|However, several {{exceptions}} exist, notably blue guidance signage for toll <b>highways</b> like Highway407 and Highway412, {{in addition}} to the collector lanes of <b>highways.</b>|$|E
5|$|Rural non-Interstate <b>highways</b> are {{particularly}} risky. Most are two-lane non-divided <b>highways</b> built to lower standards than Interstate <b>highways.</b> Drivers are often drunk and not wearing seat belts. Speeding is common. Deer, elk and moose crossing the highway {{add to the}} risk compared to urban <b>highways.</b> In {{the event of an}} accident in a remote area, injured victims may not receive emergency medical care in time to save their lives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 155 {{connects with}} <b>Highway</b> 55, <b>Highway</b> 165, <b>Highway</b> 965, <b>Highway</b> 908, <b>Highway</b> 925, <b>Highway</b> 909, <b>Highway</b> 956, and <b>Highway</b> 955.|$|R
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 606 intersects <b>Highway</b> 22, <b>Highway</b> 361, <b>Highway</b> 13, <b>Highway</b> 48, <b>Highway</b> 1, <b>Highway</b> 310, and <b>Highway</b> 8.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Highway</b> 120 intersects <b>Highway</b> 791, <b>Highway</b> 926, <b>Highway</b> 265, <b>Highway</b> 913, <b>Highway</b> 928, <b>Highway</b> 106, and <b>Highway</b> 920. The <b>highway</b> also {{passes through}} {{a small part of}} the Candle Lake Provincial Park.|$|R
5|$|The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U.S. Routes or U.S. <b>Highways)</b> is an {{integrated}} network of roads and <b>highways</b> numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States. As the designation and numbering of these <b>highways</b> were coordinated among the states, {{they are sometimes}} called Federal <b>Highways,</b> but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The advent motor {{vehicles}} created {{a demand for}} better use of <b>highways.</b> Roads evolved into two way roads, expressways, freeways and tollways during the modern times. Existing roads were developed and <b>highways</b> were designed according to intended use.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft trips are safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate <b>highways,</b> which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided <b>highways,</b> is safer than driving on most other roads and <b>highways.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Highway</b> 916 also {{connects with}} <b>Highway</b> 922, <b>Highway</b> 917, <b>Highway</b> 929, <b>Highway</b> 921, and <b>Highway</b> 939.|$|R
50|$|In Texas, US 180 intersects U.S. <b>Highway</b> 385, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 87, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 84, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 83, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 277, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 283, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 183, U.S. <b>Highway</b> 281, and Interstate 20.|$|R
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 4 is a toll road. <b>Highway</b> 4 expands to 4 lanes near {{an airport}} runway. This 4 lane section is divided and {{controlled}} access. <b>Highway</b> 4 merges with <b>Highway</b> 1 and proceeds south until it leaves <b>Highway</b> 1. <b>Highway</b> 4 continues both {{east and west}} of <b>Highway</b> 1. <b>Highway</b> 4 east of <b>Highway</b> 1 reduces to 2 lanes near <b>Highway</b> R35. West of <b>Highway</b> 1, <b>Highway</b> 4's terminus is between R511 and R104. <b>Highway</b> 4 is 4 lane until its terminus.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} <b>highways</b> {{were approved}} on November 11, 1926, by AASHTO including 14mainline <b>highways.</b> A handful of these original highway designations no longer run within Michigan, {{and a few}} numbers have been added since the 1930s. Since 1999, there have been 13 mainline <b>highways,</b> and {{with the creation of}} a business route for Constantine, there are a total of 30 special routes in the state. Several <b>highways</b> have been converted to freeways, some of which are now Interstate <b>Highways</b> and no longer part of the US Highway System. These freeway conversions started in the 1940s and 1950s and continued through to the turn of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{established}} in 2006 when Alberta Transportation renumbered portions of Highways637, 45, 860, 36, and 28 between <b>Highways</b> 36 and 41, forming a more coherent route between St.Paul and Edmonton that involved only two numbered <b>highways.</b>|$|E
5|$|Transportation in Oklahoma is {{generated}} by an anchor system of Interstate <b>Highways,</b> intercity rail lines, airports, inland ports, and mass transit networks. Situated along an integral point in the United States Interstate network, Oklahoma contains three interstate <b>highways</b> and four auxiliary Interstate <b>Highways.</b> In Oklahoma City, Interstate 35 intersects with Interstate 44 and Interstate 40, forming {{one of the most}} important intersections along the United States highway system.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Highway</b> 8, {{known as}} the Nicola <b>Highway,</b> is an {{alternate}} route to <b>Highway</b> 97C between <b>Highway</b> 1 and the Coquihalla <b>Highway</b> (<b>Highway</b> 5) in the Thompson-Nicola Regional District. <b>Highway</b> 8 was first numbered in 1953, and {{very little about the}} <b>highway</b> has changed since that year. <b>Highway</b> 8 follows the Nicola River for [...] between Spences Bridge, on <b>Highway</b> 1, to Merritt on <b>Highway</b> 5.|$|R
50|$|The Trans-Canada <b>Highway</b> (<b>Highway</b> 1) {{passes through}} Hope. Hope is the {{southern}} terminus of the Coquihalla <b>Highway</b> (<b>Highway</b> 5), the western terminus of the Crowsnest <b>Highway,</b> locally {{known as the}} Hope-Princeton <b>highway</b> (<b>Highway</b> 3), and the eastern terminus of <b>Highway</b> 7.|$|R
50|$|Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 1 was {{originally}} designated in 1925 between Harrison and South Sioux City, replacing Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 79, Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 78, Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 77, Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 65, and Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 49. In 1926, this <b>highway</b> became U.S. Route 20, and Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 1 {{was transferred to}} its current route. This route {{was originally}} signed as Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 24 in 1922 and changed to Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 5A in 1925, and Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 30 in 1926 before becoming Nebraska <b>Highway</b> 1.|$|R
5|$|You {{are going}} to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You {{are going to}} build two four-lane <b>highways</b> through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our {{neighboring}} states. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate <b>highways</b> are going to be very attractive <b>highways</b> for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate <b>Highways,</b> U.S. <b>Highways,</b> and state <b>highways</b> known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, it {{is not subject to}} state limits. These limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the vehicle is not on the NN.|$|E
5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings {{of the two}} state <b>highways</b> downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US223 business loop. These streets carried both <b>highways</b> around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.|$|E
5000|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} <b>Highway</b> 21A was a [...] <b>highway</b> that connected <b>Highway</b> 21 with <b>Highway</b> 12 near the Hamlet of Nevis. [...] In the early-1990s, <b>Highway</b> 11 was extended east from <b>Highway</b> 815 near Joffre to <b>Highway</b> 21; when construction was completed, <b>Highway</b> 21A {{became part of}} <b>Highway</b> 11.|$|R
50|$|<b>Highway</b> 368 intersects <b>Highway</b> 756, <b>Highway</b> 777, <b>Highway</b> 776, and <b>Highway</b> 41. <b>Highway</b> 368 passes near Lake Lenore, St. Brieux, Pathlow, and Claggett.|$|R
50|$|From Sydney, it heads southwards to Melbourne {{and then}} on to Adelaide via the Eastern Distributor, Southern Cross Drive, General Holmes Drive, The Grand Parade, President Avenue, Princes <b>Highway</b> (NSW), Princes Motorway, Princes <b>Highway</b> (VIC), Princes Freeway (east), Monash Freeway, CityLink, West Gate Freeway, Princes Freeway (west), Geelong Ring Road, Princes <b>Highway</b> (SA). From then on to Perth via Port Wakefield Road, Augusta <b>Highway,</b> Eyre <b>Highway,</b> Coolgardie-Esperance <b>Highway,</b> South Coast <b>Highway</b> and South Western <b>Highway.</b> It then heads to Darwin via Brand <b>Highway,</b> North West Coastal <b>Highway,</b> Great Northern <b>Highway,</b> Victoria <b>Highway,</b> and Stuart <b>Highway.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although M-n {{outside of}} Michigan could conceivably refer to other state, provincial, local, or {{national}} <b>highways,</b> local usage {{in those areas}} does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases. In countries like the United Kingdom, M refers to motorways, analogous to freeways in the United States, whereas M-numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state trunklines in general and may exist on any type of highway. M-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial <b>highways,</b> and two-lane <b>highways</b> in remote rural areas. The system also includes M-185 on Mackinac Island, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline <b>highways</b> on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south <b>highways</b> use odd numbers and east–west <b>highways</b> have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E
5|$|Concurrent <b>highways</b> I-15/84 {{continue}} south, {{parallel to}} rail {{belonging to the}} Union Pacific Railroad (UP) past the Wellsville Mountain Wilderness, to an interchange at 1100West in Brigham City, also known as US-91, which once in Brigham City becomes concurrent with US-89 and the two <b>highways</b> travel northeast from Brigham City into Box Elder Canyon towards Logan {{in the heart of}} the Cache Valley. US-89 closely parallels I-15/84 east,as the <b>highways</b> pass Willard Bay, the Willard Bay State Park and Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge before crossing into Weber County.|$|E
5000|$|Alberta Provincial <b>Highway</b> No. 986, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>Highway</b> 986, is an east-west <b>highway</b> in northern Alberta, Canada. It spans approximately [...] from <b>Highway</b> 35 (Mackenzie <b>Highway)</b> to <b>Highway</b> 88 (Bicentennial <b>Highway).</b>|$|R
25|$|Asian <b>Highway</b> Network is an {{international}} project between Asian nations to develop their <b>highway</b> systems which will form the main routes in the Asian <b>Highway</b> network. There are 7 Asian <b>Highway</b> routes passing through Malaysia - AH2 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 2, AH18 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 18, AH140 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 140, AH141 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 141, AH142 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 142, AH143 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 143, and AH150 Asian <b>Highway</b> Route 150.|$|R
50|$|The route {{began in}} {{downtown}} Windsor {{at the intersection}} of Ouellette Avenue and Riverside Drive. That intersection also served as the terminus for <b>Highway</b> 3B, <b>Highway</b> 18, and <b>Highway</b> 39; <b>Highway</b> 2 continued through the intersection to meet <b>Highway</b> 3 at the Ambassador Bridge. <b>Highway</b> 2, <b>Highway</b> 3B, <b>Highway</b> 39 and <b>Highway</b> 98 travelled south concurrently along Oulette Avenue to Tecumseh Boulevard, at which point <b>Highway</b> 3B branched west along that road while the others turned east. At Howard Avenue, <b>Highway</b> 39 continued east while <b>Highway</b> 2 and <b>Highway</b> 98 turned south. They travelled concurrently to Cabana Road / Division Road, where <b>Highway</b> 2 split onto Division Road and <b>Highway</b> 98 onto Provincial Road.|$|R
