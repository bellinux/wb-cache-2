50|$|There was {{a strong}} {{governmental}} control over radio and television in the 1950-70s. Today, the CSA is only charged of surveillance of the respect of French law in the media, in particular concerning the 1990 Gayssot Act which prohibits racist or/and religious hate speech (under which negationism, in particular but not only Holocaust denial falls under), and time period allocated to each political party during pre-electoral periods. Furthermore, other laws prohibit <b>homophobic</b> hate <b>speech,</b> and a 1970 law prohibits the advocacy of illegal drugs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Jones {{heard the}} case of Shippensburg University {{students}} Walt Bair and Ellen Wray who sued the school {{in an effort to}} stop enforcing a speech code. The speech code banned all [...] "acts of intolerance" [...] including racist, sexist and <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech.</b> Jones ruled against the University explaining that while the code was well intentioned, it went too far in regulating speech. Jones issued an order that prohibited Shippensburg from enforcing four (4) provisions of the Student Code of Conduct. Jones found that the government may not prohibit speech based solely on the impact it will have on the listener.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{the school}} {{experiences}} of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) students suggests that schools continually fail to meet their safety and healthy climate needs. Among other issues, this growing body of literature suggests that pejorative, <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech</b> is an epidemic in our schools. Much of this research depicts teachers as negligent or ineffective, or worse, adding to the problem. While teachers are clearly {{an important part of}} this story, their experiences, their perspectives and their voices have been absent in the discourse surrounding such issues. This paper introduces teachers 2 ̆ 7 voices into that discourse. ^ This qualitative study explores how teachers in one high school talk about classroom-based incidents of <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech.</b> Teachers 2 ̆ 7 conceptions of such speech and it effects, and their perceptions and enactment of various responsive roles during such encounters are examined. These ideas and experiences are explicated according to their relationship with theoretical conceptions of teacher motivation and engagement in anti-oppressive educational practices. The results of this study, while further explicating these theories and expanding our understanding of teachers 2 ̆ 7 experiences, also illustrate how an act of leadership can create a space for teachers to interrogate their own practices and the realities of their own classrooms. ...|$|E

Historically, before its repeal under François Mitterrand in the early 1980s, the ORTF had a significant influence on the mass media.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal, Men and Masculinities and the definitive version is available here: [URL] article analyses 5, 128 comments from 35 prominent football fan online message boards located across the United Kingdom and 978 online comments {{in response to a}} Guardian newspaper article regarding the decision by former German international footballer, Thomas Hitzlsperger, to publicly come out as gay in January 2014. Adopting the theoretical framework of inclusive masculinity theory, the findings demonstrate almost universal inclusivity through the rejection of homophobia and frequent contestation of comments that express orthodox views. From a period of high homophobia during the 1980 s and 1990 s, just 2 per cent of the 6, 106 comments contained pernicious homophobic intent. Rather than allow for covert <b>homophobic</b> hate <b>speech</b> towards those with a different sexual orientation, 98 per cent of the comments illustrate a significant decrease in cultural homophobia than was present when Justin Fashanu came out in 1990...|$|R
50|$|On 12 May 2015 Greece had {{its first}} survey ever showing {{majority}} support for same sex marriage at 56%, while 35% opposed it. The survey {{was based on}} 1,431 respondents and was conducted by Focus Bari. A very high percentage of respondents (76%) agreed that homosexuality should be accepted by society while 70% agreed that civil partnerships should be extended to gay couples. However respondents remained sceptical about adoption from same sex couples with only 30% supporting it while 56% opposed it. Only 14% believed that homosexuality is a mental disorder and 54% stated that stricter laws should exist to punish <b>homophobic</b> crimes (hate <b>speech</b> in particular).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests {{that there have been}} significant increases in the number of problems reported by students who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual. This paper seeks to describe, by means of autobiographical account, the educational implications of being identified as 'queer' within schools. It draws on experiential stories to illustrate the injurious effects of <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech</b> acts and attempts to show how reconstructed narratives of the self can be used in educational research. The stories told in this article speak about the impact of heteronormative practices in education and how a sense of self can become constituted through the authorising, performative utterances of wounding words...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the legal regulation of religiously-motivated speech that {{is critical of}} same-sex behaviour. The ‘Culture Wars’ have now reached Europe and are being played out in claims, on the one hand, that full equality on grounds of sexual orientation requires the punishment of <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech</b> and, on the other hand, that religious freedom requires the freedom to offend or to be exempted from emerging societal norms concerning equality. Contrasting judicial decisions in the UK, Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Sweden, and recent UK legislation (Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008) suggest {{different ways in which}} this clash of values can be mediated. The chapter critically evaluates these {{in the light of the}} European Convention on Human Rights...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses corpus-based {{methods to}} explore how British Parliamentary {{arguments}} against LGBT equality have changed in response to decreasing social acceptability of discriminatory language against minority groups. A comparison {{of the language of}} opposition to the equalisation of the age of consent for anal sex (1998 – 2000) is made to the oppositional language in debates to allow same-sex marriage (2013). Keyword, collocation and concordance analyses were used to identify differences in overall argumentation strategies, assessing the extent to which previously explicit <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech</b> (e. g. homosexuality as unnatural) has been replaced by more indirect strategies (e. g. less use of personalised argumentation via the pronoun I). We argue that while homophobic language appears to be on the decrease in such contexts, there is a mismatch between words and acts, requiring analysts to acknowledge the presence of more subtle indications of homophobic discourse in the future...|$|E
30|$|Table  2 {{illustrates}} {{very clearly}} that individual models of cyber hate do not generalise well across different protected characteristics. In all but two cases, the trained models did not detect any cyber hate in test instances from a different protected characteristic. However, one case where there was an improvement was when the model was trained using homophobic cyber hate instances and tested using the race dataset. This suggests that there were features present within the sexual orientation data that were relevant to racism. In this case, {{it is possible that}} the sexual orientation training data also contained racist narrative due to the context of the case. The <b>homophobic</b> hate <b>speech</b> was directed at a black male. There is a smaller reciprocal improvement in classification performance when using sexual orientation as the test dataset after having trained the model on racist cyber hate. In this case, the racist element of the sexual orientation dataset is likely being predictive of racist cyber hate, but to a lesser degree. These results suggest people posting this content were targeting more racist content towards a black homosexual man than they were targeting homophobic remarks to a black heterosexual man. This presents an interesting future research direction - determining whether it is possible to measure the likelihood of attacking more than one protected characteristic with varying degrees of frequency in certain cases, to dynamically improve classification of hate speech following a new event. If this were measurable, it may be possible to mix training datasets on-the-fly and rebuild supervised classification models to reflect the context of the antecedent event and measure public reaction in real-time. For example, if a terrorist attack was carried out by a member of a minority group in a predominantly caucasian community in the UK/US, it would be expected that there may follow a hateful response. If the individual or group responsible for the attack exhibited particular race characteristics different to caucasian, the response would be expected to reflect on that. If it transpired later that they also exhibited or supported religious or sexuality beliefs, the response may also reflect on that. As the context changed, it would be likely that the cyber hate classifier would also require updating to maintain levels of accuracy.|$|R
40|$|In 1998, the Manhattan Theatre Club’s {{staging of}} Terrence McNally’s play Corpus Christi ignited protest and virulent {{condemnation}} from various religious and politically conservative groups which {{eventually led to}} the cancellation of the play’s production. This led to a barrage of criticism from the national theatre, gay, and civil rights communities and free speech advocates, including the ACLU and PEN, which issued a press releases about the cancellation that decried censorship and acquiescence by the theatre to neo-conservative religiously political groups. As swiftly as the cancellation, the Manhattan Theatre Club reversed its decision and the show resumed its rehearsal schedule. Although the critical reception of the play was mostly negative, the political controversy surrounding its production testifies to the fact that a contemporary play in America dealing with both religious and gay themes is still economically risky, radical politically, and worthy of critical rhetorical analysis. This work aims to fill that gap by providing an in-depth investigation of the tangled rhetorical history of Corpus Christi. First providing an account of the controversy surrounding the 1998 production of Corpus Christi, this work then gives a historical and cultural analysis of McNally’s career and corpus of work leading up to the play’s contentious staging. Second, a full account of the play’s critical reception is given through a close analysis of the rhetorical responses to the work from the Christian Right and the more secular community that supported the play’s production. Third, the American Christian Right’s vitriolic rhetorical response to the play is indicted as <b>homophobic</b> hate <b>speech.</b> Fourth, how McNally’s play repudiates the rhetorical violence perpetrated by the Right against gays is revealed. Finally, the last two chapters examine how the rhetoric of the play speaks directly to its queer audience. Chapter five reveals the rhetorical and meta-theatrical conversion strategies employed by McNally in Corpus Christi to proselytize his expansive message of Christ to his gay audience. Ending the work, chapter six examines McNally’s rhetorical reclamation of the Christ figure from the Right as a means of sacralizing homosexuality as a religious identity and homosexual love and sex as a spiritual act...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on swear-taboo words in bilinguals {{shows that they}} affirm “in-group membership” and aid in definitive identity constructions (Dewaele 2004). Equal or near-equivalent Spanish/English bilingualism in Miami-area Caribbean Latinxs provides a population of subjects {{with the ability to}} frequently code switch between both languages. Studying homophobic language used in Miami’s bilingual Latinx contexts aids in establishing a better understanding of multilingualism’s role in communities of color and its relationship to <b>homophobic</b> <b>speech.</b> The construction of Caribbean Latino queer masculinity also provides an interesting experience in identifying the role of associated gender with the severity or marginalizing force of the words in question (Kurtz 1999). This study makes use of structured questionnaires with 10 straight Miami Caribbean Latino men who evaluate the insulting intent of homophobic language in English and Caribbean Spanish on a linear scale from 1 - 3, 1 : Doesn’t seem like intended to be an insult, 3 : Intended to be directed anger. The emotional reaction data is analyzed to identify the power dynamics and social pressures at play behind the populations using English and Spanish homophobic slurs and their emotional impact on Caribbean Latino masculinities. In addition to the data on their evaluation of insulting quality, recordings of acted slurs in English and Spanish by bilingual Miami Cubans are used {{to see if there are}} noticeable intonational differences between the speech signals and how manipulations are perceived by listeners in relation to degree of insult. This research has broad implications for understanding the role that intonation plays in the interpretation of emotion behind insulting speech acts and the way homophobia is realized in the speech of bilingual communities...|$|E
