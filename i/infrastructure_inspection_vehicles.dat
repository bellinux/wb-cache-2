40|$|Abstract [...] The {{process of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> in the United Arab Emirates has been {{investigated}} in this study using multiple decision-making criteria. The objective {{was to assess the}} current situation and set out recommendations to improve <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> procedure. Inspected mechanical and environmental parameters have been compared among different inspection centers in the country. The assessment included inspection of both light and heavy vehicles as well as vehicles imported through ports. A set of surveys have been designed to collect information about the inspection process, opinion of the inspection technicians, public opinion, and opinion of <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> experts in the country. The study revealed significant differences among the inspection centers in the different Emirates and even within the same Emirate. It has been found that <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> forms are not uniform among the seven Emirates, with no Emirates Standards for vehicles safety and environmental <b>inspection.</b> Additionally, <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> equipments are not unified among the inspection centers and inspection of some important safety issues is not implemented. It was also found that there was no third-party auditing to assure quality control. Moreover, most of the customers did not abide to the rules of <b>vehicle</b> <b>inspection</b> and <b>vehicle</b> maintenance...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} Cooperative Coverage Path Planning (C-CPP) for the <b>inspection</b> of complex <b>infrastructures</b> (offline 3 D reconstruction) by utilizing multiple Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed scheme, based on a priori 3 D model of the <b>infrastructure</b> under <b>inspection,</b> is able to generate multiple paths for UAVs {{in order to achieve}} a complete cooperative coverage in a short time. Initially the <b>infrastructure</b> under <b>inspection</b> is being sliced by horizontal planes, which has the capability of recognizing the branches of the structure and these branches will be handled as breaking points for the path planning of the UAVs to collaboratively execute the coverage task in less time and more realistically, based on the current flying times of the UAVs. The multiple data sets collected from the coverage are merged for the offline sparse and dense 3 D reconstruction of the infrastructure by utilizing SLAM and Structure from Motion approaches, with either monocular or stereo sensors. The performance of the proposed C-CPP has been experimentally evaluated in multiple indoor and realistic outdoor <b>infrastructure</b> <b>inspection</b> experiments.

40|$|The {{ability to}} perform {{autonomous}} in-space inspection and servicing activities is of significant importance to the future space program. The University of Maryland has developed a pair of free-flying robotic platforms that operate in a neutral buoyancy environment to support such space-based activities. Numerous tests have been performed with this platform, including demonstration of a robust closed-loop controller for the rotational degrees of freedom. This rotational controller has been observed to substantially reduce operator workload through stable maintenance and tracking of attitude commands. However, in previous work the operator has directly controlled translational motion due {{to the absence of}} an inertial navigation system such as GPS in the underwater environment. Recently, a Visual Positioning System (VPS) has been developed for the neutral buoyancy environment that provides translational position and velocity estimates of the free-flying <b>inspection</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This paper describes the development and testing of a six degree-offreedom control system for this <b>inspection</b> <b>vehicle</b> and analyzes its performance during a variety of stationkeeping, pilot-assisted, and autonomous trajectory-tracking tasks.
