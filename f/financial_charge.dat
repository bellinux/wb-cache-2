5000|$|Several historians {{take the}} middle ground between condemning reparations and {{supporting}} the argument {{that they were not}} a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, [...] "Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy" [...] as had been feared, however the [...] "psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system". P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a [...] "strain on the German balance of payments", they could be paid and were [...] "compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry". According to Martel, Robert Boyce said reparations were [...] "a heavy burden on Germany, both as a <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> ... and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments". However, he says that while [...] "Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations" [...] this was far from the truth, and that [...] " ... Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad". William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, [...] "an increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt". However, Charles Feinstein writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans [...] "to accept even a modest increase in taxation to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries". Feinstein says that [...] "even if the economic aspects ... were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany".|$|E

In this paper, we study {{the whole process of}} MapReduce processing and build up a cost function that explicitly models the relationship between the amount of input data, the available system resources (Map and Reduce slots), and the complexity of the Reduce function for the target MapReduce job. The model parameters can be learned from test runs with a small number of nodes. Based on this cost model, we can solve a number of decision problems, such as the optimal amount of resources that can minimize the financial cost with a time deadline or minimize the time under certain financial budget. Experimental results show that this cost model performs well on tested MapReduce programs...|$|E

This thesis describes the weaknesses in the current PPM policies and procedures. An analysis of the PPM policies and procedures concludes that the root cause common to the weaknesses indentified in the current PPM policies is an incentive structure that rewards a service member {{in the form of a}} variable monetary incentive based on the amount of weight he/she transports. This thesis proposes a three-step pilot plan to address the weaknesses and to incentivize service members to transport fewer household goods. The first step implements a NAVSUP proposal to provide a <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> card for service members to charge their transportation expenses. The second step is a shift to a fixed monetary incentive based on the average government contract cost for a Transportation Service Provider to ship household goods.

40|$|Abstract Tax is a <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> {{imposed on}} {{individuals}} by state in different forms like direct tax paid directly by individuals, indirect tax collected by intermediaries and deposited to Government like sales tax. Taxation {{plays an important}} role in the process of revenue generation and to run various activities in an economy. The study empirically demonstrates various factors involved in direct and indirect tax collection in Pakistan. Tax to GDP ratio, corruption, political instability, trade openness, real per capita income and inflation were considered main factors affecting tax collection in empirical testing. Corruption and political instability were measured by using corruption index and political instability index respectively. Time series data from 1980 - 2010 was used for regression analysis. Data of all variables was obtained from International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), Handbook of Statistics and Polity to Project IMF. Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test was applied to check the stationarity of all variables. Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) model was applied to find out long run and short run dynamics of models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we enhance the Digital Content Mediator (DCM) approach, a {{legitimate}} online service that uses financial incen-tives {{as an effective}} weapon to fight against online piracy. We provide needed network security support for the DCM service. The DCM mediator is a trusted notary to ensure fair and legiti-mate deals between digital content selling peers and buying peers. (1) In our design, the mediator sees no raw bits of digital contents. This saves storage and communication resource for the central mediator. (2) For the seller and buyer in a DCM-legitimized transaction, one wants payment and the other wants the content. The DCM protocol ensures that neither of them can stop the protocol in the middle to steal its service without serv-ing the other party. (3) A digital content may have many legiti-mate copies from large amount of sellers. In a large-scale ran-dom network like the Internet, transaction fairness {{is defined as the}} condition that a buyer wants to buy the copy from the seller with shortest downloading delay (i. e., largest seller-to-buyer pairwise bandwidth) given the same amount of <b>financial</b> <b>charge.</b> DCM employs flow network security countermeasures to ensure that a seller keeps its bandwidth promises.

40|$|The sexual violence's {{committed}} in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are from their scales and consequences on women, real public health, politico-legal, and socio-economical challenges. More than a million of women have been victims of sexual violence on a period of less than fifteen years. Systematic rapes of women were used as war weapon by different groups involved in the Congolese war. Sexual violence against women has impacted public health by spreading sexually transmissible diseases including HIV/AIDS, causing unwanted pregnancies, leading to the gynaecological complications of rape-related injuries, and inflicting psychological trauma on the victims. Despite high level of unwanted pregnancies observed, the Congolese law is very restrictive and interdict induced abortion. This paper presents three arguments which plead in favour of legalizing abortion in DRC : 1) a restrictive law on abortion forces women to use unsafe abortion and increase incidence of injuries and maternal mortality; 2) DRC has ratified the universal Declaration of human rights, the African union charter, and has than to promote equality between sexes, in this is included women reproductive rights; 3) an unwanted birth is an additional <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> for a woman, a factor increasing poverty and psychologically unacceptable in case of rape. From the politico-legal point of view, endinging rape impunity and decriminalizing abortion are recommended. Decriminalizing abortion give women choice and save victims and pregnant women from risks related to the pregnancy, a childbirth, or an eventual unsafe abortion. These risks increase the maternal mortality already high in DRC (between 950 and 3000 for 100000 live births). SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the barriers female sex workers (FSWs) in Bangladesh face with regard to accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care, and assess the satisfaction with the healthcare received. Data were collected from coverage areas of four community-based drop-in-centers (DICs) in Dhaka where sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human immunovirus (HIV) prevention interventions have been implemented for FSWs. A total of 731 FSWs aged 15 - 49 years were surveyed. In addition, in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with 14 FSWs and 9 service providers. Respondent satisfaction was measured based on recorded scores on dignity, privacy, autonomy, confidentiality, prompt attention, access to social support networks during care, basic amenities, and choice of institution/care provider. Of 731 FSWs, 353 (51 %) reported facing barriers when seeking sexual and reproductive healthcare. Financial problems (72 %), shame about receiving care (52. 3 %), unwillingness of service providers to provide care (39. 9 %), unfriendly behavior of the provider (24. 4 %), and distance to care (16. 9 %) were mentioned as barriers. Only one-third {{of the respondents reported}} an overall satisfaction score of more than fifty percent (a score of between 9 and 16) with formal healthcare. Inadequacy or lack of SRH services and referral problems (e. g., <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> at referral centers, unsustainable referral provision, or unknown location of referral) were reported by the qualitative FSWs as the major barriers to accessing and utilizing SRH care. These findings are useful for program implementers and policy makers to take the necessary steps to reduce or remove the barriers in the health system that are preventing FSWs from accessing SRH care, and ultimately meet the unmet healthcare needs of FSWs...|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement/ Objective: Severe {{dehydration}} due to diarrhoea {{leads to}} 19. 8 % of deaths among children under 5 {{years of age}} in Madagascar (1). The Ministry of Health identified infant diarrhoea {{as a public health}} priority. Several studies show that there is an association between infant and young child feeding practices and diarrhoea morbidity (2, 3). A conceptual framework allowed a description of child undernutrition as immediately linked to poverty with diarrhoea as a short-term consequence(4). A cultural contruction of diarrhoeal illness one was proposed by Weiss with the KAP model (5). Thus, {{there is a need to}} understand how young child diarrhoea is managed with regard to knowledge, attitudes, feeding and treatment practices in the households of Moramanga (Madagascar). Material and Methods: This study is a qualitative study and the following methods were used: 1) 5 focus groups discussions (FGDs) were conducted with mothers, grandmothers and fathers in an area close to the Maternal and Child Health Centre (CSMI); 2) 5 semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with health professionals (doctors, midwife and community health workers) were made in Moramanga to supplement the information and explore the reality of caregivers during child diarrhoea episodes with regards to the education. The information analyzed was triangulated between the data provided by FGDs and SSIs. Reliability was improved by leading FGDs only in the local language and translating from Malagasy to French with two independent local translators and then comparing the translations with two independent doctors. Findings: Health and diarrhoea treatment are not a priority requirement for people in Moramanga. Their opportunity to pay for the health care is limited and the <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> in relation with the illness leads them to a bigger poverty. Even the cost of ORS is expensive for the population who prefere using traditional medicine. Health workers confirmed sub-optimal treatment practices and varied acknowledgement of the socio-economic burden of diarrhoea was seen. Discussion and conclusion: Considering all these results, most of the children could be treated at home with zinc and ORS or a family preparation with salt and sugar. Population has to learn how to rehydrate properly the child. Health workers must now implement a preventive programme involving people targeting the financial constraint of the population. This programme will be differenciated for each group in the population and will not only implement a global programme. Understanding the priorities of the population can assist in improving the diarrhoea programme in this region...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of lifelong chronic inflammatory diseases with variable and unpredictable disease courses which often require significant healthcare expenditures. There exists no uniform severity measure {{to capture the}} activity and the healthcare utilization of the disease. This study seeks to identify disease trajectories for the IBD patients based on their annual financial healthcare charges over time. We performed a longitudinal study of annual financial charges using a consented, prospective, natural history registry of 2, 400 IBD patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center from 2009 to 2013. The annual charges were calculated as the sum of inpatient admission charges and professional service charges, with (ChargeF) or without (ChargeR) biological medicine charges. Patients who completed a five-year follow-up {{were included in the}} study. The continuous financial charges were first categorized into sections of different price range, and then the data was fitted with a latent group-based zero-inflated Poisson model to identify different homogeneous trajectory patterns of financial charges. We identified six distinct trajectory groups of total annual charges obtained from each of the two calculation methods (ChargeF and ChargeR). We further compared between these trajectories for patient characteristics, disease activity indices (Harvey-Bradshaw Index and ulcerative colitis activity index), disease activity markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), health-related quality of life index (short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire, SIBDQ), healthcare utilization (emergency department, hospitalization, and surgery), and corticosteroid prescriptions. We concluded that the healthcare <b>financial</b> <b>charge</b> could be a novel and uniform metric to evaluate the disease severity and the response of IBD patients to treatments. The present study is {{the first of its kind}} using latent group-based trajectory modeling of financial charges to identify distinct subsets of IBD patients with their response to treatments. The model could be used to determine the genetic, environmental, and other factors that influence disease severity and the patient’s response to medical therapies. It will provide important information for the development of personalized or precision medical interventions for IBD patients and the reduction of their health care cost. Public Health Relevance: This study proposed a new metric which could be an accurate reflection of classic disease activity parameters, biochemical markers of inflammation, disease activity indices, and health-related quality of life in a cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The model developed would be of great significance to exploring the risk factors that influence the response to medical interventions.
