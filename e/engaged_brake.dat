50|$|The system {{monitors}} cross {{traffic in}} an intersection/road junction. If this anticipatory system detects a hazardous situation of this type, it prompts {{the driver to}} start emergency braking by activating visual and acoustic warnings and automatically <b>engaging</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|SSC's job {{is purely}} informational, relying on driver's {{intervention}} {{in case of}} obstacles ahead, while SCMT can actively <b>engage</b> emergency <b>brakes</b> and speed limits.|$|R
25|$|Second: The {{clutch pedal}} is {{unlatched}} and the clutch <b>engaged.</b> The <b>brake</b> pedal is pushed forward {{as far as}} possible setting brakes on the rear wheel.|$|R
25|$|Capacity is {{inversely}} proportional to headway. Therefore, moving from two-second headways to one-second headways would double PRT capacity. Half-second headways would quadruple capacity. Theoretical minimum PRT headways {{would be based on}} the mechanical time to <b>engage</b> <b>brakes,</b> and these are much less than a half second. Although no regulatory agency has as yet (June 2006) approved headways shorter than two seconds, researchers suggest that high capacity PRT (HCPRT) designs could operate safely at half-second headways. Using the above figures, capacities above 10,000 passengers per hour seem in reach.|$|R
50|$|A {{solenoid brake}} is an {{electrically}} controlled brake. The brake {{is turned on}} and off by an electrical solenoid. Typically a spring <b>engages</b> the <b>brake</b> when unpowered, and the solenoid releases it when powered.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Déjà Vu at Six Flags Great America, with {{passengers}} waiting mid-ride after emergency <b>brakes</b> <b>engaged.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{is a third}} {{mechanic}} [...] "station brake", {{controlled by}} electrovalve regulated coils. An emergency system enables the driver to totally shut down the machine pressing two big red buttons on the console, cutting off electricity and <b>engaging</b> the <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Controller-{{throttle}} <b>engages</b> spoiler/dive <b>brake</b> {{system when}} throttle setting is below a fixed power setting and gradually increases effect of spoiler/dive brake as throttle is moved toward idle position; since action is automatically reversible, a sudden {{application of power}} abruptly terminates aerodynamic effects of spoiler/dive brake system...|$|R
2500|$|Coaster-brake {{bicycles}} {{are generally}} {{equipped with a}} single cog and chain wheel and often use ⅛ in (3.2mm) wide chain. [...] However, {{there have been several}} models of coaster brake hubs with dérailleurs, such as the Sachs 2x3. These use special extra-short dérailleurs which can stand up to the forces of being straightened out frequently and do not require an excessive amount of reverse pedal rotation before the <b>brake</b> <b>engages.</b> Coaster <b>brakes</b> have also been incorporated into hub gear designs - for example the AWC and SRC3 from Sturmey-Archer, and the Shimano Nexus 3-speed. They can have up to eight gears, like the Nexus inter-8.|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} is principally {{operated}} by the top-hand guard being pushed forward to <b>engage</b> the <b>brake,</b> and pulled back to disengage. The spring-loaded action allows powerful braking under emergency conditions and can halt a chain under full power in {{a fraction of a}} second. Correspondingly, it may require considerable force to reset.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{safety system}} was established. If no control in one minute, then the {{emergency}} <b>brake</b> <b>engages</b> {{and the train}} stops. This system is named by Japan [...] "EB".|$|R
50|$|A broken clamp is {{an unusual}} but not unheard of event. Steel clamps {{sometimes}} experience fatigue or corrosion damage, so a failure is accounted as a possibility. In case of a clamp failure {{the loss of a}} train section breaks off the pneumatic brake circuit: lack of pressure <b>engages</b> emergency <b>brakes</b> on both parts of the convoy and alert the engineers.|$|R
50|$|The {{on-board}} computer generates two speed-thresholds {{based on the}} received signals from the balises. If the train is over the speed limit, passing the first speed-threshold, an audible alarm sounds and the control panel indicates to the driver to adjust the train speed without delay. If the second speed threshold is passed, the KVB automatically <b>engages</b> emergency <b>brakes</b> on the train.|$|R
50|$|Barnes and Colson {{catch up}} to 777 and attempt to engage the coupling. Their {{attempts}} to connect with 777 cause the grain car seal to break and leak grain at a blinding rate. Colson notices the locking pin on the coupler is not engaged. He attempts to kick it in but the couple again impacts 1206 and Colson gets his right foot crushed in the process. However, {{he is able to}} hold on enough to fully engage the locking pin. Barnes works his way across 777 to its cab, manually <b>engaging</b> the <b>brakes</b> on the freight cars along the way, while Colson <b>engages</b> 1206's dynamic <b>brakes,</b> which initially slow down 777, but would prove to be no match for 777's speed. They are able to reduce the speed slow enough to clear the Stanton Curve without derailing by using the independent brake, but 777 remains out of control and threatens to crash into the Stanton train yard. Despite attempting to reach the locomotive by jumping on the cars, Barnes finds his path blocked to 777's cab, but Oldham arrives in his truck with a police convoy and drives on a parallel road to the tracks. Colson jumps to Oldham's truck, and Oldham drives him up to the front of 777 allowing Colson to get into the cab and <b>engage</b> the <b>brakes.</b> 777 is safely stopped before it reaches the end of the line.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{wide range}} of other {{electronic}} features, offered as extras. These include lane assist (warns the driver if they inadvertently leave their lane), Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control ART (which <b>engages</b> the <b>brakes</b> if the vehicle in front suddenly stops), side looking radar for warning the driver about a vehicle in their blind spot, and many more, mostly oriented towards safety. All of them are marketed as [...] "Telligent".|$|R
50|$|When {{the landing}} {{feature of the}} autobrake is engaged, the {{aircraft}} automatically <b>engages</b> pressurized wheel <b>braking</b> upon touchdown to the landing surface. During the roll out, application of the brake pedals transfers control back to the pilot.|$|R
50|$|Performing a burnout in a {{front wheel}} drive vehicle is {{likely to result in}} damage to the drivetrain. It is usually {{achieved}} by <b>engaging</b> the parking <b>brake</b> to lock up the rear tires and flooring the gas pedal.|$|R
50|$|The {{engineers}} of both trains noticed {{each other}} at Brzoza Torunska. Morning fog limited visibility, and the trains were some 150 meters from each other when they became visible. Roschek probably reacted first, <b>engaging</b> his <b>brakes.</b> He must have realized then {{that he was on}} the wrong track, but did not try to escape by jumping out. His body was later found in the engine. Przyjemski <b>engaged</b> his train's <b>brakes</b> a few seconds later, and immediately tried to escape the locomotive cab. The trains crashed into each other when he was in a narrow corridor {{in the rear of the}} engine; this probably saved his life. Later on, the investigators thoroughly recreated the accident, stating that it would have been impossible to stop the trains before the crash. The engines collided at 4:30 a.m. The freight train was traveling at 33 km/h, the passenger train 85 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Fin brakes {{involve a}} metal fin being {{attached}} to the underside of a train. The track is fitted with two computer-controlled squeezing mechanisms which upon closing, squeeze the fin and either slow or stop the train. Fin brakes {{are the most common}} form of brakes on roller coasters today. Sometimes they are thick metal box beams (mostly on Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters); others are thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads. Fin brakes are designed to be fail-safe, so that a loss of power will cause them to <b>engage.</b> <b>Brakes</b> are constructed according to a certain measure of redundancy, meaning the ride is usually fitted with one extra set of brakes to bring the train to a hold even if one brake fails. Opening is done by a bellows type of air-operated actuator. Each set of brakes is fitted with its own air supply system controlled by supply valves which open the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring, usually made of steel, is used to hold the brake closed by default.|$|R
5000|$|The {{trick is}} {{performed}} by progressively <b>engaging</b> the front <b>brake</b> and leaning forward {{to shift the}} center of mass closer to the front wheel. The rider then tries to balance by shifting their weight and keeping the rear wheel as high as possible.|$|R
50|$|At 2:23 pm CDT, Delta Flight 1288 {{was cleared}} for takeoff on Runway 17. As the first officer was {{advancing}} the throttles and reaching an airspeed of 40 knots, the cockpit lost lighting and instrumentation. The rear cabin passengers and flight crew heard a very loud bang and experienced a blast-like sensation. The pilot then ended takeoff by bringing the throttle to idle and <b>engaging</b> the <b>brake,</b> which brought the aircraft to an eventual stop without use of reversers or spoilers.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with establishing the braking retardation and determining of it's influence for standing passengers. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part is theoretical and it is <b>engaged</b> in <b>brake</b> system of tramway. The second, experimentally part talks about practical establishing of braking retardation. And the third part of thesis is gived to discussion about established values of braking retardation. The aim of thesis {{is to find a}} value of braking retardation, when standing passengers don't fall down...|$|R
5000|$|While taking off, the aircraft's autobrake {{can be set}} to the {{rejected}} takeoff mode, commonly {{indicated on}} an aircraft instrument panel as RTO. In case of the Airbus A300-600 and A320 family models, [...] "MAX" [...] mode is set. In RTO setting, the aircraft monitors certain variables, depending on the autobrake model. Most autobrakes <b>engage</b> RTO <b>braking</b> if the pilot returns the throttle to the [...] "idle" [...] position, or if reverse thrust is engaged. Other autobrake systems may monitor critical flight controls for failures.|$|R
5000|$|The 152 is also {{fitted with}} a parking brake system. It is applied by {{depressing}} both toe brakes and then pulling the [...] "Park Brake" [...] lever to the pilot’s left. The toe brakes are then released but pressure is maintained in the system thereby leaving both <b>brakes</b> <b>engaged.</b>|$|R
50|$|Earlier that day, San Francisco-bound ten-car Train No. 363 {{had made}} an {{emergency}} stop in the Transbay Tube at approximately 4:30 p.m., reporting smoke and a possible fire. Troubleshooting without an external inspection revealed No. 363 had broken derail bars on the number six and eight cars, and an <b>engaged</b> parking <b>brake</b> on the number nine car. After clearing the derail bar circuits and manually releasing the parking brake, No. 363 was cleared to proceed, and upon reaching {{the end of the}} line in Daly City, was taken out of service for inspection.|$|R
50|$|The Yankee Cannonball has two trains, {{with three}} cars per train, {{but only one}} train runs at a time. Riders are {{arranged}} two across in three rows in each car {{for a total of}} 18 riders per train. The trains were built by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Restraints consist of headrests and lap bars, and seat belts were added for the 2003 season, as a response to a 2001 accident, in which the two trains collided {{at the foot of the}} lift hill due to operator failure in <b>engaging</b> the <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
500|$|An {{emergency}} <b>brake</b> <b>engages</b> if the {{air pressure}} needed to control the incline is insufficient; the <b>brake</b> also <b>engages</b> if a dead man's switch is tripped in the operator's booth. In addition to the hauling cables, a [...] safety cable capable of withstanding [...] is also connected to the cars.|$|R
5000|$|On car #2211 (July 1975), {{a switch}} {{was added to}} the dual master {{cylinder}} along with a small PC board behind the dash to warn of problems with brake hydraulics, as well as indicating if the parking <b>brake</b> is <b>engaged.</b> Before #2211, the brake lamp was a parking <b>brake</b> <b>engaged</b> indicator only.|$|R
25|$|On 15 September 2011, {{a report}} by RT stated that it was now {{believed}} {{that there was no}} evidence to show that the parking <b>brake</b> was <b>engaged</b> during the take off roll. RIA Novosti reported that Deputy Minister Okulov and Federal Air Transport Agency head Alexander Neradko both dismissed the theory in discussions with reporters at a press conference on 14 September 2011. The theory was also discounted by Konstantin Malinin, a former test pilot of the Yak-42, who noted that an <b>engaged</b> parking <b>brake</b> would have left skid marks and pieces of rubber on the runway, and there were none found.|$|R
50|$|Distant {{aspects that}} {{announce}} 'halt' or 'proceed with low speed', like Vr 0, Vr 2, Ks 2, Hl 10 etc., are normally (except for repeaters) {{accompanied by an}} activated 1000 Hz magnet of the PZB train safety system. Passing it triggers hidden timers in the vehicle's part of the PZB system, which first checks that the driver acknowledges the distant signal, then it supervises the braking. If the acknowledgement does not occur in time or if, at any point, the system detects that the train´s speed exceeds the limits of a certain <b>braking</b> profile, it <b>engages</b> full <b>brakes</b> and enforces a stop of the train.|$|R
50|$|Steering was {{accomplished}} through a seven-speed AK 7-200 synchromesh gearbox, designed by Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen (ZF), and a MAN single radius steering system, operated by steering levers. Each gear had a fixed radius of turning, ranging from 5 m for 1st gear up to 80 m for 7th gear. The driver {{was expected to}} judge the sharpness of a turn {{ahead of time and}} shift into the appropriate gear to turn the tank. The driver could also <b>engage</b> the <b>brakes</b> on one side to force a sharper turn. This manual steering was a much simplified design, compared to the sophisticated dual-radius hydraulically controlled steering system of the Tiger tanks.|$|R
5000|$|Steering the [...] was {{accomplished}} by turning the handlebars: Up to a certain point, only the front wheel would steer the vehicle. A motion of the handlebars beyond that point would <b>engage</b> the track <b>brakes</b> to help make turns sharper. It was also possible to run the vehicle without the front wheel installed and this was recommended in extreme off-road conditions where speed would be kept low.|$|R
50|$|Pre-Safe and Pre-Safe Plus for {{vehicles}} with Distronic Plus: a {{development of the}} previous Pre-Safe system fitted to the W220 S-Class, which uses vehicle-dynamic sensors to predict collisions and trigger precautionary measures to protect the vehicle occupants, the W221's Pre-Safe Plus system also takes into account closing speed, {{as measured by the}} vehicle's radar. If a collision appears likely, Pre-Safe closes all windows and the sunroof, moves all passenger's seats and their head restraints to a safer position, and tightens the seatbelts. It also inflates the air chambers in the side bolsters of the optional multi-contour seats and (from 2006) <b>engages</b> Pre-Safe <b>Brakes</b> in order to reduce speed and therefore severity of impact.|$|R
50|$|It is {{expected}} that these systems will incorporate other features in the future. Jaguar, Landrover, BMW, Renault, Subaru and VW already have a system where the emergency <b>brake</b> <b>engages</b> when the engine is stopped and is released when the gas pedal is pressed. An extension of this system, called the hill-hold function, prevents roll-back when stopping and starting on a hill. The OEM can easily turn off the system.|$|R
50|$|Other {{mechanical}} changes {{include a}} new 18.5 mm rear stabilizer bar, revised suspension tuning, upgrades to the 3.0 L V6 that brought power to 240 hp, {{and a new}} exhaust system on all Escapes. The braking system for the Hybrid versions has been revised with a vacuum assist unit that reviewers have said give the brakes a consistent feel over the entire travel of the brake pedal. Previous versions of the Hybrid {{were reported to have}} a slightly mushy brake feel, primarily {{due to the fact that}} for the first part of the brake travel and braking the system is regenerating power instead of <b>engaging</b> the <b>brake</b> pads against the rotors. However, the brakes, when tested, gave the Escape extremely long stops.|$|R
40|$|A {{brake system}} is {{provided}} that applies braking forces on surfaces {{in both the}} translational and rotational directions using a single acting self-contained actuator that travels with the translational mechanism. The <b>brake</b> <b>engages</b> a mechanical lock and creates a frictional force on the translational structure preventing translation while simultaneously creating a frictional torque that prevents rotation of the vertical support. The system may include serrations on the braking surfaces to provide increased braking forces...|$|R
