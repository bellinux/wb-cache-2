The Provisional Government of Ireland (Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann) overprints were initially issued on 17 February 1922, with eight low-value and three high-value stamps overprinted by Dollard and four by Thom. This overprint is composed of the <b>four</b> <b>words</b> Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann and the numeral date 1922 arranged in five lines of seriffed text.

Nouns (including surnames) and the infinitive or past participle of verbs are allowed, as are abbreviations; in larger crosswords, it is {{customary}} to put {{at the center of the}} grid phrases made of two to <b>four</b> <b>words,</b> or forenames and surnames. A variant of Italian crosswords does not use shaded squares: words are delimited by thickening the grid. Another variant starts with a blank grid: the solver must insert both the answers and the shaded squares, and Across and Down clues are either ordered by row and column or not ordered at all.|$|E

500|$|The Roman satirist Juvenal {{wrote in}} AD 82 of rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno ("a rare {{bird in the}} lands, and very like a black swan"). He meant {{something}} whose rarity would {{compare with that of}} a black swan, or in other words, as a black swan did not exist, neither did the supposed characteristics of the [...] "rare bird" [...] with which it was being compared. The phrase passed into several European languages as a popular proverb, including English, in which the first <b>four</b> <b>words</b> ("a rare bird in the land") are often used ironically. For some 1500 years, the black swan existed in the European imagination as a metaphor for that which could not exist.|$|E

500|$|The first choral movement, [...] "" [...] (Weeping, lamentation, worry, despair), is in [...] form. The {{first section}} {{is built on}} a [...] as an old-style passacaglia in 3/2 time. The lamento, a {{chromatic}} fourth ostinato, is repeated twelve times. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes that Henry Purcell arrived at a similar motif in Dido's Lament in the opera Dido and Aeneas, which Bach probably did not know. The first <b>four</b> <b>words</b> are each sung by a different vocal part, each overlapping the next. Beginning with the highest voice, each part sings an extended sigh. The setting is intensified, until in the seventh repeat all voices continue the text simultaneously: [...] "" [...] ("dread and need" [...] or [...] "anguish and trouble"). The ninth repeat {{is similar to the}} first, but in more extreme harmonies. The twelfth repeat is instrumental. The middle section of the line about the Christians [...] "" [...] (that bear the marks of Jesus), first marked [...] "un poco allegro", is in a contrasting mood. Its last section is marked andante, the voices enter one after the other, beginning with the lowest and rising. Throughout the middle section, the instruments play colla parte with the voices. John Eliot Gardiner describes the first section as a [...] "tombeau, one of the most impressive and deeply affecting cantata movements Bach can have composed to that point".|$|E
