40|$|The {{invention}} {{pertains to}} {{a method for}} transferring ink to a receiving material using an inkjet printer having an <b>ink</b> <b>chamber</b> (10) with a nozzle (8) and an electromechanical transducer (16) in cooperative connection with the <b>ink</b> <b>chamber,</b> comprising actuating the transducer to generate a pressure wave in the <b>ink</b> <b>chamber</b> to expel a volume of ink from the nozzle, the pressure wave being such that it induces splitting of the said volume in a first and second ink droplet (36, 37), wherein the transducer is actuated such that the volume of ink that is forced to be expelled from the <b>ink</b> <b>chamber</b> experiences a supercritical acceleration {{in the direction of}} the receiving material, whereafter the transducer is actuated to retract the second droplet (36) into the <b>ink</b> <b>chamber.</b> The invention also pertains to a print head adjusted for applying the said method and a printer incorporating such a print head...|$|E
40|$|An {{inkjet printer}} for jetting ink that is {{substantially}} free of solvent, the printer containing a printhead having an <b>ink</b> <b>chamber</b> with an ink inlet and an ink outlet, an ink supply reservoir in fluid {{connection with the}} chamber via the ink inlet, an electromechanical transducer in operative connection with the <b>ink</b> <b>chamber</b> for generating pressure waves herein, and a heater for substantially uniformly heating the ink in the <b>ink</b> <b>chamber,</b> wherein the ink inlet includes a constricting element such that the pressure drop over the constricting element in the direction from the reservoir to the chamber is smaller than the pressure drop over said element {{in the opposite direction}} for the same net fluid flow and wherein the ratio of the length of the constricting element and the mean diameter of the constricting element is less than 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a printhead comprising multiple substantially closed <b>ink</b> <b>chambers</b> (13), the <b>ink</b> <b>chambers</b> being mutually separated {{by at least}} one wall (12), wherein each of the chambers comprises an electro-mechanical converter (15), where actuation of the converter leads to a volume change of the corresponding chamber. The invention also relates to an inkjet printer comprising such a printhea...|$|R
50|$|In 1826 Mary Anning {{discovered}} {{what appeared to}} be a <b>chamber</b> containing dried <b>ink</b> inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Philpot was able to revivify the ink by mixing it with water and used it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils, and other local artists were soon doing the same as more such fossilised <b>ink</b> <b>chambers</b> were discovered.|$|R
40|$|A inkjet {{printhead}} containing two substantially closed <b>ink</b> <b>chambers</b> {{separated by}} a wall, each of the chambers having associated therewith an electromechanical converter, where actuation of the converter corresponding to a first chamber of said printhead {{will lead to a}} volume change in a second chamber due to cross-talk, whereby the wall is deformable {{in such a way that}} it deforms by actuation and as such simultaneously generates a second volume change in the same chamber, either volume change being, in essence, the same size but opposite to the other...|$|R
5000|$|Injecting ink: Depending on {{the type}} of {{cartridge}} being refilled, ink can either be injected through a hole on top of the cartridge, or directly into the <b>ink</b> <b>chambers</b> after the top has been popped off. The ink can be injected directly from a bottle (with a needle tip on it) or from a needle filled with ink. The ink must be slowly injected into the cartridge so as not to cause damage, or overfilling, or overflow to other-color ink reservoirs. (For colors, a label on the cartridge might have three ordered color-dots to indicate the corresponding three ink colors of the reservoir chambers.|$|R
5|$|Aside from wrestling, Moore is also {{a tattoo}} artist, and used to own a tattoo parlor known as Gas <b>Chamber</b> <b>Ink</b> in Southern Pines, North Carolina. He {{is also a}} musician, having written his own {{entrance}} music, and {{was part of the}} band Peroxwhy?gen with Jeff Hardy.|$|R
50|$|In {{the thermal}} inkjet process, the print {{cartridges}} {{consist of a}} series of tiny chambers, each containing a heater, all of which are constructed by photolithography. To eject a droplet from each chamber, a pulse of current is passed through the heating element causing a rapid vaporization of the <b>ink</b> in the <b>chamber</b> and forming a bubble, which causes a large pressure increase, propelling a droplet of ink onto the paper (hence Canon's trade name of Bubble Jet). The ink's surface tension, as well as the condensation and resultant contraction of the vapor bubble, pulls a further charge of <b>ink</b> into the <b>chamber</b> through a narrow channel attached to an ink reservoir. The inks involved are usually water-based and use either pigments or dyes as the colorant. The inks must have a volatile component to form the vapor bubble; otherwise droplet ejection cannot occur. As no special materials are required, the print head is generally cheaper to produce than in other inkjet technologies.|$|R
500|$|Vertebrate fossil finds, {{especially}} of marine reptiles, made Anning's reputation, {{but she made}} numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 she discovered {{what appeared to be}} a <b>chamber</b> containing dried <b>ink</b> inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Soon other local artists were doing the same, as more such fossilised <b>ink</b> <b>chambers</b> were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised <b>chambers</b> resembled the <b>ink</b> sacs of modern squid and cuttlefish, which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods, and this led William Buckland to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do. It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as [...] "bezoar stones" [...] were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places, Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them coprolites. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society, he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.|$|R
5000|$|Fountain pens were {{developed}} in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an <b>ink</b> reservoir <b>chamber,</b> and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, {{in order to protect}} its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the ink reservoir can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by eyedropper, suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge-based fountain pens can be fitted with [...] "converters", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink.|$|R
500|$|Moore has {{multiple}} tattoos including {{one on the}} inside of his lip that says [...] "extinct". He also has two tattoos across his fingers saying [...] "Hard Knox" [...] and [...] "Made 1979". In 2005, he had 2BME tattooed on his stomach. He operated a tattoo shop called Gas <b>Chamber</b> <b>Ink</b> in Southern Pines, North Carolina. He also has a total of three piercings; one in each ear and one in his septum.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary ink {{metering}} systems {{employ a}} self contained system {{known as a}} chambered doctor blade system which is basically a manifold which delivers ink to the anilox roll. Ink is pumped through a hose(s) to the chamber which fills to capacity. Ink is retained within the system by end seals and doctor blades.One blade work as a retaining blade, simply holding <b>ink</b> within the <b>chamber.</b> The other reverse angle blade works as previously described, removing excess ink from the engraved surface of the anilox roll.Chambered doctor blade systems are recognized for high quality, consistency and accuracy removing the influence of press speed and some human subjectivity.|$|R
