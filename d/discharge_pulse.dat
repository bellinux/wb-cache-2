During each <b>discharge</b> <b>pulse</b> through the laser medium the neutral strontium vapor is ionized to Sr2+ as the electrons {{in the outer}} shell are removed, while {{only a small fraction}} of the helium buffer gas is ionized due to its greater ionization potential.

50|$|Even with {{chemical}} quenching, {{for a short}} time after a <b>discharge</b> <b>pulse</b> there is a period during which the tube is rendered insensitive and is thus temporarily unable to detect the arrival of any new ionizing particle (the so-called dead time; typically 50-100 microseconds). This causes a loss of counts at sufficiently high count rates and limits the G-M tube to an effective (accurate) count rate of approximately 103 counts per second even with external quenching. While a G-M tube is technically capable of reading higher count rates before it truly saturates, the level of uncertainty involved and the risk of saturation makes it extremely dangerous to rely upon higher count rate readings when attempting to calculate an equivalent radiation dose rate from the count rate. A consequence of this is that ion chamber instruments are usually preferred for higher count rates, however a modern external quenching technique can extend this upper limit considerably.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{demand on}} power transformers, {{due to the}} {{extension}} of equipment lifetimes and a trend to lower costs, {{has led to a}} need for condition based maintenance. However, there are currently no established techniques to accurately monitor and diagnose faults in real-time while the transformer is on-line. A major factor in the degradation of transformer insulation is partial discharging which, if left unattended, will eventually cause complete insulation failure. A partial discharge detection system (PDDS) is presented for electrically identifying partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> and determining the number of partial discharge sources while the transformer is on-line and subjected to external interference. Current and voltage transducers are placed on the transformer bushings rendering it unnecessary for the transformer to be disconnected or opened. Partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> are identified within narrowband and pulse interference using digital signal processing techniques which include an automated Fourier domain threshold filter and a continuous wavelet directional coupling filter. If multiple sources are active, the partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> are grouped by a clustering neural network. Two 7. 5 kVA, 11 kV transformers were used to conduct testing of the PDDS. High recognition rates of artificial partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> were achieved in an off-line transformer, while a previously unknown natural partial discharge source was identified in the second energised transformer...|$|R

40|$|The {{dielectric}} barrier discharge {{characteristics in}} helium at atmospheric pressure are simulated {{based on a}} one-dimensional fluid model. Under some discharge conditions, {{the results show that}} one <b>discharge</b> <b>pulse</b> per half voltage cycle usually appears when the amplitude of external voltage is low, while a glow-like discharge occurs at high voltage. For the one <b>discharge</b> <b>pulse</b> per half voltage cycle, the maximum of electron density appears near the anode {{at the beginning of the}} discharge, which corresponds to a Townsend discharge mode. The maxima of the electron density and the intensity of electric field appear in the vicinity of the cathode when the discharge current increases to some extent, which indicates the formation of a cathode-fall region. Therefore, the discharge has a transition from the Townsend mode to the glow discharge mode during one <b>discharge</b> <b>pulse,</b> which is consistent with previous experimental results. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of an on-line technique for detecting and locating partial discharges in the stator winding of a high voltage electrical machine. This technique forms part of an on-line health monitoring strategy for the insulation of high voltage machines. Existing diagnostic techniques and partial discharge measurement systems are reviewed. The requirement for an on-line partial discharge location technique is discussed. An experimental investigation was carried out into the propagation characteristics of partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> within a model stator winding. This allowed identification of the main propagation characteristics which were used {{as the basis for the}} development of a partial discharge location technique. In the development of a location technique, a means of on-line detection of discharge signals at the motor terminals is required. A study was therefore made on the use of the Rogowski coil for the non-invasive measurement of partial discharges. A partial discharge location system was developed based on the correlation of partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> detected at the two ends of a motor phase winding. The performance of the location system was investigated by injecting artificially generated <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> into the model stator winding. Further verification of the ability of the technique to locate the position of discharges was done by injecting high voltage discharges. The final part of the research work was to develop a theoretical model to predict the propagation behaviour of partial <b>discharge</b> <b>pulses</b> in the stator winding of an electrical machine. The effect of electromagnetic propagation through the endwinding region is incorporated in the model of two adjacent coils in a winding.
