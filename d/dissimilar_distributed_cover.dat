40|$|To support {{corporate}} business' {{competition on}} speed to market for product and service development, generically modeled data structures {{have been used}} in the development of vertical application software systems, and in storing XML and RDF data for its flexibility, adaptability, and agility. However, generic data models require multiple self-joins on a single table with a large volume of data, causing slow performance for business intelligence (BI) applications. Conversely, traditional specific data models have faster performance but are not flexible, adaptive, or agile for speed to market. A generic data model named the Class Object Value Element Relationship (COVER) model was developed for storing node-oriented tree data information, and is suitable for automated pivot index generation and distributed data processing. This approach utilizes pivot view with appropriate metadata constructs to expose the search predicate fields for indexing, leading to performance gains in data retrieval for queries on branches or leaves across multiple trees. It is beneficial for production support or data retrieval to feed business intelligence and data mining. A <b>distributed</b> <b>COVER</b> model with two different physical implementation variations was also developed for implementation on the distributed and parallel cloud computing platforms to take the scalability and performance advantages of the technology. Benchmark experiments for comparing the query performance on the COVER model against self-join and XPath/XQuery approaches using RDBMS were executed and proved that the COVER model outperforms the other two on the same sets of test data queries. Furthermore, benchmark experiments on distributed cloud computing environment were conducted using Hadoop HBase for comparing the RDBMS <b>COVER</b> and <b>distributed</b> <b>COVER</b> models. The results have shown that the <b>distributed</b> <b>COVER</b> models outperformed the RDBMS and demonstrated that the <b>distributed</b> <b>COVER</b> model is a viable data storage approach for flexible, adaptable, agile, and scalable systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} surveillance {{applications in}} which sensors are deployed {{in large numbers}} to improve coverage fidelity. Previous research has studied how to select active sensor covers (subsets of nodes that cover the field) to efficiently exploit the redundant node deployment. Little attention was given to studying the tradeoff between fault tolerance and energy efficiency in sensor coverage. In this work, our objective is to rapidly restore coverage of the field under unexpected node failures. For this purpose, we explore different adaptable coverage strategies. We then propose design guidelines for applications employing distributed cover-selection algorithms to control the degree of redundancy at local regions {{in the field and}} achieve energy-efficient coverage. In addition, we develop a new distributed technique to facilitate switching between active covers without the need for node synchronization. <b>Distributed</b> <b>cover</b> selection protocols can be integrated into our framework (referred to as “resilient online coverage” (ROC)). We evaluate the effectiveness of ROC through analysis and extensive simulations. I...|$|R

40|$|The country around Lampeter, Llangybi and Llanfair Clydogau {{comprises}} late Ordovician Ashgill to Silurian Llandovery-age bedrock overlain by {{a widely}} <b>distributed</b> <b>cover</b> of superficial deposits. The bedrock strata largely comprises sandstones, siltstones and mudstones deposited by turbiditic flows {{in the deep}} waters of the Welsh Basin. The major units recognized are the Yr Allt Formation, comprising dark pelagic mudstones and disturbed or dewatered sandstones, the Mottled Mudstone Member of the Cwmere Formation, the sandstone-dominant Rhyddlan Formation, the mudstone-dominant Clarewen Group, the rhythmitic Devil’s Bridge Formation, the mudrock-dominant Blaen Myherin Mudstones Formation and the generally coarse-grained rocks of the Cwmystwyth Grits Group. Outliers of the Borth Mudstone Formation are also recorded. The bedrock is deformed {{by a series of}} anastamosing faults which trend south-west to north-east. Major faults include the Rhysgog Fault, the Teifi Escarpment Fault, and the Falcondale Lake Fault. Fold axes follow the same trend, the folds dominantly having a vergence to the south-east with the eastern limbs of anticlines frequently overturned and fold closures sheared out by faults. Superficial deposits are dominated by tills, which form fans soliflucted from upland sheets down into the main river valleys of the region. Other drift deposits are largely confined to these trunk valleys. The geomorphology of the area reflects the glacial sculpting and exaggeration of bedrock structural lineaments...|$|R
