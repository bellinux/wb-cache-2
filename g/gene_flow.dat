5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>flow</b> {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The {{presence or absence of}} <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. <b>Gene</b> <b>flow</b> is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> cannot {{be counted on}} as a dependable source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>flow</b> is the {{exchange}} of genes between populations and between species. It can therefore {{be a source of}} variation that is new to a population or to a species. <b>Gene</b> <b>flow</b> can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms, as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations, or the movement of pollen between heavy metal tolerant and heavy metal sensitive populations of grasses.|$|E
5|$|Limousins in {{different}} countries are bred according to different selection practices or objectives, and are connected by limited international <b>gene</b> <b>flows.</b> Poor genetic connectedness between countries has negative implications for estimation accuracies of international genetic prediction programmes. As a result of genetic drift or different selection, each country's population of Limousins is becoming genetically differentiated, but which is counterbalanced to a limited extent by <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> from other countries. A study of over 2.4million Limousin pedigree files of five European countries (France, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom) showed moderate <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> from France to the United Kingdom and Denmark, but negligible <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> to Sweden. Except for <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> originating from France, and some limited <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> between Denmark and Sweden in the 1990s, bull and semen exchanges between European countries has been scarce, especially since about 2000. Cow and embryo flows {{have been even more}} scarce. Conversely, the genetic contribution of North American Limousins to European countries has increased since the late 1990s, which has occurred because of their use in breeding programmes to introduce the polled gene.|$|R

50|$|A {{better way}} to model ancestry is {{to think in terms}} of <b>genes</b> <b>flowing</b> through a river of time. An {{ancestor}} <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> down the river either as perfect replicas of itself or as slightly mutated descendant genes. Dawkins fails to explicitly contrast ancestor organism and descendant organisms against ancestor genes and descendant genes in this chapter. But the first half of the chapter is really about differences between these two models of lineage. While organisms have ancestry graphs and progeny graphs via sexual reproduction, a gene has a single chain of ancestors and a tree of descendants.|$|R
5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in the genome, reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (<b>gene</b> <b>flow).</b> Despite the constant {{introduction of new}} variation through mutation and <b>gene</b> <b>flow,</b> most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species. However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.|$|E

40|$|Reconstructing early {{evolutionary}} {{events like}} the origins of informational and operational genes, membranes, and photophos-phorylation is difficult because early evolutionary events can be masked by subsequent <b>gene</b> <b>flows.</b> Furthermore, as evolution progresses through both Darwinian {{survival of the fittest}} (tree-like evolution) and symbiotic/endosymbiotic cooperation (ring-like evolution), trees alone are not adequate to represent Earth's evolutionary history. Here, we reconstruct and root the New Rings of Life {{and use it as a}} framework for interpreting early events in the evolution of life. Unlike the three-domain hypothesis, the rings do not fit all life into one of three immutable categories, but rather accommodate new <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> as novel organisms are discovered. A draft of the Rooted Rings of Life is reconstructed by analyzing the phylogenetic distributions of indels (insertions/deletions) and genes coding for fundamental molecular processes. Their phylogenetic distributions are inconsistent with all trees. Hypergeometric distribution analyses of them strongly localize the root of the rings to a segment of the deepest ring (P < 10 - 21 and P < 10 - 194), and whole-genome analyses independently confirm the topology of the rooted rings (P < 7. 1 × 10 - 6). The rings identify several large <b>gene</b> <b>flows,</b> including a flow of a thousand genes into the Halobacteria and the Eubacteria, the related photocyte flow, the <b>flow</b> of <b>genes</b> into the last common ancestor of the eocytes and the eukaryotes, and the informational and operational <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> into the eukaryotes. The rooted rings also chronologically order steps in the evolution of extant taxa, that is, phototrophy evolved from Halobacteria (photophosphorylation) → Heliobacteria (photosynthesis) → Cyanobacteria (oxygenic photosynthesis). © The Author(s) 2013...|$|R

We used genealogical data, with a reference population of 547, 620 horses born in France between 2002 and 2011, grouped according to 55 breed origins. On average, individuals had 6. 3 equivalent generations known. Considering different population levels, fixation index decreased from an overall species FIT of 1. 37 %, {{to an average}} FIS of 20. 07 % when considering the 55 origins, showing that most horse breeds constitute populations without genetic structure. We illustrate the complexity of <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> existing among horse breeds, a few populations being closed to foreign influence, most, however, being submitted to various levels of introgression. In particular, Thoroughbred and Arab breeds are largely used as introgression sources, since those two populations explain together 26 % of founder origins within the overall horse population. When compared with molecular data, breeds with a small level of coancestry also showed low genetic distance; the gene pool of the breeds was probably impacted by their reproducer exchanges...|$|R

5|$|Finally, in {{sympatric}} speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since {{even a small}} amount of <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.

5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms.

40|$|Spatial {{heterogeneity}} in {{the distribution}} of phenotypes among populations is of major importance for species evolution and ecosystem functioning. Dispersal has long been assumed to homogenise populations in structured landscapes by generating maladapted <b>gene</b> <b>flows,</b> making spatial heterogeneity of phenotypes traditionally considered resulting from local adaptation or plasticity. However, there is accumulating evidence that individuals, instead of dispersing randomly in the landscapes, adjust their dispersal decisions according to their phenotype and the environmental conditions. Specifically, individuals might move in the landscape to find and settle in the environmental conditions that best match their phenotype, therefore maximizing their fitness, a hypothesis named habitat matching. Although habitat matching and associated non-random <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> can produce spatial phenotypic heterogeneity, their potential consequences for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning are still poorly understood. Here, we discuss evidence for intra and interspecific drivers of habitat matching, and highlight the potential consequences of this process for metapopulation and metacommunity functioning. We conclude that habitat matching might deeply affect the eco-evolutionary dynamics of meta-systems, pointing out the need for further empirical and theoretical research on its incidence and implications for species and communities evolution under environmental change...|$|R

40|$|The {{extent and}} nature of southeastern Europe (SEE) {{paternal}} genetic contribution to the European genetic landscape were explored based on a high-resolution Y chromosome analysis involving 681 males from seven populations in the region. Paternal lineages present in SEE were compared with previously published data from 81 western Eurasian populations and 5, 017 Y chromosome samples. The finding that five major haplogroups (E 3 b 1, I 1 b* (xM 26), J 2, R 1 a, and R 1 b) comprise more than 70 % of SEE total genetic variation {{is consistent with the}} typical European Y chromosome gene pool. However, distribution of major Y chromosomal lineages and estimated expansion signals clarify the specific role of this region in structuring of European, and particularly Slavic, paternal genetic heritage. Contemporary Slavic paternal gene pool, mostly characterized by the predominance of R 1 a and I 1 b* (xM 26) and scarcity of E 3 b 1 lineages, is a result of two major prehistoric <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> with opposite directions: the post-Last Glacial Maximum R 1 a expansion from east to west, the Younger Dryas-Holocene I 1 b* (xM 26) diffusion out of SEE in addition to subsequent R 1 a and I 1 b* (xM 26) putative <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> between eastern Europe and SEE, and a rather weak extent of E 3 b 1 diffusion toward regions nowadays occupied by Slavic-speaking populations...|$|R
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species.

5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

50|$|One form {{of hybrid}} zone results where one species has {{undergone}} allopatric speciation {{and the two}} new populations regain contact {{after a period of}} geographic isolation. The two populations then mate within an area of contact, producing 'hybrids' which contain a mixture of the alleles distinctive for each population. Thus novel <b>genes</b> <b>flow</b> from either side into the hybrid zone. <b>Genes</b> can also <b>flow</b> back into the distinct populations through interbreeding between hybrids and parental (non-hybrid) individuals (introgression). These processes lead to the formation of a cline between the two pure forms within the hybrid zone. In the centre of such a cline, hybrizymes are commonly found. These are alleles that are normally rare in both species but, probably due to genetic hitchhiking on genes for hybrid fitness, reach high frequencies in the areas where most hybrids are formed.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{our present}} study was to {{construct}} genetic structure and relationships among Chinese fine-wool sheep breeds. 46 individuals from 25 breeds or strains were genotyped based on the Illumina Ovine 50 K SNP array. Meanwhile, genetic variations among 482 individuals from 9 populations were genotyped with 10 microsatellites. In this study, we found high genetic polymorphisms for the microsatellites, while 7 loci in the Chinese superfine Merino strain (Xinjiang types) (CMS) and 5 loci in Gansu alpine superfine-wool sheep strain (GSS) groups were found deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Genetic drift FST= 0. 019 (P< 0. 001) and high <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> were detected in all the 7 fine-wool sheep populations. Phylogenetic analysis showed fine-wool sheep populations were clustered in a group independent from the Chinese indigenous breeds such that the 7 fine-wool sheep clustered distinct from Liangshan semifine-wool sheep (LS) and Hu sheep (HY) reflected by different population differentiation analyses. Overall, our findings suggested that all fine-wool sheep populations have close genetic relationship, which is consistent with their breeding progress. These populations, therefore, can be regarded as open-breeding populations with high levels of <b>gene</b> <b>flows.</b> Furthermore, the two superfine-wool strains, viz., CMS and GSS, might be formed by strong artificial selection and with frequent introduction of Australian Merino. Our results can assist in breeding of superfine-wool sheep and provide guidance for the cultivation of new fine-wool sheep breeds with different breeding objectives...|$|R

In this work, eleven preselected nuclear microsatellite markers were used to assess genetic diversity, population structure, and <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> with the aim of assembling a core collection. The dendrogram obtained utilizing the unweighted pair group method highlights the presence of homonymy and synonymy in olive tree datasets analyzed in this study. 439 different unique genotype profiles were obtained with this combination of 11 loci nSSR, representing 89. 8 % of the varieties analyzed. The remaining 10. 2 % comprises different variety pairs in which both accessions are genetically indistinguishable. Clustering analysis performed using BAPS software detected seven groups in Italian olive germplasm and <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> were determined among identified clusters.

The information collected in this study regarding the CRA-OLI ex situ collection can be used for breeding programs, for germplasm conservation, and for optimizing a strategy for the management of olive gene pools...|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, three {{distinct}} subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland koala (P.c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (P.c.cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (P.c.victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala {{is the smallest}} of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull. The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit. Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation. Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene.

There was 11%–13% of ancient <b>gene</b> <b>flow</b> into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations.

This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study that}} {{analyzed}} the molecular genetics of coyotes, as well as samples of historical red wolves and Mexican gray wolves from Texas, a few coyote genetic markers {{have been found in}} the historical samples of some isolated Mexican gray wolf individuals. Likewise, gray wolf Y chromosomes have also been found in a few individual male Texan coyotes. This study suggested that although the Mexican gray wolf is generally less prone to hybridizations with coyotes, exceptional genetic exchanges with the Texan coyotes may have occurred among individual gray wolves from historical remnants before the population was completely extirpated in Texas. The resulting hybrids would later on melt back into the coyote populations as the wolves disappeared. However, the same study also discussed an alternative possibility that the red wolves, which in turn also once overlapped with both species in the central Texas, were involved in circuiting the <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> between the coyotes and gray wolves much like how the eastern wolf is suspected to have bridged <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> between gray wolves and coyotes in the Great Lakes region since direct hybridizations between coyotes and gray wolves is considered rare. In tests performed on a stuffed carcass of what was initially labelled a chupacabra, mitochondrial DNA analysis conducted by Texas State University showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote-gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf.|$|R

However, if one were to rule out the possibility of a large-scale Indo-Aryan migration, these findings suggest that the genetic affinities of both Indian ancestral components are the result of multiple <b>gene</b> <b>flows</b> over the course of thousands of years.|$|R

The result is a ‘genetic-genomic-metagenomic reactor’ where resistance <b>genes</b> <b>flow</b> among different biological units of different hierarchical levels, such as integrons, transposons, plasmids, clones, species or genetic exchange communities.
