30|$|According to a {{literature}} {{review of the}} German Federal Environmental Agency, the silver concentration in nine municipal sewage treatment plants was determined. A silver concentration between 4 and 26.3 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> was found in 2002. In 2007 the silver concentration in the {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} sludge in Karlsruhe, Pforzheim and Nuremberg was between 12 and 45 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> [29]. In our investigations the sludge from the municipal STP in Schmallenberg had a silver concentration of 1.8 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge.</b> A study by the US EPA showed silver concentrations in the sewage sludge of 1.94 to 856 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> [30]. In this case various sites were studied. High concentrations can be explained by industrial silver entry. From these data, it can be concluded that in sludge of municipal STPs used for agricultural purposes, silver concentrations range from 2 to 45 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge.</b>|$|R
30|$|The hazard {{assessment}} {{was based on}} EC 10 values {{of at least three}} tests with three different organisms from three different trophic levels, which resulted in an assessment factor of 10. On this basis, a PNEC in soil of 0.05 mg/kg dry soil was calculated for NM- 300 K. The calculated PNEC was transferred to the sludge pathway. Based on the German sewage sludge ordinance (5 tons of <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> can be applied per hectare in 3 years, see the ‘Methods’ section), 1.67 g dry sludge/kg dry soil could be applied as sludge to the test soil. The concentration of NM- 300 K that can be applied via 1.67 g <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> without passing the limit of 0.05 mg/kg dry soil was calculated. The PNEC in soil (for the sewage sludge pathway) corresponds to a concentration of 30 mg/kg <b>dry</b> <b>sludge</b> of NM- 300 K in a single application.|$|R

Approach: Activated sludge samples were collected from Riyadh wastewater plant and analyzed quantitatively for the presence of important bacterial parameters including fecal coliforms and Salmonella spp. The collected samples were treated with various doses of Gamma irradiation and bacterial count was determined. Results: The results indicated that all tested sludge samples were positive for the presence of fecal coliforms and Salmonella spp, with different counts in different stages of wastewater treatment. The raw sludge showed to have the highest coliforms and Salmonella spp counts of 1. 1 × 108 and 2 × 103 MPN g− 1 <b>dry</b> <b>sludge,</b> respectively.

40|$|Municipal sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants is a promising lipid feedstock for biodiesel production as it contains {{a significant amount of}} lipids. However, the energy necessary to remove its high water content is a major inconvenience for scaling up because of the high associated cost. In addition, the expensive conventional <b>sludge</b> <b>drying</b> methods are not effective enough for lipid recovery, thus reducing the potential biodiesel production. This study explores an alternative method, the direct sequential liquid-liquid extraction, which was performed in a batch mixer-settler reactor at room temperature, using hexane as a solvent, after previous sludge acidification showed significant increase in the lipid efficiency. The optimisation study demonstrated that, after three stages, 91 % of lipid from primary sludge was recovered. The optimised extraction gave slightly higher lipid (27 %, <b>dry</b> <b>sludge)</b> than the standard method (25 %, <b>dry</b> <b>sludge),</b> supporting the suitability of the proposed process. Finally, this work demonstrates that the residual lipid-extracted sludge is still a good feedstock for energy production via anaerobic digestion.
