25|$|The {{battalion}} {{was originally}} {{scheduled to be}} relieved of responsibility for patrolling the area of operations around Camp Taji by the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment (2–7 CAV) on 9 April 2004, but the relief had to be delayed until 12 April 2004 {{due to the fact}} that the Heavy Equipment Transport System (HETS) transporting the M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles belonging to 2–7 CAV were delayed in transit by attacks against the 39th IBCT main body convoys south of Baghdad. After the arrival of the 2–7 CAV and the remainder of the 39th BCT main body, 1–206th FA provided fires in support of 39th Brigade Combat Team operations; served as the base defense operations center (BDOC); manned the main entry control point, Gunner Gate; provided the camp's quick reaction force (QRF); conducted convoy and VIP escorts; and, trained, equipped and organized the 307th Iraqi National Guard Battalion. The battalion's AN/TPQ-36 <b>Firefinder</b> radar section was located at Camp Taji to provide early warning and detection of insurgent fires against the 1st Cavalry Division. The 1–206th was augmented with one AN/TPQ-37 <b>Firefinder</b> radar from C Battery (Target Acquisition) 1–21st FA, 1st Cavalry Division Artillery.|$|E
25|$|Outpost Gunner was {{established}} {{on a high}} point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery {{in an attempt to}} monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of 2/3 Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a <b>Firefinder</b> Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{ground forces}} {{included}} a battalion from the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. The unit was deployed in March 1999 to Albania {{in support of}} the bombing campaign where the battalion secured the Tirana airfield, Apache helicopter refueling sites, established a forward-operating base to prepare for Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) strikes and offensive ground operations, and deployed a small team with an AN/TPQ-36 <b>Firefinder</b> radar system to the Albania/Kosovo border where it acquired targets for allied/NATO air strikes. Immediately after the bombing campaign, the battalion was refitted back at Tirana airfield and issued orders to move into Kosovo as the initial entry force in support of Operation Joint Guardian.|$|E
25|$|The infiltrators, {{apart from}} being {{equipped}} with small arms and grenade launchers, were also armed with mortars, artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Many posts were also heavily mined, with India later stating to have recovered more than 8,000 anti-personnel mines according to an ICBL report. Pakistan's reconnaissance was done through unmanned aerial vehicles and AN/TPQ-36 <b>Firefinder</b> radars supplied by the US. The initial Indian attacks were aimed at controlling the hills overlooking NH 1D, with high priority being given to the stretches of the highway {{near the town of}} Kargil. The majority of posts along the Line of Control were adjacent to the highway, and therefore the recapture of nearly every infiltrated post increased both the territorial gains and the security of the highway. The protection of this route and the recapture of the forward posts were thus ongoing objectives throughout the war.|$|E

50|$|The {{requirement}} of the Chinese domestic equivalent was subsequently modified {{to address these issues}} revealed in trials. Due to the limitation of the Chinese industrial capability at the time, decision was made to develop the Chinese domestic equivalent in several steps. The first step was to develop a smaller one, which would result in the Chinese equivalent of AN/TPQ-36 <b>Firefinder</b> radar, and based on the experience gained from this program, a more capable larger version in the same class of AN/TPQ-37 <b>Firefinder</b> radar would be developed, which eventually resulted in SLC-2 series.|$|E
50|$|Next, in the 1970s Hughes Aircraft {{developed}} the US <b>Firefinder</b> RADAR system {{and created the}} algorithms that could extrapolate a gun's position from a segment of an elliptic trajectory. It's likely the Soviet Union created similar algorithms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Firefinder</b> (V)8 extends system performance, {{improves}} operator survivability {{and lowers}} life cycle cost. Greater processing {{power and the}} addition of a low noise amplifier to the radar antenna improves detection range (by up to 50%) and performance accuracy against certain threats.|$|E
50|$|In November 1997, Battery F (TA), 144th Field Artillery Regiment, {{represented}} {{the state of}} California in Bosnia. During this deployment, Battery F conducted <b>Firefinder</b> counter-battery radar operations, convoys and base security all with little to no armor, with a high threat of mine strikes and ambushes. Most drivers exceeded 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) during the seven months in country.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{to acquire}} {{such a system}} {{intensified}} after the Kargil War, where the Indian Army was severely disadvantaged by its lack of firefinding radars. While the Pakistani forces were equipped with American AN/TPQ-36 <b>Firefinder</b> radars, India only had British Cymbeline mortar detecting radars, which were not suitable. Almost 80% of Indian casualties during the war resulted from enemy artillery fire, making such a radar critical.|$|E
50|$|<b>Firefinder</b> (V)7 adds a Modular Azimuth Position System (MAPS).MAPS has a North Seeking Laser Gyrocompass and a {{microprocessor}} controlled Honeywell H-726 Inertial Navigation System. Prior Firefinders used a survey team to find site latitude, longitude, and direction to North. With MAPS, reaction time was {{limited only by}} site set-up, since system geo-position was pre-loaded before sortie deployment. Crew was reduced from 8 to 6.|$|E
50|$|First {{intended}} to provide a third tier against long-range threats, the AN/TPQ-37 <b>Firefinder</b> radar basic software filters out all other radar tracks with signatures of lesser-ranged threats. New software, required by the mortar threat in the Balkans, allows it to duplicate the Q-36 mortar detection range of 18 kilometers, while still detecting longer-range threats. Proper crew training should compensate for the reduced clutter rejection caused by accepting mortar signatures.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/GSG-10 TACFIRE system {{automated}} Field Artillery {{command and}} control functions. It was composed of computers and remote devices such as the Variable Format Message Entry Device (VFMED), the Digital Message Device (DMD) and the <b>Firefinder</b> Field Artillery target acquisition radar system linked by digital communications using existing radio and wire communications equipment. Later in its service life, it also linked with the Battery Computer System (BCS) which had more advanced targeting algorithms.|$|E

The {{system is a}} long-range version of “weapon-locating radar,” designed to detect and track incoming artillery and rocket fire to determine the point of origin for counter-battery fire. It is currently in service at brigade and higher levels in the United States Army and by other countries. The radar is trailer-mounted and towed by a 2⅓-ton truck. A typical AN/TPQ-37 system consists of the Antenna-Transceiver Group, Command Shelter and 60 kW Generator.|$|E
50|$|In December 2005, the battalion's AN/TPQ-36 <b>Firefinder</b> Radar Section was {{deployed}} {{in support of}} Operation Iraqi Freedom 4 & 5. The team was deployed to FOB McKynzy (Samarrah East Airfields) where they supported 1-8 Infantry, 4th ID out of Ft. Carson, CO. Some time later during the deployment the team of 7 were relocated to FOB Palawada, located near Balad east of LSA Anaconda. After a year's deployment the team returned home in late 2006 to support the battalion's mission of training MIT teams to deploy to various theaters of operations.|$|E
50|$|Four AN/TPQ-37 <b>Firefinder</b> radar {{were sold}} to China, and these became the {{foundation}} of SLC-2 radar development. Aside from political reasons, the US$10 million plus unit price tag of TPQ-37 (including after sale logistic support) was simply too costly for Chinese.

50|$|Locating mortars was {{relatively}} easy because their trajectory was sufficiently close to parabolic that the simple mathematics of parabolas {{could be used}} with analogue computers. Better radars were also able to detect howitzers when firing in high angle (elevation greater than 45 degrees), although such use was quite rare. Low angle trajectories normally used by guns, howitzers and rockets were more difficult. By the early 1970s radar systems capable of locating guns appeared possible, and many European members of NATO embarked on the joint Project Zenda. This was short-lived for unclear reasons, but the US embarked on <b>Firefinder</b> program and Hughes developed the necessary algorithms, although it took {{two or three years}} of difficult work.|$|E

5000|$|To {{correct this}} weakness, in 2002, the Ministry of Defence issued an RFP to five manufacturers. With {{the lifting of}} {{sanctions}} in late 2001, the US Government offered to sell the AN/TPQ-37 radar to India under their Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programme for [...] 680 million each. In July 2002, India placed a $200 million USD order for 12 AN/TPQ-37 <b>Firefinder</b> radars. Initially, only 8 were ordered for $140 million USD, but the order was later increased to 12. The radars were integrated on BEML-manufactured Tatra truck platforms. Delivery of all 12 radars was completed in May 2007. Concept design work on the WLR also accelerated {{in the aftermath of}} the Kargil War.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, in June 2000, arms trading {{relations}} between Russia and Yugoslavia were exposed {{which led to}} the retaliation and bombings of Russian Checkpoints and area Police Stations.

The Pinaka units will also be able {{to make use of the}} Indian Army's SATA (Surveillance & Target Acquisition) Units which have been improved substantially throughout the late 1990s, with the induction of the Searcher-1, Searcher-2 and IAI Heron UAVs into the Indian Army, as well as the purchase of a large number of both Israeli made and Indian made Battle Field Surveillance radars. These have also been coupled with purchases of the Israeli LORROS (Long Range Observation and Sighting System) which is a combination of FLIR/CCD system for long range day/night surveillance.|$|E
50|$|The 78th Field Artillery Regiment {{is a field}} {{artillery}} regiment of the United States Army. Initially activated on 1 July 1916, the 78th Field Artillery Battalion did not see action in World War I, but would later be reactivated {{at the start of}} World War II and participate in the campaigns for Algeria-French Morocco, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe, and the Rhineland with the 2d Armored Division. The 78th Artillery Battalion's six batteries were reorganized into separate battalions in 1957, with the 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery being the only remaining active unit of the 78th Field Artillery. The 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery is assigned to the 428th Field Artillery Brigade, supporting the Fires Center of Excellence mission through the conduct of Initial Entry Training in order to provide the Army with combat ready Field Artillery Soldiers. The 1st Battalion, 78th Field Artillery conducts Advanced Individual Training for the 13-series (Field Artillery) Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) of 13B (Cannon Crewmember), 13F (Joint Fire Support Specialist), 13J (Field Artillery Automated Tactical Data System Specialist), 13M (Multiple Launch Rocket System Crewmember), and 13R (<b>Firefinder</b> Radar Operator).|$|E
40|$|Raytheon Company, {{a leader}} in {{aerospace}} and defense, has experienced tremendous growth through mergers and acquisitions. In particular, the company's Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) business unit was largely formed through acquisitions of E-Systems and Texas Instruments and a merger with Hughes Aircraft Company. To assimilate the legacy organizations, Raytheon and SAS have undertaken great efforts to work as "One Company. " One such example has been to strive for an enterprise sales and operations planning process. Five years ago, Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) Operations leaders {{recognized the need to}} be more proactive in comprehending forecasted business and subsequent impacts to SAS' manufacturing network. As a result, Program Requirements and Operations Planning (PROP) was born to enable improved supply chain planning for factory labor and capital resources.
