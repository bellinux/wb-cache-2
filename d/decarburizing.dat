When they are welded, however, they show serious drawback of crack generation due to excess carbon at thehardened region of heat-affected zone.

In the present study, some characteristics of the <b>decarburized</b> layer in the spheroidal graphite cast iron were investigated. The results obtained are as follows. Growth of <b>decarburized</b> layer is controlled by diffusion of carbon atoms toward the surface region in the iron during the heat-treatment and there is a critical temperature of 930 K for the decarburization, below which decarburization does not occur.

50|$|Silicon {{significantly}} {{increases the}} electrical resistivity of the steel, which decreases the induced eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus lowering the core loss. However, the grain structure hardens and embrittles the metal, which adversely affects the workability of the material, especially when rolling it. When alloying, the concentration levels of carbon, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen {{must be kept}} low, as these elements indicate the presence of carbides, sulfides, oxides and nitrides. These compounds, even in particles as small as one micrometer in diameter, increase hysteresis losses while also decreasing magnetic permeability. The presence of carbon has a more detrimental effect than sulfur or oxygen. Carbon also causes magnetic aging when it slowly leaves the solid solution and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting {{in an increase in}} power loss over time.

5000|$|During the 20th century various gases (natural gas, acetylene, etc.) {{have also}} come {{to be used as}} fuels for {{blacksmith}}ing. While these are fine for blacksmithing iron, special care must be taken when using them to blacksmith steel. Each time a piece of steel is heated, there is a tendency for the carbon content to leave the steel (decarburization). This can leave a piece of steel with an effective layer of unhardenable iron on its surface. In a traditional charcoal or coal forge, the fuel is really just carbon. In a properly regulated charcoal/coal fire, the air in and immediately around the fire should be a reducing atmosphere. In this case, and at elevated temperatures, there is a tendency for vaporized carbon to soak into steel and iron, counteracting or negating the <b>decarburizing</b> tendency. This is similar to the process by which a case of steel is developed on a piece of iron in preparation for case hardening.A renewed interest in blacksmithing occurred as part of the trend in [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] and [...] "self-sufficiency" [...] that occurred during the 1970s. Currently there are many books, organizations and individuals working to help educate the public about blacksmithing, including local groups of smiths who have formed clubs, with some of those smiths demonstrating at historical sites and living history events. Some modern blacksmiths who produce decorative metalwork refer to themselves as artist-blacksmiths. In 1973 the Artists Blacksmiths’ Association of North America was formed with 27 members. By 2013 it had almost 4000 members.

40|$|Usual heat {{treatments}} of steels like austenitization are generally conducted in air. In such atmosphere, {{a part of}} the atoms of carbon could be removed from the superficial zone of steel. Indeed, those atoms of carbon, combined with oxygen present in atmosphere, can take gaseous form of carbon monoxide due to the great attraction between atoms of carbon and oxygen. This well-known phenomenon is called <b>decarburizing.</b> It can change microstructure to a large extent and, as a result, bring dramatic modifications of mechanical properties of steel, like decrease of fatigue lifetime. To characterize the extent of <b>decarburizing</b> phenomenon, observations by optical microscopy and/or hardness profiles measurements must be performed in a cross section, as it is advised by international standard. Until today, the eddy current technique is used to detect superficial defects. In practice, the control consists to create two groups of available samples or not, from a large sampling. In this study, we propose to estimate the <b>decarburizing</b> extent. In the present work, different durations of austenitizing at 920 °C temperature before oil quenching (50 °C) were performed on the SAE 92 V 45 steel in order to obtain various morphologies and different total depths of the decarburized zone. We will show, in the continuation, how eddy currents control is used to assess the level of <b>decarburizing</b> after a Fourier transformation performed on the output signal.

40|$|Carbon is {{the most}} {{important}} element going in the steels composition since it largely contributes to their mechanical performance. During the heat treatment of steels, a part of atoms of carbon could be removed from the superficial zone of the steel, which {{is the result of the}} atmospheric oxygen attraction by forming gaseous carbon monoxide. This phenomenon, called <b>decarburizing,</b> can change microstructure in a large extent and, as a result, mechanical properties of the steel. This could lead to unsuitable properties for the service life of mechanical parts. In order to prevent such part from breaking in service, it is necessary to know the affected zone by the <b>decarburizing</b> process. For this purpose, the most used technique is a visual observation by optical microscopy of a cross section of the material. This technique is often associated to the hardness profile obtained by Vickers or Knoop indentations in the same section. Depending on the material and on the specimen preparation, some discrepancies are often observed between the two informations. On the other hand, these techniques require a long preparation and cautious interpretation. Then we propose here to use eddy current testing, which is widely employed to detect fatigue cracks, to give some information about changes in microstructure and to examine carburizing of steel from both mechanical and microstructural point of view. For carburizing, eddy current has been successfully connected to the increase of micro-hardness near the surface. This last result has particularly motivated us to use eddy current to analyze <b>decarburizing.</b> In the present work, different durations in the furnace at a temperature of 920 °C before oil quenching were performed on 54 SiCrV 6 (SAE 92 V 45) steel in order to obtain various morphologies of the decarburized zone.

40|$|Introduction {{and current}} state of the problem. Common and {{undesirable}} defects in microstructures include surface decarburization which compromises the quality of HC wire rods hot-wound into coils (coil rod) and performance of products made there from. Resistance of metal to alternating loads is determined by the depth of the <b>decarburized</b> layer, i. e. actual difference between surface microstructure and base metal structure. As we know [1, 2], for decarburization process to occur on the metal surface when heated in a furnace, the gaseous atmosphere shall not produce a very strong oxidizing effect. If the rate of oxidation is higher than that of carbon diffusion in steel, it enhances scale build-up whereby oxygen can oxidize both carbon and iron. Although <b>decarburized</b> layer is mostly deemed to be detrimental, {{it has been argued that}} decarburization of wire rod surface can be advantageous to useful qualities of wire rods. Soft <b>decarburized</b> surface ensures improved flextural (bending) or torsional (twisting) dictility of metal resulting from low sensitivity to stress concentration factors, high resistance to crack propagation and higher corrosion resistance [3]. Compressive residual stresses occurring in a <b>decarburized</b> skin improve the fatigue life and increase the durability of steel-wire ropes [4]. Wire rods with more pronounced surface decarburization are less likely to form the hardened structures (martensite) in drawing operations due to surface cracking and cupping of the martensitic layer. However, in the process of cold drawing whereby metal is deformed by pulling wire rods through a serious of drawing dies (monolithic system), maximum stresses develop on the surface of rolled products[3 – 5]. Therefore uniform distribution of structure on the surface and in the boundary layers is essential. This means that minimum and uniform depth of decarburization on the metal surface is a prerequisite for the production of high-quality HC rolled stock [3 – 7]. The paper [11] acknowledges the influence of micro-additives of boron on changes in the austenite grain size and accordingly the length of borders in high-carbon steels with austenitizing temperature increase within the range of 900 … 1 100 ºС.
