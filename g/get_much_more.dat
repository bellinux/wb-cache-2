According to the report, authors who reject the notion of nationality, or support anti-Zionist views, <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> exposure in reading lists. In 2010, Im Tirtzu sent Rivka Karmi, {{the head of the}} Ben-Gurion University of the Negev a letter, demanding that the university stop the anti-Zionist bias in its Department of Politics and Government. The letter alleged that 9 out of 11 professors in the department were involved in extreme left-wing activities (among others, attempting to persuade other countries to join the academic boycott of Israel). Im Tirtzu threatened to notify the donors of the university if the problem was not rectified.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} in their early performances as [...] "the New Yardbirds" [...] and was featured as their opening number in Led Zeppelin's 1968 and 1969 tours, and was included on several bootleg albums. [...] In an interview, early MTV video host J.J.

[...] They later revived it for their final tour [...] "Over Europe" [...] in 1980.

500|$|Appeal to Reason {{also had}} less {{positive}} reception, with most negative reviews criticizing the band's further movement into the mainstream. Entertainment Weekly criticized the album, saying, [...] "Songs like [...] "Re-Education (Through Labor)" [...] and [...] "Entertainment," [...] {{which seeks to}} redress the evils of media manipulation upon the land, are peppy but pretty empty, power-chord downers with little bark or bite." [...] In giving the album five out of ten stars, PopMatters said, [...] "McIlrath rarely reaches beyond his one-note vocal performance despite apparent and commendable earnestness...he never channels the intensity of early-career songs like [...] "Dead Ringer", let alone the intensity of Henry Rollins. The {{other members of the}} band don't fare much better: new lead guitarist Zach Blair, in particular, might have his three-chord attack down to a science, but the formula wears thin by the time the album gets through its first 30 minutes—and after that, there are still 18 to go.

2500|$|In 1990, {{a disgruntled}} {{employee}} at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station in Canada obtained a sample (estimated as about a [...] "half cup") of heavy {{water from the}} primary heat transport loop of the nuclear reactor, and loaded it into a cafeteria drink dispenser. Eight employees drank some of the contaminated water. The incident was discovered when employees began leaving bioassay urine samples with elevated tritium levels. The quantity of heavy water involved was far below levels that could induce heavy water toxicity, but several employees received elevated radiation doses from tritium and neutron-activated chemicals in the water. This was not an incident of heavy water poisoning, but rather radiation poisoning from other isotopes in the heavy water. Some news services were not careful to distinguish these points, {{and some of the}} public were left with the impression that heavy water is normally radioactive and more severely toxic than it is. Even if pure heavy water had been used in the water cooler indefinitely, it is not likely the incident would have been detected or caused harm, since no employee would be expected to <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than 25% of their daily drinking water from such a source.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed to <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure to mention the fact that Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and what she says are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' as you call it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Luster of Otaku USA {{noted that}} the story is typical for its time, but said that this [...] "is overshadowed by its bold, filmic execution" [...] {{as well as its}} insight into Tatsumi's early career. Katherine Dacey of Manga Bookshelf found the art's anatomy lacking, but complimented its {{characterization}} and composition, concluding that the manga has [...] "a vital, improvisatory energy missing from Tatsumi's later period". Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't <b>get</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but rough work, full of character types and situations entirely too on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning blur of hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not." [...] ICv2 said that [...] "Tatsumi skillfully uses the conventions of the crime story to examine his characters who come from very different social backgrounds", calling Black Blizzard [...] "one of the first examples of the realistic, socially conscious, and adult (in the best sense of the term) gekiga genre of manga." [...] Deb Aoki of About.com said of the manga: [...] "while not as polished as his later works, this one-shot crackles with youthful energy, cinematic style, and Tatsumi's burning desire to push the boundaries of manga beyond kids stuff." ...|$|E
