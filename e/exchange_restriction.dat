Following incubation with the extracts, the DNA's were introduced in JM 109 bacteria (rec A- and lac Z'-) which were grown in presence of a colorimetric indicator of beta-galactosidase activity. Homologous recombination {{gives rise to the}} genotypical modification: lac Z'+ instead of lac Z'- in the bacteriophage DNA. This is revealed by phenotypical expression of the lac Z' gene product in replicating bacteriophage, i. e. the formation of blue instead of white plaques. The frequency of recombination (blue/total plaques) is increased by a factor of 50 - 80 as a function of protein concentration and of incubation time. The maximal frequency observed is 5 X 10 (- 5). There is no increase over the background when extracts are boiled. Electrophoresis and electron microscopy of DNA's incubated with the extracts show the formation of recombination intermediates with single strand <b>exchange.</b> <b>Restriction</b> analysis of recombined DNA confirms that the process corresponds to targeted sequence exchange. These data allow to propose three steps for homologous recombination between two duplex DNA's: i) unpairing of the two duplexes; ii) single-strand exchange and synaptic pairing; iii) resolution of the cross-junctions. The three steps correspond to those predicted by the gene conversion model of Holliday...|$|E

Unfortunately, we are unsure if this problem can be rectified. Apologies for the inconvenience. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and <b>Exchange</b> <b>Restrictions</b> (AREAER) database tracks exchange and trade arrangements for all IMF member countries. This unique database is updated yearly based mostly on information from country authorities. The database also provides information on different types of capital controls used by countries, restrictions on current international payments and transfers, arrangements for payments and receipts, procedures for resident and non-resident accounts, exchange rate arrangements, and the operation of foreign exchange markets. It also includes measures implemented in the financial sector, including prudential measures. The IMF has published the AREAER annually since 1950. AREAER Online, accessible at the UK Data Service provides {{direct access to the}} data used to create the yearly reports covering the period from 1999 through 2010. The data can be searched across years, countries and specific categories. This database was first provided by the UK Data Service in December 2013 and includes the IMF AREAER dataset user guide.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a generalized method for describing and handling any type of heat <b>exchange</b> <b>restrictions</b> between subsets of thermal streams when dealing with automatic energy targeting. A graph theory representation of the heat exchange opportunities between stream subsets called heat integration graph is introduced. This graph is used to identify subsystems consisting of one or more stream subsets which can be treated as separate thermal cascades. These correspond to maximal subgraphs that are completely connected components of the heat integration graph, also called “cliques”. The stream subsets belonging to more than one clique, here called “pivot”, are those which thermal streams have to be optimally distributed to two or more cliques. The hot utility target of a system can then be found by solving a linear programming optimization in which the constraints that guarantee a feasible thermal cascade in all the maximal subgraphs are included.

Several findings are worth noting. First, oil prices have indeed {{played a significant role in}} determining a time-varying equilibrium real exchange rate path. Second, oil prices are not the only important determinant of the real effective exchange rate: declining productivity is also a key factor. Third, appreciation pressures are rising. Finally, the speed of convergence of a VEC model using parallel rather than official rates is higher, suggesting that the government has been able to maintain sharp deviations between the official and equilibrium rates because of Venezuela''s oil dependency and the concentration of oil income in government hands.
