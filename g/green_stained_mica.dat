40|$|A {{fluorescent}} {{nucleic acid}} stain {{that does not}} penetrate living cells {{was used to assess}} the integrity of the plasma membranes of bacteria. SYTOX <b>Green</b> nucleic acid <b>stain</b> is an unsymmetrical cyanine dye with three positive charges that is completely excluded from live eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Binding of SYTOX <b>Green</b> <b>stain</b> to nucleic acids resulted in a > 500 -fold enhancement in fluorescence emission (absorption and emission maxima at 502 and 523 nm, respectively), rendering bacteria with compromised plasma membranes brightly green fluorescent. SYTOX <b>Green</b> <b>stain</b> is readily excited by the 488 -nm line of the argon ion laser. The fluorescence signal from membrane-compromised bacteria labeled with SYTOX <b>Green</b> <b>stain</b> was typically > 10 -fold brighter than that from intact organisms. Bacterial suspensions labeled with SYTOX <b>Green</b> <b>stain</b> emitted <b>green</b> fluorescence in proportion to the fraction of permeabilized cells in the population, which was quantified by microscopy, fluorometry, or flow cytometry. Flow cytometric and fluorometric approaches were used to quantify the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on the cell membrane integrity of Escherichia coli. Detection and discrimination of live and permeabilized cells labeled with SYTOX <b>Green</b> <b>stain</b> by flow cytometry were markedly improved over those by propidium iodide-based tests. These studies showed that bacterial labeling with SYTOX <b>Green</b> <b>stain</b> is an effective alternative to conventional methods for measuring bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility...|$|R

30|$|Light {{calcareous}} stone {{materials used}} in connection with cultural heritage objects, such as pedestals, or used as wall facings in connection with bronze statues or joints often show <b>green</b> <b>staining</b> due to the corrosion products from the bronze elements. The <b>green</b> <b>stains</b> alter {{the appearance of the}} monument and thus disrupt the original intention. Due to this, several cleaning methods, often involving ammonia, have been developed for removal of copper stains from stone surfaces. This paper describes a new, highly efficient method for cleaning copper stains from calcareous stone by introducing the chelating agent ethylenediamine in a poultice consisting of Laponite® RD, Arbocel® BC 1000 and CMC.|$|R
