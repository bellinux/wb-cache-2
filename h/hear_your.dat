They don't <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> accent and make assumptions. All they see are your words." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere. The game has sound attenuation, with a 5.1 surround sound system, and context sensitive dialog, {{with a total of}} twenty-thousand lines of dialog. Each of the soldiers fighting alongside the player will call out the position of enemy soldiers, warn of flank attacks, and help out in ways that were not possible in {{the first game of the}} series. Zampella said, [...] "We really wanted realistic battle chatter going that's not only entertaining, but actually adds to the gaming experience. So now you'll <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> guys telling you that there's [...] two guys hiding behind that rusty car in the street or that there are people on the second floor of a building".|$|E
500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of School 2013, Lee starred in the {{critically}} acclaimed drama series I Can <b>Hear</b> <b>Your</b> Voice with Lee Bo-young. He played Park Soo-ha, an intelligent young man who can read minds. Originally slated for 16 episodes, the drama was extended by 2 episodes due to its successful ratings. He received the Excellence Award in the male category at the Korea Drama Awards for his performance. Lee then starred in the sports film No Breathing and had a supporting role in the box office hit The Face Reader.|$|E
2500|$|After preaching in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Jones was bearded by a [...] "big, burly Dutch missionary" [...] who said, [...] "I hear at Bob Jones University you do {{not like}} black people. [...] I <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> rules are too strict {{and that there is}} no love there." [...] Jones interrupted, [...] "I hear that Dutch Calvinists are rude and disagreeable, insulting, and {{thoroughly}} abrasive; that their lives are carnal; and that they have no conscience against drinking and smoking and little concern for the winning of souls." [...] When the missionary was sufficiently taken aback, Jones added that he didn't necessarily believe everything he heard.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Perry won the Hart Memorial Trophy, {{prevailing}} over finalists Daniel Sedin and Martin St. Louis, as the League's {{regular season}} MVP.

I thought I had a great chance, but you look at the other two guys and they had great chances as well."

2500|$|Specific {{details of}} what {{triggered}} the massacre are debated. According to some accounts, Yellow Bird began to perform the Ghost Dance, telling the Lakota that their [...] "ghost shirts" [...] were bulletproof. As tensions mounted, Black Coyote {{refused to give up}} his rifle; he was deaf and had not understood the order. Another Indian said: [...] "Black Coyote is deaf." [...] (Black Coyote did not speak English.) When the soldier persisted, he said, [...] "Stop. He cannot <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> orders." [...] At that moment, two soldiers seized Black Coyote from behind, and (allegedly) in the struggle, his rifle discharged. At the same moment, Yellow Bird threw some dust into the air, and approximately five young Lakota men with concealed weapons threw aside their blankets and fired their rifles at Troop K of the 7th. After this initial exchange, the firing became indiscriminate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the week}} prior to announcing his candidacy, Colbert {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} talk shows to promote his book I Am America (And So Can You). [...] During these interviews, he parodied potential candidates' standard approach to a White House run, giving broad and generally unprompted hints towards a campaign on shows like Larry King Live. [...] "A lot of people see this book as testing the waters for a run for political office," [...] he told King in an October 14, 2007 interview. On the same day, Colbert took over The New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd's column, which he used to engage in similar speculation: [...] "I know why you want me to run, and I <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> clamor...Nevertheless, I am not ready to announce yet – even though it's clear that the voters are desperate for a white, male, middle-aged, Jesus-trumpeting alternative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} nothing but look it over, as you call it, since you came into the Department. You've been a disgrace to the office. You're of no use whatsoever. You give more trouble {{than all the other}} clerks put together. I'm sick of <b>hearing</b> <b>your</b> name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I {{do without}} you?" [...] she said. [...] "It is hard, in these dreary days, {{to lose the}} comfort of <b>hearing</b> <b>your</b> voice. I shall feel all my {{security}} gone, when I feel you no longer near me. How many days shall you be away?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Gaston is {{admitted}} and expresses {{his desire to}} be close to Héléne again. [...] He begins to plan his escape (Aria: Je veux encore entendre.. / [...] "I want to <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> voice again") when the Emir arrives and advises him that escape will result in his death. [...] At that moment, Hélène, having been captured in the city, is brought in. The couple pretends not to know one another, but the Emir is suspicious. [...] However, they are left alone and are joyous in their reunion, until Gaston attempts to dissuade Hélène from associating with him in his dishonor (Aria: Dans la honte et l'épouvante / [...] "You cannot share in the horror and shame of my wandering life!"). She remains firmly resolved to remain with him. [...] From a window, they see the approaching Crusaders and, in the chaos, determine to escape but are thwarted by the arrival of the Emir's soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving in}} the Royal Navy, Guinness had planned to become an Anglican priest. In 1954, while he was filming Father Brown in Burgundy, Guinness, who was in costume as a Catholic priest, was mistaken for a real priest by a local child. Guinness was far from fluent in French, and the child {{apparently}} did not notice that Guinness did not understand him but {{took his hand and}} chattered while the two strolled; the child then waved and trotted off. The confidence and affection the clerical attire appeared to inspire in the boy left a deep impression on the actor. When their son was ill with polio at the age of 11, Guinness began visiting a church to pray. A few years later in 1956, Guinness converted to the Roman Catholic Church. His wife, who was of paternal Sephardi Jewish descent, followed suit in 1957 while he was in Sri Lanka filming The Bridge on the River Kwai, and she informed him only after the event. Every morning, Guinness recited a verse from Psalm 143, [...] "Cause me to <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> loving kindness in the morning".|$|E
2500|$|Often {{referred}} to with the accompanying parenthetical title [...] "(Krishna, Where Are You?)", [...] "I Am Missing You" [...] {{is a love}} song dedicated to the Hindu god Krishna. In the choruses, Shankar's words mourn the apparent absence of Krishna from his life, but in the repeated verses he acknowledges: [...] "Though I can't see you / I <b>hear</b> <b>your</b> flute all the while." [...] The latter line reflects {{the importance of the}} flute – or bansuri – in the Hindu tradition, since it is the musical instrument most commonly associated with the deity. In his second autobiography, Raga Mala (1997), Shankar describes the words as [...] "a simple lyric that just gushed out of me when I was travelling on a plane". Speaking to journalist Graham Reid in 1998, Shankar recalled: [...] "I think we were travelling somewhere in the States … it was very short, maybe six or eight lines. It came very spontaneously with the tune and I noted it down." [...] In addition to the lyrics being in English rather than Hindi or Bengali, the latter being Shankar's first language, the song's melody follows Western convention, with distinct chord changes instead of the single-chord, monodic drone common to Indian music.|$|E
