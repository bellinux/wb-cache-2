25|$|It {{is common}} to assume that {{buildings}} are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies {{that there is little}} interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see {{the overwhelming majority of the}} mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. âBuilding ecology â is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{basics of}} {{continuous}} backpropagation were derived {{in the context}} of control theory by Kelley in 1960 and by Bryson in 1961, using principles of dynamic programming. In 1962, Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule. Bryson and Ho described it as a multi-stage <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> optimization method in 1969. In 1970, Linnainmaa finally published the general method for automatic differentiation (AD) of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. This corresponds to the modern version of backpropagation which is efficient even when the networks are sparse. In 1973, Dreyfus used backpropagation to adapt parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. In 1974, Werbos mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to ANNs, and in 1982, he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to neural networks in the way that is widely used today. In 1986, Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams noted that this method can generate useful internal representations of incoming data in hidden layers of neural networks. In 1993, Wan was the first to win an international pattern recognition contest through backpropagation.|$|E
25|$|Lyapunov {{contributed to}} several fields, {{including}} differential equations, potential theory, dynamical systems and probability theory. His main preoccupations were {{the stability of}} equilibria and the motion of mechanical systems, {{and the study of}} particles under the influence of gravity. His work in the field of mathematical physics regarded the boundary value problem of the equation of Laplace. In the theory of potential, his work from 1897 On some questions connected with Dirichlet's problem clarified several important aspects of the theory. His work in this field is in close connection with the work of Steklov. Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a <b>dynamic</b> <b>system.</b> In the theory of probability, he generalised the works of Chebyshev and Markov, and proved the Central Limit Theorem under more general conditions than his predecessors. The method of characteristic functions he used for the proof later found widespread use in probability theory.|$|E

500|$|Super Mario 64 is {{the first}} game to have a [...] "free" [...] camera that can be {{controlled}} independently of the character. Most 3D games from the time use a first-person perspective, or a camera that is fixed in position relative to the player's character, or to the level. To create freedom of exploration, and more fluid control in a 3D world, the designers created a <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> in which the video camera is operated by the in-game character Lakitu. The camera system would become the standard for 3D platform games in the future. Nintendo Power stated the camera-control scheme is what transitioned platform games into three dimensions, and that the game, along with , [...] "blazed trails" [...] into the 3D era. Along with camera control, the game also innovated in its implementation of movement. Edge stated the game changed [...] "gamers' expectations of 3D movement forever". The Nintendo 64's analog stick allows for more precise and wide-ranging character movements than the digital D-pads of other consoles, and Super Mario 64 uses this {{in a way that}} was unique for its time. At the time, 3D games generally allowed for controls in which the player could either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character's perspective. Super Mario 64s controls are fully analog, and interpret a 360-degree range of motion into navigation through a 3D space relative to the camera. The analog stick also allows for precise control over subtleties such as the speed at which Mario runs. Super Mario 64 was one of the first games to implement the system.|$|E

2500|$|Mathematical {{models of}} complex systems are of three types: black-box (phenomenological), white-box ({{mechanistic}}, {{based on the}} first principles) and grey-box (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models) [...] In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> remain hidden. [...] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> has âtransparent wallsâ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a <b>dynamic</b> <b>system</b> are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers [...] use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [...] Creation of a white-box model of complex system {{is associated with the}} problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical cellular automata are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical ontology of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the first principles because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic axiomatic system of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem [...]|$|E
