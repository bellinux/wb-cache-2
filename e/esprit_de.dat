5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an <b>esprit</b> <b>de</b> corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E

40|$|Claude Dupin {{published}} {{two versions}} of his critique of the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois: Réflexions sur quelques parties d’un livre intitulé ‘De l’esprit des loix,’ in 2 volumes, which appeared in 1749 and was suppressed by the author; and Observations sur un livre intitulé de l’Esprit des loix, in three volumes, published before 1755 and also suppressed. In 2004 Cecil Courtney discovered at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Columbia University a manuscript entitled Observations sur un livre intitulé "De l'Esprit des lois", which is the final revised and unpublished version of Dupin's work. The manuscript remained unknown to Montesquieu scholars till 2004 because of a spelling error in the card catalogue: it was cross referenced to "Montesquiou, Charles Louis de Secondat" and was listed among works on Montesquiou. The Columbia manuscript shows that {{after the publication of}} the Observations Dupin continued to make changes in his work seeking to strengthen his arguments and to make the connection of his text to the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois more transparent. The most important change is the reorganization of chapters. The published Réflexions and Observations are divided into chapters which correspond either to books or to chapters of the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois. The manuscript, on the other hand, is divided into chapters which correspond to chapters in the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois and bear the same titles. The article examines the most frequent types of omissions, additions and characteristic revisions of style. Dupin failed to refute or to elucidate the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois, but the table of contents of the manuscript is valuable because it connects Dupin's comments to individual chapters of the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois and the references he provides are useful for the investigation of sources of information that were available to Montesquieu...|$|R
5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong <b>esprit</b> <b>de</b> corps, the Army issued them beret insignias backed with the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently {{under the impression that}} they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Army {{sought to}} forge a strong <b>esprit</b> <b>de</b> corps among the new recruits, and to this end {{extended}} them several sentimental allowances: for example, morale amongst the Frenchmen rose when they were informed that the Rhodesian insignia on their berets would be backed with the French tricolour. In a similar vein, their request for permission to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia outside their headquarters each morning was approved. French-speaking men already in the army were attached to the unit to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction. Some of these were Mauritians, who {{by virtue of their}} upbringing spoke both English and French at a native-like level. The company itself, which numbered about 200 men, was assigned headquarters near Salisbury at Cranborne Barracks, the home of the Rhodesian Light Infantry. It was organised {{in the same manner as}} a standard Rhodesian independent company, the only exception being its exclusively francophone personnel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} the relative paucity of post-structuralist studies of Montesquieu. If the political writings of Rousseau have attracted this form of approach, it is undoubtedly because of the reflections on truth and on language which they articulate; by contrast, the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois is justifiably acclaimed as introducing empirical or historical methodology into political science. I suggest, however, that a reflection on the problematics of truth and language can be discovered in Montesquieu.

60|$|We are not {{to suppose}} that the Encyclopædia was the {{originating}} organ of either new methods or new social ideas. The exalted and peculiarly modern views about peace, for instance, were plainly inspired from {{the writings of the}} Abbé Saint Pierre (1658-1743)--one of the most original spirits of the century, who deserves to be remembered among other good services as the inventor of the word bienfaisance. Again, in the mass of the political articles we feel the immense impulse that was given to sociological discussion by the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> Lois. Few questions are debated here, which Montesquieu had not raised, and none are debated without reference to Montesquieu's line of argument. The change of which we are conscious in turning from the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> Lois to the Encyclopædia is that political ideas have been grasped as instruments. Philosophy has become patriotism. The Encyclopædists advanced with grave solicitude to the consideration of evils, to which the red-heeled parasites of Versailles were insolently and incorrigibly blind.|$|R

40|$|Georges Benrekassa : From Montesquieu to Benjamin Constant : {{the end of}} the Enlightenment ? This study {{attempts}} to analyze the supposedly liberal tradition linking the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois to the Principes de politique dating from 1802 - 6, after the revolutionary upheaval and at the birth of a new despotism. Constant works out, through a profound criticism of the notion of «social authority », a liberal position based both on contemporary experience and an unusual reading of Montesquieu and Rousseau taken together. But this position {{can be seen as a}} betrayal of the original form of Montesquieu's enlightened ideal and its underlying attempt at liberation. The pacificying and elitist desire to guide and manipulate public opinion in fact leads to a justification of a deep but hidden split in society which is probably in contradiction with the teachings and aims of the <b>Esprit</b> <b>des</b> lois.

25|$|The French 18th-century {{historian}} Louis-Pierre Anquetil, in his <b>Esprit</b> <b>de</b> la Ligue of 1767, {{was among}} the first to begin impartial historical investigation, emphasizing the lack of premeditation (before the attempt on Coligny) in the massacre and that Catholic mob violence had a history of uncontrollable escalation. By this period the Massacre was being widely used by Voltaire (in his Henriade) and other Enlightenment writers in polemics against organized religion in general. The question of whether the massacre had long been premeditated was not entirely settled until the late 19th century; Lord Acton changed his mind on the matter twice, finally concluding that it was not.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Australia began raising an all volunteer force for overseas service almost immediately.

Many of the previously existing militia units chose to enlist together in the AIF and in order to maintain a degree of <b>esprit</b> <b>de</b> corps these men were often allocated to the same AIF unit. As a result, many AIF units retained the identity and traditions of their parent militia units.
