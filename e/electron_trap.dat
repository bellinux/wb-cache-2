50|$|When a photon {{is absorbed}} by a silver halide crystal, a free-carrier (electron in the {{conduction}} band) is generated. This free-carrier can migrate through the crystal lattice of silver halide, until {{captured by the}} shallow <b>electron</b> <b>trap,</b> where the electron is likely to reduce an interstitial silver ion to form an atomic silver. Subsequent exposure can grow the size of silver cluster through the same mechanism. This forms the latent image where the silver cluster becomes large enough to render the entire crystal developable in developer solution.|$|E
40|$|A phenomenological {{theory of}} double {{injection}} into an insulator with traps is derived under the injected plasma approximation. Four probable trap configurations are considered: discrete hole and <b>electron</b> <b>traps,</b> discrete hole and exponential <b>electron</b> <b>traps,</b> exponential hole and discrete <b>electron</b> <b>traps,</b> and exponential hole and <b>electron</b> <b>traps.</b> The traps {{are assumed to}} act as recombination centres. The large range of possible j-V relations which emerges from these models is delineated. By allowing the recombination radiation to cause photodetrapping the scaling law (j/d) = f(V/d 2) can be violated, explaining a common feature of experimental work on anthracene. An exact calculation is used to confirm the theory for a simple case...|$|R

40|$|Enhanced <b>electron</b> <b>trapping</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in n-channels of rad-hard CMOS devices due to electron and gamma-ray irradiation. Room-temperature annealing results in a positive shift in the threshold potential far beyond its initial value. The slope of the annealing curve immediately after irradiation was found to depend strongly on the gate bias applied during irradiation. Some dependence was also observed on the electron dose rate. No clear dependence on energy and shielding over a delidded device was observed. The threshold shift is probably due to <b>electron</b> <b>trapping</b> at the radiation-induced interface states and tunneling of electrons through the oxide-silicon energy barrier to fill the radiation-induced <b>electron</b> <b>traps.</b> A mathematical analysis, based on two parallel annealing kinetics, hole annealing and <b>electron</b> <b>trapping,</b> {{is applied to the}} data for various electron dose rates...|$|R
50|$|A {{schematic}} diagram of instrumentation {{which can be}} used for electron ionization is shown to the right. The ion source block is made out of metal. As the electron source, the cathode, which can be a thin filament of tungsten or rhenium wire, is inserted through a slit to the source block. Then it is heated up to an incandescent temperature to emit electrons. A potential of 70 V is applied between the cathode and source block to accelerate them to 70 eV kinetic energy) to produce positive ions. The potential of the anode (<b>electron</b> <b>trap)</b> is slightly positive and it is placed {{on the outside of the}} ionization chamber, directly opposite to the cathode. The unused electrons are collected by this <b>electron</b> <b>trap.</b> The sample is introduced through the sample hole. To increase the ionization process, a weak magnetic field is applied parallel to the direction of the electrons' travel. Because of this, electrons travel in a narrow helical path, which increases their path length. The positive ions that are generated are accelerated by the repeller electrode into the accelerating region through the slit in the source block. By applying a potential to the ion source and maintaining the exit slit at ground potential, ions enter the mass analyzer with a fixed kinetic energy. To avoid the condensation of the sample, the source block is heated to approximately 300 °C.|$|E
50|$|One very {{important}} {{way to increase}} photographic sensitivity is to manipulate the electron traps in each crystal. A pure, defect-free crystal exhibits poor photographic sensitivity, since it lacks a shallow <b>electron</b> <b>trap</b> that facilitates {{the formation of a}} latent image. In such a case, many of the photoelectrons will recombine with the silver halide crystal and be wasted. Shallow electron traps are created by sulfur sensitization, introduction of a crystalline defect (edge dislocation), and incorporating a trace amount of non-silver salt as a dopant. The location, kind and number of shallow traps have a huge influence on the efficiency by which the photoelectrons create latent image centers, and consequently, on photographic sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{action of}} {{the light on the}} silver halide grains within the {{emulsion}} forms sites of metallic silver in the grains. The basic mechanism by which this happens was first proposed by R W Gurney and N F Mott in 1938. The incoming photon liberates an electron, called a photoelectron, from a silver halide crystal. Photoelectrons migrate to a shallow <b>electron</b> <b>trap</b> site (a sensitivity site), where the electrons reduce silver ions to form a metallic silver speck. A positive hole must also be generated but it is largely ignored. Subsequent work has slightly modified this picture, so that 'hole' trapping is also considered (Mitchell, 1957). Since then, understanding of the mechanism of sensitivity and latent image formation has been greatly improved.|$|E

Gelatin may also contain trace elements (such as sulfur) which increase the light sensitivity of the emulsion, although modern practice uses gelatin without such components. When absorbed by an AgX crystal, photons cause electrons to be promoted to a conduction band (de-localized electron orbital with higher energy than a valence band) which can be attracted by a sensitivity speck, which is a shallow <b>electron</b> <b>trap,</b> which may be a crystalline defect or a cluster of silver sulfide, gold, other trace elements (dopant), or combination thereof, and then combined with an interstitial silver ion to form silver metal speck.|$|E

By adding 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) and then methanol to P 25 to act as hole scavengers, the resultant EPR signal should show <b>electrons</b> populating surface <b>trapping</b> sites. Upon illumination with fluorescent light, at room temperature, the EPR signal for anatase surface <b>electron</b> <b>trapping</b> sites is observed to be very broad, indicating that {{a wide variety of}} both surface and lattice sites, with varying geometries and therefore energies, have been populated. Also observed is a signal attributed to distorted four-coordinated interfacial sites, as previously observed between silica and anatase coatings. Following illumination of the sample, this time at 10  K, more electron-hole pairs were created because of the lower temperature impeding charge carrier mobility. Subsequently any recombination of trapped species will occur where the electron-hole pair was formed. The resultant EPR signal showed there to be a decrease in both the number of populated surface <b>electron</b> <b>trapping</b> sites and interfacial <b>electron</b> <b>trapping</b> sites, which coincided with an increase in the signal for the anatase and rutile lattice <b>electron</b> <b>trapping</b> sites.
