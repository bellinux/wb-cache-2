5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>with</b> a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|At {{daylight}} on {{the morning}} of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive. As the day passed, with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night. When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying {{that he did not want}} to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>with</b> the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, May went {{on trial}} with League Two club Gillingham, {{training}} {{with the club}} {{for a number of}} weeks and playing in several pre-season friendlies. However, no move materialised, and May signed for Conference South side Dover Athletic on a free transfer on 8 August 2012. May made his competitive debut for Dover in a 2–2 away draw against Sutton United on 21 August 2012, coming on as an 86th-minute substitute. He made his first start four days later as Dover defeated AFC Hornchurch 1–0 at Hornchurch Stadium, before scoring his first goal for the club in a 3–1 away win at Eastleigh on 1 September. May went on to score in seven consecutive games running from September to November, five of which in the league and a further two in the FA Cup, subsequently taking his goal tally for the season to eight. Goals in convincing victories over Weston-super-Mare and Truro City took May's goal count into double figures. He ended the year with a run of five goals in three matches, scoring braces in wins against Eastleigh and Hayes & Yeading United, as well as scoring a late consolation strike in a 2–1 defeat to Tonbridge Angels on 26 December 2012. It took May a month to get off the mark {{at the start of the}} new year, controlling the ball and scoring on the turn in a 3–2 win over Welling United at the Crabble Athletic Ground on 9 February 2013. He scored four times in March 2013, subsequently taking his tally for the season to over 20 goals – the first time May had reached this milestone in his career. He scored two further times during the regular season, in away victories against Chelmsford City and Staines Town. Dover finished the season in third place, meaning they would play fourth placed Eastleigh in the two legged play-off semi-finals. May scored a dipping volley as Dover took a 3–1 lead in the first leg, controlling the ball on <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>with</b> his back to goal, turning and hitting the ball from 25-yards past Ross Flitney in the Eastleigh goal. Dover progressed to the final, but lost 3–2 to Salisbury City after extra-time, with May playing in all three play-off matches. During his one season at Dover, May finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, scoring 24 times in 45 matches.|$|E

2500|$|After {{many years}} as an {{acknowledged}} Thelemite, Anger joined the main Thelemic organisation, the Ordo Templi Orientis. He viewed {{many of the men}} he associated with as living embodiments of Lucifer, a symbol of the Aeon of Horus in Thelemic philosophy, and had his own name inked onto <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> <b>with</b> the Lucifer tattoo. Anger has shown an interest in various other religious movements, particularly those that relate in some way to occultism. For instance, Kenneth was a lifelong friend of Anton LaVey from before the founding of the Church of Satan in the 1960s and even lived with him and his family during the 1980s. LaVey also made an appearance in one of Anger's films, Invocation of My Demon Brother (1969) as a devilish priest. Anger describes himself as a [...] "pagan" [...] and refuses to consider himself to be a Satanist. He also characterized Wicca as being a [...] "lunar", feminine religion in contrast with the [...] "solar" [...] masculinity of Thelema.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} that Jade's sinister side would leave the characters in serious danger and that not all the characters involved in the teen storyline would survive the series. It was later revealed that two characters from the main show would die during the series. When episode four was transmitted viewers saw Callum try to rescue Esther from Jade who had taken her hostage after becoming fixated on Esther because of her liver transplant from Jade's dead boyfriend. While rescuing Esther, Callum was stabbed by Jade with a samurai sword which killed him. Callum's exit was not announced previous to its airing, shocking viewers. Duncan felt that the scenes are [...] "surprising and shocking" [...] as they lead the viewer to believe that Callum has saved Esther until he is suddenly killed. Gape said she felt bad that Jade was responsible for Callum's death, although she praised the means of his murder, calling it [...] "one of the best Hollyoaks deaths yet". Although the scenes were filmed using a real samurai sword, the props department created a reproduction of the sword which was used by Duncan during his death scene. The sword was attached to Duncan using a harness to give the appearance {{that he had been}} impaled with the blade exiting <b>his</b> <b>chest,</b> <b>with</b> the puncture wound created using makeup. Jade was the second Hollyoaks character to die during Later, being killed by falling on her own knife during a fight with Tilly.|$|E
