40|$|Magnetic {{circuitry}} computation {{is one of}} {{the central}} stages of designing a synchronous motor with incorporated magnets, which can be performed by means of a simplified method of the magnetic-circuits equivalent modeling. The article studies the magnetic circuit of the motor with the rotor-incorporated magnets, which includes four sectors: constant magnets with the field pole extension made of magnetically soft steel, magniflux dispersion sections containing air barriers and steel bridges; the air gap; the stator grooves, cogs and the <b>frame</b> <b>yoke.</b> The authors introduce an equivalent model of the magnetic circuit. High-energy magnets with a linear demagnetization curve are employed in the capacity of constant magnets. Two magnets create the magnetic flux for one pole. The decline of magnetic potential in the steel of the pole is negligible consequent on the admission that the poles magnetic inductivity µ = ∞. The rotor design provides for the air barriers and the steel bridges that close leakage flux. The induction-permeability curve linearization serves for the bridges magnetic saturation accountability and presents a polygonal line consisting of two linear sections. The estimation of the magnet circuit section including the cogs and the <b>frame</b> <b>yoke</b> is executed with account of the steel saturation, their magnetic conductivities thereat being dependent on the saturation rate. Relying on the equivalent model of the magnetic circuit, the authors deduce a system of two equations written from the first and the second Kirchhoff laws of the magnetic circuits. These equations allow solving two problems: specifying dimensions of the magnets by the preset value of the magnetic flow in the clearance and determining the clearance magnetic flow at the preset motor rotor-and-stator design. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} design and tests of 2 T superconducting model dipoles, {{operating}} at 1 Hz, are presented. The magnets use a SC coil made from hollow superconducting cable, cooled with forced flow two-phase helium, and utilise a two section window <b>frame</b> iron <b>yoke</b> at different temperatures: one section at 4. 5 K, the other at 80 K. Measurements of magnet training, AC losses, and magnetic fields are presented. Some beam pipe design problems as well as radiation effects are also discussed. ...|$|R

The yoke, working with a swivel head allows the caster wheel to operate in a 360 degree manner. The yoke is also known as the fork, rig or housing.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{full-size}} prototype dipole magnet {{has been}} designed, fabricated and {{tested for the}} Booster synchrotron of a new collider facility NICA at JINR in Dubna. The magnet {{is based on a}} cold window <b>frame</b> iron <b>yoke</b> and a curved single-layered superconducting winding made from a hollow NbTi composite superconductor cable cooled with a forced two-phase helium flow at T= 4. 5 K. The maximal operating magnetic field in the elliptical aperture of 128 mm x 64 mm is 1. 8 T. The magnetic field ramp rate of 1. 2 T/s should be achievable. The design features of the magnet 2. 2 m long as well as the test results are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersion}} of acoustic noise during the turn-on and turn-off switching of HEV(hybrid electric vehicle) relay was experimentally analyzed {{to identify the}} reason for the {{dispersion of}} noise level. An effective method was proposed to reduce the dispersion of noise level. First, a method to wrap the side of moving core with a tape was adopted to reduce the transverse vibration. It enabled the moving core to make a consistent motion and reduce the dispersion of noise level from switching operation of relay. Second, the dispersion of noise level from vibration transmission of parts such as the outer <b>frame</b> and <b>yoke</b> caulking part of relay were tested to find out main sources. From this result, it was identified that the yoke caulking part made inconsistent transient vibration and noise dispersion...|$|R
50|$|The Model 12 is {{most often}} found to have some wear on its bluing due to age, but this wear does not detract from either its {{function}} or its value as a vintage concealed-carry piece. An important earmark is the factory stamp Mod-12 on the <b>frame</b> inside the <b>yoke.</b> Also {{on the inside of}} the yoke is the revolver's serial number, which is repeated verbatim on the base of the butt. The Model 12 holds its market value nicely and is highly collectible. As with most older revolvers, a reputable gunsmith should check its functioning prior to purchase.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non invasive method for estimating the energy efficiency of induction motors used in industrial applications. This method is innovative {{because it is}} only based on the measurement of the external field emitted by the motor. The paper describes the sensors used, how they should be placed around the machine in order to decouple the external field components generated by both the air gap flux and the winding end-windings. The study emphasizes {{the influence of the}} eddy currents flowing in the <b>yoke</b> <b>frame</b> on the sensor position. A method to estimate the torque from the external field use is proposed. The measurements are transmitted by a wireless module (Zig-Bee) and they are centralized and stored on a PC computer...|$|R
40|$|Proposal of {{abstract}} for MT 16, Tallahesse, Florida, 26 th September to 2 nd October 1999. A large Dipole Magnet {{is required for}} the Muon Arm Spectrometer of the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The absence of strong requirements on the symmetry and homogeneity of the magnetic field has lead to a design dominated by economic and feasibility considerations. In March 1997 the decision was taken to build a resistive dipole magnet for the muon spectrometer of the ALICE experiment. Since then, design work has been pursued in JINR/Russia and at CERN. While a common concept has been adopted for the construction of the steel core, two different proposals have been made for the manufacturing technology of the excitation coils. In both cases, however, the conductor material will be Aluminium. The general concept of the dipole magnet is based on a window <b>frame</b> return <b>yoke,</b> fabricated from low carbon steel sheets. The flat vertical poles follow the defined acceptance angle of 9 degrees. The excitation coils are of saddle type. The coils are wound from large hollow Aluminium profiles. They are cooled by pressurized demineralised water. The coil ends are located to both sides of the magnet yoke and determine the overall length of the magnet. The main flux direction in the gap is horizontal and perpendicular to the LHC beam axis. Both coil concepts and the underlying manufacturing technology are compared and the present status of the development of the magnet is described...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis as been {{implemented}} during the spring term 2009 at the University of Gävle. The company Bruks produces mobile chippers which are used for chipping logging slash, roundwood and parts of trees. The chipper is powered by a separate diesel engine and the chipper can be assembled on trucks, trailers or some other carrier vehicles. When the chip has passed the chipper drum, the chip is collected in an integrated bin which is mounted on the vehicles <b>frame</b> with dumping <b>yokes.</b> When these dumping yokes were designed they were probably created with large material dimensions. The aim with the degree project is hence to study the strengths of materials and, if possible, to suggest an arrangement that can decrease the total weight on the dumping yoke on Bruks´ mobile chippers 805 CT. The CAD-program Pro/ENGINEER was used during the project for outlining the 2 Ddrawings, as distributed of constructors on Bruks, to solid 3 D-parts. The three-dimensional assembly from Pro/ENGINEER was transferred to Pro/MECHANICA. The construction is complex and contains many components, and therefore the model has been divided into two different parts, the external and the internal dumping yoke. The conclusion of the degree project is that the product generally is not over dimensioned. However there are many options for optimizing, mainly on the external dumping yokes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{styles of}} Panofsky Quadrupoles with {{integral}} corrector dipole windings are {{in use in}} the electron beam line of the Free Electron Laser at Jefferson Lab. We combined the functions into single magnets, adding hundreds of Gauss-cm dipole corrector capability to existing quadrupoles because space is at a premium along the beam line. Superposing a o ne part in 1 00 dipole corrector field on a 1 part in 1000, weak (600 to 1000 Gauss) quadrupole is possible because the parallel slab iron yoke of the Panofsky Quadrupole acts as a window <b>frame</b> style dipole <b>yoke.</b> The dipole field is formed when two electrically floating “current sources”, designed and made at JLab, add and subtract current from the two opposite quadrupole current sheet windings parallel to the dipole field direction. The current sources also drive auxiliary coils at the yoke’s inner corners that improve the d ipole field. Magnet measurements yielded the control system field maps that characterize {{the two types of}} fields. Field analysis using TOSCA, construction and wiring details, magnet measurements and reference for the current source are presented.

5000|$|The Do 217 usually {{carried a}} crew of four. Included were a pilot, an observer/bomb aimer/forward gunner, dorsal gunner/radio {{operator}} and a flight engineer/ventral gunner. As with the Dornier Do 17, the crew were positioned in the cockpit cabin forward of the engines and leading edge. The pilot sat on the port side, with a spectacle-type control column mounted on a swinging arm centered in the instrument panel. The entire arm could be swung 180deg to starboard, placing the yoke {{in front of the}} bombardier, in case of emergencies. In the later Do 217K with stepless windscreen, the center pivot was mounted on a rocking control arm or pedestal, rather than a sliding piston, since the instrument panel itself was eliminated (replaced with smaller panels holding the gauges, hung {{from the edge of the}} fueslage wall and from the glazing <b>frames</b> above the <b>yoke,</b> respectively.) The bomb aimer sat on his immediate right, slightly below and behind. In combat he could move forward into the nose and operate the bomb release gear or aim the forward machine gun (or 20 mm cannon). On the right side of the nose, the bomb aimer's window penetrates the cockpit and is visible as a bulge on the exterior. Back-to-back with the bombardiers seat, the flight engineer/ventral gunner sat on the port side, his seat facing to the rear. The seat of the ventral gunner/flight engineer was next to the radio operator facing forward, behind the bomb aimer. During operations the ventral gunner/engineer would lie on his stomach facing aft, his post as a gunner taking immediate and first priority.The radio-operator/dorsal gunner sat in a pivoting seat in the extreme rear, above the ventral gun position. His head was inside the B-Stand gun position, and the instruments mounted in a semi-circle around his torso level. The pilot had a curved shield of Armour plating, 8.5 mm thick, placed behind his seat. His seat had a further 5mm ( [...] in) of armour and another 5mm ( [...] in) plate above his head, installed in the top of the cockpit roof. The dorsal gunner was also protected by armour plating.The Funkgerät or FuG radio communication device compartments were located in the extreme rear of the cockpit, near the leading edge. The automatic pilot panel was located next the FuG boxes. In the right-rear of the cockpit the piping that was also attached to the de-icing ducts in wings also entered the cockpit, as part of a single heating system to emit warm air to heat the cabin if needed.The FuG X, 16, navigational direction finder PeilG V direction finder (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 2 blind landing devices were used in the E-2.|$|R
