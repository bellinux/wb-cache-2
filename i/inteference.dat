The study involved a number of data collection techniques, namely a desktop study, literature review, case study and documetary review. Specifically, the study focused on the following objectives: i. To assess how the municipality develops and presents the Integrated Development Plan to the community; ii. The structures promoting IDP, good governance and public participation; iii. To bring to light any political <b>inteferences</b> which may hamper municipal service delivery; iv. To critically analyse the implementation of Batho Pele principles as a way of community involvement; and v.

Throughout the study, Fetakgomo Local Municipality was found to have some strengths, but it was also found that there is room for improvement in terms of providing a better and more understandable integrated development plan. In conclusion, meaningful public participation in the IDP process requires that citizens should be afforded an opportunity to raise their concerns and be taken into consideration, that they should be informed and be knowledgeable about municipal activities. The community must be willing and able to be involved. Community members must have the interest, time, opportunity and access necessary to participate. The community must take responsibility for the quality of their participation and be accountable to each other for effective and efficient use of time and other resources.

The unimodular factor {{is the product of}} elementary J-orthogonal matrices and a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal, as in the constant matrix LU decomposition. This leads to a J-Orthogonal LU polynomial matrix decomposition, as a combination of two classical matrix factorization methods: Smith canonical form and LU Gaussian elimination. The inversion of the unimodular factor, for use as a pre/post filter in the beamforming scheme, is immediate and can be achieved with O(1) complexity. The resulting reduced MIMO channel is exactly diagonal, leading to separate single input single output (SISO) channels with no co-channel <b>inteference.</b> There is no need to model the MIMO channel as Laurent polynomial as usual, thus introducing unnecessary delays just for technical reasons. In addition, it turns out that each of the resulting SISO channels, except the last one, reduces to a simple additive noise channel, with no intersymbol interference, except for unprobable original MIMO channels. However, these very interesting features are to be balanced with the possible noise enhancement in the postfiltering step. The performance in terms of bit-error rate is studied and compared to the QR-based frequency-domain and time-domain broadband beamforming.

Themis 2 over-expression enhanced the LPS-induced production of TNF but not IL- 6 or Cox- 2, nor TNF production induced by ligands for TLR 2 (PAM 3) or TLR 3 (poly I:C).

During the time-span of the study, home-range use and movement patterns suggested a marked centrality in spatial behaviour and traditionality in retreat areas year-round, both during pup-rearing season and the following months. In addition, by being essentially nocturnal, resident wolves appeared to adopt tactics of temporal segregation from people to exploit food resources safely in the proximity of human settlements. Overall activity correlated with distance travelled (r = 0. 90, P much less than 0. 001), and corresponded to cyclic nocturnal movements from retreat to feeding areas. wolf movement rate between 20 : 00 and 04 : 00 h averaged 2. 5 km/h but varied up to about 8 km/h, and daily distance travelled ((x) over bar = 27 km/night; range 17 - 38 km/night) mostly depended on the location of traditional feeding sites. Home-range configuration, habitat use, {{activity and}} movements all appeared highly integrated so as to represent the most functional compromise between avoidance of human <b>inteference</b> and exploitation of the available food resources...|$|E
30|$|Based {{on early}} {{clinical}} experiences with permanent or temporary epiphysiodesis (Phemister 1933; Blount and Clarke 1949) many experimental articles {{were published in}} the mid- 20 th century with the goal to improve growth regulation of long bones, but also to evaluate the risk of epiphyseal fractures or epiphysiolysis on the remaining longitudinal growth (Haas 1948, Haas 1945 a,b, 1950; Campbell et al. 1959; Ford and Key 1956; Friedenberg 1957; Siffert 1956; Barash and Siffert 1966; Nordentoft 1969). At the end of the 20 th century, first experiments were conducted with biodegradable materials. Mäkelä et al. (1987) studied the reaction of growth plates to a polyglactin 91 rod that was placed in the central portion of distal femoral growth plate in rabbits. Six weeks after implantation, the distal femoral physis showed similar growth disturbance as a drill hole which was left empty. In a later study, the same author (Mäkelä et al. 1989) showed that the size of the implant {{played a significant role in}} the development of growth disturbances. In rabbits with transphyseally placed 2.0  mm polydioxanone (PDS) implants no permanent growth disturbances could be found, whereas 3.2  mm PDS implants caused a growth disturbance similar to a drill hole. In a large animal study on sheep, placing a biodegradable interference screw over the growth plate resulted in a deformity of the proximal tibial growth plate. The fact that no major growth changes were observed may have been related to the fact that the <b>inteference</b> screw was placed centrally in the growth plate of the proximal tibia, similar to Stadelmaier’s study (Stadelmaier et al. 1995). This revealed that microscopic growth plate deformities may also occur with the implantation of biodegradable materials and the authors did not recommend the use of such transphyseally placed implants in pediatric ACL reconstruction (Seil 2002).|$|E
