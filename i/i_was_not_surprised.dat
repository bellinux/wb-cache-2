500|$|Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, who {{did become}} the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1944, helped Willis in his race. Upon Willis' victory, Bricker wired {{a friend to}} express jubilation, {{which turned out to}} have been unfounded: [...] "Election showed {{definite}} trend in all areas against New Deal. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at the outcome particularly in Kentucky because the thinking {{of the people of the}} Middle West is in line with results down there. It looks very much like a Republican victory next year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bronstein, who {{had worked}} with Furman earlier, wrote [...] "When Furman started to work with Anatoly Karpov, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> by the young grandmaster's success, showing a {{brilliant}} understanding of grandmaster strategy. It was obvious that Furman had passed on to him a lot of the knowledge acquired during his earlier years. It should also be said that Furman had very good analytical powers and was able to look deeply into the games of other grandmasters, disclosing the secrets of their success." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{spent the}} first half of 1859 in Florida, where Ludlow wrote a series of articles, “Due South Sketches,” {{describing}} what he later recalled as “the climate of Utopia, the scenery of Paradise, and the social system of Hell.” He noted that while apologists for slavery condemned abolitionists for condoning miscegenation, “he most open relations of concubinage existed between white chevaliers and black servants in the town of Jacksonville. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at the fact, but was surprised at its openness.... not even the pious shrugged their shoulders or seemed to care.” ...|$|E

'And {{my friend}} the centaur, goes {{the way of}} his mamma! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised.</b> And his mysterious friend Mr Dennis, likewise! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised.</b> And my old postman, the {{exceedingly}} free-and-easy young madman of Chigwell! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite rejoiced. It's the very best thing that could possibly happen to him.' ...|$|R

2500|$|Through the maquis {{caused the}} Germans much difficulty, the guerrillas tended not to fare well in {{sustained}} combat. The SOE agent André Hue who was leading a maquis band in Brittany later recalled about the Battle of Saint Marcel as the firefight on 18 June 1944 at a farmhouse outside Saint Marcel {{he was using}} as his base: [...] "Now every weapon that the enemy possessed was {{brought to bear on}} our front line in a cacophony of shots and explosions which could not drown an even more sinister noise: the occasional crack of a single bullet. A man within feet of me slumped to the ground with blood spurting two feet into the air from the side of his neck [...] [...] [...] We had anticipated an infantry assault-possibly backed up with light armour-but snipers, a threat we had not met before, were difficult to counter. Within minutes of the first casualty, another seven of our men lay dying within the farm complex: all had been shot from long range." [...] As the snipers continued to cut down his men while he could hear the sound of panzers coming up in the distance, Hue ordered his men to retreat into the woods under the cover of darkness while using his radio to call in a RAF airstrike that disorganised the Germans enough to make escape possible. Summarizing up the Battle of Saint Marcel, Hue wrote: [...] "The majority of the younger men had never been in battle, and seeing their friends' brains and guts oozing on to the grass and mud made them sick in the head and stomach. Just as terrifying to the young Frenchmen was the sight of those who were wounded and who yet had to die without help. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that so many had enough. I was perhaps astonished that the number of defectors were so low".|$|E

6000|$|... "What, {{the girl}} who was rescued?" [...] Colonel Somerset said; [...] "a very pretty, ladylike-looking young woman. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> now that <b>I</b> see her, at this desperate exploit of my sergeant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I fear you are {{speaking}} {{on a subject}} of which I know nothing,' said Coningsby, smiling;' I do not understand business at all; though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that, being at Manchester, you should suppose so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|On that I had paused, and, as I {{felt myself}} still holding her, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when my pause had an effect. [...] "You do let it go?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at the suddenness of this announcement. Our {{chief was}} eminently {{a man of}} action. He seldom talked much about plans, but thought them well out, and when his mind was made up acted without delay.|$|E
60|$|She evidently did {{not quite}} {{understand}} what I meant, for there was a look of slight bewilderment in her eyes; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> for I had not myself the faintest notion of my meaning. Still she saw it was a compliment.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is rather}} an {{uncommon}} name," [...] the visitor said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> {{that you do}} not remember it or me, for it is some twenty years since we met. My name is Simcoe." ...|$|R
50|$|On hearing these words, Drupada answered:-, Thou art {{of noble}} soul and great prowess. Therefore, O Brahmana, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at what thou doest. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very much gratified with thee, and I desire thy eternal friendship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Feel bad, Tom?" [...] {{his uncle}} asked cheerily from behind. [...] "Brace up, lad; {{it was a}} pretty warm ten minutes, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> you feel it. Now it <b>is</b> over <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a little shaky myself." ...|$|R
60|$|I protested hastily that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> in the least; that I {{thought nothing}} of the kind; that anarchists in general were simply inconceivable to me mentally, morally, logically, sentimentally, and even physically. X {{received}} this declaration with his usual woodenness and went on.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at this. Strickland {{was just}} the man to rise {{superior}} to circumstances, when they were such as to occasion despondency in most; but whether {{this was due to}} equanimity of soul or to contradictoriness {{it would be difficult to}} say.|$|E
60|$|We were {{swinging}} along low {{above the}} foothills of the Otz. It was comparatively warm and there was plenty of air for our starved lungs, so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> to see the black open his eyes, and a moment later the girl also.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Wallace {{is a very}} charming young lady, Mr. Ten Eyck," [...] I rejoined, as soon as wonder {{would allow}} me to answer, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> you speak of her in terms of so much admiration." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite {{the young}} man of fashion.

6000|$|... "Is it indeed, sir? But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear it, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure. It might be--any age almost." [...] After {{rendering}} {{this general}} {{tribute to the}} port, Mr. Snagsby in his modesty coughs an apology behind his hand for drinking anything so precious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{troops had}} bivouacked round the fort. Towards daybreak <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to hear that}} I was {{designated}} to command the escort of a prisoner who was to be sent down at once to Santiago. Of course the prisoner was Gaspar Ruiz' wife.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{only got}} one, Mrs. Archer, and it reached me {{just before we}} sailed from the Mediterranean two years ago. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> however, for of course the post is {{extremely}} uncertain. It is only very seldom that letters reach a ship on a foreign station.” ...|$|E
60|$|So White had {{revealed}} himself. On the whole, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised.</b> Certainly his motive for concealment, {{the fear of}} making Mr Abney nervous, was removed. An inrush of Red Indians with tomahawks could hardly have added greatly to Mr Abney's nervousness at the present juncture.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you say the}} Sirdar blew you up? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at that. You {{know the}} story of the man who fell overboard, in the old {{flogging}} days, and the captain sentenced him to two dozen lashes, for leaving the ship without orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wilson said to himself, [...] "Anybody with a {{reasonably}} good head {{would have thought}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that Blake didn't detect it; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only surprised that Tom did.

2500|$|The ex-governor and {{his family}} learned of the {{indictment}} while they were vacationing in Florida, near Disney World. Through his publicist, the ex-governor stated, [...] "I'm saddened and hurt, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> by the indictment. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> innocent. <b>I</b> now will fight in the courts to clear my name." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> I say, at this resolve of his. What {{did seem}} a little {{remarkable}} to me was the thorough {{way in which he}} had thought the thing out.

60|$|At {{intervals}} I {{wondered what}} had become of Bradshaw. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at his absence. At first I had feared that he would keep his word in that matter. As time went on I knew that he would. At more frequent intervals I wondered how I should enjoy being a bankrupt.|$|E
60|$|I {{said that}} I {{had seen them}} nearly all, during the past year, in New England and in the West, but they {{appeared}} to me inalienable of the simpler life of the country, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> {{they should not have}} found an evolution in the more artificial society of the cities.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very happy}} to find that she has some good fortune at last,' {{returned}} Miss Pecksniff, tossing her head.

It's not my fault.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} so unhappy if I think that <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> in the way. If Mrs. Furnival wished {{to speak to}} you on {{business}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that she should <b>be</b> angry, for <b>I</b> know that barristers do not usually allow themselves to be troubled by their clients in their own chambers." ...|$|R
40|$|You know a {{politician}} {{is in trouble}} and short of ideas when they start talking about saluting the flag and pride in our country.
