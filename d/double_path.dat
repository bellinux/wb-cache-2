The present paper aims at a {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} forming limits of a sheet metal subjected to <b>double</b> strain <b>path</b> changes by using as reference material the AA 6016 -T 4 aluminium alloy sheet. The simulation of plastic instability is carried out through the Marciniak-Kuczynski analysis. The initial shape of the yield locus is given by the Yld 2000 - 2 d plane stress yield function. The strain {{hardening of the material}} is described by the Voce type saturation law. Linear and several complex strain paths involving single and <b>double</b> strain <b>path</b> changes are taken into account. The validity of the model is assessed by comparing the predicted and experimental forming limits under linear and selected one strain path change. A good accuracy of the developed software on predicting the forming limits is found. A sensitive analysis of the influence of the type and the value of the double prestrain on the occurrence of the plastic flow localization is performed. A remarkable effect of the <b>double</b> strain <b>path</b> change on the sheet metal forming limits is observed...|$|R

5000|$|Other common-path {{interferometer}} configurations {{have been}} described in the literature, such as the double-focus interferometer and the Saunders's prism interferometer, and many others. Common-path interferometers have proven useful {{in a wide variety}} of applications including optical coherence tomography, digital holography, and the measurement of phase delays. [...] Their relative resilience to environmental vibration is a common outstanding feature, and they can sometimes be used when no reference beam is available; however, depending on their topology, their interference patterns may be more complicated to interpret than those generated by <b>double</b> <b>path</b> interferometers.|$|E
5000|$|Another common-path {{interferometer}} {{useful in}} lens testing and fluid flow diagnostics {{is the point}} diffraction interferometer (PDI), invented by Linnik in 1933. [...] The reference beam is generated by diffraction from a small pinhole, about half {{the diameter of the}} Airy disk, in a semitransparent plate. Fig. 1 illustrates an aberrated wavefront focused onto the pinhole. The diffracted reference beam and the transmitted test wave interfere to form fringes. The common-path design of the PDI brings to it a number of important advantages. (1) Only a single laser path is required rather than the two paths required by the Mach-Zehnder or Michelson designs. This advantage can be very important in large interferometric setups such as in wind tunnels that have long optical paths through turbulent media. (2) The common-path design uses fewer optical components than <b>double</b> <b>path</b> designs, making alignment much easier, as well as reducing cost, size, and weight, especially for large setups. (3) While the accuracy of a <b>double</b> <b>path</b> design is dependent on the precision with which the reference element is figured, careful design enables the generated reference beam of the PDI to be of guaranteed precision. A disadvantage is that the amount of light getting through the pinhole depends on how well the light can be focused onto the pinhole. If the incident wavefront is severely aberrated, very little light may get through. The PDI has seen use in various adaptive optics applications.|$|E

Li (J. Graph Theory 14 (1990) 645 â 650) has shown that every simple graph has a PPDC. A regular perfect <b>path</b> <b>double</b> cover (RPPDC) of a graph G is a PPDC of G in which all paths are of the same length. For a <b>path</b> <b>double</b> cover P of a graph G, the associated graph HP(G) of P {{is defined as a}} graph having the same vertex set as G, with two vertices x and y adjacent if and only if there is a path in P with endpoints x and y. An eulerian perfect <b>path</b> <b>double</b> cover (EPPDC) of a graph G is a PPDC of G whose associated graph is a cycle. If a PPDC is both eulerian and regular, it is called an ERPPDC.

The authors propose an integrated approach aimed at taking into consideration all the phenomena involved in this manufacturing process, with particular attention to implementing easy mathematical models in order to optimize the trade-off between the accuracy of the predicted results and the computational times. The proposed models involve the calculation of the 3 D thermal field occurring into the workpiece and predict the microstructural evolution of the target material exploiting an original approach based on the definition of thermodynamic thresholds, which can be considered as a physical constant of the material itself. Several parameters and phenomena are taken into consideration in order to accurately simulate the process: laser beam characteristics, fast austenization of the steel, and tempering effect due to mutually interacting beam trajectories.

The 3 D inputs of the simulator are the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for modelling the terrain and the target model. The targets {{are assumed to be}} standing on the terrain. Given the size of the target, the simulator generates the facets. Facets are known to be adequate to model the 3 D terrain and the target [11]. For the sake of simplicity, each facet is employed as rough surface and assumed to be a scattering center, and the back scattering from each facet is computed under the Geometrical Optics (GOs) approximation in order to compute large scenes efficiently. In the double scattering case, the surface attenuation coefficient of each facet is considered. The ratio of the height deviation to the resolution of the sensor is taken into account to determine the number of <b>double</b> <b>paths.</b> For each path, the incidence angle, the scattered ray and the new incidence angle from the target to the ground or target to target (and vice versa), are computed via ray tracing.
