2500|$|The defence-suppression bombing {{attack by}} the Canberras was two minutes late, {{occurring}} at 08h02 instead of 08h00 as originally planned, because the lead navigator failing to maintain effective timing-adjustment during the [...] low-level approach phase. This made no difference to the intended effect. As the bombing had been timed to coincide with SWAPO's daily [...] on the parade ground, {{most of the people}} in the camp were assembled in the open when the Canberras initiated their low-level <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bomb</b> attack from the north. Each of the four Canberras - flying in loose 'line abreast' at [...] and 300 knots - dropped 300 Rhodesian-designed [...] "Alpha" [...] fragmentation bombs, which were small [...] finless bombs like '10-Pin Bowling' balls, designed to bounce up to [...] into the air before detonating. A zone of some 800 metres by 500 metres was carpeted, each aircraft having its own 'bomb line'. The weapons were devastatingly effective against the assembled terrorists, causing most of SWAPO's casualties on the day, and also destroying vehicles, POL ("Petroleum Oil Lubricants", military acronym for flammable liquids) storage tanks and soft buildings.|$|E

50|$|The first {{cluster bomb}} used operationally was the German SD-2 or Sprengbombe Dickwandig 2 kg, {{commonly}} referred to as the Butterfly Bomb. It was used in World War II to attack both civilian and military targets. The technology was developed independently by the United States, Russia and Italy (see Thermos Bomb). The US used the 20-lb M41 <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bomb</b> wired together in clusters of 6 or 25 with highly sensitive or proximity fuzes.|$|E
5000|$|In ensuing days, Willoughby {{experienced}} Japanese {{air attacks}} at odd intervals during daylight hours.

50|$|It was {{alleged that}} the explosions {{could have come from}} the {{transformers}} nearby, though investigators from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources later identified that the transformers had been tampered with from the outside.

50|$|Ednatol is {{a yellow}} high explosive, {{comprising}} about 58% ethylenedinitramine (aka Haleite or Explosive H) and 42% TNT.

50|$|In 1882 the Explosive Company of Stowmarket {{introduced}} EC Powder, {{which contained}} nitro-cotton and {{nitrates of potassium}} and barium in a grain gelatinesed by ether alcohol. It had coarser grains than other nitrocellulose powders. It proved unsuitable for rifles, but it remained in long use for shotguns and was later used for grenades and <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
50|$|By early 1945, Americans were {{becoming}} aware that something strange was going on. Balloons had been sighted and explosions heard, from California to Alaska. Something {{that appeared to}} witnesses {{to be like a}} parachute descended over Thermopolis, Wyoming. A <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bomb</b> exploded, and shrapnel was found around the crater. A P-38 Lightning shot a balloon down near Santa Rosa, California; another was seen over Santa Monica; and bits of washi were found in the streets of Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|The bombs {{then called}} Blockbusters were the RAF's HC (High Capacity) bombs. These bombs had {{especially}} thin casings {{that allowed them}} to contain approximately three-quarters of their weight in explosive, with a 4,000-pound bomb containing over 3000 lb of Amatol. Most general-purpose bombs (termed Medium Capacity—or MC—by the RAF) contained 50% explosive by weight, the rest being made up of the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bomb</b> casing. Blockbusters got larger as the war progressed, from the original 4000 lb version, up to 12000 lb.|$|E
50|$|Bardagul then {{examines}} {{the contents of}} the garbage bag. The absence of shrapnel tells him that the bomb used in the explosion is not a <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bomb</b> and neither it is an incendiary bomb because the garbage is still intact. Bardagul also finds some receipts, a classified ad from a newspaper, a leaf, and a SIM card. He gets his cellular phone and inserts the SIM card. The SIM card is locked, but an acquaintance, Noks Ramos (Igno), manages to unlock it in only four seconds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, the {{squadron}} received 13 Curtis A-18 Shrike II's. This two-engine attack plane represented a technological advance. It carried 20 <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bombs</b> in the fuselage {{and up to}} four 100-pound bombs under its wings. Four [...]30-caliber machine guns mounted in the nose provided concentrated fire for strafing ground targets. It performed well, winning the Harmon Trophy for gunnery and bombing accuracy during its first year of operations.|$|R
50|$|Inowrocław {{returned}} to Poland and its original name following {{the arrival of}} the Soviet Red Army on January 21, 1945. The last German air raid occurred on April 4, 1945, when a single aircraft dropped four <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bombs</b> and fired on travelers waiting at the Inowrocław train platform. Between 1950 and 1998, the town was part of Bydgoszcz Voivodeship, but the 1999 reforms left it part of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.|$|R
50|$|On 11 November 1944 the {{aircraft}} pictured (right) {{was part of}} an 18 aircraft formation which attacked three enemy troop convoys and dropped <b>fragmentation</b> <b>bombs</b> on them while attempting to move though the Brenner Pass. The aircraft was hit by ground fire and about 60% of its right vertical tail was blown off. However, the Mitchell was able to return to its base on Corsica with only a single working rudder.|$|R
