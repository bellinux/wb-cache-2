5|$|Macartney {{missed the}} 1924–25 Test series when England toured Australia. He played {{in only two}} {{first-class}} matches {{in the early stages}} of the season, scoring 11 runs at 3.66 and taking five wickets at 23.40. The withdrawal of Macartney from competition was attributed to a <b>flare-up</b> of an injury he had suffered during World War I, but sceptics believed that he had suffered a nervous breakdown.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial <b>flare-up</b> of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} {{significant}} skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Miller was {{selected}} for the New Zealand tour, under the captaincy of Queensland's Bill Brown. Miller started the tour well, top-scoring with 139 against Auckland. Along with seven other debutants, Miller made his test debut in the match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, a match that was retrospectively accorded Test status in 1948. On a sticky wicket, New Zealand won the toss and batted. Miller was not required to bowl in the first innings as O'Reilly and Ernie Toshack skittled the home side for just 42. Australia made 8/199 with Miller scoring 30. He was allowed to take the new ball in the second innings, taking 2/6 in six overs before a <b>flare-up</b> of his back injury forced him to be removed from the attack. Australia bowled their hosts out for 54, securing an innings victory.|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} is a chronic disease {{that is more}} frequent in women of reproductive age. The relationship between lupus and pregnancy is problematic: maternal and fetal outcomes are worse than in the general population, and the management of <b>flare-ups</b> is difficult during this period. The aim here was to compare the outcomes of 76 pregnancies in 67 women with lupus, according to the occurrence or absence of <b>flare-ups.</b> DESIGN AND SETTING: An observational cohort clinical study evaluating the evolution of pregnant women with lupus who were receiving care at the prenatal outpatient clinic, Centro de Atenção Integral à Saúde da Mulher, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (CAISM/Unicamp), between 1995 and 2002. METHODS: Data were collected on a precoded form. The women {{were divided into two}} groups according to the occurrence or absence of <b>flare-ups,</b> as defined by the systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} disease activity index (SLEDAI). The presence or absence of <b>flare-ups</b> and renal involvement was considered to be the independent variable and the other results were dependent variables. RESULTS: <b>Flare-ups</b> occurred in 85. 3 % of cases, and were most significant when there was renal involvement. This was related to greater numbers of women with preeclampsia and poor perinatal outcome. Intrauterine growth restriction was more common in the women with active disease. Placental weight was significantly lower in the women with renal involvement. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Flare-ups</b> and renal involvement in lupus patients during pregnancy are associated with increased maternal and perinatal complications...|$|R

5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite <b>flare-up,</b> which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|In Banovina, the JNA {{reached the}} Kupa River and {{captured}} its entire southern bank, except for ZNG bridgeheads {{in the areas}} of Nebojan, Sunja and Sisak, on 30 September. No further advances were achieved there. The JNA attempted an additional push towards the Nebojan bridgehead via Novi Farkašić on 1718 October, and another towards Sunja on 2 November, but both attempts failed. On 4 October, the JNA initiated an attack in Kordun, in the area of Karlovac, pushing the ZNG back in the area of Slunj two days later. On 8 October, it reached the banks of the Kupa and Korana Rivers and the intensity of fighting died down. The greatest <b>flare-up</b> of hostilities in the area occurred on 45 November when a JNA garrison based in a suburb of Karlovac broke through the ZNG siege in the Battle of Logorište and reached JNA-held territory to the east of the city. Further south, the JNA captured Slunj on 17 November and Cetingrad on 29 November, eliminating a ZNG pocket in Kordun. JNA activity in Lika was limited to shelling and air raids on Gospić and Otočac, peaking on 4 October.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Rova of Antananarivo occurred {{at a time when}} the complex was in the final stages of the process to become classified as Madagascar's first cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident. Public accusations of a cover-up placed the blame for the fire on government officials, various ethnic groups, foreign powers and other parties. Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured justifications for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public distraction from their illicit activities. Other explanations have included popular dissatisfaction with the election of divisive mayor Guy Willy Razanamasy or a <b>flare-up</b> of long-standing tensions among coastal peoples resentful of Merina socio-political domination. Accusations were also made against both then-president Albert Zafy and his predecessor, Didier Ratsiraka. The debate over why and how the Rova burned remains an unresolved and highly contentious subject decades later.|$|E
30|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} {{was mentioned}} by 35 % (n =  7) of participants, typically when discussing the pain they experienced {{associated with their}} psoriasis. For some, psoriatic arthritis was {{the main source of}} pain they experienced. For the most part, participants experienced some level of pain or discomfort from their arthritis all of the time, with occasional <b>flare-ups.</b> During <b>flare-ups,</b> the pain would be severe or very severe. Psoriatic arthritis was experienced in the fingers, toes, wrists, and shoulders.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{study had}} twin objectives: {{to assess the}} {{incidence}} of <b>flare-ups</b> (a severe problem requiring an unscheduled visit and treatment) among patients who received endodontic treatment in the Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics in Vyas Dental college and hospital, Jodhpur {{during a period of}} one year, and also to examine the correlation with pre-operative and operative variables. Material and Methods: Data was collected from 1023 teeth from 916 patients who had received endodontic treatment over a 12 - month period. Information was obtained for each patient treated, including pulp and peri-radicular diagnosis for the tooth, presence of pre-operatory pain, type of medication being used, type of instrumentation technique used and number of appointments needed to complete the root canal treatment. Results: The results showed an incidence of 2. 35 % for <b>flare-ups</b> from 1023 endodontically treated teeth. Statistical analysis was done using the chi-square test. Conclusions: <b>Flare-ups</b> were found to be affected significantly by gender of patient, presence of radiolucent lesions, patients taking pre-operative analgesic or anti-inflammatory drugs and on type of instrumentation technique. In contrast, there was no correlation between <b>flare-ups</b> and age, different arch/tooth groups and single or multiple visit endodontics...|$|R

25|$|A {{greater impact}} {{than the actual}} casualties, {{according}} to Stephen W.

During the absence of Porter, McClellan was reluctant to move more of his troops south of the Chickahominy, making his left flank a more attractive target for Johnston. He was also confined to bed, ill with a <b>flare-up</b> of his chronic malaria.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Pain and/or {{swelling}} after instrumentation of a {{root canal}} constitute a significant complication during endodontic treatment. Despite {{a large number}} of articles discussing the causative factors behind endodontic <b>flare-ups,</b> the exact mechanism is still not understood. The Hypothesis: The seemingly irrational behavior of endodontic inter-appointment <b>flare-ups</b> may be due to sensitive dependence on initial conditions. A model based on Lorenz′ chaos theory is presented as a possible explanation for the sudden emergence and unpredictability of <b>flare-ups.</b> Evaluation of the Hypothesis: All studies agree on some common traits regarding inter-appointment flare-ups: Careful instrumentation can still cause flare-up; the host inflammatory response behaves as a complex nonlinear network; and also the poly-etiologic nature of this phenomenon all illustrate the sensitive dependence on initial conditions of the system. Integrating more variables (e. g., different species of bacteria) into this already complex system will make it increasingly chaotic reflecting its unpredictable behavior...|$|R
25|$|This truce was to {{last twenty}} years, until 1368. In this interval, the Kabeljauws {{delivered}} the countship to William V, who, {{as it turned}} out, came back mad {{from a trip to}} England in 1357. Thereupon his younger brother, Albert of Bavaria, was called to Holland to succeed him, which led to another <b>flare-up</b> in the civil war when a third brother, Louis the Roman, tried to take the countship for himself, {{with the support of the}} Hoek nobles.|$|E
25|$|William VI of Holland died on 31 May 1417, {{without having}} {{achieved}} anything else {{with regard to}} the Frisian war. His death caused a renewed <b>flare-up</b> of the Hoek and Kabeljauw troubles, when his younger brother John of Bavaria tried to take the countship, {{with the support of the}} Kabeljauws, from William's daughter Jacqueline of Bavaria, who had the support of the Hoeks, and was married to John IV, the duke of neighbouring Brabant. These circumstance made sure that the Frisian matter disappeared into the background again for the time being.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the first}} quarter of the 17th century saw a new <b>flare-up</b> in Kongo's {{political}} struggle. At the heart of the conflict were two noble houses fighting over the kingship. On one side of the conflict was the House of Kwilu, which counted most of the kings named Álvaro. They were ousted by the opposing House of Nsundi, when Pedro II was placed on the throne by powerful local forces in São Salvador, probably as a compromise when Álvaro III died without an heir old enough to rule.|$|E

40|$|Fibrodysplasia {{ossificans}} progressiva (FOP) is a {{rare disease}} characterized by the association of congenital bone abnormalities and extraskeletal ossification <b>flare-ups</b> occurring in muscles and fasciae. Early diagnosis is important to prevent ossification <b>flare-ups,</b> but some atypical presentations can lead to errors in diagnosis and therefore delay. Here, we report on a case of an atypical presentation of FOP in a girl, in whom prominent transverse reductional abnormalities delayed diagnosis. The patient developed extraskeletal ossifications and progressive fibrosis that led to motor restrictions. Since early diagnosis is important, we discuss the clinical presentations of FOP and the differential diagnoses...|$|R

25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} in itself painless. Many low-dose palliative {{treatments}} (for example, radiation therapy to bony metastases) cause minimal or no side effects, although short-term pain <b>flare-up</b> can be experienced {{in the days following}} treatment due to oedema compressing nerves in the treated area. Higher doses can cause varying side effects during treatment (acute side effects), in the months or years following treatment (long-term side effects), or after re-treatment (cumulative side effects). The nature, severity, and longevity of side effects depends on the organs that receive the radiation, the treatment itself (type of radiation, dose, fractionation, concurrent chemotherapy), and the patient.|$|E
25|$|The count's death plunged Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut into turmoil. William IV {{had been}} younger than 30 {{years of age}} when he died, {{and there was no}} heir. This meant the county reverted to his liege lord, the German emperor Louis the Bavarian, who enfeoffed his own wife, Margaret of Bavaria with it. Margaret was {{prepared}} to hand the three counties over to her son William, but only under certain preconditions. This led to a <b>flare-up</b> of the civil war between the Hoek and Kabeljauw parties, with the Kabeljauws trying to bring William V to the countship without any preconditions, while the Hoeks remained faithful to Margaret.|$|E
25|$|Cricket {{has also}} had a hand to play in {{sporting}} diplomacy. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General Zia ul-Haq, attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a <b>flare-up</b> in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 {{in the wake of}} diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.|$|E
