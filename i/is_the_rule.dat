25|$|Promissory {{estoppel}} is {{not available}} when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed.

25|$|One of {{the twin}} {{elements}} of natural justice <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> against bias or nemo iudex in causa sua, which means {{that no one should}} be a judge {{in his or her own}} cause. The rule ensures that decision-makers will not be biased or prejudiced in a way that precludes a genuine and fair consideration of the arguments or evidence presented by the parties. Bias may be actual, imputed or apparent.|$|E

25|$|It was {{pleasant}} {{to see the}} women riding alone on horseback, managing their mounts to perfection. They formed a sharp contrast to their Persian sisters, who either sit behind their husbands or have their steeds led by the bridle; and instead of keeping silence in public, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> for the shrouded women of Iran, these farmers' wives chaffered and haggled with {{the men in the}} bazar outside the city, transacting business with their veils thrown back.|$|E
25|$|Before Darwin, {{adaptation}} {{was seen}} as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing. Change <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> though much depends on the speed and degree of the change.|$|E
25|$|A {{candidate}} {{must have}} a plurality in five state delegations {{in order to be}} on the first ballot at national convention. For the purposes of these primaries, the five territories and D.C. are counted as states (Rule 27). This five-state rule is Rule No. 40 of the rules of the Republican Party as adopted by the 2008 Republican National Convention and amended by the Republican National Committee on August 6, 2010. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> outlining the way the convention will nominate the Republican candidate for president.|$|E

25|$|The term {{heartwood}} derives {{solely from}} its position {{and not from}} any vital importance to the tree. This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick sapwood <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Others never form heartwood.|$|E
25|$|They're both {{leaders and}} there's {{a lot of}} {{conflict}} between them. They are very supportive of one another when operating against a third party, but they also disagree with how things should be handled {{when it comes to}} crises. Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.|$|E
25|$|Another {{discovery}} was that resident killer whales {{have one of}} the most stable social structures of any animal species. Pods of killer whales had previously been assumed to consist of a few adult males and a harem of potential female mates. Bigg's team slowly realized that killer whale pods are matrilineal: killer whales travel not with their mates, but with their mothers and maternal relatives. The basis of resident killer whale groupings <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that each animal travels primarily with its mother throughout their lives.|$|E

25|$|One {{continuing}} controversy of {{the player}} selection process <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> that each team has {{to have at least}} one representative on its league's All-Star roster. Supporters of the rule point out that this prevents the large-market teams from totally dominating the squad, and keeps fan and media interest in the game, as fans would not be interested in the game if their team did not have any players involved. Opponents of the rule contend {{that the purpose of the}} game is to spotlight Major League Baseball's best players, and that some players from stronger teams are left off the roster in favor of possibly less deserving players from weaker teams.|$|E
25|$|France uses a civil legal system; that is, law arises {{primarily}} from written statutes; judges {{are not to}} make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law). Basic principles {{of the rule of}} law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: Freedom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality. That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.|$|E

500|$|The {{first rule}} of {{heraldry}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of tincture: [...] "Colour must not appear upon colour, nor metal upon metal." [...] The heraldic metals are gold and silver, usually represented as yellow and white, while red, green, blue, purple and black normally comprise the colors. Heraldic bearings are intended for recognition at a distance (in battle), and a contrast of light metal against dark color is desirable. The same principle {{can be seen in}} the choice of colors for most license plates.|$|E
500|$|The Court then discussed, on an obiter basis, the {{applicability}} of the Reynolds privilege to Singapore citizens. It held that the key question is whether or not, in the context of publication of matters of public interest, the rationale behind the Reynolds privilege ought to apply such that constitutional free speech <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> and restrictions on this right are the exception. In considering the factors relevant to the key question, Chan C.J. stated that whilst the court has the power to dictate the direction of the common law of defamation as adopted upon the enactment of the Constitution, Parliament still has overriding powers to limit the freedom of speech and expression where defamatory publications and statements are made: ...|$|E
500|$|Counsel for the {{respondent}} {{had argued that}} the right to free speech compelled the adoption of the real risk test. However, the Court declined to consider the matter as it had already decided to adopt the test, and since full arguments had not been made on the point. Nonetheless, Loh J. said that the courts had to define the offence [...] "consistently with the words, structure and spirit of Art 14, which clearly demand some kind of balance to be struck between the freedom of speech, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> and the offence of contempt, an exception to the rule. At the very minimum, neither can be defined {{in such a way that}} renders the other otiose." [...] He noted that {{the respondent}}'s counsel had not argued that the offence is inherently unconstitutional, and that a majority of cases had concluded that the real risk test, coupled with a right of fair criticism, is a reasonable limitation on free speech.|$|E
