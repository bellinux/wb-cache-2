50|$|Copper was {{the first}} metal in common use for tools and {{containers}} since {{it is one of}} the few metals available in non-oxidized form, not requiring the smelting of an ore. Copper is easily softened by heating and then cooling (it does not harden by quenching, as in cool water). In this annealed state it may then be hammered, stretched and otherwise formed, progressing toward the desired final shape, but becoming harder and less ductile as work progresses. If work continues beyond a certain hardness the metal will tend to fracture when worked and so it may be re-annealed periodically as the shape progresses. Annealing is stopped when the workpiece is near its final desired shape, and so the final product will have a desired stiffness and hardness. The technique of repoussé exploits these properties of copper, enabling the construction of durable <b>jewelry</b> <b>articles</b> and sculptures (including the Statue of Liberty).|$|R

[...] However, Venice's attention was diverted from her usual trade and maritime position by the delicate situation in Romagna, then one of the richest lands in Italy. Romagna was nominally part of the Papal States but effectively divided into a series of small lordships that were difficult for Rome's troops to control. Eager to take some of Venice's lands, all neighbouring powers joined in the League of Cambrai in 1508, under the leadership of Pope Julius II. The pope wanted Romagna, emperor Maximilian I Friuli and Veneto, Spain the Apulian ports, the king of France Cremona, the king of Hungary Dalmatia, and each of the others some part. The offensive against the huge army enlisted by Venice was launched from France. On 14 May 1509 Venice was crushingly defeated at the Battle of Agnadello, in the Ghiara d'Adda, marking one of the most delicate points of Venetian history. French and Imperial troops were occupying Veneto, but Venice managed to extricate herself through diplomatic efforts.

This concern has been conducted for the last twelve years by the present proprietors who have spared neither trouble nor expense to ensure the establishment of a superiority over every other in Europe, and to render it perfectly unique in its kind. This venture is described as having all of the basic characteristics of the department store; it was a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. All the major British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century. Increasingly, women became the major shoppers and middle-class households. Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne & Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal's, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser.

40|$|Amber is the fossilized resin or sap of {{pine trees}} which grew in forests around 45 - 100 million years ago. Amber {{is used for}} <b>jewelry</b> and {{decorative}} <b>articles</b> nowadays, {{but it was also}} used for healing and health enhancement in Eastern and Western countries in ancient times. In order to investigate the physiological effects of amber when burning it like incense, we analyzed the contingent negative variation(CNV) of electroencepha- lograms(EEG) and autonomic nervous activities such as respiratory interval, heart rate and fluctuation of heart beat interval. Amber {{used in the present study}} was mined in Kuji, Iwate Prefecture. Areas of CNV on 19 out of 23 recording spots were increased after amber incense stimulation. On the other hand, the well-known incense agalloch, i. e. Jinko, enhanced the area of CNV less effectively than amber incense. During CNV procedures, the respiratory interval was reduced and the heart rate was increased. These parameters were changed by amber incense. Reduction of amplitude in high frequency fluctuation of the heart rate, which may correspond to activities of the parasympathetic nervous system, was suppressed during exposure to amber incense. It is known that CNV represents activities of expectation, conation, motivation and attention in humans and activation of the parasympathetic activities induces relaxation in the human mind. These data suggested that amber incense enhanced expectation, conation, motivation and attention in humans, and also suggested that a stressful burden such as the CNV trial was alleviated by amber incense in the case of the present subject. 琥珀は、 4500 万～１億年前のマツ科植物の樹脂や樹液が化石化したものである。現在、琥珀は宝飾品や装飾品として使われているが、古代より洋の東西問わず癒しや健康増進のために使われてきた。琥珀をお香のように燻らせた時に、生体にいかなる生理作用があるかを調べるために、脳波随伴陰性変動（ＣＮＶ）及び自律神経活動を解析した。用いた琥珀は、岩手県久慈産である。琥珀のお香の刺激により、 23 ヶ所の脳波測定電極のうち、 19 ヶ所でＣＮＶ面積が増大した。一方、お香として良く知られる沈香の場合には、琥珀に比べＣＮＶ面積の増加はわずかであった。ＣＮＶ試行中に、呼吸数と心拍が増加した。これらの指標は、琥珀お香の刺激中に変化があった。心拍変動の高周波成分（副交感神経の活性）の減少が、琥珀お香の刺激中に抑制された。ＣＮＶは期待感、意志、動機や集中力の程度を表し、また副交感神経活性化はリラックス状態を誘導するとされている。以上の結果は、本研究の被験者において琥珀お香が生体における期待感、意志、動機や集中力を促進し、また琥珀お香の最中にはＣＮＶなどのストレス不負荷を軽減することができたことを示唆した...|$|R

This technique had obtained the citizenship in the Vatican by the establishment in 1587 of the mosaic school of the Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro, with the task of decorating the interior of the basilica and replaying in a non-perishable form the pictorial heritage. The objective of imitating painting had requested a specific technical research, aimed at obtaining an almost infinite chromatic range of enamels, able to simulate the results of the chromatic modulation obtained by brush. Despite this great technical skill, at the end of XVIII Century the completion of the works of decoration and reproduction threatened to leave unemployed the mosaicists of the school, which had been transformed in the institution of the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano. It happened, however, that two of the most skilled and renowned of them, Cesare Aguatti and Giacomo Raffaelli, devised the so-called technique of "spun enamel", consisting in re-melting and spinning of the vitreous enamel surface of the mosaic tiles, so as to obtain thin bars (1 millimeter in cross section). These could be segmented into tiles to compose tiny mosaics for inserting in wide range of items to serve as Italienreise souvenir: furnishings, such as coffee tables or fireplace coatings, or much smaller articles, such as snuff-boxes or jewelry. The ichonografic themes, which initially consisted mainly of classical antiquities, have gradually expanded to include depictions of the most popular urban places of Rome and then, since XIX Century, even of other cities - Milan, Naples, Venice – where, in the Napoleon’s Era, they tried to export the culture and know-how of the Roman Studio. Through time the iconographic repertoire has expanded in parallel with the chromatic experimentation, in which a milestone was the invention, about 1850, of the manufacturing technique of malmischiati, bars in which the color tones are variously shaded. In fact, if the production during whole the Eighteenth-Nineteenth-Centuries of engravings and urban views provided to mosacists a rich iconographic base for inspiration, we must not believe that this was a mere work of reproduction and virtuosity of craftsmanship, because the transition from the incision (usually in black and white) to the composition mosaic, introduces the color (which, in the extremely small size of the final image, is fully in charge of the perspective composition) an absolutely original factor, whose experimentation has allowed the Vatican Studio - today still hub of the production, preservation and study of the mosaic minute -getting to develop a range of 22000 different chromatic gradations...|$|R

The beginning phase of the micromosaic, coinciding with the last quarter of XVIII century, is dominated by the Giacomo Raffaelli’s personality, whose palette already included 872 different shades from 18 basic colors, among which predominates quantitatively the flesh-colored (over 800 bars) and the green color, with 77 different shades. The second phase, has been caracterized by the Antonio Aguatti’s invention of the so-called malmischiato, gradient tiles obtained by spinning of bars in variegated colors, that brings the art of micromosaic to its full maturity. The third phase started from the Michelangelo Barberi’s invention of the colori a soffio (colours by blowing), obtained by using in the spinning a weld lamp used by goldsmiths. These bars show colours with a particular vividness and a chromatic spectrum much broader than that obtained in furnace.
