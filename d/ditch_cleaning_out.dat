40|$|One {{fourth of}} the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry {{operations}} such as ditch network maintenance increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes {{an understanding of how}} forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning,</b> which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of ditch network maintenance. The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne fourth (5. 5 Mha) {{of forests}} in Finland are growing on peatlands {{that have been}} drained to improve forest growth. Forestry {{operations}} such as cuttings and ditch network maintenance in these areas may increase export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in receiving lakes and rivers. Mitigation of the deterioration calls for understanding how forest management operations affect peatland hydrology. A process-based simulation model FEMMA was applied to quantify the effects of ditch network maintenance on peatland water balance. The model has separate computation routines for evapotranspiration in tree stand and understorey vegetation, snow accumulation and melt, water movement in unsaturated and saturated soil, and drainage. Hydraulic characteristics of peat, as well as different drainage designs can be parameterised in the model. The model was applied in artificially delineated research catchments in northern Finland, where the ditch network was maintained by cleaning and digging the ditches deeper. The simulation results indicated that <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> affected the water balance slightly and the effect was dependent on stand characteristics and soil structure. When the growing stock volume was low and poorly conductive soil extended close to the soil surface, <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> increased evapotranspiration. In stands with a high stock volume and a thick topmost layer of highly conductive soil, evapotranspiration was less affected. In the study catchments, the effect of <b>ditch</b> <b>cleaning</b> on runoff was small compared to the error between measured and modelled runoff...|$|R

This study compare different concepts concerning machinery, namely two general-purpose excavators of different sizes, 8 tonnes and 15 tonnes, versus a dedicated machine constructed solely {{to deal with}} ditch-cleaning.
