40|$|The {{effect of}} varying {{sequences}} {{of red and}} far red light on sterol biosynthesis in etiolated seedlings of Digitalis purpurea L. was examined. Red light caused a marked increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of free and glycosidic sterols and a small decrease in esterified sterols during the first 4 hours after illumination. Far red light elicited the same response but to a lesser degree. Exposure to red followed by far red light or the reverse caused little or no increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of free and glycosidic sterols. The magnitude of <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> of sterols varied, depending upon <b>the</b> season <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> experiments were performed. The largest increments were obtained {{during the summer and}} fall, whereas the smallest were observed during the winter and spring.

40|$|Article 78 (a) VAT Directive {{clearly states}} that taxes, duties, levies and charges must be {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> taxable <b>amount</b> for VAT. <b>The</b> CJEU has substantially mitigated {{the scope of this}} rule.

A fair amount of uncertainty still exists as to the relation between Article 73, Article 78 (a) and Article 79 (c) VAT Directive is unclear. This interrelationship is the main topic of this article.
