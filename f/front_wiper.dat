25|$|The low {{belt line}} and window design afforded the driver with {{outstanding}} visibility. The Pacer had {{laminated safety glass}} in the windshield. The articulated <b>front</b> <b>wipers</b> were hidden when in their parked position, and a rear wiper and washer was optional.|$|R
50|$|The Austin Maestro {{emerged as}} the five-door {{hatchback}} variant. When the designs diverged, the Montego became project LM11 (the Maestro being LM10), and remained based on a lengthened version of the LC10s Volkswagen Golf style front MacPherson strut / rear twist beam chassis. The Montego received different front and rear styling following the replacement of designer David Bache with Roy Axe. It also featured body-coloured bumpers (as did the Maestro), and <b>front</b> <b>wipers</b> which hid themselves under the bonnet when parked.|$|R
50|$|Common rust {{locations}} on a 60 series Starlet {{are under the}} rear hatch seal, around the <b>front</b> window <b>wiper</b> mount, behind the front fenders and {{the bottom of the}} doors.|$|R

50|$|The central directable fascia vents {{could be}} heated and angled, {{so that they}} could be pointed {{directly}} at the windscreen in front of the driver, to keep it clear in extreme misting conditions. There was also an additional mid-level vent. The C15 also had height-adjustable halogen headlights, and multi-speed/intermittent <b>front</b> <b>wipers,</b> which was better than most commercial vehicles of the time. Early models had a single wide rear door, but this was awkward for loading in a tight space and prone to sagging or to snapping off in a high wind, so, after a year or two, only conventional two-door versions were sold with fold-back hinges.|$|R
2500|$|... 2009: Hatchbacks were redesigned. For the grille, it {{was made}} similar to the all new 2008 Chevrolet Malibu. New {{features}} included a new exterior and interior design, charcoal perforated leatherette seating surfaces, OnStar and standard on all models, available XM Satellite Radio, available leather-wrapped steering wheel wand shift knob are now included with perforated leatherette seating surface option, driver information system with outside temperature display and fuel economy/driving range function, new 15-inch, five-spoke aluminum wheels, GM Oil Life Monitoring System, 1.6-liter Ecotec DOHC 16-valve engine (107hp @ 6400 rpm, [...] of torque @ 3800 rpm), and five-speed manual transmission to include shift indicator light.

50|$|In the US and Canada, {{two models}} were offered; the base model GT {{and the higher}} {{performance}} GT-S. All models are in liftback only body shape. All models featured dual front airbags, daytime running lights (DRL) with auto-on parking and headlights, and 4 cup holders; two {{in the front and}} two in the rear. Power door lock and power window switches were mounted on the center console to reduce costs. Rear seats were contoured for only 2 passengers and can split down 50/50 to increase cargo capacity. Two-speed <b>front</b> <b>wipers</b> had variable intermittent adjustment. The rear wiper had a single speed and fixed intermittent speed. Windshield and rear window washers were also standard. In the interest of light weight, optional sunroof was made of polymer plastics instead of glass. In later models, the sunroof was made of glass, probably for cost reasons. Other options include ABS, rear spoiler, fog lights, HID low beam headlights, upgraded JBL stereo system, 6-disc CD changer, leather seat surfaces, side-impact airbags, floor mats, vehicle intrusion protection (VIP) alarms with door lock/unlock feature, cargo net, cold area package (heavy-duty battery and starter motor) and hatchback cargo cover.|$|R

Both <b>front</b> and rear <b>wipers</b> are speed-sensing, and wipe automatically when the car is moving at speed.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Vigor also benefited from Honda deciding to employ double-wishbones {{at both the}} front and rear endsâ€”a layout that spread to other Honda products in subsequent years. While more expensive than competitors' MacPherson strut systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small 4-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the JDM 2.0-Si model [...] ), larger 4-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models. Base model Vigors rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels. As established with the first generation car, the luxury content was also extensive in comparison to luxury equipment available from competitors at the time. Some of the items on the top level 2.0Si included a power tinted glass moonroof, optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, optional coloured LCD digital instruments (speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge and engine temperature), tilt steering with speed sensitive power steering, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, electronic AM/FM stereo radio with cassette and 4 speakers (high power) with subwoofer and amplifier, intermittent <b>front</b> <b>wipers</b> (variable), 4-Wheel disc brakes (front: 2 piston calipers with ventilated front discs), and optional leather interior.|$|R

The original concept has been {{taken into account in}} particular the ease of operation. Front narrow pillars and lower door sash, with a large integrated triangle window in the front doors, a <b>front</b> windshield <b>wiper</b> review of the side front position, the waistline and front passenger outward view optimization, adoption of the rear quarter windows, the size of the tailgate window and rear seat review of the shape of the seat back, the embedded headlight inclusion, have improved the appearance of the front side and rear view over the previous generation.|$|R

50|$|In 1975 the Mark 3 {{version was}} {{launched}} with another frontal facelift. The front grill had horizontal louvres {{giving it a}} modern feel and a round profile indicator lamp now isolated from the grill. At the rear a more modern looking number plate bezel replaced the early design which was commonly used by many other British cars as well. The interior now had a new dashboard with 3 standard instruments mounted on a black recessed mesh again {{moving away from the}} early coated wooden base with aluminium strip design. By 1978, the Mark 3 was available in its Standard and Deluxe versions. The Deluxe version had a newer dashboard with four meters plus the speedometer. Just before the launch of the Mark 4, the Mark 3's had their <b>front</b> windscreen <b>wiper</b> configuration changed, with a common direction sweep for both wipers.This configuration was prevalent in the new Ambassadors till the end. This has a short span of less than 3 years in production before being replaced with a Mark - IV model in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Isuzu {{commissioned}} Giorgetto Giugiaro {{to design}} a new sporty car to replace the 117 Coupe (also a Giugiaro design). They delivered several T Series Chevettes (developed in 1973 in South America) to the Italdesign studio in Italy and allowed Giugiaro free rein over the design. The result of this effort was the wedge-shaped three-door hatchback called the Asso di Fiori ("Ace of Clubs") prototype and show car. It was shown at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show to rave reviews. Giugiaro referred to the design as his fifth [...] "Copernican revolution", integrating the design innovations of many different previous designs into one, mass producible, vehicle. Within 48 hours of its unveiling at the Tokyo Motor Show, Isuzu fast tracked the vehicle into production with minimal changes to the design. Items that remained were the single blade <b>front</b> windshield <b>wiper,</b> and an integrated steering wheel adjustment that also moved the instrument cluster, with wiper controls and exterior lighting controls installed just {{behind the steering wheel}} on either side.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda Legend was {{introduced}} for the 1987 model {{year and was}} virtually identical in equipment offered and vehicle dimensions to the North American model, with one trim designation called the V6-2.5i. This means very few options were available other than the choice of transmission, and an air conditioning system identical to the North American version. The Europeans were offered an optional [...] "Special Equipment Pack" [...] that offered cruise control, aluminium alloy wheels, a driver's seat with power lumbar support, height, fore/aft and reclining adjusters, adjustable rear headrests, a 4 speaker stereo system provided by Philips and headlight <b>wipers.</b> <b>Front</b> and rear mud flaps were standard in undisclosed countries but not all.

2500|$|The {{introductory}} 1974 Gremlins became unique {{by incorporating}} the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, folding bench seats, two-point <b>front</b> seatbelts, electric <b>wipers</b> and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Australian Government's [...] "Green Car Innovation Fund", Toyota {{received}} a 35million grant in June 2008 to guarantee the commencement of local production of the hybrid powertrain Camry. Prior to release, Toyota Australia displayed an official concept model, the [...] "HC-CV" [...] (Hybrid Camry Concept Vehicle) at the 2009 Melbourne International Motor Show. The [...] "HC-CV" [...] is distinguished from the facelifted Hybrid Camry design from which it is based by {{the inclusion of a}} modified front-end fascia, redesigned wheels and side skirts, a custom rear spoiler, and leather upholstery incorporating the [...] "Hybrid Synergy Drive" [...] logo. Full-scale production began on 11 December 2009, after a small batch of pre-production vehicles were produced from 31 August. Toyota released the Hybrid Camry for sales in Australia during February 2010, with plans to sell an estimated 10,000 units per year. After its release, the Hybrid Camry became the first Australian-built vehicle to be rated the top five star grading on the Australian Government's [...] "Green Vehicle Guide".
