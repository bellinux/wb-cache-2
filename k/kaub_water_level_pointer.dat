We show that the problem of precise interprocedural type determination is NP-hard in the presence of inheritance, virtual functions and pointers.

30|$|The Mw 9.3 great Sumatra-Andaman {{earthquake}} of December 26, 2004 induced <b>water</b> <b>level</b> {{changes in}} Fairbanks, Alaska, at an epicentral distance of 10, 800 km. Spike like <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes {{followed by a}} step of <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rise were observed in at least four wells. We modeled the timing and magnitude of the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rise {{using a combination of}} a linear trend and a step function. We calculated the misfit between the observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises and our model by systematically shifting the timing of occurrence of step in <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> The minimum value of cumulative misfit suggested the timing of occurrence of steps. A previous study showed persistent <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises in all these wells from the 2002 Denali fault earthquake and it’s major aftershocks. From those observations, we developed an empirical relationship between <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes, epicentral distances and earthquake magnitude. This relationship attributed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes in the wells to ground shaking by seismic waves. The estimated average <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes due to the Sumatra earthquake using that relationship was in agreement with the observed <b>water</b> <b>level</b> changes. Thus we concluded that ground shaking in Fairbanks, induced by surface waves from the Sumatra earthquake was sufficient to change <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R

To better {{prepare for the}} future, coastal engineers and managers need accurate estimates of average exceedance probabilities for extreme <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> In this paper, we estimate present day probabilities of extreme <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> around the entire coastline of Australia. Tides and storm surges generated by extra-tropical storms were included by creating a 61 -year (1949 - 2009) hindcast of <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> using a high resolution depth averaged hydrodynamic model driven with meteorological data from a global reanalysis. Tropical cyclone-induced surges were included through numerical modelling of a database of synthetic tropical cyclones equivalent to 10, 000 years of cyclone activity around Australia. Predicted <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data was analysed using extreme value theory to construct return period curves for both the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> hindcast and synthetic tropical cyclone modelling. These return period curves were then combined by taking the highest <b>water</b> <b>level</b> at each return period. 11 page(s...|$|R
