5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them unfair, while others argue he meant that the common law courts <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|The first, original, {{and truly}} natural {{boundaries}} of states are beyond doubt their internal boundaries. Those who {{speak the same}} language are joined to each other by a multitude of invisible bonds by nature herself, long before any human art begins; they understand each other and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of continuing to make themselves understood more and more clearly; they belong together and are by nature one and an inseparable whole.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to create storms, but when the weather is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the {{execution}} of a commission for the Hospital de Tavera, El Greco fell seriously ill, and a month later, on 7 April 1614, he died. A few days earlier, on 31 March, he had directed that his son should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to make his will. Two Greeks, friends of the painter, witnessed this last will and testament (El Greco never lost touch with his Greek origins). He was buried in the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, aged 73.|$|E

5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power {{has not been}} exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is {{an exception to the}} general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|In Ocarina of Time, {{the player}} {{controls}} the playable character Link {{in the land}} of Hyrule. Link sets out on a quest to stop Ganondorf, king of the Gerudo tribe, from obtaining the Triforce, a sacred relic that grants the wishes of its holder. He travels through time and navigates various dungeons to awaken the sages, who <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to seal Ganondorf away forever. Music plays an important role: To progress, the player must learn to play several songs on an ocarina. The game was responsible for increased interest in and sales of the instrument.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to create severe storms, {{but when the}} weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the days}} of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 {{with the opening of the}} General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological {{struggle}} over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared PedroI's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported PedroI's government and the Liberal Party advocated Liberalism, and thus constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{is based}} in three {{different}} cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly {{in the world with}} more than one meeting place {{and one of the few}} that does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to decide its own location.|$|E
5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline inspection system mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to prosecute, {{it is supposed to}} transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E
50|$|Section 177A {{creates a}} {{commission}} on judicial performance, which <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to recommend removal of any judge below the Supreme Court (however, only the Supreme Court can order such removal), and also <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> {{to remove a}} Supreme Court judge upon 2/3 vote.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{changes to}} a garden, with fountains and birds, where Rinaldo and Almirena are celebrating their love. They are {{interrupted}} as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword {{to defend his}} lover, but a black cloud descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns {{the loss of his}} loved one. When Goffredo and Eustazio arrive they comfort Rinaldo, and propose they visit a Christian magician who may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to save Almirena. Rinaldo, left alone, prays for strength.|$|E
5|$|Within {{their limited}} jurisdictions, {{municipalities}} are autonomous, responsible and accountable to their citizens, to the province and their future {{residents in the}} case for the unpopulated Jumbo Glacier Mountain Resort Municipality. Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. They <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of a natural person, the power to expropriate, and the power to establish and enforce bylaws. They are able to raise funds through property taxes and user fees, and borrow a limited amount through the Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia to pay for capital costs.|$|E

50|$|Charmed {{focuses on}} the lives of three Halliwell sisters, Prue (Shannen Doherty), Piper (Holly Marie Combs) and Phoebe (Alyssa Milano), as they deal with their grandmother's death and learn that they {{inherited}} a little more than the house they grew up in. All three of them have inherited magic powers; Prue <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of telekinesis, Piper <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to freeze, and Phoebe <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of premonition. Together they try to live everyday normal lives in San Francisco, while battling demons and warlocks, and keeping their supernatural identities a secret.|$|R
5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this was what the prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point}} in killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E
5|$|Between 2006 and 2007, Texas spent $7,275 {{per pupil}} ranking it below the {{national}} average of $9,389. The pupil/teacher ratio was 14.9, {{below the national}} average of 15.3. Texas paid instructors $41,744, {{below the national average}} of $46,593. The Texas Education Agency (TEA) administers the state's public school systems. Texas has over 1,000 school districts- all districts except the Stafford Municipal School District are independent from municipal government and many cross city boundaries. School districts <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to tax their residents and to assert eminent domain over privately owned property. Due to court-mandated equitable school financing for school districts, the state has a controversial tax redistribution system called the"Robin Hood plan". This plan transfers property tax revenue from wealthy school districts to poor ones. The TEA has no authority over private or home school activities.|$|E
5|$|Committees are {{designed}} to assist the Senate as a whole. Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination, and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter. These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings, but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session. Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process. To gather their evidence committees can (with exceptions) travel {{from place to place}} to hear evidence. Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses (powers that are in practice used very sparingly). Most evidence taken by committees (both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings) is published, however committees <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to take evidence confidentially (in camera), and regularly do so. Committees hold both public hearings and conduct business at private meetings. The minutes of private meetings are confidential (in contrast, for example, to those of New South Wales parliamentary committees).|$|E
