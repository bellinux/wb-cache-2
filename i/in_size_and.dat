5|$|A bulk carrier, bulk freighter, or bulker is a {{merchant}} ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo, such as grains, coal, ore, and cement in its cargo holds. Since the first specialized bulk carrier {{was built in}} 1852, economic forces have fuelled {{the development of these}} ships, causing them to grow <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> sophistication. Today's bulkers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect {{is that as}} atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} bridge, {{the second most}} popular form of {{transportation}} is the kayuco (hollowed-out tree canoe). Kayucos range <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> styles.

50|$|In the past, sample {{sales were}} {{a way for}} {{retailers}} to sell their items which were used in advanced showings, fashion shows, and presentations for interested buyers. These samples were often very limited <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> quantities due to the purpose the items served, but present day sample sales are often much larger <b>in</b> both <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> selection. Some of the items sold at sample sales are from previous seasons, overstocked items, returned, or were never sold in stores.|$|R

5|$|After {{the start}} of the war, Himmler {{intensified}} the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> {{some details of}} tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is known from 35teeth found in a single fossil site, which is probably 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, {{the valley}} floor is {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders of various sizes and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley.

For the remaining 5 / 17 trials no lag was observed between the changes <b>in</b> pupil <b>size</b> <b>and</b> lens accommodation indicating that this correlation does not arise {{as a consequence}} of a near response. These observations suggest that under conditions of constant illumination and far fixation, the supranuclear centers controlling the near response are not active...|$|R

5|$|Caterpillars undergo ecdysis {{and have}} a number of larval instars, usually five but varying between species. The new cuticle is soft and allows the {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> development of the caterpillar before becoming hard and inelastic. In the last ecdysis, the old cuticle splits and curls up into a small ball at the posterior end of the pupa and is known as the larval exuvia.|$|E
5|$|Drosera, {{commonly}} known as the sundews, {{is one of the largest}} genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species. These members of the family Droseraceae lure, capture, and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces. The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow. Various species, which vary greatly <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>and</b> form, are native to every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
