25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} {{there would have}} to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide)</b> could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|E
25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} {{ordinary}} Portland cement (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour requires high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxide</b> (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E

Researcher Jacques di Costanzo, noting that the Shroud image {{seems to have a}} three-dimensional quality, suggested that perhaps the image was formed using a three-dimensional object, such as a sculpture. While wrapping a cloth around a life-sized statue would result in a distorted image, placing a cloth over a bas-relief would result in an image like the one seen on the shroud.

30|$|The {{elemental}} mass changes (Table  1) are {{coupled to}} {{the stability of}} the key host minerals in the BPS (Figure  4). The loss of SiO 2 and C corresponds to the decrease of quartz and the consumption of carbonaceous material, respectively. The loss of K 2 O, Rb, and Ba is correlated with the decrease of muscovite. The gain of Na 2 O and MgO reflects the increase of albite and chlorite, respectively. In outcrop 1, the gain of CaO and Sr is comparable with the increase of epidote [see Additional file 1 : Table S 1]. Some immobile components such as TiO 2, Y, Nb, La, Ce, and Nd are probably held in titanite that remains stable. The mass change of total iron is inconsistent with the modal change.

Yet {{little is known about}} the polishing principle that occurs during the employment of electro-chemical process of metal bonded grinding wheels. At the same time especially the use of grinding wheels with ferrous binding shows an additional aspect when grinding glass. The electrolytic reaction produces metal oxides, particularly iron oxides. These materials have a long history in the manufacturing process of glass lenses. Since early days glass was polished with metal oxides. However, while today CeO 2 is meant to be state-of-the-art <b>ferrous</b> <b>oxides</b> known as rouge were used until few decades ago. Indeed, the iron oxides produced in the electrolytic process of ELID can have a special polishing effect on the components made of glass.

As the polishing process of surfaces up to optical quality takes the biggest amount of time of the entire production chain, EGPG permits a considerable reduction of time and cost in producing of glass products with ultra precise optical surfaces. Especially in the manufacturing procedures of aspheric glass lenses production the conventional polishing steps contain enormous technological challenges and take up to 70 % of production time.
