25|$|Twenty-five {{distinct}} vocalisations are recognised, many {{of which}} are used primarily for <b>group</b> <b>communication</b> within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are {{the most common form of}} intragroup communication.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{storytelling}} has a broad purview. In {{addition to}} its traditional forms (fairytales, folktales, mythology, legends, fables etc.), it has extended itself to representing history, personal narrative, political commentary and evolving cultural norms. Contemporary storytelling is also widely used to address educational objectives. New forms of media are creating new ways for people to record, express and consume stories. Tools for asynchronous <b>group</b> <b>communication</b> can provide an environment for individuals to reframe or recast individual stories into group stories. Games and other digital platforms, such as those used in interactive fiction or interactive storytelling, {{may be used to}} position the user as a character within a bigger world. Documentaries, including interactive web documentaries, employ storytelling narrative techniques to communicate information about their topic. Self-revelatory stories, created for their cathartic and therapeutic effect, are growing in their use and application, as in Psychodrama, Drama Therapy and Playback Theatre.|$|E

UCSB's Department of Communication has been ranked No. 3 in the nation in terms of research productivity, according to a recent analysis of scholarly articles that have appeared in eight academic journals sponsored by the National Communication Association and the International Communication Association. In addition, UCSB's Department of Communication has been named One of the Top High Impact Departments in the nation.|$|E
2500|$|Waldeck et al. {{concluded}} that the theory needs to better predict outcomes, rather than merely explaining them. Decision rules support decision-making, which produces a communication pattern that can be directly observable. Research has not yet examined the [...] "rational" [...] function of <b>group</b> <b>communication</b> and decision-making (i.e., how well it achieves goals), nor structural production or constraints. Researchers must empirically demonstrate the recursivity of action and structure, examine how structures stabilize and change over time due to <b>group</b> <b>communication,</b> and may want to integrate argumentation research.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system of}} group diving, {{where a group}} of {{tourists}} are taken on a sightseeing tour of a dive site by a dive leader and [...] "sheepdog" [...] assistant, who brings up the rear and herds the stragglers, is often practiced when the visibility is sufficient for it to be practicable. The divers in such groups may be entirely unfamiliar with each other. In this system, especially in large groups, poor visibility or strong currents, the weak, inexperienced, or inattentive individual divers can easily become detached from the group and lose the protection of stronger or more competent divers in the <b>group.</b> <b>Communication</b> is often difficult in these groups leading to increased risk.|$|E

40|$|People collaborating {{in groups}} have {{potential}} to produce higher-quality output than individuals working alone, {{due to the}} pooling of resources, information, and skills.

This thesis proposes that technology in face-to-face settings {{can be used to}} address the social factors that have damaging influence on group decision-making processes. While there is much work in the area of collaborative software and groupware, this work differentiates itself with its specific aim to influence the way a group shares information without mediating the <b>group's</b> <b>communication.</b> By presenting visualizations to the group of individual levels of participation and turn-taking behavior, the technology aims to augment the <b>group's</b> <b>communication</b> ability, by making it more aware of imbalances.

2500|$|Many {{sturgeon}} leap {{completely out}} the water, usually making a loud splash {{which can be}} heard {{half a mile away}} on the surface and probably further under water. It is not known why they do this, but suggested functions include <b>group</b> <b>communication</b> to maintain group cohesion, catching airborne prey, courtship display, or to help shed eggs during spawning. Other plausible explanations include escape from predators, shedding parasites, or to gulp or expel air. [...] Another explanation is that it [...] "simply feels good".

2500|$|Moreno {{developed}} a specific and highly structured form of group therapy known as psychodrama (although the entry on psychodrama claims {{it is not}} a form of group therapy). Another recent development in the theory and method of group psychotherapy based on an integration of systems thinking is Yvonne Agazarian's systems-centered therapy (SCT), which sees groups functioning within the principles of system dynamics. Her method of [...] "functional subgrouping" [...] introduces a method of organizing <b>group</b> <b>communication</b> so it is less likely to react counterproductively to differences. SCT also emphasizes the need to recognize the phases of group development and the defenses related to each phase in order to best make sense and influence group dynamics.|$|E

A display revealing real-time participation levels caused those {{at the highest levels of}} participation to decrease the amount they spoke. Viewing a visualization of previous turn-taking patterns caused those who spoke the least to increase the amount they spoke in a subsequent discussion; real-time feedback did not produce this change. Additionally, after reviewing their turn-taking patterns, groups altered their information-sharing strategies. (cont.) For groups that had poor sharing strategies on an initial task, this change improved their ability to share information related to the decision; for those who did not need intervention, feedback on turn-taking was not beneficial for their subsequent information sharing. The central finding of this research is that displays of social information, viewed during or after a meeting, bring about changes in a <b>group's</b> <b>communication</b> style, highlighting the potential for such displays to improve real-world decision-making. by Joan Morris DiMicco.
