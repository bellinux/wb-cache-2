5|$|There were 10 gunmen, nine of {{whom were}} {{subsequently}} shot dead and one captured by security forces. Witnesses reported that {{they seemed to be}} in their early twenties, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and that they smiled and looked <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> they shot their victims.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially <b>happy,</b> <b>as</b> he had been prone to motion sickness {{as a child and}} could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had all worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
5|$|Rudraveena is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} cult films in the careers of Balachander and Shobana. In an interview with Rediff.com in April 1997, Chiranjeevi stated that he opted to act in Rudraveena for an image makeover. He added that despite its failure, the film made him <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> it had inspired many villages in Andhra Pradesh. During his tenure as the president of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam visited Chiranjeevi's Eye & Blood Bank (CEBB) in June 2006 and expressed his appreciation for the initiative; the actor recalled the day when he ruled out the climax of Rudraveena ever happening in real life.|$|E
5|$|This was Chopra's first action role, and she {{was excited}} to the part, so {{she wanted to do}} all the stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, in the role of Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E

25|$|The local German command {{seems to}} have {{tried to keep the}} {{civilian}} population as <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> possible, letting them govern themselves, paying them for work done and not enacting too many draconian orders sent over from France. Resistance activity by islanders would not be tolerated, however. Punishment of the guilty served as a deterrent to others.|$|E

Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school. Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in University or dating in Nightlife. In Nightlife, each date {{is a challenge to}} keep both Sims as <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> possible while accumulating aspiration points.

Mirza accused the All India Tennis Association (AITA) of using her as 'bait' to keep Paes <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> she wanted to play with Bhupathi, with whom she has won 2 grand slams. In the end, Mirza was paired with Paes and the pair lost in the quarterfinals of the mixed doubles.|$|E

25|$|After {{destroying}} the entire Pandava camp, Ashwatthama proceeds towards Duryodana with the cut-off {{heads of the}} Upapandavas. He told Duryodhana that he only managed to kill the Pandava's children as the Pandavas were not there, and this makes Duryodhana <b>happy,</b> <b>as</b> that means the Pandava lineage would die out. Duryodhana then, having heard the news that was so agreeable to his heart, regained his senses and praised Ashwatthama for achieving what Bhishma, Drona, and Karna had failed to accomplish. Duryodhana died happily with a smile in his face. At the same time, Sanjaya loses his divine sight, {{which he had been}} using to update Duryodhana's father Dhritarashtra.|$|E

Guðrún responded that her mother should not be so eager to giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and tear out the heart of Högni. Grímhildr began to weep when she heard the prophecy and told Guðrún that she was forced to give her away to Atli.|$|E
25|$|In early 1975 the merged group began rehearsing for In Praise of Learning in a {{freezing}} gymnasium. It was {{an arduous}} and extremely demanding time, something Slapp Happy {{were not prepared}} for, and it soon {{became apparent that the}} merger might not work. Nevertheless, they still went to The Manor and made In Praise of Learning together. But it was only after they started rehearsing with a view to performing live together that it became clear that their approaches were incompatible. The merger ended in April 1975, when Anthony Moore quit and Peter Blegvad was asked to leave. However, Dagmar Krause, whose contribution had added another dimension to Henry Cow's sound, elected to remain, which effectively spelled the end of Slapp <b>Happy</b> <b>as</b> a band.|$|E

25|$|<b>Happy</b> <b>as</b> {{commissioned}} in July 1754 under post-captain Edward Jekyll. Britain {{had been}} at peace {{since the end of}} the War of the Austrian Succession six years earlier, but the waters around England remained heavily populated with privateers. Happy was therefore assigned to patrol the Bristol Channel in order to protect local merchant craft. In May 1756 Happys command was transferred to newly promoted post-captain Thomas Burnett. Under Burnett's leadership the vessel made her first capture, seizing Le Renard, a 14-gun French privateer, on 18 February 1757. Burnett left the sloop in May 1757 and was replaced by Commander John Rushworth, who was granted permission to take the vessel cruising along the coasts of England in search of privateers and prize money.|$|E
25|$|Joy (Yellow Heart) - Peach {{becomes very}} <b>happy</b> <b>as</b> if walking on air, which {{allows her to}} slowly ascend in a small tornado, gust fogs and clouds, turn windmills, push down fountains, hit blocks above her and blow enemies away. With this power, she can float in the wind in some stages. She can also use it to break open flying bags that contain mostly coins and {{sometimes}} hearts and vibe crystals, splash bits of Blooper's ink thrown in the air, spin Kamek's head and slow down her falls as an easy use. However, some areas feature spores that stop her flying abilities, requiring more traditional platform methods to reach, but she can go up platforms that are vertically close.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} P. R. Brown, and released on November 7, 2016. The video reflects the song's central theme of being in unsettled situations and getting through them. In {{the beginning of the}} video, Armstrong is shown as a solitary figure; his bandmates Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are sitting lethargically in a different location. The video explores situations of various other characters as well, all starting out in a dejected state. The shots of Armstrong, Dirnt, and Cool are repeatedly seen interspersed with developments {{in the lives of the}} other characters. Eventually, all of them manage to find things that make them <b>happy.</b> <b>As</b> the video reaches its end, Armstrong is seen entering a warehouse and being happily reunited with his bandmates, who had begun to play their instruments.|$|E
