60|$|Roger {{looked at}} her in her morning ugliness. He had not really seen her <b>for</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>Now</b> she smote on his {{tortured}} senses, so long drugged with beauty, like a physical blow. He suddenly burst into a laughter that frightened her.|$|E
60|$|Helen rose to tiptoe {{across the}} floor, and, softly parting some curtains, {{she looked into}} the room where her uncle lay. He was asleep. Sometimes he called out in his slumbers. <b>For</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>now</b> he had been {{confined}} to his bed, slowly growing weaker. With a sigh Helen returned to her window-seat and took up her work.|$|E
60|$|He {{and that}} pale-face aristocrat had <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>now,</b> months, or years perhaps, conspired against the Republic, against the Revolution, {{which had been}} made by a people thirsting for liberty. During these months and years he had talked to them, and they had listened; he had poured forth treasures of eloquence, cajoled them, as he had done just now.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have been}} {{plotting}} something <b>for</b> a <b>week</b> <b>now,</b> and to-day they seem particularly full of it. All alike; they insult {{me with their}} secrecy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I help it? I {{have lived}} {{under the same}} roof with her <b>for</b> three <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> I have begun to {{understand}} what a saint is like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anne," [...] {{he said in}} {{a muffled}} voice. [...] "I don't feel like praying after all. I haven't felt like it <b>for</b> a <b>week</b> <b>now.</b> I--I DIDN'T pray last night nor the night before." ...|$|R
6000|$|Smoke, {{scooping}} {{the light}} snow away with mittened hands, paused to consider, scooped again, and again paused. [...] "No," [...] he decided. [...] "There's been travel both ways, {{but the last}} travel was up that creek. Whoever they are, they're there now--certain. There's been no travel <b>for</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>Now</b> what's been keeping them there all the time? That's what I want to know." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>now</b> Madame Guillotine {{had been}} much {{occupied}} plying her gruesome trade; she now {{stood there in the}} gloom, passive and immovable, seeming to wait placidly for the end of this holiday, ready to begin her work again on the morrow. She towered above these merrymakers, hoisted up on the platform whereon many an innocent foot had trodden, the tattered basket beside her, into which many an innocent head had rolled.|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt was precinct-leader on Floral Heights, but his {{district}} was safe and he longed for stouter battling. His convention paper {{had given him}} the beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the Republican-Democratic Central Committee sent him to the Seventh Ward and South Zenith, to address small audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with their new votes. He acquired a fame enduring <b>for</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>Now</b> and then a reporter was present at one of his meetings, and the headlines (though they were not very large) indicated that George F. Babbitt had addressed Cheering Throng, and Distinguished Man of Affairs had pointed out the Fallacies of Doane. Once, in the rotogravure section of the Sunday Advocate-Times, there was a photograph of Babbitt and a dozen other business men, with the caption [...] "Leaders of Zenith Finance and Commerce Who Back Prout." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I grant thee pardon," [...] {{said the}} knight, [...] "but tell thee plainly, an thou dost face me so again, I will truly send thee {{to the black}} cell <b>for</b> a <b>week.</b> <b>Now</b> get thee away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Do {{you mean}} to say that you have done them all! Why, it would have taken me all my evenings <b>for</b> a <b>week.</b> <b>Now,</b> hand me the books; it is best to do things ship-shape." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{the counter}} {{of the front}} room stood a tall man, who was also speaking, when they emerged. He said to the youth in attendance, 'I will take my paper <b>for</b> this <b>week</b> <b>now</b> I am here, so that you needn't post it to me.' ...|$|R
60|$|Hetty, in her red {{cloak and}} warm bonnet, with her basket in her hand, is turning towards a gate {{by the side}} of the Treddleston road, but not that she may have a more {{lingering}} enjoyment of the sunshine and think with hope of the long unfolding year. She hardly knows that the sun is shining; and <b>for</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>now,</b> when she has hoped at all, it has been for something at which she herself trembles and shudders. She only wants to be out of the high-road, that she may walk slowly and not care how her face looks, as she dwells on wretched thoughts; and through this gate she can get into a field-path behind the wide thick hedgerows. Her great dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who is desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a brave tender man. But there are no tears in them: her tears were all wept away in the weary night, before she went to sleep. At the next stile the pathway branches off: there are two roads before her--one along by the hedgerow, which will by and by lead her into the road again, the other across the fields, which will take her much farther out of the way into the Scantlands, low shrouded pastures where she will see nobody. She chooses this and begins to walk a little faster, as if she had suddenly thought of an object towards which it was worth while to hasten. Soon she is in the Scantlands, where the grassy land slopes gradually downwards, and she leaves the level ground to follow the slope. Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she is making her way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a dark shrouded pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs of the elder-bushes lie low beneath the water. She sits down on the grassy bank, against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over the dark pool. She has thought of this pool often in the nights of the month that has just gone by, and now at last she is come to see it. She clasps her hands round her knees, and leans forward, and looks earnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it would make for her young round limbs.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, Westport was a fashionable resort town. Its social scene was {{regularly}} reported on in The New York Times {{and by the}} Boston press. Like many other East Coast resorts, its popularity gradually declined, starting in the 1930s, as first automobiles and then airplanes made possible a wider selection of vacation sites. Since the 1950s, however, Westport's lakeshore property has steadily increased in value. Although once most of the [...] "summer people" [...] stayed <b>for</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>now</b> distinctions are not as clear: there are [...] "year-round summer people" [...] whose livelihood stems from outside Westport, weekenders whose principal residence is fairly close by (for example, Albany, which is two hours distant by car), and commuters to workplaces as distant as Plattsburgh, New York, or Middlebury, Vermont.|$|E
40|$|For {{weeks we}} have been sitting here in this position. The {{camouflage}} nets have been draped over each vehicle, looking like a nightmare out of the Arabian Nights, <b>for</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> Everything has a harried, slovenly look, but maybe it 2 ̆ 7 s {{because this is a}} 2 ̆ 2 secret 2 ̆ 2 position. When we were ordered up here, it was under the heaviest cloak of secrecy. All identification was removed from the trucks, each man was inspected for any signs of which outfit he belonged to; they went through our clothing for addresses or cards. This was big, we had been told. We were to cross the Ruhr River and then it shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t be too long before the Germans caught onto how useless it was to try to keep on fighting...|$|E
50|$|On 5 January, Gillingham {{announced}} that Samuel has extended his stay at Priestfield <b>for</b> another three <b>weeks,</b> <b>now</b> available <b>for</b> the Gills until January 28.|$|R
2500|$|... "Aki the Akita", Nisei Week's {{official}} mascot, {{was created}} by renowned mascot artist Dick Sakahara in 1997 <b>for</b> Nisei <b>Week's</b> <b>now</b> defunct Dog Show [...] Aki appears as a costumed character to greet and entertain children, or in cartoon form as a symbol for the festival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always," [...] was the answer, [...] "by day, {{and four}} nights out of five. We {{have not had}} so quiet a time as last night <b>for</b> a <b>week.</b> <b>Now</b> I will go and ask the chief to which {{garrison}} {{you and your brother}} are to be assigned." ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{commercial}} world quality {{has to do}} with survival. But why should a nonprofit organisation operating in the health service need to establish service differentials with its competition in order to survive? Why bother to compete when people are queuing up for this service? These questions arise because some people consider it strange to spend resources on marketing a school or a hospital in Ireland. However, since the birth rate in Ireland has dropped, there are fewer pupils enrolling particularly in rural west of Ireland schools. The schools for the first time are competing for pupils and seek to avoid closure by encouraging more pupils through extra courses. Equally, some hospitals in Ireland are under threat of closure at the present time. If they had understood this threat five or ten years ago, a strategy of excellence in performance in patient care in a particular area of treatment might have protected them. An example of such excellence is a small hospital in Dublin which offers a specialist service and which was threatened with closure. One of the ways it avoided closure was to open a day care centre, to pioneer a five day service and provide services to patients specifically for the convenience of patients but not necessarily for staff. Most patients required once daily treatment. In the past this often meant occupying a bed in the hospital <b>for</b> <b>weeks.</b> <b>Now</b> patients can get their treatment at 8. 00 a. m. before going to work...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well said, Captain Barclay; well said, indeed. I believe I may {{say that}} {{everyone}} here agrees with you, entirely. There are too many officers continually absent from the army upon 'private affairs;' and those of Monsieur Desmaret have taken longer to arrange than usual, for he has been staying here <b>for</b> five <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R
60|$|But he {{had gone}} away again as {{suddenly}} as he had come, and <b>for</b> six <b>weeks</b> <b>now</b> she had lived partly {{in anticipation of the}} courier with messages from him, and partly on the fitful joy engendered by these messages. To-day she had not even that, and the disappointment seemed just now more than she could bear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like Pony's {{going with}} Jim Leonard so much. He's had nobody else with him <b>for</b> two <b>weeks,</b> and <b>now</b> he's sitting {{with him in}} school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll go as escort. The {{doctor has}} been wanting {{me to leave}} <b>for</b> a <b>week,</b> and <b>now</b> I 've no desire to stay," [...] he said eagerly.|$|R
60|$|Winnifred ate the herring, {{her heart}} filled with gratitude. With renewed {{strength}} she sallied {{forth on the}} street to resume her vain search for employment. <b>For</b> two <b>weeks</b> <b>now</b> Winnifred Clair had sought employment even of the humblest character. At various dress-making establishments she had offered, to no purpose, the services of her needle. They had looked at it and refused it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a den of thieves. It was the hiding-place of Jack Riggs and {{his gang}} of road agents. I've been hunting this spot <b>for</b> three <b>weeks.</b> And <b>now</b> the whole thing's up!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Devine {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "Grant has {{not been}} away <b>for</b> almost two <b>weeks</b> <b>now,</b> and it is quite that time since we have seen Mr. Brooke," [...] she said. [...] "Didn't we ask him to come when you had Minnie here?" ...|$|R
50|$|Campbell is deplorably poor.... Partly {{in order}} to help his pockets a little Mr. Scott and I decided {{to see if we could}} get the Toronto Globe to give us space for a couple of columns of {{paragraphs}} & short articles, at whatever pay we could get for them. They agreed to it; and Campbell, Scott and I have been carrying on the thing <b>for</b> several <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R
60|$|On a couch of glossy {{red leather}} with glossy black buttons and stiff fringes also of glossy red leather, Mr. William Wrenn sat upright {{and was very}} confiding to Miss Nelly Croubel, who was curled among the satin pillows with her skirts drawn {{carefully}} about her ankles. He had been at Mrs. Arty's <b>for</b> two <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> He wore a new light-blue tie, and his trousers were pressed like sheet steel.|$|R
5000|$|A British yachtsman visiting Peschany Island {{recently}} {{commented on}} the weather and on the desolation of the place: [...] "I have been anchored off Ostrov Peschany <b>for</b> a <b>week</b> <b>now</b> {{and during that time}} have had to move position eight times. There is, as a rule of thumb, a gale per day lasting between 8 and 12 hours" ... "Ostrov Peschany must be one of the bleakest and least inviting islands anywhere in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' I wisht {{this cold}} snap'd break," [...] he went on. [...] "It's ben fifty below <b>for</b> two <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> An' I wisht I'd never started on this trip, Henry. I don't like {{the looks of}} it. I don't feel right, somehow. An' while I'm wishin', I wisht the trip was over an' done with, an' you an' me a-sittin' by the fire in Fort McGurry just about now an' playing cribbage--that's what I wisht." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a comfort. The fog {{can last}} <b>for</b> a <b>week</b> <b>now.</b> Let us get the canoe ashore. We can moor the boat; {{the water is}} as smooth as glass, {{and there is no}} risk {{whatever}} of her damaging herself. Bring an armful of firewood ashore," [...] he went on as they laid the canoe down gently on a flat rock. [...] "I will look about for a place for the tent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pat Phelan, {{played by}} Connor McIntyre. Phelan {{had been doing}} a {{conversion}} job in Ken's kitchen <b>for</b> some <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> After informing Ken {{that he would have}} to extend the job, Ken snaps with mounting pressure from his family, raging that Phelan is untrustworthy following the incident with the flat scam. Unbeknownst to Ken, Phelan has murdered Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) two months previously. Phelan is caught by Daniel standing over Ken when he is pushed down the stairs.|$|R
5000|$|Saturday night, the housemates {{fail the}} challenge. A {{restricted}} budget has been causing tensions <b>for</b> some <b>weeks</b> <b>now.</b> Later, Mardiola's birthday is celebrated but the fun stops when a very uneasy Ervis is evicted with 48% of the vote. Shkëlqim, Ina and Pol realise that Romina has snatched away the public's support. Meanwhile, Ervis blames his elimination {{on the public}} and even appears on the nightly news to clear his record from the [...] "gigolo joke".|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} {{clattering}} around among the plantations <b>for</b> three <b>weeks,</b> <b>now,</b> and next <b>week</b> I {{am going to}} visit the extinct crater of Mount Haleakala--the largest in the world; it is ten miles {{to the foot of}} the mountain; it rises 10,000 feet above the valley; the crater is 29 miles in circumference and 1,000 feet deep. Seen from the summit, the city of St. Louis would look like a picture in the bottom of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's been playin' {{for this}} <b>for</b> a <b>week,</b> and <b>now</b> he's got it. You {{know as well}} as I do that if he hadn't been gassing at us the way he has, that young devil Beetle wouldn't have dreamed of marbles." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} debating names <b>for</b> <b>weeks,</b> but <b>now</b> we choose one, Hayden, aware it’s a name {{we might have}} to bury. I {{sit on the edge of}} the bed and think about the vial of amniotic fluid—Katherine’s water—traveling by van to the lab in Milwaukee. I think of its soft amber color, its {{protective}} viscosity, its blizzard of DNA, the helix of Hayden’s existence a braid of Katherine’s alleles and mine. [URL]...|$|R
