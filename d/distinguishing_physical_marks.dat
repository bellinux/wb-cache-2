30|$|The samudrikavidyā has Vedic {{origins and}} is {{considered}} a vedāṅga (auxiliary knowledge of Veda). Both samudrikavidyā and phrenology focused on <b>physical</b> <b>marks</b> as manifestations of differences between individuals. The <b>physical</b> <b>marks</b> suggested an innate predisposition of the individual. For phrenology, however, these predispositions were eventually interpreted in racial and hierarchical or evolutionary terms. As for the samudrikavidyā, differences in <b>physical</b> <b>marks</b> would {{say something about the}} “self” of the individual. Moreover, samudrikavidyā was concerned with distinguishing marks that the individual brought in the fullness of their bodies, not just in their heads (Kapila 2007, p. 502 – 503). These <b>physical</b> <b>marks</b> were considered saṃskāras, thus representing karmic dispositions.|$|R

In the stories, if someone did something to harm Cain, the damage would come back sevenfold. Some interpretations view this as a <b>physical</b> <b>mark,</b> whereas other interpretations see the [...] "mark" [...] as a sign, and not as a <b>physical</b> <b>marking</b> on Cain himself.

40|$|Trees symbolize growth, strength, and wisdom. Trees {{also have}} a function, and these organisms can record {{everything}} that happens around them and to them. Trees record a <b>physical</b> <b>mark</b> of growth and this linear record is physically beautiful and an inspiration for my current body of work. While interested in these states of physical being I researched the growth patterns found in different living beings. It became evident that growth patterns are actually more similar in trees, hair, and elevation levels. Each being on this earth {{is very different from}} the rest, but one thing that connects us all is the <b>physical</b> <b>marks</b> that show scars, aging, and growth. I use different patterns of growth for different beings to show how these <b>physical</b> <b>marks</b> can still be shown, and how closely humans relate to other organisms. Linear elements dominate my prints and woodworking. I use line to create a fluid composition combined with natural and neutral earth tone colors. I create rich and layered work to give my prints texture. Mark Schatz’s sculptures inspire me to think bigger, and use different materials to execute an idea.

40|$|The social stigma {{associated}} with psychiatric disorder {{is often a}} reason cited for the delay or avoidance of treatment. It is thus of concern to mental health practitioners caring and advocating for ill individuals. As a cultural phenomenon, stigma also poses challenges for those who manage treatment settings and policy makers who must deal {{with the image of}} those labeled as mentally ill. My dissertation was a correlational study with a panel design which examined, over a four-month time span, the personal experiences and perceptions of stigma by psychiatric patients receiving medical and psychosocial treatments under the auspices offederally funded studies ofunipolar (UP) and bipolar (BP) affective disorders. The word "stigma " is defined as a mark, and originally referenced a <b>physical</b> <b>mark.</b> Although not a pejorative term in its Greek origin, it has become {{associated with}} its later Latin usage in referencing <b>physical</b> identifying <b>marks</b> inflicted on criminals. As the term is used today, stigma is not a <b>physical</b> <b>mark,</b> but a metaphorical one, referring to a blemish or flaw ofcharacter.

His most <b>distinguishing</b> <b>physical</b> quality was his lazy left eye. Before his career in acting, he took several jobs in finance and served two years in the United States Navy during World War II.|$|R
40|$|Can human {{observers}} <b>distinguish</b> <b>physical</b> {{removal of}} a visible stimulus from phenomenal suppression of that stimulus during binocular rivalry? As so often happens, simple questions produce complex answers, {{and that is the}} case in the study reported here. Using continuous flash suppression to produce binocular rivalry, we were able to identify stimulus conditions where most – but not all – people utterly fail to <b>distinguish</b> <b>physical</b> from phenomenal stimulus removal, although we can be certain that those two equivalent perceptual states are accompanied by distinct neural events. More interestingly, we find subtle variants of the task where distinguishing the two states is trivially easy, even for people who utterly fail under the original conditions. We found that stimulus features are differentially vulnerable to suppression. Observers are able to be aware of existence/removal of some stimulus attributes (flicker) but not others (orientation), implying that interocular suppression breaks down the unitary awareness of integrated features belonging to a visual object. These findings raise questions about the unitary nature of awareness and, also, place qualifications on the utility of binocular rivalry as a tool for studying the neural concomitants of conscious visual awareness...|$|R
40|$|Survival is a {{fundamental}} parameter in population dynamics with increasing importance in the management and conservation strategies of wildlife populations. Survival probability in vertebrates is usually estimated by live-encounter data obtained by means of physical mark-capture-recapture protocols. Non-invasive acoustic marking relying on individual-specific features of signals has been alternatively applied as a marking technique, especially in secretive species. Nevertheless, to date no research has compared survival rate estimates obtained by acoustic and <b>physical</b> <b>marking.</b> We estimated half-yearly and annual survival and recapture rates of a secretive and threatened passerine, the Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti, using two separate live-encounter data sets of males collected simultaneously by <b>physical</b> and acoustic <b>marking</b> in the same study area. The separate analysis of both methods led to different model structures, since transient individuals had to be accounted for in the acoustic marking {{but not in the}} <b>physical</b> <b>marking</b> data set. Furthermore, while reencounter probabilities did not differ between methods, survival estimates employing <b>physical</b> <b>marking</b> were lower than those obtained acoustically, especially between the postbreeding and the breeding period when the apparent survival of colour-banded birds was twice as low as for acoustic marking. The combination of marking methods suggested the existence of different subsets of individuals differentially sampled within the population: whereas colour-banded males seemed to represent the territorial fraction of the population, both resident and floater individuals were probably detected by acoustic marking. Using traditional mark-recapture methods exclusively could have misled our estimates of survival rates, potentially affecting prospective predictions of population dynamics. Acoustic marking has been poorly applied in mark-recapture studies, but might be a powerful complement to obtain accurate estimates of fundamental demographic parameters such as survival and dispersal. © 2008 The Authors.

Results are satisfactorily compared with available experimental data. Finally, the validity of non-forced numerical models is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Generally co-variant {{theories}} do {{not have}} a notion of a <b>distinguished</b> <b>physical</b> time with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.|$|R
