5|$|Rashad (T.I.) is a teen {{living in}} Atlanta, Georgia with his Uncle, George (Mykelti Williamson) and <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> Ant (Evan Ross). He {{and his brother}} were raised by their uncle George since their parents {{died in a car}} accident, and they work with him as part of his {{custodial}} company. When not working or finishing his last semester of high school, Rashad {{spends most of his time}} with his friends Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), Teddy (Jason Weaver), and Esquire (Jackie Long). Rashad is a talented artist but does not see much of a future in that field as he has become accustomed to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year. However, he finds out that he will need a letter of recommendation from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.|$|E

After the dance, Meg begins to think Brian is her boyfriend, despite Brian saying he has no feelings for her and citing his already existing relationship with Jillian. Meg develops an obsession with Brian, even baking him a pie and using her hair as one of the ingredients. Stewie arrives and sits next to Brian and asks if he can have some pie. He then asks for the [...] "Cool Hwhip" [...] (this is the first in a series of occasions where Stewie puts [...] on the [...] "h" [...] sound in a word starting with [...] "wh").

2500|$|Incest themes - Beginning {{with the}} film <b>His</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Brother</b> (produced in 1978), Nova Studios often {{included}} incest in its films. [...] Although none of the models were, in fact, siblings, Nova Studios often gave them the same last name as their stage name to heighten {{the impression that the}} models were brothers. Other aspects of the films—the performers occupy the same house, or appear to have the same parents, or seem to have a brotherly relationship in school or at home—also contribute to the impression that incest is occurring.|$|E

2500|$|Barrie {{explains}} that the Neverlands {{are found in the}} minds of children, and that although each is [...] "always more or less an island", and they have a family resemblance, they are not the same from one child to the next. For example, John Darling's had [...] "a lagoon with flamingos flying over it" [...] while <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> Michael's had [...] "a flamingo with lagoons flying over it".

2500|$|Rico Dredd (20662099) was the [...] "clone brother" [...] of Joseph Dredd, {{which is}} to say that they were both cloned from the same genetic source, in their case Chief Judge Fargo. Their growth in the cloning tanks was artificially accelerated, so that within 16 months they emerged with the {{physical}} development of children aged five years. They also had their brains electronically induced with knowledge and training which greatly surpassed their apparent physical age, so that they could immediately begin training in law enforcement. Rico was removed from the cloning tanks twelve minutes before Joe, and so he habitually referred to Joe as <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> (or [...] "Little Joe").|$|E
2500|$|In 1440, in the King's name, an {{invitation}} {{is said to}} have been sent to the young, 16-year-old 6th Earl of Douglas and <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother,</b> twelve-year-old David, to visit the king at Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. According to legend, they came, and were entertained at the royal table, where James, still a little boy, was charmed by them. However, they were treacherously hurried to their doom, which took place by beheading in the castle yard of Edinburgh on 24 November, with the 10-year-old king pleading for their lives. Three days later Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld, their chief adherent, shared the same fate. It is likely the king, being a small child, had nothing to do with this. This infamous incident took the name of [...] "the Black Dinner".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Take Out," [...] Don {{must see}} a {{therapist}} who is {{led to believe}} that he is [...] "trigger happy." [...] His father noted that this may be true, as he often shoots first. Further, Alan recalled how Don would take on others' burdens as a child and told him to get counseling, which he later willingly sought, especially considering that he viewed his life's work as a series of dirty deeds. In [...] "One Hour", Don expressed that he doesn't have to trust his team, they have to trust him. [...] The exception to this may be Charlie, whom the therapist identified {{as a member of the}} team to Don's initial confusion. [...] It appears that Don considers Charlie more of an extension of himself than a member of his team, which may be true: [...] Charlie would likely not be involved in the volume of cases that he is if not for Don's continued requests for his assistance, despite the team's respect for Charlie's contributions. He also confessed to his psychiatrist that he [...] "respects the Hell out of" [...] Charlie for all that his brother does for the FBI, and that Charlie has never let them down despite often having the team's and Don's lives in his hands. When the psychiatrist pushes Don about his relationship with Charlie, indicating first that Don resents Charlie's presence at the FBI and then that Don enjoys having <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> as his 'employee', Don vehemently snaps back and defends Charlie. This shows how far the relationship between the brothers has come, especially since being damaged by the unusual pressures of their childhood and the three months near the end of their mother's life that Charlie spent working on P vs. NP. The therapist reveals that Don has deep-seated fears of losing what he has worked for, together with self-esteem issues from growing up in Charlie's shadow and likely some abandonment issues as well. In [...] "Money for Nothing", he acquiesces to the counselor's request to ask Charlie to come in for a visit. A looming issue was the day Charlie walked all the way home from a camping trip at the age of 8 (taken for Don's 13th birthday) just to get away from Don who did not want him sticking around. During the meeting, he learns that his brother was not as inept as he and his father thought and stated he likes working with Charlie. Both Don's therapist and Edgerton himself bring up the incident in which a suspect was tortured that nearly took Don over the edge ("One Hour" [...] and [...] "Pandora's Box"), but given the fact that it was done to obtain the whereabouts of a missing FBI agent, Don and Ian's superiors appear to be overlooking the matter for now.|$|E

2500|$|Superboy is a {{principal}} character in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Nolan North. He {{has been referred to}} as the [...] "breakout character" [...] of the show by its producers and is the only member of Young Justice from the comics to appear {{as a member of the}} team in the first season, with other characters either appearing or joining next season. He first wore a white form-fitting solar suit and later wears a black T-shirt with the Superman logo across his chest and blue army-type pants with brown work boots. The result of Project Cadmus' [...] "Project Kr" [...] in the two-part pilot [...] "Independence Day", Superboy is a sixteen-week-old genomorph clone of Superman, created as a living weapon by Project Cadmus and Dr. Mark Desmond to either replace Superman if he falls or destroy him should he go rogue. Kept in a pod beneath the Cadmus facility, he was telepathically force-fed advanced knowledge in various areas including languages, history, math, reading, writing, culture, etc. While he possesses Superman's super strength, enhanced speed, telescopic vision, infrared vision, super hearing, and invulnerability, these powers are not at Superman's level, nor at the proportionate level for a Kryptonian of his physical age. In addition, he lacks Superman's more advanced powers such as flight, x-ray and heat vision, due to missing sequences in Superboy's Kryptonian DNA being bridged with human DNA, which stabilizes Superboy and withholds full Kryptonian powers. After being released by Aqualad, Robin, and Kid Flash, defeating the transformed Desmond (a.k.a. Blockbuster) and the Justice League's arrival, Superboy meets Superman, who has since found it uncomfortable being around his clone, and Superboy's failed attempts to work with and talk to Superman make Superboy angry and irrational. He has a burgeoning romantic relationship with Martian Manhunter's niece, M'gann. In [...] "Targets", Superboy is given the name [...] "Conner Kent"; the first name suggested by M'gann after the love interest of a sitcom titled [...] "Hello Megan" [...] whom he greatly resembles; and the surname by Martian Manhunter after Superman, which Miss Martian thought was in homage to Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson). At the end of [...] "Terrors", he kisses Miss Martian after Killer Frost had almost killed her. Since then, the two have started a romantic relationship, but attempted to keep it from their teammates, showing their affection in privacy or speaking telepathically. In [...] "Agendas", Superboy learns that he is the half-human clone of Lex Luthor, who gives him Shield-shaped patches to defeat the Superclone Match. Afterwards, Lex tells him the shields are a gift [...] "from a father to his son" [...] and quotes [...] "Red Sun" [...] to incapacitate Superboy when he tries to attack him. In [...] "Performance", Superboy displays signs of addiction to the [...] "shields", using them continuously in the field, but making him more aggressive when fighting Parasite. In [...] "Usual Suspects", Superboy confesses this to the Team, and agrees to meet Luthor on Santa Prisco for a restock on the [...] "shields". Upon arriving, Miss Martian and Artemis also appear to find Lex Luthor accompanied by Queen Bee, Bane, Blockbuster, Cheshire, and Sportsmaster. However the villains are surprised and attacked by them and the rest of the Team, as the [...] "Red Sun" [...] program has been wiped from his mind by Miss Martian. Luthor admits that no other programs were installed in time by Dr. Desmond. In [...] "Auld Acquaintance", he and Superman finally interact and reveal their civilian identities to one another. In the five-year gap, Superboy remained with the team sporting a long-sleeved Superman T-shirt, but retaining his appearance from season one, due to being force grown. He is now more relaxed, controlled, and makes use of strategy and technology in battles. In the episode [...] "Alienated", his relationship with Superman has visibly improved. Kal-El refers to Superboy as <b>his</b> <b>little</b> <b>brother</b> with the Kryptonian name Kon-El. At some point, he ended his relationship with Miss Martian in part because he does not outwardly age, but also because of her violent probing of hostile minds, leaving them in a catatonic state. Worse, she attempted to erase his memory of this argument. M'gann is shocked out of her ways after she telepathically attacks Aqualad, and eventually breaks up with Lagoon Boy, deciding with Connor to renew their relationship.|$|E
