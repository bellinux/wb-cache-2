40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of winter deicing on groundwater quality beneath an 860 -m 2 permeable asphalt parking lot at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut. While the beneficial impacts of permeable asphalt on water quality and hydrology have been documented in the literature and include increases in groundwater recharge, reduced peak flows and reductions in metals and hydrocarbon contaminant concentrations in groundwater, chloride has not been observed to be filtered from percolate beneath permeable asphalt. The potential issues related to chloride contamination of groundwater include aquatic toxicity and heavy metals mobilization. Monitoring wells were installed up-gradient and <b>down-gradient</b> in which electrical conductivity was monitored at 10 minute intervals from September 26, 2014 to May 8, 2014. Biweekly samples were collected and analyzed for chloride during the period of study and used to develop a predictive relationship which allowed electrical conductivity to serve as a proxy for continuous chloride concentrations. Samples were also analyzed for sodium (Na), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) on two occasions before deicing activities began in September and October 2014 and two occasions while deicing activities were active in January and March 2015 and used to evaluate cation exchange potential. Changes in electrical conductivity and chloride were found to be directly proportional to changes in water table elevations after deicing salt applications and snowmelt percolation and inversely proportional during non-winter months due to dilution by percolating water. Chloride concentrations in groundwater beneath permeable asphalt increased by 9, 480 % over the period of study, though the mean concentration of 303. 7 mg/L calculated <b>down-gradient</b> was lower than the up-gradient mean concentration of 1, 280 mg/L. Ca and Mg in the <b>down-gradient</b> well increased by 4, 632 % and 1, 946 %, respectively, though metals concentrations in the up-gradient well were higher than <b>down-gradient</b> for all sampling dates. Despite the frequent high peaks of chloride as well as the increases in metals observed in the <b>down-gradient</b> well, monitoring throughout the study period revealed lower contaminant concentrations <b>down-gradient</b> than up-gradient before and after deicing activities were active. These results suggest that the use of permeable asphalt in environments with high background contaminant concentrations is beneficial to shallow groundwater quality in the long term due to dilution...|$|E
40|$|Some {{decades ago}} Margalef speculated that {{study of the}} exchanges across {{boundaries}} that separate different types of ecological systems would provide significant insights about properties and processes within the units that make up ecological mosaics.

In this paper we explore exchanges across such ecological boundaries in coastal ecosystems in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and elsewhere. We find that, indeed, definition of such boundaries is ambiguous, but study of the exchanges is more useful. In the Cape Cod system, water transport <b>down-gradient</b> is the dominant mechanism exerting influence on <b>down-gradient</b> systems. The direction of ecological control across such boundaries is largely asymmetrical, and properties of up-gradient units exert significant influence on <b>down-gradient</b> units.

The array design, areal extent nominally 89 ° W to 85 ° W, 25 ° N to 27 ° N with 30 – 50 km mesoscale resolution, permits quantitative mapping of the regional circulation at all depths. During Loop Current Eddy detachment and formation events, a marked increase in deep eddy kinetic energy occurs coincident {{with the growth of}} a large-scale meander along the northern and eastern parts of the Loop Current. Deep eddies develop in a pattern where the deep fields were offset and leading upper meanders consistent with developing baroclinic instability. The interaction between the upper and deep fields is quantified by evaluating the mean eddy potential energy budget. Largest <b>down-gradient</b> heat fluxes are found along {{the eastern side of the}} Loop Current.

40|$|Groundwaters often exhibit ((super 234) U/ (super 238) U) {{activity}} ratios {{greater than}} {{one as a}} result of fractionation between (super 234) U and (super 238) U nuclides during rock/water interactions. However, when groundwaters pass through high-grade uranium mineralisation, congruent dissolution of uranium minerals should impart a ((super 234) U/ (super 238) U) activity ratio which is at or very close to secular equilibrium. This research characterises the uranium-series (U-series) disequilibria in groundwater surrounding a high-grade uranium deposit, and investigates the use of disequilibria in groundwater as a proxy for uranium exploration. U-Series isotopes have been analysed by isotope dilution MC-ICP-MS in groundwater samples along the groundwater flow path, within and surrounding the South Australian Four Mile and Pepegoona sediment-hosted uranium mineralised systems. Samples collected <b>down-gradient</b> of the Four Mile mineralisation have ((super 234) U/ (super 238) U) activity ratios ranging from 1. 12 proximal to mineralisation, up to 2. 08 approximately 10 kms <b>down-gradient</b> from mineralisation. U concentrations range from 0. 5 - 200 ppb, with highest concentrations found in samples collected in mineralisation. Groundwaters sampled within the high-grade mineralisation show ((super 234) U/ (super 238) U) activity ratios close to unity (1. 05), which is consistent with the congruent dissolution of uranium minerals. The observation of increasing disequilibrium with distance from mineralisation highlights the potential application of U-series isotopes as an indicator of high-grade uranium deposits. However, the extent and distribution of disequilibrium at the Pepegoona deposit is not entirely consistant with proximity to the mineralisation. Groundwaters samples within mineralisation exhibit much higher ((super 234) U/ (super 238) U) activity ratios than at Four Mile, averaging 1. 41. Samples collected <b>down-gradient</b> have typically lower U concentrations and ((super 234) U/ (super 238) U) activity ratios approaching unity.

40|$|Shallow {{subsurface}} thermal {{regimes in}} urban areas are increasingly impacted by anthropogenic activities, which include infrastructure development like underground traffic lines as well as industrial and residential subsurface buildings. In combination with the progressive use of shallow geothermal energy systems, this results in the so-called subsurface urban heat island effect. This article {{emphasizes the importance of}} considering the thermal impact of subsurface structures, which commonly is underestimated due to missing information and of reliable subsurface temperature data. Based on synthetic heat-transport models different settings of the urban environment were investigated, including: (1) hydraulic gradients and conductivities, which result in different groundwater flow velocities; (2) aquifer properties like groundwater thickness to aquitard and depth to water table; and (3) constructional features, such as building depths and thermal properties of building structures. Our results demonstrate that with rising groundwater flow velocities, the heat-load from building structures increase, whereas <b>down-gradient</b> groundwater temperatures decrease. Thermal impacts on subsurface resources therefore have {{to be related to the}} permeability of aquifers and hydraulic boundary conditions. In regard to the urban settings of Basel, Switzerland, flow velocities of around 1 m d(- 1) delineate a marker where either <b>down-gradient</b> temperature deviations or heat-loads into the subsurface are more relevant. Furthermore, no direct thermal influence on groundwater resources should be expected for aquifers with groundwater thicknesses larger 10 m and when the distance of the building structure to the groundwater table is higher than around 10 m. We demonstrate that measuring temperature changes <b>down-gradient</b> of subsurface structures is insufficient overall to assess thermal impacts, particularly {{in urban areas}}. Moreover, in areas which are densely urbanized, and where groundwater flow velocities are low, appropriate measures for assessing thermal impacts should specifically include a quantification of heat-loads into the subsurface which result in a more diffuse thermal contamination of urban groundwater resources...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The nontherapeutic use of {{antibiotics}} in swine feed can select for antibiotic resistance in swine enteric bacteria. Leaking swine waste storage pits and the land-application of swine manure can result in the dispersion of resistant bacteria to water sources. However, there are few data comparing levels of resistant bacteria in swine manure–impacted water sources versus unaffected sources. OBJECTIVES: The goal {{of this study was}} to analyze surface water and groundwater situated up and down gradient from a swine facility for antibiotic-resistant enterococci and other fecal indicators. METHODS: Surface water and groundwater samples (n = 28) were collected up and down gradient from a swine facility from 2002 to 2004. Fecal indicators were isolated by membrane filtration, and enterococci (n = 200) were tested for susceptibility to erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, virginiamycin, and vancomycin.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The goal of {{this paper}} is to assess the interim results of a {{full-scale}} bioaugmentation biobarrier. The biobarrier is designed to treat a trichloroethene (TCE) plume along the downgradient property boundary of an industrial facility. The biobarrier is 381 meters long perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction. The aquifer was conditioned with 27, 215 kilograms (kg) of an emulsified vegetable oil (EVO) electron donor using direct-push techniques. Three groundwater extraction wells were used to supply make-up water to three different portions of the biobarrier. The make-up water was used to prepare a 20 % EVO solution, which was delivered to the subsurface. The central extraction well was located in an area where a viable bacterial population persisted from an earlier bioaugmentation pilot test. The EVO donor solution prepared from this water successfully “pre-seeded ” the central portion of the biobarrier. Two months following donor addition, 330 liters (L) of dechlorinating bacterial culture (KB- 1) was applied to the entire length of the biobarrier including the pre-seeded area.

It was observed that there is a wide variation in the concentration of the contaminants measured at different sampling periods between 2004 and 2011. Pollution risks from chromium, lead, manganese, cobalt and zinc were determined to be very low since the simulated contaminant concentrations in the wells were less than the reference ground water concentrations.

The ore occurs in a roll front deposit and is mined via in situ recovery (ISR). This method of mining is used to recover U from low-grade deposits while producing no tailings or waste rock. This method of mining can, however, contaminate adjacent aquifers with residual U and other elements. The objective of this project is to characterize core taken <b>down-gradient</b> of a mined unit to provide information on the capacity of <b>down-gradient</b> aquifer solids to attenuate U. Core samples were obtained from hydraulically <b>down-gradient</b> of the mine unit B at two locations. Powder X-ray diffraction analyses showed the presence of quartz, clays, feldspar, goethite and pyrite. Electron microprobe analysis, scanning electron microscopy and physical examination confirmed that the core is a heterogeneous mixture of grain sizes with different shapes and composed of clays, sandy materials and coal lenses. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence mapping revealed the close association of U with Fe, V, Ca and coal lenses in the sediments. Uranium X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) showed the presence of both U(IV) and U(VI) in samples containing coal lenses. Carbon (C) XANES indicated the presence of several C functional groups representative of organic C; however, inorganic C was not identified in the C-K-edge XANES analysis. Iron and S XANES also confirmed the presence of reduced and oxidised Fe and S species. Clays, coal lenses, Fe- oxides and pyrite observed in the core samples may control U concentrations and mobility in groundwater. Geochemical modelling using PHREEQC software showed that primary and secondary U minerals may not control U mobility in these materials but the presence of carbonate, Fe oxides and clays may control U concentrations and mobility through sorption, reduction and precipitation processes.

40|$|A {{parameterization}} of mesoscale eddies in coarse-resolution ocean {{general circulation}} models (GCM) is formulated and implemented using a residual-mean formalism. In that framework, mean buoyancy is advected by the residual velocity (the {{sum of the}} Eulerian and eddy-induced velocities) and modified by a residual flux which accounts for the diabatic effects of mesoscale eddies. The residual velocity is obtained by stepping forward a residual-mean momentum equation in which eddy stresses appear as forcing terms. Study of the spatial distribution of eddy stresses, derived by using them as control parameters to ‘‘fit’’ the residual-mean model to observations, supports the idea that eddy stresses can be likened to a vertical <b>down-gradient</b> flux of momentum with a coefficient which is constant in the vertical. The residual eddy flux is set to zero in the ocean interior, where mesoscale eddies {{are assumed to be}} quasi-adiabatic, but is parameterized by a horizontal <b>down-gradient</b> diffusivity near the surface where eddies develop a diabatic component as they stir properties horizontally across steep isopycnals. The residual-mean model is implemented and tested in the MIT general circulation model. It is shown that the resulting model (1) has a climatology that is superior to that obtained using the Gent and McWilliams parameterization scheme with a spatially uniform diffusivity and (2) allows one to significantly reduce the (spurious) horizontal viscosity used in coarse resolution GCMs...|$|E

However, groundwater pollution from the leachate generated within the landfill and migrating through the bottom liner material into the underlying groundwater aquifers remains a major public health concern. In our study, we evaluated {{the application of a}} mathematical model to determine the aerial extent of unacceptable groundwater contamination due to lead migrating from the Richmond landfill leachate into the underlying Matsheumhlope unconfined aquifer. A one-dimensional advection-dispersion model was applied to predict the <b>down-gradient</b> migration of lead into the aquifer. Linear sorption and first-order decay were considered as the dominant contaminant sink mechanisms for lead. Lead concentrations in the monitoring wells at the landfill site were used as the source term. The lead migration from the landfill was determined by water quality sampling from boreholes situated <b>down-gradient</b> of the landfill. The model simulations gave a good fit of the field results.

40|$|The role of eddy fluxes in {{the general}} {{circulation}} is often approached by treating eddies as (macro) turbulence. In this approach, the eddies act to diffuse certain quasiconservative quantities, such as potential vorticity (PV), along isentropic surfaces in the free atmosphere. The eddy fluxes are determined primarily by the eddy diffusivities and are necessarily <b>down-gradient</b> of the basic state PV field. Support for the (macro) turbulence approach {{stems from the fact}} that the eddy fluxes of PV in the free atmosphere are generally <b>down-gradient</b> in the long-term mean. Here we call attention to a pronounced and significant region of upgradient eddy PV fluxes on the poleward flank of the jet core in both hemispheres. The region of up-gradient (i. e., notionally “antidiffusive”) eddy PV fluxes is most pronounced during the winter and spring seasons and partially contradicts the turbulence approach described above. Analyses of the PV variance (potential enstrophy) budget suggest that the up-gradient PV fluxes represent local wave decay and are maintained by poleward fluxes of PV variance. Finite-amplitude effects thus represent leading order contributions to the PV variance budget, whereas dissipation is only of secondary importance locally. The appearance of up-gradient PV fluxes in the long-term mean is associated with the poleward shift of the jet—and thus the region of wave decay relative to wave growth—following wave-breaking events...|$|E

The boulder field was {{thought to have been}} emplaced by a glacial lake outburst based {{on the size of the}} boulders, elevation, location, local geology and geomorphology. Two boulders from the boulder field, a granite and a sandstone, yielded exposure ages of 18. 2 ± 2. 5 and 18. 1 ± 2. 2 ka, respectively. The exposure age dates indicate that the glacial lake outburst flood occurred close to the LGM for this area (19. 4 ± 1. 5 ka; Guido, et. al, 2007). Another granite boulder, resting at an elevation of 2012 meters, from a different boulder field, was also exposure age dated and yielded an anomalously young exposure age of 2. 5 ± 0. 4 ka. The second boulder field: (1) is located approximately 4. 5 km <b>down-gradient</b> from the LGM terminal moraine; and, (2) contains a cluster of boulders that form a linear array in a gully along the north face of Smelter Mountain (in Durango). The exposure age date of the second granite boulder likely represents the age of the last downslope movement of the boulder in the north-facing gully. It is reasonable to suggest that the downslope movement of 2 - 4 meter diameter boulders occurred as a result of a significant (regional or local) precipitation event. Remarkably, the 2. 5 ± 0. 4 ka exposure age on the granite boulder correlates well with the onset of regional climate change recorded in the nearby La Plata Mountains.

Seven alternatives were developed and ranged from those that included pit backfill (of various scenarios) to those that retained an open pit or a pit lake (a. k. a. pit pond). One of the issues of most con-cern and most uncertainty was the potential impact or risk to <b>down-gradient</b> surface water and groundwater {{as a result of}} reclamation; and the ability to make an assessment of the relative risks of any one alternative over the others.

40|$|Coarse {{resolution}} numerical ocean models must typically {{include a}} parameterisation for mesoscale turbulence. A common recipe for such parameterisations is to invoke <b>down-gradient</b> mixing, or diffusion, of some tracer quantity, such as potential vorticity or buoyancy. However, {{it is well}} known that eddy fluxes include large rotational components which necessarily do not lead to any mixing; eddy diffusivities diagnosed from unfiltered fluxes are thus contaminated by the presence of these rotational components. Here a new methodology is applied whereby eddy diffusivities are diagnosed directly from the eddy force function. The eddy force function depends only upon flux divergences, is independent of any rotational flux components, and is inherently non-local and smooth. A one-shot inversion procedure is applied, minimising the mis-match between parameterised force functions and force functions derived from eddy resolving calculations. This enables diffusivities associated with the eddy potential vorticity and buoyancy fluxes to be diagnosed. The methodology is applied to multi-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean gyre simulations. It is found that: (i) a strictly <b>down-gradient</b> mixing scheme has limited success in reducing the mis-match compared to one with no sign constraint on the diffusivity; (ii) negative signals of diffusivities are prevalent around the time-mean jet; (iii) there is some indication that the magnitude of the diffusivity correlates well the eddy energy.

40|$|Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) {{has been}} used to map the 3 D spatial {{distribution}} of waste and leachate concentrations within a closed and unconfined landfill. Borehole sampling and a 2 D ERT survey <b>down-gradient</b> of the landfill boundary had failed to detect a pollution plume. Accordingly, a 3 D survey was undertaken to determine the pattern of leachate drainage within the waste so that a more refined contaminant transport model could be developed. A full 3 D survey was undertaken by sub-dividing the landfill into a number of discrete rectangular blocks and acquiring data on multiple parallel lines. The line data were merged into a single x-y matrix file and then inverted using a 3 D finite element algorithm. The results are presented as 3 D volumetric tomograms to show the inferred waste distribution and leachate flow-paths. The resistivity models indicate that leachate has accumulated at several discrete localities within the landfill. The controlling mechanism appears to be the depth and geometry of the original Chalk quarries used for waste disposal. The deepest leachate infiltration of the underlying Chalk bedrock invariably occurs below these drainage sinks. A narrow leachate plume is indicated {{in one part of the}} landfill, migrating <b>down-gradient</b> to the north-west. The inferred leachate concentrations in the Chalk were subsequently confirmed by drilling and hydrochemical sampling which showed elevated solute levels coincident with distinct resistivity lows of < 15 ohm-...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{distribution}} of Red Blood Cells in a confined channel flow is inhomogeneous and shows a marked depletion near the walls {{due to a}} competition between migration away from the walls and shear-induced diffusion resulting from interactions between particles. We investigated the lift of RBCs in a shear flow near a wall and measured a significant lift velocity despite the tumbling motion of cells. We also provide values for the collective and anisotropic shear-induced diffusion of a cloud of RBCs, both {{in the direction of}} shear and in the direction of vorticity. A generic <b>down-gradient</b> subdiffusion characterized by an exponent 1 / 3 is highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Disposal of tritium {{generation}} wastes in shallow, concrete vaults {{was modeled}} to determine aquifer concentrations created by advection and diffusion. A 10, 000 -year minimum duration was examined, hence material changes in waste containers, vaults and engineered barriers were accommodated in the simulations. Ground-water flow analyses were accomplished in three steady-state stages, representing the intact, cracked, and failed {{states of the}} concrete vaults. Radionuclide half-lives and Kds were major inputs to transient transport modeling that was performed to complete the analyses. Contaminant mass fluxes to the water table and concentrations at a hypothetical 100 -m <b>down-gradient</b> well from the analyses of two radionuclides were presented displaying distinctively different behaviors...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} column {{experiments}} of metal mobilization from a soil sampled down gradient of a municipal waste landfill in Northern Italy are presented. The experiments were performed at different pH and Eh conditions. Distilled water was used {{first and then}} a groundwater sampled <b>down-gradient</b> in the same site. 50 d column tests were performed on 15 kg of saturated soil. The concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Ni were evaluated when these selected environmental parameters were altered. Results indicated a greater release when acidic conditions were achieved, a positive effect in this case of the addition of an oxidant and a great Fe mobilisation when a negative redox potential was established...|$|E
40|$|In this study, lipid {{biomarker}} {{characterization of}} the bacterial and eukaryotic communities was combined with PCR-DGGE analysis of the eubacterial community to evaluate correlation between JP- 4 fuel concentration and community structure shifts. Vadose, capillary fringe and saturated-soils were taken from cores within, up- and <b>down-gradient</b> of the contaminant plume. Significant differences in biomass and proportion of Gram negative bacteria were found {{inside and outside the}} plume. Sequence analysis of DGGE bands from within the spill site suggested dominance by a limited number of phylogenetically diverse bacteria. Used in tandem with pollutant quantification, these molecular techniques should facilitate significant improvements over current assessment procedures for determination of remediation end points...|$|E
40|$|Geostrophic eddies have {{traditionally}} been viewed within oceanography as diffusing water masses and tracers in a <b>down-gradient</b> manner. However, eddies also have an advective role {{that may lead to}} an up-gradient transfer of tracers, as has been recognized in atmospheric tracer studies and recent eddy parameterizations developed for the ocean. Eddies provide an advective transfer or "bolus" velocity through the secondary circulation formed by the slumping of density surfaces in baroclinic instability. Here we use an eddy-resolving isopycnal ocean model to investigate the meridional transfer across a zonal jet. The jet undergoes baroclinic instability, forming a vibrant eddy field and inducing a meridional bolus velocity. The bolus velocity is found to be correlated with gradients of potential vorticity rather than thickness. A transient tracer is released with high and low values at the southern and northern boundaries respectively. Over the first few years, the tracer spreads diffusively in a <b>down-gradient</b> manner. The implied eddy diffusivity of the passive tracer is found to be reassuringly {{similar to that of the}} dynamic tracer, potential vorticity. On the decadal time scale, however, the eddy-induced advection dominates and leads to a poleward spreading of tracer in the upper layer, and equatorward spreading of tracer in the lower layer. This eddy-induced advection is likely to be important in controlling the water-mass distribution wherever the time-mean meridional flow is weak. Observationally, the transport velocity is difficult to measure directly, but we argue might be inferred from the spreading of transient tracers, such as CFCs, before they reach a statistically-steady state...|$|E
