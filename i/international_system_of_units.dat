5|$|The <b>International</b> <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement.

5|$|The uncoordinated use of {{the metric}} system by {{different}} scientific and engineering disciplines, particularly in the late 19th century, resulted in different choices of base units even though all {{were based on the}} same definitions of the units of the metre and the kilogram.

5|$|The <b>International</b> <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> {{standardized}} its unit of time, the second, on {{the properties}} of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks).|$|E
5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect.

The study recommended that the United States adopt the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States.

However, reports published since 2007 hold this is no longer true of Myanmar or Liberia. An Agence France-Presse report from 2010 stated that Sierra Leone had passed a law to replace the imperial system with the metric system thereby aligning its system of measurement with that used by its Mano River Union (MRU) neighbours Guinea and Liberia. Reports from Myanmar suggest that the country is also planning to adopt the metric system.|$|E

5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> <b>of</b> <b>Units</b> (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, {{the performance}} of metrology equipment directly impacts yield. Fabs and equipment suppliers depend on calibration standards {{to ensure that their}} metrology results are within tolerances and to maintain their ISO [1] and QS [2] quality certifications. This task becomes more challenging as the device features shrink and tolerances become tighter, to the extent of their physical limits in many cases. As the industry keeps finding ways to meet the demanding metrology requirements, calibration standards have been developed and enhanced for all essential measurements, i. e. critical dimensions, thin films, surface topography, overlay, doping, and defect inspections. This paper provides an overview of such standards and demonstrates how they are certified and tested to be traceable to the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> (SI) <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> length in order to ensure reliable and transferable calibrations for fabs.

40|$|Presented on September 30, 2013 at 6 : 00 pm in the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons - Room 144. Runtime: 73 : 12 minutes. For over 200 years, {{the metric}} {{system has been}} the {{standard}} for comparing measurements in science and industry. Formal procedures were adopted about 125 years ago to create the <b>International</b> <b>System</b> (SI) <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> {{and it has been}} steadily improved. In the next few years, the SI will be completely redefined to make all units more reproducible for the foreseeable future. The base concepts of time, length, mass, charge, temperature, amount of substance, and luminosity will have SI <b>units</b> <b>of</b> seconds, meters, kilograms, coulombs, kelvins, moles, and candela, respectively, all linked to fundamental physical constants. Conducting tests to obtain consistent and better values for physics constants has a long history, going back to Galileo trying to measure the speed of light. Many physics constants now have values in SI <b>units</b> <b>of</b> 8 digits or more, but that accuracy improved slowly. The Planck constant h has the shortest history of them all, since it was only conceived in the modern quantum approach to atomic theory. This talk will use the Planck constant {{as an example of how}} the uncertainty in constants measurements decreases, but not without jumps and disagreements, even increasingly smaller ones, that still have significant effects. Change always involves controversy. The early Planck values “quickly” changed by one percent as physics itself developed. Even in the 1970 's and 80 's there was controversy over voltage units, arising in the changeover from standard chemical cells to the quantum-based Josephson effect. Today's hot topic concerns changing from the last artifact, a kilogram mass standard, to a Planck constant (or Avogadro constant) definition. The recent discrepancies over Planck and Avogadro results are a factor of 100 smaller than those over voltage, showing how electronic metrology is still progressing, and that research on accurate measurements is never complete...|$|R
