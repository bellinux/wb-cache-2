I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country.

The Air Corps previously employed two of its three Beechcraft 200 Super King Airs for this duty. However, the Super King Airs used for Maritime patrol were disposed of in the 1990s, and the third was allocated to transport duties. 102 Squadron operated one Beech King Air (#BB-672 with tail-number 240), but (as of 2010) <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> service and hangared.

25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW what {{many of us have}} been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action.

He acts visibly nervous when he rents a boat from a man who seems to deduce that George gave him a false name; the man's suspicions are aroused more when George asks him whether any other boaters are on the lake (none are). While they are out on the lake, Alice confesses her dreams about their happy future {{together}} with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, and, judging from his attitude, decides not to carry out his murderous plan, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.|$|E

25|$|In July 2016, American and South Korean {{military}} officials agreed to deploy the THAAD {{missile defense system}} {{in the country to}} counter North Korea's growing threats and use of ballistic missile and nuclear tests; each THAAD unit consists of six truck-mounted launchers, 48 interceptors, a fire control and communications unit, and an AN/TPY-2 radar. Seongju County in North Gyeongsang Province was chosen as the site to base the THAAD, partly because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range of North Korean rocket artillery along the DMZ, which sparked protests from Seongju County residents from fear of the radiation emitted by the AN/TPY-2 radar. On 30 September 2016, the U.S. and South Korea announced that THAAD would be relocated to Lotte Skyhill Seongju Country Club, farther from the town's main residential areas and higher in elevation, to alleviate concerns.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to the {{discovery}} of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the NASA Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite that orbited in 1989–1996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out cosmic strings as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested cosmic inflation was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the BOOMERanG experiment reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the universe is flat. A number of ground-based interferometers provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the Very Small Array, Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> phase with the T-mode spectrum.|$|E

500|$|In the 1830s, few {{sought the}} {{immediate}} eradication of slavery. [...] The abolitionist movement {{was young and}} only recently had figures such as William Lloyd Garrison taken on the fight. Stevens's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard Current in 1942, suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ambition; Fawn Brodie, in her controversial 1959 psychobiography <b>of</b> Stevens, suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> identification with the downtrodden, based on his handicap. Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens's feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor, combined with remorse over the Butler case, but that ambition was unlikely {{to have been a}} major motivator, as Stevens's fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career.|$|R
500|$|There {{were two}} main forms of cricket in the 17th and 18th centuries.

If an excommunication was pronounced against the bishops of China, who separated themselves from Rome and put themselves under the Chinese government, one very easily understands why Pope Pius XII excommunicated them. There is no question of us separating ourselves from Rome, nor of putting ourselves under a foreign government, nor of establishing a sort of parallel church as the Bishops of Palmar de Troya have done in Spain.
