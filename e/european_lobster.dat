25|$|Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was {{the first}} person to observe the {{difference}} between larval crustaceans and the adults when he watched the eggs of Cyclops hatching in 1699. Despite this, and other observations over the following decades, there was controversy among scientists about whether or not metamorphosis occurred in crustaceans, with conflicting observations presented, based on different species, some of which went through a metamorphosis, and some of which did not. This controversy persisted until the 1840s, and the first descriptions of a complete series of larval forms were not published until the 1870s (Sidney Irving Smith on the American lobster in 1873; Georg Ossian Sars on the <b>European</b> <b>lobster</b> in 1875, and Walter Faxon on the shrimp Palaemonetes vulgaris in 1879).|$|E
25|$|Their {{longevity}} {{may be due}} to telomerase, {{an enzyme}} that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. Lobsters grow by moulting which requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required. Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die. The <b>European</b> <b>lobster</b> has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.|$|E
500|$|Homarus gammarus, {{known as}} the <b>European</b> <b>lobster</b> or common lobster, is a species of clawed lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea {{and parts of the}} Black Sea.

Here, we report a mark-recapture study of the mobility of wild <b>European</b> <b>lobsters</b> conducted in 3 areas on the south coast of England, using persistent tags. Tagged lobsters were smaller than the fishery minimum landing size (50 to 84 mm carapace length) and were therefore likely to be predominantly sexually immature.

500|$|Technetium-99 is {{produced}} by the nuclear fission of both uranium-235 and plutonium-239. It is therefore present in radioactive waste and in the nuclear fallout of fission bomb explosions. Its decay, measured in becquerels per amount of spent fuel, is the dominant contributor to nuclear waste radioactivity after about 104 to 106years after {{the creation of the}} nuclear waste. From 1945 to 1994, an estimated 160TBq (about 250kg) of technetium-99 was released into the environment during atmospheric nuclear tests. The amount of technetium-99 from nuclear reactors released into the environment up to 1986 is on the order of 1000TBq (about 1600kg), primarily by nuclear fuel reprocessing; most of this was discharged into the sea. Reprocessing methods have reduced emissions since then, but as of 2005 the primary release of technetium-99 into the environment is by the Sellafield plant, which released an estimated 550TBq (about 900kg) from 1995–1999 into the Irish Sea. From 2000 onwards the amount has been limited by regulation to 90TBq (about 140kg) per year.

This study investigates if female <b>European</b> <b>lobsters</b> Homarus gammarus would sexually interact and mate with male American lobsters Homarus americanus, recently introduced to Norwegian waters, if given the choice between the heterospecific and a conspecific male. Interactions between a mixed species pair of male lobsters and a single H. gammarus female were recorded during 1 wk periods in a large tank provided with 2 shelters. Trials included either dominant H. americanus or dominant H. gammarus males. The frequency and duration of social interactions such as aggression, shelter visits, shelter sharing, courtship and mating were analysed. Conspecific courtship occurred in 10 trials, and mating, in 5 trials. No sexual interactions occurred between species. H. gammarus females preferred to court and mate with a conspecific male irrespective of its dominance status. In addition, the H. americanus males showed no sexual response to the European females. Females visited conspecific male shelters more frequently than heterospecific male shelters. They received longer visits from the conspecific than from the heterospecific male. Conspecific pairs shared shelters more frequently and over longer periods of time than heterospecific pairs. Conspecific shelter sharing often included courtship, while heterospecific interactions were generally of aggressive nature, with lobsters fighting over shelter. The results suggest that <b>European</b> <b>lobsters</b> are able to recognize conspecific mates, perhaps by chemical signals, and that these signals serve as pre-mating barriers preventing hybridisation...|$|R

Considering the ecological and commercial importance of the <b>European</b> spiny <b>lobster</b> (Palinurus elephas (Fabricius, 1787)) {{in most parts of the}} Mediterranean coastal area, in the present study we investigated whether shipping noise pollution contribute to changing the immune parameters of stress in the <b>European</b> spiny <b>lobster.</b> The animals were exposed to a mix of noises produced by different typologies of the boat played back in a tank, and the values of cellular and humeral parameters were evaluated. Total haemocyte count (THC), haemolymphatic protein concentration, phenoloxidase (PO) activity in cell-free haemolymph, and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp 27) expression in haemocyte lysate were considered potential biomarkers of stress. THC and PO activity decreased significantly, whereas total protein and Hsp 27 expression increased significantly.

Individual females mated up to 5 times with different males, showing that previously inseminated females were still attractive to males. Thus, male but not female olfaction is crucial for intermolt mating in H. gammarus, indicating the presence of a female sex pheromone during the entire female molt cycle, not only at the time of molting.

Furthermore, in contrast to earlier studies, age was also closely, but nonlinearly, related to carapace length (r 2 = 0. 78). Comparison of lipofuscin and carapace length as age predictors nevertheless showed that lipofuscin produced significantly more accurate estimates of age than carapace length. The relatively small difference in the precision of age estimation between lipofuscin and carapace length emphasises the importance of evaluating the relationship between age and carapace length/lipofuscin in studies of populations with variable environmental conditions or demographic processes.

40|$|In September 2008, Lamlash Bay became Scotland’s {{first and}} only fully {{protected}} marine reserve. Dive surveys conducted {{over a period of}} four years revealed the abundance of juvenile scallops to be 2 - 5 times greater within this marine reserve than outside. Generalised linear models showed that this greater abundance was related to a greater presence of macroalgae and hydroids growing within the boundaries of the reserve. My study also indicated that the age, size and reproductive biomass of adult king scallops were all significantly greater within the reserve. Similarly, potting surveys conducted over a two year period showed <b>European</b> <b>lobsters</b> were significantly larger and more fecund within the reserve than on neighbouring fishing grounds. However, differences between the reserve and outside were less clear after I explored benthic and fish communities within and around Lamlash Bay.

In contrast, comparisons of the abundance of mobile benthic fauna and fish revealed no difference between the reserve and outside. This was likely due to the young age of the reserve (5 years) and its small size (2. 67 km 2), both of which are known to reduce the effects of marine reserves on mobile species. Overall, my results are consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can promote the density, size and age structure of commercially exploited species to return to more natural levels.

40|$|The {{availability}} of breeding sites has been predicted {{to affect the}} intensity of sexual selection, including mate competition, mate choice and ultimately, variation in mating success. We tested the hypothesis that reduced density of shelters would cause {{an increase in the}} intensity of sexual selection in <b>European</b> <b>lobsters,</b> Homarus gammarus. However, we found little support for our predictions. For example, within-sex competition by males and by females was not more intense when shelters were scarce. Indeed, females attempted to evict one another from shelters significantly more often when shelters were common. When shelters were abundant, shelter-holding males had greater mating success than males without shelters, yet females did not show more interest towards these males during courtship encounters. Mate attraction was more strongly related to large male body size when shelters were scarce. Overall, the results suggest that reduced shelter density does not lead to more overt within-sex aggression in this species. Instead, we suggest that impacts of breeding resource availability on sexual selection may depend on the range over which resources are measured, with extreme scarcity of shelters rendering overt competition uneconomical. Furthermore, females may become more selective of male traits such as large size, which enhance male control of breeding sites and hence protection of females.
