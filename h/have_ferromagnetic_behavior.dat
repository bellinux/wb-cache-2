40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a CVD {{method is}} used for the {{synthesis}} of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) which have been purified and functionalized. The approach consists of thermal oxidation and subsequent chemical oxidation. Accord-ing to TEM images, the CNTs have a diameter about 20 - 30 nm. We synthesized the FePt nanoparticles {{on the surface of the}} functionalized carbon nanotubes through a polyol process. The synthesized FePt nanoparticles have the chemically-disordered face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with superparamagnetic behavior and with a size of about 2. 5 nm. To achieve phase transition from fcc to ordered structure (fct-L 10 phase), high-temperature annealing under a reducing at-mosphere (90 % Ar + 10 % H 2) is required. The CNTs as a substrate prevent the aggregation of particles during thermal treatment. The FePt nanoparticles after phase transition <b>have</b> <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>behavior.</b> Furthermore, they have finite size with an average about 5. 6 nm and their coercivity reaches to 5. 1 KOe at 700 °C.
