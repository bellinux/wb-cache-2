2500|$|Nevertheless, young Habib {{spent his}} summer {{vacations}} in Monastir, among women who he helped with chores: help the servant called Fatma, bring the Baklava tray {{to the oven}} of uncle Hamida, monitor cooking then basting a ladle of honey or participating in the olive grove process. He also {{spent a lot of}} time with his father who insisted that he pursued with a studious education so he could avoid Ali's fate in the army: [...] "I do not want you to be cut back like a workhorse. I do not want you to be like me, sentenced to wear a kit on your shoulders, all day long", <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> his son. At the end of the holidays, he returned to his brother's in Tunis where, after lessons, he strolled streets and admired the bey coming, on each Thursday to the Kasbah, to chair the seal ceremony. He was also marked with the 2011 Jellaz Affair which ended with the execution of Manoubi Djardjar in Bab Saadoun, where he noticed the hostility and mocking laughter of preponderants. The exiles and repression following the Tramway boycott aiming to protest against the Jellaz issue, soon created an atmosphere of revolt and contestation.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{was that}} you said?" [...] asked Mrs. Boulte. [...] "Never mind that man. What did Ted say to you? What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you? What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Professor Dobbs, your geologian, what <b>does</b> <b>HE</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> this {{frequent}} {{recurrence of}} the conglomerate sandstone period in your study?" [...] I asked quickly.|$|R
6000|$|When Bathurst ceased, a hubbub {{of voices}} arose, the Sepoy {{officers}} protesting that the surrender {{should be made}} to them. It was some minutes before anything like quietness was restored, and then one of the officers said, [...] "Here is Rujub; he speaks in the name of Nana. What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She read on, 'Goodness me--and that isn't all. He is {{actually}} the reviewer of Elfride's book. How absurd, to be sure! I {{had no idea he}} reviewed novels or {{had anything to do with}} the PRESENT. He is a barrister--and I thought he only wrote in the Quarterlies. Why, Elfride, you have brought about an odd entanglement! What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gildersleeve {{echoed the}} phrase in a startled cry. [...] "To Devonshire, Gwendoline! To Devonshire! <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Devonshire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} {{whatever}} you like,--here or anywhere else, {{as far as}} the vicarage goes. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you this morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the offer? did he {{not make}} any {{comments}} on it? He was not offended at it, I hope," [...] demanded Mr. Benfield.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> my mistress, {{who was in}} the room, [...] "This is a {{very serious}} case," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "I {{recommend}} you to write to Lady Glyde's friends directly." [...] My mistress <b>says</b> <b>to</b> him, [...] "Is it heart-disease?" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Yes, heart-disease of a most dangerous kind." [...] He told her exactly what he thought was the matter, which I was not clever enough to understand. But I know this, <b>he</b> ended by <b>saying</b> that <b>he</b> was afraid neither his help nor any other doctor's help was likely to be of much service.|$|R
6000|$|... “Mr. Holt, qui pensoit à tout,” says Blaise, “gets off his horse, {{examines}} {{the pockets of}} the dead officer for papers, gives his money to us two, and says, ‘The wine is drawn, monsieur le marquis,’—why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> marquis <b>to</b> monsieur le vicomte?—‘we must drink it.’ ...|$|R

"Mr. Holt, qui pensait a tout," [...] says Blaise, [...] "gets off his horse, {{examines}} {{the pockets of}} the dead officer for papers, gives his money to us two, and says, 'The wine is drawn, M. le Marquis,'--why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> Marquis <b>to</b> M. le Vicomte?--'we must drink it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{never had}} an idea of it; but I might have guessed from what fell from him unconsciously, for not a word would he have said--nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> show how he sacrificed himself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo {{clapped her}} hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, [...] "You are almost equal to Caroline Percy, {{who was a}} pattern of prudence! Tell on, Meg. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, hush!" [...] (putting {{her fingers}} in her ears) [...] "you crack my tympanums with your rude Anglicisms. But, how is our well-beloved John? Do tell me about him. The poor man must be in a sad way. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> my {{behaviour}} the other night? Wasn't I cruel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am terrified," [...] she said. [...] "Monsieur {{must come}} to my apartments one afternoon, where we can talk without fear. There is one more question, though," [...] she {{continued}} rapidly. [...] "Louis looked often at us. Tell me, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>to</b> you about Monsieur Bartot and myself?" ...|$|R
50|$|During the disembarkation, Shafter sent forward Fifth Corps' Cavalry Division under Joseph Wheeler to reconnoiter {{the road}} to Santiago de Cuba. In a {{complete}} disregard of orders, Wheeler brought on a fight which escalated into the Battle of Las Guasimas. Shafter apparently did not realize the battle was even underway nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>to</b> Wheeler about it afterward.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Nat?" [...] {{questioned}} Ben. [...] "Of {{course you}} haven't {{got to tell}} us if you don't want to," [...] he added, hastily.|$|R
6000|$|How is this? What is {{this strange}} thing, without which even the true {{knowledge}} of doctrine {{is of no}} use; which, if a man, or a nation has not, he is poor, and blind, and wretched, and naked in soul, {{in spite of all}} his religion? Isaiah will tell us--What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the Jews in his day? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was always}} arrogant and always hard. I can {{remember}} her just the same; {{but that was}} so many years ago. She left Bragton then because she could not banish his mother from the house. But to bear it all in her heart so long is not like a human being,--let alone a woman. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you going home yesterday?" ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{needless to}} make any attempt at trying to {{describe}} Seth's condition of mind, for it may readily be understood that his grief was great. More than once <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> himself {{it would be better}} to tell Aunt Hannah all; but each time he understood, or believed he did, that by such a course he should not only be cutting himself off from all possibility of remaining longer at the farm, but would be forfeiting her friendship.|$|E
6000|$|Does any {{one still}} doubt that men may be changed into beasts? Call Lucian, call Apuleius, call Homer, whose {{story of the}} companions of Ulysses made swine of by Circe, says Bodin, n'est pas fable. If that arch-patron of sorcerers, Wierus, is still unconvinced, and pronounces the whole thing a {{delusion}} of diseased imagination, what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Nebuchadnezzar? Nay, let St. Austin be subpoenaed, who declares that [...] "in his time among the Alps sorceresses were common, who, by making travellers eat of a certain cheese, changed them into beasts of burden and then back again into men." [...] Too confiding tourist, beware of Gruyère, especially at supper! Then, there was the Philosopher Ammonius, whose lectures were constantly attended by an ass,--a phenomenon not without parallel in more recent times, and all the more credible to Bodin, who had been professor of civil law.|$|R
60|$|I knew a {{woman that}} was so {{dexterous}} with a fellow, who indeed deserved no better usage, {{that while he was}} busy with her another way, conveyed his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fob-pocket, where he had put it for fear of her, and put another purse with gilded counters in it into the room of it. After <b>he</b> had <b>done,</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> her, 'Now han't you picked my pocket?' She jested with him, and told him she supposed he had not much to lose; he put his hand to his fob, and with his fingers felt that his purse was there, which fully satisfied him, and so she brought off his money. And this was a trade with her; she kept a sham gold watch, that is, a watch of silver gilt, and a purse of counters in her pocket to be ready on all such occasions, and I doubt not practiced it with success.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the loving}} Lord has {{patience}} with us, {{as he had}} with Adam, and does not take us at our word. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Adam, You lay the blame upon your wife; then I will take her from you, and you shall see then where the blame lies. Ungrateful to me! you shall live henceforth alone. And <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not <b>say</b> <b>to</b> us, You make all the blessings which I have given you an excuse for sinning! Then I will take them from you, and leave you miserable, and pour out my wrath upon you to the uttermost! ...|$|R
60|$|Abercrombie Smith was not {{an entirely}} {{pleasant}} man to have as an enemy. Slow and easy-tempered, he was formidable when driven to action. He brought to every purpose in life the same deliberate resoluteness which had distinguished him as a scientific student. He had laid his studies aside for a day, but he intended that the day should not be wasted. Not a word <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> his host as to his plans, but by nine o'clock he was {{well on his way}} to Oxford.|$|E
60|$|No word <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me as to my {{dwelling}} on with him, yet there I remained, by common consent, as it were. Indeed on the morrow of my coming a tailor appeared to measure me for such garments {{as he thought}} I should wear, by his command, I suppose, as I was never asked for payment, and he bade me furnish my chamber to my own liking, also another room {{at the back of}} the house that was much larger than it seemed, which he told me was to be mine to work in, though at what I was to work he did not say.|$|E
6000|$|For {{you must}} {{remember}} {{that there was a}} class of sinners in Judaea, to whom our Lord speaks no word of pity or forgiveness: namely, the very men who were his own personal enemies, who were persecuting him, and going about to kill him; and that therefore, by any hard words toward them, he must have laid himself open, just as much as David laid himself open, to the imputation of personal spite. And yet, what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the scribes and Pharisees: 'Ye go about to kill me, and therefore I am bound to say nothing harsh concerning you'? What he did say was this: 'Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> used <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that roads-instead {{were never}} as good, for such purposes, as land that's locked havens, for the anchors would return home, {{as he called}} it, in roads-instead." ...|$|R
6000|$|But what <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> the Directors? <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Upon {{the whole}} of these transactions, which to you, who are {{accustomed}} to view business in an official and regular light, may appear unprecedented, if not improper, I have but a few short remarks to suggest to your consideration." [...] He looks upon them and treats them {{as a set of}} low mechanical men, a set of low-born book-keepers, as base souls, who in an account call for explanation and precision. If there is no precision in accounts, there is nothing of worth in them. You see he himself is an eccentric accountant, a Pindaric book-keeper, an arithmetician in the clouds. [...] "I know," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "what the Directors desire: but they are mean people; they are not of elevated sentiments; they are modest; they avoid ostentation in taking of bribes: I therefore am playing cups and balls with them, letting them see a little glimpse of the bribes, then carrying them fairly away." [...] Upon this he founds the applause of his own breast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{suppose it}} comes to this, {{that he has a}} new pair {{whenever}} he wants them. But what constitutes the want? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>say</b> <b>to</b> himself that they'll do for another Sunday? I remember the bishop coming here once, and he had a hole {{at the end of his}} thumb. I was going to be confirmed, and I remember thinking that he ought to have been smarter." ...|$|R
60|$|I knew, too, {{that her}} concern at my state was the greater {{because it was}} not her first {{experience}} of a trouble of this kind. My elder long- absent brother had scarcely ceased to be a boy before throwing off all belief in the Christian creed and congratulating himself on having got rid of old wives' fables, as he scornfully expressed it. But never a word <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her of this change, and without a word she knew it, and when she spoke to us on the subject nearest to her heart and he listened in respectful silence, she knew the thought and feeling--that was in him-that he loved her above everybody but was free of her creed.|$|E
6000|$|... "O mother, mother, {{listen to}} me, to Rima, your beloved child!" [...] she began. [...] "All these years I have been wickedly deceived by grandfather--Nuflo--the old man that found you. Often have I {{spoken to him}} of Riolama, where you once were, and your people are, and he denied all {{knowledge}} of such a place. Sometimes {{he said that it}} was at an immense distance, in a great wilderness full of serpents larger than the trunks of great trees, and of evil spirits and savage men, slayers of all strangers. At other times he affirmed that no such place existed; that it was a tale told by the Indians; such false things <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me--to Rima, your child. O mother, can you believe such wickedness? ...|$|E
60|$|On this {{representation}} {{he conceded}} a little space, {{for the sake}} of her good name. But the destined day of their marriage at last arrived, and it was a gay time for the villagers and all concerned, and the bells in the parish church rang from noon till night. Thus at last she was united to the man who had loved her the most tenderly of them all, who but for his reticence might perhaps have been the first to win her. Often <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> himself; 'How wondrous that her words should have been fulfilled! Many a truth hath been spoken in jest, but never a more remarkable one!' The noble lady herself preferred not to dwell on the coincidence, a certain shyness, if not shame, crossing her fair face at any allusion thereto.|$|E
6000|$|Christ {{comes to}} us in many ways. But most surely does Christ come to us, and often most happily, and most clearly <b>does</b> <b>He</b> speak to us--in {{the face of a}} little child, fresh out of heaven. Ah, let us take heed that we despise not one of these little ones, lest we despise our Lord Himself. For as often as we enter into communion with little children, so often does Christ come to us. So often, as in Judaea of old, <b>does</b> <b>He</b> take a little child and set him in the midst of us, that from its simplicity, docility, and trust--the restless, the mutinous, and the ambitious may learn the things which belong to their peace--so often <b>does</b> <b>He</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> us, [...] "Except ye be changed and become as this little child, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. For I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{perceive}} the distinction," [...] said M. Danton, and sneered. [...] "You've an ingenious mind." [...] He turned to Le Chapelier. [...] "What <b>did</b> you <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was <b>to</b> begin with--a lawyer, wasn't it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|At Sirens Nightclub, Jervis Tetch (Benedict Samuel) {{performs}} an hypnosis {{show to the}} audience, to Barbara's (Erin Richards) delight but Tabitha's (Jessica Lucas) concern. He {{selects a}} man of the audience to be his volunteer after seeing his wife's collar. After performing the hypnosis on the man, he whispers something to him before freeing him from the hypnosis. Barbara questions whether people can <b>do</b> anything <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> which Tetch explains, [...] "only things they secretly wish to do".|$|R
