40|$|PURPOSE Gender {{differences}} in paediatric patients with {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) are frequently reported as a secondary outcome {{and the results are}} divergent. To assess gender differences by analysing data collected within the Swiss IBD cohort study database since 2008, related to children with IBD, using the Montreal classification for a systematic approach. METHODS Data on gender, age, anthropometrics, disease location at diagnosis, disease behaviour, and therapy of 196 patients, 105 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 91 with ulcerative or indeterminate colitis (UC/IC) were retrieved and analysed. RESULTS THE CRUDE <b>GENDER</b> <b>RATIO</b> (<b>MALE</b> : <b>female)</b> of patients with CD diagnosed at 10 years a more important use of azathioprine was observed. No other gender difference was found after analysis of age, disease location and behaviour at diagnosis, duration of disease, familial occurrence of IBD, prevalence of extra-intestinal manifestations, complications, and requirement for surgery. CONCLUSION CD in children < 10 years affects predominantly boys with a sex ratio of 2. 57; the impact of sex-hormones on the development of CD in pre-pubertal male patients should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{regional}} difference of death from intentional self-harm. The analysis was based on data of intentional self-harm deaths (31, 450) from the 2010 - 2011 vital statistics of Korea. The suicide rate (per 100, 000 population) was 46. 2 in male and 22. 3 in <b>female.</b> <b>Gender</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>male</b> / <b>female)</b> of suicide rate was 2. 07, and Jeju province had the lowest <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> (1. 82), and Chungbuk province had the highest <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> (2. 42). In the age-gender standardized death rate (per 100, 000) of self-harm by region, the highest suicide rate was observed in Gangwon province (44. 8) and Chungnam province (44. 3), and the lowest in Seoul metropolitan city (28. 9) and Ulsan metropolitan city (29. 2). There was a significant increase in the rate of suicide in city areas (odds ratio: 1. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 08 - 1. 13), county areas (1. 62, 1. 56 - 1. 67) as compared with the rate of suicide in metropolitan areas. The commonest methods of suicide were hanging (53. 7 percent), self-poisoning by pesticides (16. 8 percent) and jumping from a height (14. 3 percent). The methods used for suicide differed between rural (county) and urban areas (metropolitan city and city). In county areas, 43 percent of suicides used pesticides as compared to only 7 - 18 percent of those in urban areas. In urban areas, jumping was more common (13 - 17 percent vs. 6 percent). There were no difference in hanging between urban and rura...|$|R
30|$|We can {{see that}} the {{increase}} in the domestic migration rate (the proportion of domestic migrants), the home-renting factor, the proportion of people who can work but do not work, and GDP per capita, among others, can notably increase crime rates. An increase in the proportion of the retired and household personnel will lead to a decline in the crime rate. These five variables are highly significant and are relatively robust. An increase in the <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>male</b> to <b>female</b> in the youth can increase the crime rate, and an increase in average years of education and government public expenses will decrease the crime rate. The findings on these three variables are consistent in direction but not in significance. No clear evidence was found on whether an increase in the proportion of youth and the population’s urbanization rate will decrease crime, which {{may be due to the}} existence of their simultaneous effects on increasing and decreasing crime.|$|R
40|$|Background Nowadays, the {{epidemiological}} {{report and}} study about the intracranial aneurysms in young adults are very rare, especially in China. This paper aims {{to investigate the}} epidemiological and imaging features of intracranial aneurysms in young adults with the age of 16 - 29 years old. Methods Clinical data of 2119 patients with intracranial aneurysms admitted from January 2010 to October 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Results Intracranial aneurysms in young adults (16 - 29 years old) accounted for 1. 93 % of all intracranial aneurysms (41 / 2119) treated in the same period, and the <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> (<b>male</b> : <b>female)</b> was 2. 15 : 1. A total of 42 intracranial aneurysms were found in 41 patients, including 35 located in the anterior circulation and 7 in the posterior circulation, of which 13 aneurysms (30. 95 %) in the anterior communicating artery, 6 aneurysms (14. 29 %) each in the middle cerebral artery and the distal of anterior cerebral artery, and 2 aneurysms (4. 76 %) in the posterior communicating artery. There were almost 34 aneurysms (80. 95 %) located in bifurcation of Willis circle and proximal aorta and 8 aneurysms (19. 05 %) in the branches of artery. The diameter of aneurysms were ≤ 5 mm in 19 aneurysms (45. 24 %), 6 - 10 mm in 13 (30. 95 %), 11 - 24 mm in 3 (7. 14 %) and ≥ 25 mm in 7 (16. 67 %). Conclusion Young men are much more susceptible to intracranial aneurysms than young women, but the incidence in women increases as they grow old. The anterior communicating artery is the predilection site of intracranial aneurysms in young adults (16 - 29 years old), and the occurence of giant aneurysms and the aneurysms in the posterior circulation and the distal of anterior cerebral artery is common. The epidemiological and imaging features and <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> of intracranial aneurysms in young adults (16 - 29 years old) {{are similar to those}} in children and adolesents, but much different from adult patients...|$|R
30|$|Discussions of the {{education}} factor in crime {{can be found in}} Freeman (1996); Lochner and Moretti (2004). Although it is difficult to tell whether the relationship between the unemployment rate and the crime rate is causal or correlational, the unemployment rate is a good predictor of crime, especially of property crime (Cantor and Land 1985; Aaltonen et al. 2013). Marriage and families can make people happier and healthier (Waite 1995), and reduce crime (Laub et al. 1998; Sampson et al. 2006). Age is a commonly recognized factor in criminology (Hirschi and Gottfredson 1983; Farrington 1986). The <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> of <b>males</b> to <b>females,</b> especially when the proportion of males among the young population is high, can increase crime on both the micro and macro level, though it has some reverse effect at the macro level through the increasing stability of the family (Messner and Sampson 1991). For China, research on both the macro level (Edlund et al. 2013) and the macro to micro level (Yang et al. 2016) find an association between <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> and crime. Some research notes the influence of urbanization on the crime rate, which to some extent {{can be attributed to the}} economic temptation in cities (Glaeser and Sacerdote 1999).|$|R
40|$|This {{descriptive}} {{cross-sectional study}} {{was carried out}} in seven health facilities to determine the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) sero-prevalence and risk behaviors among two groups of tuberculosis patients in Khartoum State. Three hundred and two patients were screened for HIV infection by using an Enzyme Immuno-assay (EIA) test and reactive specimens were confirmed by another EIA test of different formatting. Three hundred and two patients were interviewed by using structured pre-tested questionnaire which consisted of six sections concerned with the socio- demographic profile of the respondents, awareness about HIV/AIDS, its mode of transmission and prevention, recognition and use of male condom, history of sexually transmitted infections, available mass media, history of TB disease and treatment. The epidemiological survey results revealed that the overall HIV seroprevalence among the patients was 7. 6 %. Bivariate analysis revealed that, age and gender have no effect on the susceptibility of the TB patients to get HIV infection. Median age of respondents of the first group among whom sero-survey was carried out was 31 years and <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> between <b>males</b> and <b>females</b> was 2. 5 : 1. Socio-demographic profile of the second group showed that median age of participants was also 31 years. <b>Gender</b> <b>ratio</b> between <b>males</b> and <b>females</b> was 1. 8 : 1. More than 40 % of the respondents were illiterate and 48. 7 % were originally from the Western States of the Sudan. One fifth of the patients had previous blood transfusion or surgical interventions. The majority of the patients (73. 5 %) were aware of AIDS and there was a statistical significant difference between <b>males</b> and <b>females,</b> among age groups, different occupations and education levels, regarding knowledge about AIDS and male condom(p< 0. 001). VIII About 48 % could recognize a single symptom of AIDS and 54 % could not identify the germ that causes it and 21. 2 % do not know any prevention method. Only 9. 3 % of the patients had been tested before for HIV infection. About 79 % never saw or heard about the male condom and 80. 8 % said had never had any sexual relations before and only 2 % had been sexually active before marriage. A total of 16. 3 % of patients complained of different STIs symptoms. Only 20. 2 % of respondents received educational material about AIDS. Sixty nine percent of the patients had the TB disease for a year or less. From this study it is concluded that the HIV seroprevalence among TB patients is higher than in previous survey conducted by the Sudan National AIDS Control Programme in 2002 and the information and education about HIV/AIDS are still weak. It is recommended to make use of all available sources that would ensure maximum spread of information regarding HIV transmission, prevention and control and efforts should be intensified to provide HIV screening for all TB patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Worldwide the {{incidence}} of cancers is increasing and this seen more in developing nations. This study looks at the spectrum of cancers among South Asian nationals working in Brunei Darussalam, a developing Southeast Asia nation. Materials and Methods: The cancer registry from 1994 to 2012 maintained by the State Laboratory was retrospectively reviewed. Results: Over the period, there was a total of 123 cancer cases diagnosed among South Asians, giving an incidence of 1. 5 % (n = 123 / 8253). The mean age at diagnosis was 42. 9 ± 17. 1 with a <b>gender</b> <b>ratio</b> of (<b>male</b> 60; <b>female</b> 63). Among the South Asians, Indians accounted for the most (53. 7 %) cases, followed by Nepalese (39. 8 %), Pakistani (3. 3 %) and Sri Lankan (2. 4 %). The most common cancers were cancers of the female reproductive/gynecologic organs, gastrointestinal tract, and breast. Among the two major ethnic groups; cancers of the breast {{was the most common}} among Indians followed by gastrointestinal tract where among the Nepalese, these were gastrointestinal tract followed by gynecologic (esp. cervical cancers). Among the South Asian, the Nepalese were younger at diagnosis compared to the other groups. Conclusion: The spectrum of cancers among South Asian residing in Brunei is comparable to what have been reported from South Asia with the exception of lung cancers. The most common cancers were cancers of female reproductive/gynecologic organs, gastrointestinal tract and breast. South Asians were younger at diagnosis of cancers compared to non-South Asians...|$|R

40|$|Background: Flowering {{synchrony}} and floral {{sex ratio}} {{have the potential}} to influence the mating opportunities and reproductive success through female function. Here, we examine the variances in synchronous display of <b>female</b> and <b>male</b> function, <b>ratio</b> of <b>male</b> to <b>female</b> flowers per day and subsequently reproductive output in small populations of two monoecious plants, Sagittaria trifolia and Sagittaria graminea. Methodology/Principal Finding: We created plant populations of size 2, 4, 10 and 20 and recorded the daily number of blooming <b>male</b> and <b>female</b> flowers per plant to determine daily floral display, flowering synchrony index and <b>ratio</b> of <b>male</b> to <b>female</b> flowers per day. We also harvested the fruits, counted the seeds and calculated the number of fruits and seeds per flower to measure reproductive success through female function. There is less overlap in flowering time of <b>female</b> and <b>male</b> function in smaller populations than in larger populations. Most importantly, we found that male-biased floral sex ratio and imbalanced display period of <b>female</b> and <b>male</b> function for individual plant can lead to a population-size-dependent <b>ratio</b> of <b>male</b> to <b>female</b> flowers per day. Increasing <b>ratio</b> of <b>male</b> to <b>female</b> flowers per day was generally associated with a greater percentage of fruit production.
