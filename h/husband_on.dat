5|$|At {{the last}} minute, Thumbelina escapes the {{situation}} by fleeing to a far land with a swallow she nursed back to health during the winter. In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of wings to accompany her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia.|$|E
5|$|Having firmly {{assisted}} {{and supported}} her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, {{to achieve the}} political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted barely a year. For over thirty years following her death, he wandered in a political wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.|$|E

They were saved in an 8-person eviction on day 22 however, they were evicted on day 25 against Kim Woodburn, Jessica Cunningham, Bianca Gascoigne and Jedward. Montag and Pratt were reunited with their rival, Rylan Clark-Neal, on Big Brother's Bit on the Side that night.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 1901, {{nine days}} after {{arriving}} back in Britain {{and on the}} King's sixtieth birthday, George was created Prince of Wales. The family moved their London residence from St James's Palace to Marlborough House. As Princess of Wales, May accompanied her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> trips to Austria-Hungary and Württemberg in 1904. The following year, {{she gave birth to}} her last child, John. It was a difficult labour, and although she recovered quickly, her newborn son suffered respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{underwent}} surgery for lung cancer in 1974 {{after decades of}} heavy smoking. In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, allowed Evva Pryor, a social worker from her attorney's office, to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare. During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially {{after the death of}} her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> November 9, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.|$|E

5|$|Una Aue / Frau Von Üxküll – Una Aue is Maximilien's twin sister. She {{is married}} to the aristocrat Berndt von Üxküll, and {{although}} she appears only briefly in person, she dominates Aue's imagination, particularly his sexual fantasies and hallucinations. She lived with her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> his estate in Pomerania, but apparently moved to Switzerland with him {{towards the end of}} the war. Like her husband, she is critical of Germany's National Socialist regime which, along with his hatred of their mother and stepfather, and his attraction to her, led to her being estranged from Aue following the war.|$|E
5|$|William and a tearful Mary {{were married}} in St James's Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on 4 November 1677. Mary {{accompanied}} her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> a rough sea crossing back to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and {{they were forced to}} land at the small village of Ter Heijde, and walk through the frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On 14 December, they made a formal entry to The Hague in a grand procession.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

50|$|As {{was typical}} of the army of William, in which wives {{accompanied}} their <b>husbands</b> <b>on</b> crusade, Corba went with Geoffrey to the Holy Land. Geoffrey was killed at the battled of Heraclea and Corba was abducted by the Turks and never heard from again.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence. However, due to the EPB's policies of anonymity, most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful <b>husband.</b> <b>On</b> January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E
5|$|Marcos {{initially}} {{needed to}} win votes of the delegates of the Nacionalista Party for the presidential candidacy. Imelda assumed the managerial position in her husband's campaign. The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would {{have a say in}} the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one who}} went through a detailed and personal campaign for her <b>husband.</b> <b>On</b> November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|Wallis {{had already}} {{filed for divorce}} from her second <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that he had {{committed}} adultery with her childhood friend Mary Kirk and the decree nisi was granted on 27 October 1936. In November, the King consulted with the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, on a way to marry Wallis and keep the throne. The King suggested a morganatic marriage, where he would remain king but Wallis would not be queen, but this was rejected by Baldwin and the Prime Ministers of Australia, Canada, and South Africa. If the King were to marry Wallis against Baldwin's advice, the Government {{would be required to}} resign, causing a constitutional crisis.|$|E

5|$|France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French officially {{declared}} Madagascar to {{be their}} colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year. The queen and much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister {{would need to be}} selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> the queen and would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|Gray became {{engaged to}} Jane Lathrop Loring of Boston in May 1847. Two of Gray's younger brothers, George and Joseph, were {{students}} at Harvard {{in the late}} 1840s and lived with Gray. During his junior year, George caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on January9, 1848, in the Loring house in Boston. This {{is part of the}} reason Gray's marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848. Gray and Jane Loring married on May4, 1848. Her parents were Charles Greely Loring, a member of the Harvard Corporation and a lawyer, and Anna Pierce (Brace) Loring. Her family was Unitarian, like most faculty and staff of Harvard at the time. Both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it. They had no children. Jane Gray accompanied her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> most of his expeditions. Gray was a devout Presbyterian and was a member of First Church in Cambridge, a Congregational church, where he served as a deacon. He was also an ardent empiricist in the tradition of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. When the congregation moved into its present building in 1872, at 11Garden Street, Gray planted two Kentucky yellowwood trees, Cladrastis kentukea, in front of the church. They stood until October 2014.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted that she be shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E

5|$|Louise {{returned}} to Britain, from Quebec, with her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> 27 October 1883, and landed at Liverpool. Queen Victoria had prepared apartments at Kensington Palace, {{and the couple}} took up official residence there. Louise retained those apartments until her death there 56 years later. Lorne resumed his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1896, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists. Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the Queen's attempts to keep them under one roof, they often went their separate ways. Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the Prince of Wales did not take to him. Out of all the royal family, Lorne {{was the only one}} to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|Tatlock {{broke up}} with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August that year he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening Harrison, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Harrison had been married three times previously. Her first {{marriage}} lasted only a few months. Her second husband was Joe Dallet, {{an active member of}} the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of Pennsylvania. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to Pasadena, California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in Reno, Nevada, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> November 1, 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard {{of the advice}} of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her <b>husband</b> <b>on</b> the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been {{made on the basis of}} significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E
