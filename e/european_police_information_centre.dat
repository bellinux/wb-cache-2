40|$|This article {{describes}} some common <b>police</b> <b>information</b> systems {{and practices in}} light of legislation designed to protect individual privacy. The author finds that policy personnel are sensitive to human rights issues and attempt to reduce threats posed {{by the use of}} <b>police</b> <b>information.</b> Threats are further mitigated by a lack of "soft" information in the national Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (CPIC) system and limitations on the ability to share electronically data in local agency records. However, the author also raises concerns about the quality and security of records, the level of training, questionable information practices, and pressures to link local records systems. These concerns merit more focused attention from policy exports. ...|$|R

50|$|Versaterm {{was founded}} in 1977 by {{principals}} after spending {{a number of years}} building and refining the Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (CPIC) computer system, the Canadian equivalent to NCIC and NLETS. From the beginning, the focus was to create advanced information and management systems for municipal Public Safety agencies. Versaterm has been doing Fire/Police/EMS systems for integrated dispatch and early emergency operations centers since 1985. The company went through several 'start over' product generations before adopting modern, open tools and environments in 1986. Since then, Versaterm products have been UNIX/Linux based, used RDBMS products and used other 'middleware' to assure that the products did not rely on any specific proprietary component.|$|R

50|$|Under provincial and {{municipal}} contracts the RCMP provides front-line policing {{in all areas}} outside of Ontario and Quebec {{that do not have}} an established local police force. There are detachments located in small villages in the far north, remote First Nations reserves, and rural towns, but also larger cities such as Surrey, British Columbia (population 468,251+). There, support units investigate for their own detachments, and smaller municipal police forces. Investigations include major crimes, homicides, forensic identification, collision forensics, police dogs, emergency response teams, explosives disposal, and undercover operations. Under its National Police Services branch the RCMP supports all police forces in Canada via the Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre,</b> Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, Forensic Science and Identification Services, Canadian Firearms Program, and the Canadian Police College.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, the EU {{dispatched}} {{the head}} of Germany's criminal investigation office Klaus Jansen to assess Bulgaria's progress in fighting organized crime. He concluded that Bulgaria had failed to implement modern principles and methods {{in the fight against}} crime, criticising among other things the low commitment of the country's police force to combat organized crime. The report further observed that [...] "indictments, prosecutions, trials, convictions and deterrent sentences remain rare in the fight against high-level corruption" [...] and described efforts to fight crime as [...] "a total mess". Jensen also suggested that <b>European</b> <b>police</b> <b>information</b> passed to Sofia could end up with criminals. In a reaction to the report, Interior Minister Rumen Petkov described the findings as exaggerated and protested against Jansen's way of presenting the situation in Bulgaria which, in his words, demonstrated his incompetence.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} court-ordered {{treatment}} for wife assault {{was assessed by}} monitoring 156 men who had completed such treatment for up to 11 years (mean = 5. 2 years) after treatment completion. Recidivist assault and wife assault was assessed through access to Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> data that record crimes committed anywhere in Canada. Comparisons were drawn between this group {{and a group of}} 167 dropouts from treatment (noncompleters), 32 men rejected for treatment because of resistance or denial (rejects), and 91 men who never appeared for their treatment assessment (no shows). Whereas time-to-failure failed to reveal significant between-group differences, a recidivism ratio (total repeat offenses per man-in-group) revealed significantly lower recidivism rates for treatment completers (. 23 versus. 50). No shows recidivated at an equal rate to completers. Some inferences are drawn about spiral models of behavioral change...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the characteristics of missing persons and to discover reasons why people go missing. The Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> data included 2290 unresolved missing person 2 ̆ 7 s cases in which the persons remain missing and spanned a fifty-four year period from 1950 to 2004 inclusive. The ultimate goal was to evaluate reasons and circumstances in which people go missing and determine how these trends have changed over the last five decades. Results indicate specific trends in missing cases in half a century. These include shifts in jurisdictional base lines; definite changes in probable cause of missing incidents; and differences in locations from which people go missing. Other trends remained constant, i. e., sex of persons with highest probability of going missing. Creating nationwide uniform categories gives police agencies standard criteria for recognizing missing persons cases, determining urgency, and possibly flagging links to violent crime...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, a {{conditional}} discharge is a sentence passed in criminal court {{in which an}} individual is found guilty of an offence but is deemed {{not to have been}} convicted. Although a discharge is not considered a conviction, a record of an absolute or {{conditional discharge}} is kept by Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (CPIC) and by the charging police agency and is purged from the individual's police record after a period of time: one year {{in the case of an}} absolute discharge, three years for a conditional one. The Criminal Records Act states that, except in exceptional circumstances, if the discharge is conditional, no record may be disclosed after three years. While no conviction occurs, the offender is required to fulfill certain conditions as part of the sentence. The offender is put on probation for a period of up to three years. If the offender fails to meet the conditions of the probation, or commits another criminal offence during the probation period, they may be returned to court where the discharge is cancelled and receive a criminal conviction and sentence on the original offence, and for breach of probation.|$|R
40|$|This study investigated, retrospectively, whether {{recidivism}} in {{a sample}} of court-ordered'graduates of an alcohol education and awareness program could be predicted. This alcohol education program was based on adult education principles and was philosophically akin to the thoughts of Drs. Jack Mezirow, Stephen Brookfield, and Patricia Cranton. Data on the sample of 214 Halton IDEA (Impaired Driver Education and Awareness) graduates were entered into a spread sheet. Descriptive statistics were generated. Each of the 214 program graduates had taken several tests {{during the course of the}} IDEA program. These tests measured knowledge, attitude about impaired driving, and degree of alcohol involvement. Test scores were analyzed to determine whether those IDEA graduates who recidivated differed in any measurable way from those who had no further criminal convictions after a period of at least three years. Their criminal records were obtained from the Canadian <b>Police</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> (CPIC). Those program graduates who reoffended were compared to the vast majority who did not reoffend. Results of the study indicated that there was no way to determine who would recidivate from the data that were collected. Further studies could use a qualitative model. Follow-up interviews could be used to determine what impact, if any, attendance at the IDEA program had on the life of the graduates...|$|R
