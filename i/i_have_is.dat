Despite Thi's {{good relations with the}} Buddhists in his area, most notably Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monks' support for Thi's removal. Quang used the crisis to highlight Buddhist calls for civilian rule. There were claims that Quang intended to challenge Kỳ, {{regardless of whether or not}} Thi had been cast aside.|$|E

Author Ian Inglis views [...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] as working as a straightforward love song, with Harrison's [...] "Let me into your heart" [...] serving as [...] "not a desperate plea but a reassuring conversation", and Dylan's [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> yours / All you see is mine" [...] providing the same [...] "element of reciprocity that distinguished the declaration of love" [...] in Harrison's song [...] "Something".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Turning Tables" [...] {{is a song}} of {{domestic}} dispute, where its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative ex-lover. Reconciling herself with the termination of a contentious relationship, she vows emotional distance to shield herself from future heartbreak. Bryan Boyd of The Irish Times likened the singer to 1980s Welsh rocker Bonnie Tyler in delivering the vocals {{with a mixture of}} anger, pain and pathos. According to Paste magazine, cinematic strings [...] "serve as fitting counterpoint to [...] heartbroken, hollowed-out lyrics." [...] "Turning Tables" [...] opens with a piano sequence after which Adele sings the first lines: [...] "Close enough to start a war/All that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> on the floor". The chorus consists of the lyrics: [...] "So I won't let you / Close enough to hurt me / No, I won't rescue / You to just desert me / I can't give you / The heart you think you gave me / It's time to say goodbye / To turning tables." ...|$|E

Since the 1998 Wimbledon Junior Championships Federer played with a Pro Staff 6.0 85 racquet.

His grip size was 4 3/8inches (sometimes referred to as L3). [...] Federer strung his racquets at 21.5kg mains/20kg crosses pre-stretched 20 percent, using Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough 16L gauge (polyester) for his cross strings. When asked about string tensions, Federer stated [...] "this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play.

Hoffman went to Savanna High School in Anaheim as had Glenn, which put pressure on Hoffman following his more talented older brother. Ed, who did not trust that coaches would protect Hoffman's arm, stopped allowing his son to pitch after he was 12 years old. Standing at just [...] and , Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna, but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school. He grew three inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College, and later for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989. [...] Arizona was afraid of the liability if Hoffman's remaining kidney got hit by a baseball. [...] "I told them the one kidney <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> on my right side. That's not the side that faces the pitcher when I hit, so it was O.K. They bought it", said Hoffman. He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a [...]371 batting average, 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow. Other notable teammates included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long. Hoffman exhibited a strong throwing arm playing shortstop.|$|E
500|$|The Confederate {{point of}} view for the battle was much {{different}} from the reports of the Union officers. Confederate General Jones reported [...] "The information <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> that the expedition started from Kanawha 1,200 or 1,300 strong, and that when it reached Fayetteville, on the return, it numbered but 500, only 300 of whom were mounted. The commander (Colonel Toland) and several other officers were killed, the second in command, Colonel Powell, and other officers wounded and captured. They admit a loss of more than 60 killed and wounded; it was probably much greater. Their dead bodies were scattered along the roads and mountain paths. [...] Our loss, as reported to me, was 1 captain and 5 men killed, and about double that number wounded." [...] The Reverend J. M. Wharey, who fought as a citizen of Wytheville during the raid, wrote [...] "...there was no telling what damage they would have done. Had Colonel Toland lived, the lead mines, the salt works, and the railroad bridges near Wytheville would have been at their mercy. So our little battle disconcerted their plans and the raid was a complete failure." ...|$|E
500|$|Kỳ claimed Thi {{was leaving}} the country to receive medical {{treatment}} for his nasal passages, {{as well as a}} general health examination. An official announcement said that the junta [...] "had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation". Thi retorted that [...] "The only sinus condition <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> from the stink of corruption." [...] With the health story exposed as a sham, Kỳ gave a series of reasons for dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, ruling I Corps like a warlord, having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial. Kỳ knew that Thi supported negotiations with the communists as a means of ending the war, and had a history of consistently removing officials and military figures who promoted such a policy, but did not publicly mention this as a reason. Thi's dismissal provoked the Buddhist Uprising, led by the [...] "Struggle Movement". Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Huế, a city of approximately 120,000, and civil unrest erupted throughout the region. When he returned to the former imperial capital five days after being relieved of his command, around 20,000 supporters mobbed him, shouting and trying to touch him. This was part of a gamble by Kỳ to allow Thi back to his home city in an attempt to placate the dismayed locals, but it did not work. A general strike incapacited 90% of Da Nang, the second biggest city in South Vietnam and the main port in central Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

His claims prove false, however, as he is arrested on false charges and then assassinated before his trial. Later in the play, Lord Saye makes a similar claim.

Many of his colleagues and friends and many people from Wexford and around the coast paid the ultimate price in serving this nation by losing their lives. The ships were so rickety, old and derelict that we would not go to sea in them today. Yet, these brave, perhaps foolhardy, men crossed the Atlantic, went to the Mediterranean and North African coast and kept Ireland supplied with vital provisions.
