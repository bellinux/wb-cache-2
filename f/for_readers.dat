40|$|PURPOSE: To {{retrospectively}} {{assess the}} frequency and performance of magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography to help diagnose acetabular cartilage delamination in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were waived for this retrospective study. Forty-four consecutive patients with FAI of the cam type were included (mean age, 30. 7 years; range, 16 - 49 years), including 30 men (mean age, 30. 5 years; range, 16 - 49 years) and 14 women (mean age, 31. 4 years; range, 18 - 48 years). The inclusion criteria were no previous surgery, surgery within 3 months after MR imaging, and availability of a detailed surgical report with acetabular cartilage findings. MR arthrographic findings were assessed independently by two blinded readers. Findings at surgery served as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and kappa statistics for interobserver agreement were calculated. RESULTS: At surgery, acetabular cartilage delamination was seen in 23 (52 %) of 44 patients (mean size of cartilage flap from acetabular rim, 7. 6 mm; range, 2 - 30 mm). At MR, patients with fluid signal intensity under the cartilage delamination had a respective sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 22 %, 95 %, and 57 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 1 and 30 %, 95 %, and 61 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 2. A hypointense line in the acetabular cartilage on sagittal three-dimensional double-echo steady-state images with water excitation demonstrated moderate diagnostic performance (respective sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 70 %, 57 %, and 64 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 1 and 70 %, 62 %, and 66 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 2). Hypointense areas in the acetabular cartilage were quite specific on both coronal intermediate-weighted fat-saturated images (respective sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 52 %, 90 %, and 70 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 1 and 74 %, 90 %, and 82 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 2) and coronal T 1 -weighted images (respective sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 35 %, 90 %, and 61 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 1 and 61 %, 95 %, and 77 % <b>for</b> <b>reader</b> 2). CONCLUSION: Cartilage delamination is common in patients undergoing surgery for FAI. Fluid under the cartilage delamination is a specific but rare finding. Hypointense areas in the acetabular cartilage seen on intermediate-weighted fat-saturated or T 1 -weighted images appear to be helpful diagnostic criteria...|$|R

5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult <b>for</b> <b>readers</b> to understand.|$|E

5|$|The Tempest {{presents}} {{relatively few}} textual problems {{in comparison with}} many of Shakespeare's other plays. First published in the First Folio in December 1623, the play is first in the volume, leading the section of comedies. The play has more stage directions than any of Shakespeare's other plays, though {{they appear to have}} been written <b>for</b> <b>readers</b> instead of actors. Scholars infer from this that the editors of the volume, John Heminges and Henry Condell, included the directions to aid readers, and they were not necessarily Shakespeare's. Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some think was an interpolated afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613. However, other scholars see this as unlikely, arguing that taking the masque out of the play creates more problems than it solves.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to helping Stone develop as an orator, the antislavery agency {{introduced her to}} a network of progressive reformers within the Garrisonian wing of the abolition movement who assisted her women’s rights work. In the fall of 1848, she received an invitation from Phoebe Hathaway of Farmington, New York, to lecture for the women who had organized the Seneca Falls women’s rights convention and the Rochester women’s rights convention earlier that summer. These rights convention provided continuity for the woman's rights movement, even though no official organization was actually formed prior to the Civil War. Most of the well-known leaders at the time attended these conventions, except {{for those who were}} ill or sick. The best-known of them, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone, met, and worked together harmoniously as they wrote, discussed, and circulated petitions for the woman's rights movement. Although Stone accepted and expected to begin working for them in the fall of 1849, the agency never materialized. In April, 1849, Stone was invited to lecture for the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society, and Lucretia Mott took advantage of her presence to hold Pennsylvania’s first women’s rights meeting on May 4, 1849. With the help of abolitionists, Stone conducted Massachusetts’ first petition campaigns for the right of women to vote and hold public office. Wendell Phillips drafted the first petitions and accompanying appeals for circulation, and William Lloyd Garrison published them in the Liberator <b>for</b> <b>readers</b> to copy and circulate.
