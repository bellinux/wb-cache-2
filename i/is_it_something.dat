25|$|For Anaximander, the {{principle}} of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth. Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature — for example, water can only be wet, never dry — and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could {{any of the other}} candidates. He postulated the apeiron as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.|$|E
500|$|On the {{critical}} side, The Daily Telegraphs Jenny McCartney dismissed the metaphors {{in the chorus}} and thought the song's topic was over-hyped. She disagreed with {{the critical}} praise, arguing that women accept abusive relationships for deeper reasons than sexual and emotional pleasure, such as family and financial issues and helplessness. In an NPR article, the writer Maura Johnston commented that the lyrics portray Rihanna as the subject of Eminem's violence. Jay Smooth, a New York radio personality, responded that [...] "while Eminem explores the psyche of the abuser with an almost disturbing amount of depth and detail," [...] Rihanna's perspective is downplayed and not explained fully. Johnston and Smooth wrote that such imbalances are a prevalent issue in popular music duets. To Sady Doyle, although [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] is one of Eminem's most affecting tracks and finds him remorseful, {{it does not make}} up for his past misogynistic actions and hateful songs. Noveck questioned whether the lyrics are [...] "a treatise against (or apology for) domestic violence, or an irresponsible glorification of it?

Is it {{a good thing to}} find out you have been deceived or <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>something</b> that makes you angry? Kierkegaard had already discussed anger in his Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 where he quoted The Epistle of James, Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger, because man’s anger does not work what is righteous before God. (James 1:17-22) Earlier in the same discourse he had discussed equality. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. He asks pointed questions, [...] "Did the woman who was a sinner feel her guilt more deeply when the scribes were accusing her than when there was no accuser anymore and she stood alone before the Lord! But you also realize that the most dangerously deceived person is the one who is self-deceived, that the most dangerous condition is that of the one who is deceived by much knowledge, and, furthermore, that it is a lamentable weakness to have one’s consolation in another’s light-mindedness, {{but it is also a}} lamentable weakness to have one’s terror from another’s heavy-mindedness.
