50|$|From (+)-sabinene (8), the {{proposed}} biosynthetic route to generate thujone follows a three-step pathway: (+)-sabinene is first oxidized to an isomer of (+)-sabinol (9-1,2) by a cytochrome P450 enzyme, followed by conversion to (+)-sabinone (10) via a dehydrogenase. Finally, a reductase mediates the conversion to α-thujone (11-1) and β-thujone (11-2). The isomerism of the (+)-sabinol intermediate varies among thujone-producing plants; for instance, {{in the western}} redcedar (Thuja plicata), thujone is derived exclusively from the (+)-trans-sabinol intermediate (9-1) whereas in the common <b>garden</b> <b>sage</b> (Salvia officinalis), thujone is formed from the (+)-cis-sabinol intermediate (9-2).|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{plants from}} the Lamiaceae family (rosemary, <b>garden</b> thyme, <b>sage)</b> are used mainly as natural antioxidants. However, their strong {{smell and taste}} are not {{desirable}} in the food industry. From this point of view, self-heal (Prunella vulgaris L.) {{can be considered as}} one of the most perspective plants, since it is almost taste-and odourless, and it is rich in phenolic compounds. Taking into account its advantageous characteristics, in 2005, we were the first who examined the morphological and chemical diversity of seven populations of self-heal collected from different natural habitats in Hungary. Our results were compared to a cultivated population, too. The total phenolic compounds (measured by modified method of SINGLETON & ROSSI, 1965) and the antioxidant powers (measured by the FRAP method), as well as the rosmarinic acid content of the samples were significantly different from each other. The highest total-phenol (0. 43 ± 0. 01 mg GAE ml− 1) and rosmarinic acid content (1. 84 ± 0. 03 mg g− 1) was observed in the one-year-old population under cultivation, while the strongest antioxidant activity was measured in the samples collected in Mátra Hills (0. 35 ± 0. 04 mg AAE ml− 1). According to our results, in the future, it will probably be possible to optimise the cultivation conditions of Prunella vulgaris providing high quality for the food-industry. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Low {{physical}} activity (PA) and {{fruit and vegetable}} (F&V) consumption in early childhood are continued public health challenges. This manuscript describes outcomes from two pilot studies for Sustainability via Active <b>Garden</b> Education (<b>SAGE),</b> {{a program designed to}} increase PA and F&V consumption among 3 to 5  year old children. Methods SAGE was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) and delivered to children (N[*]=[*] 89) in early care and education centers (ECEC, N[*]=[*] 6) in two US cities. Children participated in 12 one-hour sessions that included songs, games, and interactive learning activities involving garden maintenance and taste tests. We evaluated reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and potential for maintenance of SAGE following the RE-AIM framework. Reach was evaluated by comparing demographic characteristics among SAGE participants and residents of target geographic areas. Efficacy was evaluated with accelerometer-measured PA, F&V consumption, and eating in the absence of hunger among children, parenting practices regarding PA, and home availability of F&V. Adoption was evaluated by the number of ECEC that participated relative to the number of ECEC that were recruited. Implementation was evaluated by completion rates of planned SAGE lessons and activities, and potential for maintenance was evaluated with a parent satisfaction survey. Results SAGE reached ECEC in neighborhoods representing a wide range of socioeconomic status, with participants’ sociodemographic characteristics representing those of the intervention areas. Children significantly increased PA during SAGE lessons compared to usual lessons, but they also consumed more calories in the absence of hunger in post- vs. pre-intervention tests (both p[*]<[*]. 05). Parent reports did not suggest changes in F&V consumption, parenting PA practices, or home F&V availability, possibly due to low parent engagement. ECEC had moderate-to-high implementation of SAGE lessons and curriculum. Potential for maintenance was strong, with parents rating SAGE favorably and reporting increases in knowledge about PA and nutrition guidelines for young children. Conclusions SAGE successfully translated national PA guidelines to practice for young children but was less successful with nutrition guidelines. High adoption and implementation and favorable parent reports suggest high potential for program sustainability. Further work to engage parents and families of young children in ECEC-based PA and nutrition programming is needed...|$|R
6000|$|However {{mean your}} life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it {{and call it}} hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant, thrilling, glorious hours, even in a poorhouse. The setting sun is {{reflected}} from {{the windows of the}} almshouse as brightly as from the rich man's abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the spring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there, and have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town's poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any. Maybe they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they are above being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be more disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a <b>garden</b> herb, like <b>sage.</b> Do not trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or friends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change. Sell your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not want society. If I were confined to a corner of a garret all my days, like a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my thoughts about me. The philosopher said: [...] "From an army of three divisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought." [...] Do not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and meanness gather around us, [...] "and lo! creation widens to our view." [...] We are often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of Croesus, our aims must still be the same, and our means essentially the same. Moreover, if you are restricted in your range by poverty, if you cannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are but confined to the most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It is life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being a trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a higher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul.|$|R

40|$|Chemotypes (or chemovars) are {{chemically}} {{distinct entities}} within a plant species based on genetic variation. Their occurrence is in mono- and sesquiterpenes (principal constituents of essential oils) exceptionally frequent. In almost all chemotypes the genetic background of their formation is still unknown. Salvia officinalis L. (<b>garden</b> <b>sage,</b> Dalmatian sage, Lamiaceae), a medicinal and aromatic plant whose numerous different bioactivities are partly {{based on its}} essential oil, {{is a prime example}} of the occurrence of a multitude of chemotypes. The genetic resources already available for Dalmatian sage (gene sequences and protein structures of monoterpene synthases, gene regulation, etc.) permit here an in depth elucidation of the genetic background of chemotype formation. A population of <b>garden</b> <b>sage</b> from Central Albania will be the model population in focus to study this background because this population is polymorphic in a specific sensorially important essential oil composition. In the beginning, the natural variation of the target genes (different monoterpene synthases) on the genomic level will be compiled including their 5 Ą¯ and 3 Ą¯ UTRs and the promoter regions. The major difficulty is the occurrence of multiple copies of each gene in the genome whose exact number is still unknown. Therefore, a complex qPCR and sequencing approach is foreseen to detect haplotypes within individuals. After an inventory of haplotypes, an extensive analysis of the transcriptome will follow in order to find out which haplotypes are expressed in different chemotypes and plant tissues. In a next step, the association between expressed haplotypes and chemotypes will be studied first in silico and then in an in planta transient expression system. Furthermore, promoter regions will be analyzed, because differences here could also be responsible for the chemical polymorphisms. Deletion analysis of the promoter regions shall further clarify, which minimal requirements are necessary for gene expression of monoterpene synthases. Two bioactive monoterpenes in sage, alpha and beta-thujone, have potential neurotoxic effects when consumed in excess. Therefore, the thujone chemotypes will be studied in a neuronal cell culture assay to determine if the chemotypes show different activity in this assay and if the plant extract has the same activity as pure compounds. In the end our results will not only explain the correlation between genotype and a specific chemotype in Dalmatian sage but shall also enable a faster and straightforward exploration of further genotype correlations in Dalmatian sage and many others of the numerous essential oil delivering plant species from the same family because in many of these closely related species, the basic genetic principle of chemotype could be similar. The known correlation between genotype and chemotype may also be important for quality assurance systems in pharmacy and the food sector, because this work could pave the way towards enables molecular markers to determine a specific chemotype without chemical analysis...|$|E
