Keratinosomes appear at 24 hr after wounding. They are more fully developed at 36 hr, preceding the formation of the horny layer at 48 hr.

The isolated granules revealed a fine granular substructure in the electron microscope similar to that seen in situ. Analyses of amino acids by automated column-chromatography showed that proline and cystine are present in large proportions whereas histidine is present in a small amount. Accordingly, it was concluded that keratohyalin represents a sulfur-rich amorphous precursor of the <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> content, rather than a sulfur-poor side product of the keratinization process, or a unique histidine-rich protein as proposed by in situ histochemical and radioautographic studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{contents}} of epidermal cysts {{were used as}} a source of desquamated human keratinocytes uncontaminated by sebaceous, subcutaneous, or bacterial lipids. Lipids extracted with chloroform:methanol mixtures included six series of ceramides (41 % of the total extractable lipid), cholesterol (27 %), cholesteryl esters (10 %), fatty acids (9 %), choles-teryl sulfate (1. 9 %), a novel class of ceramide esters (3. 8 %), and a sterol diester (0. 9 %). Electron microscopy revealed that the lipids in the cyst contents existed as multiple intercellular lamellae, as in stratum corneum. One lamella, adjacent to the <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> protein envelope, was resistant to lipid extraction and is thought to represent covalently bound lipid on the outer surface of the keratinocyte. The results indicate that the degradation of intercellular lipid lamellae is not required for desquamation...|$|E

Follicular casts {{were present in}} all samples but were not as abundant as usually seen in older individuals with acne. When examined with the light microscope, all casts and comedones were composed of numerous layers of <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> and sebum, but were devoid of bacteria. Neither follicular casts nor comedones yielded bacteria when cultured. Electron microscopy of the follicular casts revealed the presence of small round, discrete lipid droplets, and alternating dense and less dense lamellar configurations within the <b>horny</b> <b>cells.</b> Some <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> closest to the sebum-filled lumen contained large lipid masses, resulting in “balloon-shaped” regions. Prepuberal follicular <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> contained all of the abnormalities usually seen in follicular casts and biopsy material from acne patients, which suggests that these casts are potential comedones. These aberrations occurred in the complete absence of bacteria indicating that bacteria are not essential {{to the formation of}} casts or comedones. Furthermore, our findings indicate that bacteria play little if any role in the initial events of pathological keratinization...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of epidermal {{damage on the}} orderly stacking of <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> of the mouse ear was studied by fluorescence microscopy. Two types of wounding were compared: compression (10 Kg/cm 2 for 4 sec) or superficial wounding by needle scratching. Scratching caused a complete loss of order in the rapidly forming new horny layer, while the application of pressure without cell damage resulted in increased mitotic activity alone without loss of cell stacking. It is concluded, that the formation of cell columns in keratinizing epithelia is not hindered by a sudden increase in mitotic activity. However, it is replaced by randomly arranged <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> and a slowly re-appearing stacked <b>horny</b> layer, when <b>cell</b> loss or cell damage has occurred...|$|R

After dissociation in {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} the polypeptides were separated by Laemmli's gel electrophoresis method and their molecular weights and relative amounts determined. Normal <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> contained 3 polypeptide chains of Mr 67 K, 59 K, and 57 K, while those of callus contained 9 polypeptides of Mr 67 K, 66 K, 63 K, 62 K, 58 K, 54 K, 52 K, 48 K, and 45 K. In both cases all keratin polypeptides participated in filament reassembly in vitro and were recovered from the filaments. In psoriatic scale keratin, 7 prominent polypeptides were detected having Mr 67 K, 59 K, 57 K, 50 K, 48 K, 42 K, and 40 K. The 67 K polypeptide could not be recovered from reassembled filaments. Ultrastructural studies revealed that these filaments are imperfect and readily aggregate into thick fibrils.

40|$|Epidermal cell renewal was {{assessed}} nonintrusively in normal human volunteers by monitoring the disap-pearance of a fluorescent marker dye, dansyl chloride, {{from the skin}} surface. In young adults, stratum cor-neum transit time was approximately 20 days, whereas in older adults this was lengthened by more than 10 days. Because the number of <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> layers does not change with age, these data indicate that the in-creased stratum corneum transit time was a reflection of diminished epidermal cell proliferation. Addi-tional analysis indicated that the decline in epidermal cell renewal may not occur at a constant rate through-out the adult lifespan but, instead, remains relatively constant in the younger years and then begins to drop dramatically after age 50. This suggests that a linear-spline model rather than a simple linear model may be more appropriate for analyzing these results.

In order {{to see whether the}} mutant loricrin molecules predicted by DNA sequencing are expressed in vivo and to define their pathologic effects, we raised antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the mutated sequences of loricrin. Immunoblotting of <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> extracts from loricrin keratoderma patients showed specific bands for mutant loricrin. Immunohisto- chemistry of loricrin keratoderma skin biopsies showed positive immunoreactivity to the mutant loricrin antibodies in the nuclei of differentiated epidermal keratinocytes. The immunostaining was localized to the nucleoli of the lower granular cell layer. As keratinocyte differentiation progressed the immunoreactivity moved gradually into the nucleoplasm leaving nucleoli mostly nonimmunoreactive. No substantial staining was observed along the cornified cell envelope. This study confirmed that mutant loricrin was expressed in the loricrin keratoderma skin. Mutant loricrin, as a dominant negative disrupter, is not likely to affect cornified cell envelope crosslinking directly, but seems to interfere with nuclear/nucleolar functions of differentiating keratinocytes.

40|$|Lipid {{synthesis}} in newborn chick epidermis was {{studied by}} electron microscopic autoradiography after injection of tritiated palmitate. The labeled lipid {{product in the}} tissue was identified as mostly triglyceride. At the earliest time after injection (6 hr), the radioactive precursor was taken up by all viable cells of the epidermis. Grain density was heaviest over basal cells, moderate over spinous cells, and slight over granular cells; thus lipid incorporation is highest in the basal and spinous regions of the chick epidermis. As time after injection progressed, the increasing amounts of grains over the granular and horny cells and decreasing amounts over the basal and spinous cells reflected the continuous upward displacement of cells from one layer into the next. From the distribution of silver grains within the epidermal cells, it has been concluded that, {{with the passage of}} time, triglycerides synthesized by the epidermal cells were mainly located in lipid droplets. The numerous grains associated with the elements of the endoplasmic reticulum indicated that this organelle is involved in aggregating triglyceride molecules into lipid droplets. The fact that grains were seen within the horny cells indicated that part of the <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> consists of lipid probably derived from the lipid droplets' retained by the cells during keratinization...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis [...] A highly active {{antidandruff}} agent, seleniuxn sulfide, was {{studied with}} normal and dandruff scalps {{to test the}} hypothesis that the excess scaling is due to an overproduction of <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> and that effective therapy is absolutely dependent on lowering the rate of multi-plication of germinative cells. A new technique to demonstrate an increased production of <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> in dandruff entailed determination of the corneocyte count, the quantity of <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> per square centimeter produced over a 4 -day period. Use of a selenium sulfide-contain-ing shampoo sharply reduced the corneocyte counts; a nomncdicated shaxnpoo reduced the count only slightly. Selenium sulfide was proportionately effective in lowering the corneocyte count of the normal scalp. It was postulated that this agent controls dandruff by its cytostatic capa-bilities. Its principal impact is to reduce cell turnover. Thyroidinc radioautography con-firmed the inhibitory effect of selenium sulfide on epidermopoesis. The labeling index of both the epidermis and the infundibulum of the hair follicles of the normal scalp, not previ-ously described in the literature, was determined. Selenium sulfide was equally effective in diminishing the labeling index of the epidermis and {{the upper part of the}} external root sheath of the hair follicles...|$|R

Except for the dermal cysts, the gross epithelial abnormalities were almost completely corrected by retinoic acid in a dose-dependent fashion. Salicylic acid caused partial emptying of the horny masses, but the utriculi did not regress. Lactic acid, propylene glycol and benzoyl peroxide had minor effects on keratinization and exfoliation.

In the present study, we investigated the distribution of the JAK–STAT pathway using immunohistochemistry in the human epidermis. Each element of the pathway showed abundant and differential expression in the epidermis. The differential distribution of the elements was most strikingly observed in the horny keratinised cell and granular layers of the epidermis. JAK 2, JAK 3, STAT 1 and STAT 5 were expressed in high amounts, and JAK 1, TYK 2, STAT 2, STAT 3, STAT 4 and STAT 6 to a much lesser extent in the <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> layer. JAK 3, TYK 2, STAT 2, STAT 3, STAT 4 and STAT 6 were more abundantly expressed in the granular layer than the lower layers of the epidermis. JAK 1, STAT 1 and STAT 5 were expressed at almost the same levels in the various layers of the epidermis. These results show that elements of the JAK–STAT pathway are abundantly and differentially expressed in the epidermis.

40|$|Filipin (a polyene antibiotic) interacts {{specifically}} with cholesterol in membranes, producing characteristic 25 nm-diameter deformation (pitlike lesions) within the membrane plane detectable by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Utilizing this probe, {{the distribution of}} cholesterol molecules in membranes and in lamellar structures between horny cells was investigated in human skin. The plasma membranes of basal, spinous, and granular cells reacted extensively with filipin except for desmosomal membrane portions. However, the plasma membranes of horny cells were rarely labeled with filipin, while lamellar structures between horny cells were well labeled. These observations indicate the distinct difference in susceptibility to filipin among the plasma membranes of viable cells and horny cells, and the lipid lamellar structures. Whenever <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> plasma membranes were affected with filipin, they revealed a low deformability showing shallow pits or low protrusions. This low deformability {{may be due to}} greater membrane rigidity rather than a lower content of cholesterol, although the possibility of a low amount of cholesterol cannot be excluded. Lamellar bodies in granular cells were well labeled in the limiting membranes but poorly labeled in the internal lamellar structures. The regions of gap junctions were absolutely unlabeled. Filipin-cholesterol complexes were produced very close to the junctional strands but did not appear to disrupt the junctional structure of tight junctions. Nuclear membranes were affected only in the outer membrane with filipin. These results suggest that keratinocytes undergo a distinctive reduction in membrane deformability or in free-cholesterol content at the transition from living to dead cells, and display a heterogeneity in cholesterol distribution in human epidermal cell membranes...|$|E

Premature desquamation of the <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> took place along the intercellular spaces and was not due to degeneration of <b>horny</b> <b>cells.</b> It was thought that incomplete discharge of cementsomes, perhaps due to shortened transit time of keratinocytes, failed to provide enough intercellular cement.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays an {{important}} role in normal and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF receptors (VEGFRs, including VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2, and VEGFR- 3) and neuropilins (NRPs, including NRP- 1 and NRP- 2) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and are typically considered to be specific for endothelial cells. Here we showed expression of VEGFRs and NRPs on cultured epidermal keratinocytes at both mRNA and protein levels. We further localized these receptors by immunofluorescence (IF) staining in the epidermis of surgical skin specimens. We found positive staining for VEGFRs and NRPs in all layers of the epidermis except for the stratum corneum. VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 2 are primarily expressed on the cytoplasmic membrane of basal cells and the adjacent spinosum keratinocytes. All layers of the epidermis except for the <b>horny</b> <b>cell</b> layer demonstrated a uniform pattern of VEGFR- 3, NRP- 1, and NRP- 2. Sections staining for NRP- 1 and NRP- 2 also showed diffuse intense fluorescence and were localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of keratinocytes. In another panel of experiments, keratinocytes were treated with different concentrations of VEGF, with or without VEGFR- 2 neutralizing antibody in culture. VEGF enhanced the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, and these effects were partially inhibited by pretreatment with VEGFR- 2 neutralizing antibody. Adhesion of keratinocytes to type IV collagen–coated culture plates was decreased by VEGF treatment, but this reduction could be completely reversed by pretreatment with VEGFR- 2 neutralizing antibody. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of VEGFRs and NRPs on keratinocytes may constitute important regulators for its activity and may possibly be responsible for the autocrine signaling in the epidermis...|$|E
40|$|Components of desmosomes, filaments, and keratohyaline {{granules}} {{were studied}} by electron microscope and biochemical methods to clarify {{their role in}} the stabilization and keratinization of the epidermis. Isolated desmosomes are composed of 76 % protein, 17 % carbohydrate, and 10 % lipid. The bulk of protein consists of a “spectrin”-like fibrous protein, presumably present in the plaque, and of glycoproteins in the desmosomal interspace. The main component of filaments, prekeratin, is a low-sulfur α-protein composed of a pair of three-chain subunits with non-α-helical segments separated by 200 Å-long α-helical regions. The major component of isolated keratohyaline granules, the amorphous particulate material, is formed by a high-sulfur protein with a single-type of polypeptide chain. polypeptide chains comparable to those found in prekeratin and keratohyaline granules were recovered from extracts of <b>horny</b> <b>cells.</b> Within the living part of the epidermis, filaments hypothetically form a cytoskeletal system which is anchored to desmosomes by a filamentous plaque protein. Glycoproteins are involved in the formation of strong junctions between the cells which enable the living part of the epidermis to respond as a whole to mechanical stress.

40|$|The ultrastructural {{differentiation}} of epidermal keratinocytes cultured {{in the presence}} of 3 T 3 feeder cells is significantly {{different from that of the}} epidermis in vivo. Several markers of keratinization, including keratohyaline granules (KGs), membrane-coating granules (MCGs), and an enucleated stratum corneum are essentially absent from cultured cells. When cultured rabbit epidermal cells were trypsinized and injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, the cells reaggregated and formed cysts lined with a stratified squamous epithelium morphologically resembling the in vivo epidermis. In this paper, we examined the {{differentiation of}} the injected cells by electron microscopy. Within 24 h after injection, MOGs and KGs appeared in the reaggregated epidermal <b>cells.</b> <b>Horny</b> <b>cells</b> were noted within 48 h. Since basement membrane formation was not completed until much later (between 4 – 9 days), a direct contact between epidermal cells and a continuous basal lamina structure was not required for the formation of various keratinization markers. Glycogen and lipid droplets, which were abundant in the early (10 – 48 h) cystic epithelia, gradually disappeared from the basal through the granular layers during days 2 – 9. By 16 days, the ultra-structure of the cystic epithelium appeared similar to the in vivo rabbit epidermis including the formation of “rabbit-type” KGs, MCGs, and normal enucleated <b>horny</b> <b>cells.</b> These results provided further evidence that the differentiation of epidermal cells can be modulated significantly and reversibly by the external environment.

Despite an overall thinning of the epidermis and focal areas of cytologic atypia, the characteristic morphological markers associated with the keratinization process are not markedly altered in appearance or amount. A well-formed stratum corneum consisting of flattened, enucleated <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> enveloped by a thickened membrane, and intracellular spaces filled with electron-dense material provide structural evidence that barrier ability is not compromised in senile skin. The dermal/epidermal changes in aged skin are marked and have significant physiologic implications. The major change is a relatively flat dermal/epidermal junction resulting from the retraction of the epidermal papillae {{as well as the}} microprojections of basal cells into the dermis. This flattening results in a more fragile epidermal/dermal interface and, consequently, the epidermis is less resistant to shearing forces. Retraction of the epidermal downgrowths (preferential sites of the putative epidermal stem cell) may also explain the loss in proliferative capacity associated with the aged epidermis. The three-dimensional arrangements of collagen and elastic fibers showed marked alterations with age. Both fibrous components appear more compact because of a decrease in spaces between the fibers.

Since keratinocyte membrane disturbances may be involved in psoriasis and since retinoids biochemically affect biologic membranes, we employed a freeze-fracture technique to study the effects of retinoid on the junctional and internal structures of membranes. Lesional and nonlesional skin was biopsied from 5 patients with psoriasis vulgaris before and 3 of them after oral treatment with 50 mg of etretinate (Ro 10 - 9359) per day for 4 weeks. The most remarkable finding was the reduction in size of desmosomes-from 0. 43 ± 0. 07 μm to 0. 23 ± 0. 08 μm diameter in spinous cells and 0. 35 ± 0. 03 μm to 0. 14 ± 0. 03 μm in <b>horny</b> <b>cells</b> in lesional skin. Similar results were obtained in nonlesional skin. This reduction in desmosomal size appears to be large enough to produce an extensive exfoliation. It was also of great interest that the intramembranous particle density on the P face (the fracture face of the protoplasmic half-layer) of the spinous cell plasma membranes was 1140 ± 57 /μm 2 in lesional and 429 ± 89 /μm 2 in nonlesional skin before treatment, and 1184 ± 93 /μm 2 and 1179 ± 147 /μm 2 after treatment, respectively, although the lesions were clinically resolved. This may suggest that the agent does not revert the keratinocyte membrane from a psoriatic to a normal state despite clinical improvement. Many openings of pinocytotic (or exocytotic) vesicles were produced on the plasma membranes of keratinocytes. This was associated with the appearance of fine granular substances (so-called mucous-like substances) in the intercellular spaces...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{very fair}} women with mild to {{moderate}} photoaging in there 60 &#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;s were tested by doubled blind immunohistological study. Tretinoin 0. 05 &#x 0025; cream applied daily was compared to its vehicle with regards to epidermal, basal, spinous differentiation markers and dendritic cells (Langerhan&#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;s and melariocyte). In comparison with the control skin, tretinoin-treated skin showed the following changes: 1. From atrophy to normalization or hyperplasia of <b>horny</b> and prickle <b>cell</b> layers, 2. Granular layer was normal to hypertrophied, 3. Basal cells were well-stained and thicker, 4. Basement membrane was thicker to normal in appearance and 5. Dendritic cells were increased in number (Langerhan&#x 00 E 2;&#x 20 AC;s). These results demonstrated a decelerating effect of tretinoin on the time clock of photoaging...|$|R
