500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Alpert said in 2014 {{that the}} original comics have given them enough ideas for Rick Grimes and company {{over the next seven}} years. [...] "I happen to love working from source material, specifically because we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what Season 10 is gonna be", Alpert said.

500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were positively received. Manny LaMancha of GamePro said that the visuals were brightly colored and smoothly animated and noted that the Xbox version's graphics were slightly cleaner than the PlayStation 2 version. Michael Lafferty of GameZone praised the environments as [...] "lush and richly textured" [...] and the cutscenes as [...] "very well done". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox commended the graphics as [...] "clean and crisp" [...] and added that the cutscenes were [...] "beautifully polished". Ryan Davis of GameSpot noted that [...] "Crash Nitro Kart maintains the brightly colored, cartoony look {{that has been the}} hallmark of past Crash Bandicoot games, though with slightly upgraded graphics. Ed Lewis of IGN said that the graphics for the single-player modes were [...] "bright and cheery and smooth", but decreased in quality in the multiplayer modes. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that [...] "CNK stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a splash of eye candy with their cartoon frippery." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that [...] "if you've played any of the other Crash Bandicoot games out there, then you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> what this one looks like." [...] Russ Fischer of GameSpy said that the game [...] "some nice graphics, which use a solid framerate and loads of color to capture the old Crash magic." ...|$|E

Come now, play {{something}} more for me before you go--something that's bright and happy this time, so as to leave me with a good taste in my mouth. That last thing you played took me straight to heaven,--but heaven's awful near to hell, and at the last you tipped me in." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stage {{director}} Marta ("Mrs.") Domingo {{seems to}} have taken the Hippocratic oath as her inspiration for this [...] "Traviata": She does no harm.

Actresses trying to secure a nomination stop in to schmooze at the magazine's Chatsworth offices. agency client once presented dolls of herself to editors and writers. Another baked cookies".

[...] "This is a new thing for me, and I like this better though. It’s way better than having to stand there in the rehearsing room one-on-one and trying to explain with bad air drumming. Instead I’m at my studio, really focused, taking my time and saying “ok, here I hear a fill” and write it down. I’m not a drummer, but that’s a more precise way for me to explain my ideas.

They conceded, however, that [...] "we are starting to see more bubbles than there used to be", which raises further questions of the gas company. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) commented that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what’s going on, {{but it is hard to}} be completely definitive as the gas is emanating from underground", and that [...] "the methane gas emanating from the Condamine River in Queensland poses no environmental impact." ...|$|E
