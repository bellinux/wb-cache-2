40|$|In {{the present}} work {{the change in}} natural frequencies, damping and mode shapes of a {{prefabricated}} timber <b>floor</b> <b>element</b> have been investigated when it was integrated into a building structure. The timber <b>floor</b> <b>element</b> was first subjected to modal testing in laboratory with ungrounded and simply supported boundary conditions, and then in situ {{at different stages of}} building construction. The first five natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of the <b>floor</b> <b>element</b> and the entire floor were extracted and analysed. It may be concluded that the major change in natural frequencies occur as the <b>floor</b> <b>element</b> is coupled to the adjacent elements and when partitions are built in the studied room, the largest effect is on those modes of vibration that largely are constrained in their movement. The in situ conditions have a great influence on the damping, which depends on the damping characteristics of the supports, but also {{on the fact that the}} floor is integrated into the building and interacts with it. There is a slight increase of damping in the floor over the different construction stages and the damping values seem to decrease with ascending mode order...|$|E
40|$|Steel angles are {{extensively}} used {{to connect}} concrete floor/roof elements to the supporting beam in typical dry-assembled precast frame structures widely diffused in Europe {{and other parts}} of the world. These connections allow for relative rotation of the <b>floor</b> <b>element</b> in its vertical plane and restrains their relative displacement, avoiding possible loss of support and consequent fall of the <b>floor</b> <b>element</b> when the structure is subjected to lateral load. The diaphragm behaviour of the precast decks relies on these floor-to-beam connections. Their post-addition to unconnected floor-to-beam joints of existing buildings is a typical seismic retrofit intervention. All these applications are often made without an adequate information about the main structural parameters of the connections, due to lack of experimental or theoretical knowledge. An experimental campaign has been performed at Politecnico di Milano within the framework of the Safecast and ReLUIS research projects with the scope of characterising the mechanical behaviour of post-inserted floor-to-beam connections made with hot-rolled angles, cold-formed angles and welded sockets in the direction parallel to the <b>floor</b> <b>element.</b> The results of monotonic local tests on connectors and on the bolted connection with the floor rib and of cyclic and monotonic sub-assembly tests allowed to determine the main structural parameters of the joints, including elastic stiffness, strength, displacement capacity and hysteretic shape...|$|E

Tests have been carried out to examine the structural behaviour of the hanger. The two most critical load cases, vertical floor load and horizontal wind suction load, and three different screw joint configurations were investigated. The results indicate that the vertical distance between the screw joint and the upper edge of the rim beam should be increased and that withdrawal forces on the screws should be kept as low as possible.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The authors {{report on}} an {{experimental}} test program on different shear connectors {{to be used}} in floor elements where prefabricated concrete beams are to be connected on top of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels. The objective is to evaluate the level of composite action that can be achieved and the increase of strength and stiffness when combining effectively these structural components in a <b>floor</b> <b>element.</b> Shear tests were performed on 12 specimens in total. The shear connector consists of a steel plate as the common part to connect to both the concrete beam and the CLT panel. To the steel plate, studs or a metal mesh were welded and casted in the concrete beam to form a prefabricated unit. The CLT panel was then attached to the steel plate by screws. The main slip occurred between the CLT panel and the steel plate. The test results show a high ultimate load capacity for all types of shear connectors and a ductile type of behaviour for most of them. The test results for the shear connectors were compared with the capacity obtained from analytical models. Also, the strength and stiffness of partially composite floor elements with these shear connectors were analysed. It was found that from a structural point of view these shear connections are suitable to be used to form floor elements {{with a high level of}} composite action...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master Thesis is to study how the value stream mapping concept can be applied along the {{construction}} supply chain for prefabricated massive timber <b>floor</b> <b>elements.</b> Identification and qualification of waste are starting points to propose {{suggestions on how to}} reduce and/or eliminate them. In order to use the value stream mapping along the construction supply chain, pertinent data has been collected and analyzed. To conduct the value stream mapping, the first three steps of the lean thinking principles in construction have been followed. The first step aims at defining the customer and his value as well as the value for the delivery team and how it is specified in the product. The second step is based on identifying the value stream and this is done through defining the resources and activities needed to manufacture, deliver and install the <b>floor</b> <b>elements.</b> This is conducted by using the VSMM methodology. In addition the current practice should be standardized and key component suppliers should be defined and located. The third and last step identifies non-value adding activities, in other words waste and suggestions on how to remove and/or reduce waste have been reached. Wastes from product defects, transportation waste and waste of waiting were {{to be found in the}} construction supply chain. Propositions to reduce and/or eliminate wastes were to implement a more careful planning of the manufacturing process and production schedule, to apply lean production principles in the manufacturing facility and decrease and or eliminate storage time.

40|$|The Masonite Flexible Building (MFB) {{system is}} a {{complete}} timber building system for commercial and residential multi-storey houses. The system is subdivided into two market variants; XL and Light. The XL version is for tall and large buildings with long floor spans while the Light version is adapted for smaller buildings with lower loads. Though differing in technical performance, the functional criteria are the same for both variants. The MFB system uses prefabricated wall, <b>floor</b> and roof <b>elements</b> which are delivered in flat packages and erected on the construction site. The MFB system might be classified as a panel construction, where the load-carrying structure consists of composite light-weight timber I-beams mechanically integrated with a composite laminated wood panel called PlyBoard‚Ñ¢. The Ibeams and the panel form a strong and rigid carcass for wall and <b>floor</b> <b>elements,</b> making the system well suited for high rise construction. A key feature of the MFB system is the connection technique which enables swift erection of the system units on site. The plyboard panels are provided with a continuous slot along the periphery.

40|$|A new shear {{connection}} {{system was}} tested {{in order to}} be used in off-site manufactured cassette floor elements made with glulam beams and Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) panels. The shear connection proposed is made with double-sided punched metal plate fasteners, connecting CLT and glulam members to form a T-cross-section. Due to the lack of withdrawal capacity of punched metal plate fasteners, the shear connection must be secured with screws to resist separations forces which may occur between the members in the <b>floor</b> <b>element.</b> Shear tests were performed on glulam-CLT joints made with double-sided punched metal plate fasteners and with inclined self-tapping screws as reference cases to compare to joints with both fastener types combined. Each fastener type is characterised by a specific load-slip curve and different values for the yield slip, slip at maximum load and failure slip. These parameters can be used to evaluate the compatibility of the different fasteners and their combined effect in a joint. The test results show that there is a significant contribution from both the double-sided punched metal plate and inclined screw fasteners to the strength and stiffness of the combined joints. Due {{to the fact that the}} individual fasteners reach their maximum load for different slip values, the load-carrying capacity of joints with combined fasteners is somewhat lower than the sum of the individual fasteners load-carrying capacities. The slip modulus of the combined fasteners may be estimated as the sum of the respective slip modulus of each fastener due to the compatible behaviour of the fasteners in the serviceability limit state.
