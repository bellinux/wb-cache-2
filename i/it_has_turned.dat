2500|$|Today, Liszt's {{songs are}} {{relatively}} obscure. As an exception, most frequently the song [...] "Ich möchte hingehn" [...] is cited. It {{is because of}} a single bar, most resembling the opening motif of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. While it is commonly claimed that Liszt wrote that motif ten years before Wagner started work on his masterpiece, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>turned</b> {{out that this is}} not true: the original version of [...] "Ich möchte hingehn" [...] was composed in 1844 or 1845. There are four manuscripts, and only a single one, a copy by August Conradi, contains the said bar with the Tristan motif. It is on a paste-over in Liszt's hand. Since {{in the second half of}} 1858 Liszt was preparing his songs for publication, and he just at that time received the first act of Wagner's Tristan, it is most likely that the version on the paste-over was a quotation from Wagner. This is not to say the motif was originally invented by Wagner. An earlier example can be found in bar 100 of Liszt's Ballade No. 2 in B minor for piano, composed in 1853.|$|E
