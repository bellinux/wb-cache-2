5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for <b>final</b> <b>sale</b> to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut and polished, US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major ice {{consuming}} cities to hold the imported ice before <b>final</b> <b>sale</b> and consumption, where they were often termed depots. In London, the early ice depots were often circular and called wells or shades; the New Cattle Market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of ice. Later ice depots at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian ice. The city of New York was unusual and did not build ice depots near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the ice as floating warehouses until the ice was needed.|$|E

40|$|Auctions {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} as an economic marketplace. The economist’s focus is on modeling <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> prices, but the processes {{that give rise to}} those outcomes are rarely studied in great detail. This research is intended to provide that complementary perspective. We show how the interactions between bidders in an auction unfold in a dynamic pattern of bids and counter-bids, and thereby over the duration of an auction, create a network structure. The auction network contributes significantly to models of price dynamics and the network predicts <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> prices better than economic (non-network) indicators alone. In addition, network analyses are useful in identifying the key bidders whose actions seem to exert disproportionate influence on other bidders and the <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> prices. Furthermore, the key bidders may be identified very early in an auction process, which has practical implications for the auction house managers and for other bidders...|$|R

40|$|We study {{rationing}} {{as a tool}} of the monopolist’s pricing strategy when {{demand is}} uncertain. Three pricing strategies are potentially optimal in our environment: uniform pricing, <b>final</b> <b>sales,</b> and introductory offers. The <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> strategy consists in charging a high price initially, but then lowering the price while committing to a total capacity. Consumers with high valuations to pay may decide to buy at the high price since the endogenous probability of rationing is higher at the lower price. The introductory offers strategy consists in selling a limited quantity at a low price initially, and then raising price. Those consumers with high valuations who were rationed initially at the lower price may find it optimal to buy the good at the higher price. We show that while the introductory offers strategy may dominate uniform pricing, it is never optimal if the monopolist can use the <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> strategy. rationing, priority pricing, sales, demand uncertainty, introductory offer, price dispersion...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{highlights}} {{findings from}} behavioral economics {{in the context}} of real estate markets, and the housing market in particular. Behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, herding, investor sentiment, charm pricing and round numbers bias are addressed. In the empirical part, the Oslo housing market for freeholder dwellings in the period of 2006 to 2013 is analyzed. The value evaluations of professional surveyors are found to be good estimates of a dwelling’s market worth, however they are lower than <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> prices on average, and might not sufficiently incorporate all available information. I find widespread clustering of all price measures in the data; value evaluations and <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> prices cluster at round numbers, asking prices cluster at charm prices. The role of round numbers as focal points is considered, and estimated coefficients show that a million kroner focal point attracts 44 % more sales than other 50 000 kr price points. The relative effects of different focal points appear to be stable across time. However, the pull of mass is stronger from above than below the focal point, which might be interpreted as a pull from the seller’s side of the distribution. Finally, different designs of asking prices are considered. The data reveals that round number pricing, and setting the asking price equal to value evaluation are the most favorable designs in terms of <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> price. Charm pricing and ”under-pricing” either has no, or a negative effect on the <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> price...|$|R

25|$|Mergers {{with and}} sales to other breweries {{occurred}} over the years. A merger with competitor Portland Brewing brought the Blitz name into the formal name of the brewery. Arnold Blitz, who had owned Portland Brewing, became Chairman of the new Blitz-Weinhard company. The new company took 20 years to modernize the brewery and recover from Prohibition, which ended in 1933. In 1979, Blitz-Weinhard was sold to the Pabst Brewing Company. Pabst then sold the brewery to Stroh Brewing Company in 1996. The last and <b>final</b> <b>sale</b> of the company in 1999 had major effects on the brewery building. Stroh's sold the Henry Weinhard's brand to Miller Brewing Company, and moved all Henry's brewing operations to the Olympia Brewery in Tumwater, Washington.

25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Pike Place Market in 1907, local Seattle area farmers sold their goods to the public in a three-square block area called The Lots, located at Sixth Avenue and King Street. Most produce sold at The Lots would then be brought to commercial wholesale houses on Western Avenue, which became known as Produce Row. Most farmers, due to the amount of time required to work their farms, were forced to sell their produce on consignment through the wholesalers on Western Avenue. The farmers typically received a percentage of the <b>final</b> <b>sale</b> price for their goods. They would sell to the middleman on commission, as most farmers would often have no time to sell direct to the public, and their earnings would be on marked up prices and expected sales. In some cases, the farmers made a profit, but just as often found themselves breaking even, or getting no money at all due to the business practices of the wholesalers. During the existence of the wholesale houses, which far predated the Market, there were regular rumors as well as instances of corruption in denying payment to farmers.|$|E

Dyadic ties are identified as the bid and counter-bid patterns of interactions between bidders that unfold throughout the duration of an auction. These structures are modeled using network analyses, which enables: (1) a richer understanding of detailed auction processes, both within auctions and across auctions of multiple lots, (2) a mapping of the processes to the forecast of prices and the trajectory toward <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> prices, (3) the clear and early identification of key bidders who are influential to the bidding action and who impact <b>final</b> auction <b>sales</b> prices, and (4) the results clearly show that the network exchange patterns are significant and contribute to an understanding of auction processes and outcomes above and beyond simple economic predictors such as the number of bids or bidders or the bidders’ economic status. We conclude by providing some managerial implications for online auction houses and bidders...|$|R

Moreover, inventory accumulation is strongly procyclical, and production is more volatile than sales, as in the data. The comovement between inventory investment and <b>final</b> <b>sales</b> is often interpreted as evidence that inventories amplify aggregate fluctuations. In contrast, our model economy exhibits a business cycle similar to that of a comparable benchmark without inventories, though we do observe somewhat higher variability in employment, and lower variability in consumption and investment.

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of congestion pricing {{was one of}} a number of anti-congestion policies implemented in Singapore since the 1970s, in recognition of the country's land constraints, need of economic competitiveness, and to avoid the traffic gridlock that chokes many cities in the world. One key aspect of demand management in Singapore is the restraint of vehicle ownership, either through the imposition of high ownership costs or restriction on the actual growth of the car population. [...] These measures have included high annual road tax, custom duties and vehicle registration fees. Besides fiscal deterrents, supply of motor vehicles was regulated since 1990, when a Vehicle Quota System was introduced. These high initial buy-in charges are considered as the price motorists pay for the luxury of owning a car and to cover part of the fixed costs associated with scaling basic road infrastructure. Then, use-related charges, such as fuel taxes (50% of <b>final</b> <b>sale</b> price), ALS or high parking rates are utilised by public authorities to further constraint travel. In parallel to the whole spectrum of road pricing measures, the government has invested heavily in public transport and implemented a park-and-ride scheme, with thirteen fringe car parks, hence providing car users a real alternative to switch travel modes. In summary, Singapore's urban and transport strategy allowed the users to have pro-transit [...] "carrots" [...] matching auto-restraint [...] "sticks", and as a result, despite having one of the highest per capita incomes in Asia, 32% of Singaporean households owned cars in 2010.|$|E
