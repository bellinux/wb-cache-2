The high pressure hydrogen tanks have excellent hydrogen permeation prevention performance, strength, and durability. Hydrogen sensors provide warnings and can shut off tank main stop valves. The hydrogen tanks and other hydrogen-related parts are located outside the cabin to ensure that if hydrogen leaks, it will dissipate easily. The vehicle structure is enhanced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers from Toray and designed to disperse and absorb impact energy across multiple parts to ensure a high-impact safety performance that protects the Toyota FC Stack and high-pressure hydrogen tanks during frontal, side or rear impacts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{challenge}} for the viability of PEM fuel cells today still remains in their cost and stability. The high cost can in large part {{be attributed to the}} use of the precious metal of platinum in the catalyst layer of PEM cells. The electrocatalyst currently accounts for nearly half of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stack</b> cost. Although the Pt loading of PEM fuel cells has been reduced by two orders of magnitude over the past decade, further reduction is necessary to make the technology economically viable for commercialization. Whereas some research efforts aim to address this issue by improving the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-based catalysts, an alternative is to eliminate the use of Pt altogether by developing a non-platinum-group-metal (non-PGM) cathode catalyst whose performance rivals that of Pt-based technologies. The U.S. Department of Energy has been setting milestones for the development of fuel cells, targeting a durability of 5000 hours and a non-PGM catalyst ORR volumetric activity of 300 A cm−3 ...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid solid oxide <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> {{microturbine}} (SOFC-MT) systems present {{opportunities for}} improvement over conventional systems, including high electric efficiency, cogeneration, {{and the potential}} for low carbon emissions. Hybrid systems require stringent control, however, and competing systems (including non-hybrid SOFC systems) currently generate power reliably and efficiently. In order to advance toward commercialization, hybrid systems need to adopt a control strategy that maintains safe and efficient operation, while also exhibiting favorable exergetic and economic performance. The present work investigates the SOFC stack's dynamic response to step changes in control variables, as well as the hybrid and non-hybrid systems' energetic, exergetic, economic, and environmental performances. The numerical, 1 -D, SOFC stack model developed herein allows for simulations on multiple timescales. An equivalent circuit combines the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell's</b> irreversiblities with the charge double layer. The hybrid and non-hybrid models integrate the SOFC stack model with the balance-of-plant component models, evaluating the energy and exergy flows through each component. Finally, the techno-economic model calculates the hybrid and non-hybrid systems' levelized costs of electricity (LCOEs). Manipulating the current density is found to be {{the most effective way to}} control the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stack's</b> power, giving rise to instantaneous power changes without restricting the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>stack's</b> <b>fuel</b> utilization.
