25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort I went through, then it was worth it because <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

[...] I decided that I wanted to write it while the show {{was still on the}} air." [...] In an {{interview}} with Scotland on Sunday, she added [...] "I wanted to tell my story and I needed to because <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> much fan mail. People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that." [...] In a 1995 interview, five years before writing the book, Cartwright remarked that she wanted to write a book and that if she did, it would be titled [...] "My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E

500|$|Co-written by D'Angelo and {{producer}} Raphael Saadiq, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] features sexually-explicit lyrics that follow and narrate a man's plea to his love interest for sex, {{as demonstrated in}} the song's second verse: [...] "Love to make you wet / In between your thighs, cause / I love when it comes inside of you / <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> excited when I'm around you, baby". The song's lyrics {{have been described as}} [...] "generic pop lyrics". Music critic Andy Peterson described the lyrics as [...] "not–so–subtle", citing the line [...] "Baby close the door / Listen girl, I have something I wanna show you / I wish you’d open up cause I wanna take the walls down with you" [...] as an example. Music journalist Greg Levine cited its lyrics as [...] "the generic pop lyrics", while also noting the similarity the lyrics have to those of other classic soul ballads, stating [...] "Each line seems to be directly lifted from Marvin Gaye, Prince, or Curtis Mayfield." [...] Levine elaborated on the lyrical theme of the song: ...|$|E
2500|$|Good {{food is a}} {{keystone}} (along with reading) of Wolfe's mostly leisured existence. [...] He is both a gourmand and a gourmet, enjoying generous helpings of Fritz's cuisine {{three times}} a day. Shad roe is a particular favorite, prepared {{in a number of}} different ways. [...] Archie enjoys his food but lacks Wolfe's discerning palate, lamenting in The Final Deduction (chapter 9) that [...] "Every spring <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> fed up with shad roe that I wish to heaven fish would figure out some other way. [...] Whales have." [...] Shad roe is frequently the first course, followed by roasted or braised duck, another Wolfe favorite.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} A-. In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Y’know, when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> frustrated with OUAT, it’s because it sets a high bar up against itself. Like this episode, for example. It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single hour. I didn’t realize {{we were about to}} get so much out of “Nimue,” but I should have guessed once we found out that it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E

My aunt has Down's syndrome so it's very close to my heart," [...] says Scherzinger. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, along with other artists, she recorded [...] "We Are the World 25 for Haiti", which benefited people affected by the tragedy. In October 2010 she portrayed Trixie at the 35th anniversary concert of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It also raised money for the Painted Turtle camp for chronically ill children.|$|E
2500|$|Fox hired Terry Erdmann (Blue Blaze {{code name}} [...] "Silver Fox") {{and a team}} of publicists {{including}} Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at Star Trek conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody knew what to do with Buckaroo Banzai. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew". Lithgow said, [...] "I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour. I mean it; it's that complicated. But it's terrific. Every time I tell people about it, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> excited that I end it by saying, Buckaroo Banzai, remember where you heard it first!" ...|$|E

My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>so</b> that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and tell me if you can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E
