2500|$|The Gulf of Mexico {{is one of}} the United States’ richest fishing grounds, and the Mega Borg spill {{added to}} an {{abundance}} of oil spills that have happened in the area. This effects not only marine microorganisms in deep waters, but larger <b>deep-water</b> <b>fish</b> and thus both recreational and commercial fishermen. [...] Additionally, the National Wildlife Refuges near Galveston’s shores, nearby salt marches, and oyster reefs were all in potential danger depending on the extent of the slick’s spread.|$|E
6000|$|The {{attractions of}} the pool palling, {{they went back to}} the hotel. Ashurst sent his wire, {{addressing}} it to Mrs. Narracombe: [...] "Sorry, detained for the night, back to-morrow." [...] Surely Megan would understand that he had too much to do; and his heart grew lighter. It was a lovely afternoon, warm, the sea calm and blue, and swimming his great passion; the favour of these pretty children flattered him, the pleasure of looking at them, at Stella, at Halliday's sunny face; the slight unreality, yet extreme naturalness of it all--as of a last peep at normality before he took this plunge with Megan! He got his borrowed bathing dress, and they all set forth. Halliday and he undressed behind one rock, the three girls behind another. He was first into the sea, and at once swam out with the bravado of justifying his self-given reputation. When he turned he could see Halliday swimming along shore, and the girls flopping and dipping, and riding the little waves, in the way he was accustomed to despise, but now thought pretty and sensible, since it gave him the distinction of the only <b>deep-water</b> <b>fish.</b> But drawing near, he wondered if they would like him, a stranger, to come into their splashing group; he felt shy, approaching that slim nymph. Then Sabina summoned him to teach her to float, and between them the little girls kept him so busy that he had no time even to notice whether Stella was accustomed to his presence, till suddenly he heard a startled sound from her: She was standing submerged to the waist, leaning a little forward, her slim white arms stretched out and pointing, her wet face puckered by the sun and an expression of fear.|$|E

40|$|The Rockall Trough or Channel is {{a clearly}} delimited {{deepwater}} area {{lying to the}} west of the British Isles. The eastern and western boundaries are formed by the continental margin and the Rockall Plateau, respectively. To the north it is separated from the colder Norwegian Sea by a ridge at about 500 m depth. To the south the depth steadily increases to abyssal depths. Some of the earliest descriptions of <b>deep-water</b> <b>fishes</b> are from this area in the 1860 s and 1870 s. The UK and Germany carried out <b>deep-water</b> exploratory <b>fishing</b> surveys in the 1970 s and 1980 s and detailed biological studies by the Scottish Association for Marine Science began in 1975. Although some <b>deep-water</b> <b>fishing</b> began in the 1970 s the rapid increase in commercial exploitation did not begin until 1989. As a result there is information on the fish populations and their biology that pre-date the fishery. Since then several countries have carried out research surveys in the area and there has been some monitoring of landings and discards. There are documented concerns about the vulnerability of the fish stocks since 1993 and ICES considers them to be outside safe biological limits. The most recent ICES advice is for a 50 % reduction in fishing effort for the main species. Despite ICES advice the fishery remains unregulated.
