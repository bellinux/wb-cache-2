25|$|The high-energy {{focusing}} telescope (HEFT) is a balloon-borne experiment to image astrophysical {{sources in the}} hard X-ray (20–100 keV) band. Its maiden flight took place in May 2005 from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, USA. The angular resolution of HEFT is ~1.5'. Rather than using a grazing-angle X-ray telescope, HEFT makes use of a novel tungsten-silicon multilayer coatings to extend the reflectivity of nested grazing-incidence mirrors beyond 10 keV. HEFT has an energy resolution of 1.0 keV full width at <b>half</b> <b>maximum</b> at 60 keV. HEFT was launched for a 25-hour balloon flight in May 2005.

[...] The histone variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin. [...] γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139) can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double-strand break formation), and <b>half</b> <b>maximum</b> accumulation of γH2AX occurs in one minute. [...] The extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γH2AX is about two million base pairs {{at the site of}} a DNA double-strand break. [...] γH2AX does not, itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within 30 seconds of irradiation, RNF8 protein can be detected in association with γH2AX.

[...] In one of the earliest steps, the stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphorylates SIRT6 on serine 10 in response to double-strand breaks or other DNA damage. [...] This post-translational modification facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites, and is required for efficient recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to DNA break sites and for efficient repair of DSBs. [...] PARP1 protein starts to appear at DNA damage sites in less than a second, with <b>half</b> <b>maximum</b> accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs.

2500|$|The {{most common}} figure {{used to express}} {{detector}} resolution is full width at <b>half</b> <b>maximum</b> (FWHM). This is {{the width of the}} gamma ray peak at half of the highest point on the peak distribution. Resolution figures are given with reference to specified gamma ray energies.

These resolution values are expressed in absolute terms. To express the resolution in relative terms, the FWHM in eV or MeV is divided by the energy of the gamma ray and usually shown as percentage. Using the preceding example, the resolution of the detector is 7.5% at 122keV, and 12.5% at 662keV.
