500|$|Potter's {{publisher}} Harold Warne {{received the}} text of Mr. Tod in November 1911, though Potter had written the tale {{some time in the}} past. Warne had doubts about the name 'tod' for a fox, but Potter responded:"Tod" [...] is surely a very common name for a fox? It is probably Saxon, it was the word in ordinary use in Scotland a few years ago, probably is still amongst the country people. In the same way [...] "brock" [...] or [...] "gray" [...] is the country name for a badger. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> them [...] "brocks" [...] both names are used in Westmoreland. [...] "Brockholes", [...] "Graythwaite" [...] are examples of place names; also Broxbourne and Brockhampton [...] "Hey quoth the Tod/it's a braw bright night!/The wind's in the west/and the moon shines bright"â€”Mean to say you never heard that?" ...|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{most notable}} {{action in the}} House was a speech he made on February4, 1875, in {{response}} to Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler's call to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Referring to comments Butler had made the previous day about lawlessness against African-Americans in the South, Brown claimed that unjust charges had been made against Southerners by an individual [...] "who is outlawed {{in his own home}} by respectable society, whose name is synonymous with falsehood, who is the champion, and has been on all occasions, of fraud; who is the apologist of thieves, who is such a prodigy of vice and meanness that to describe him would sicken the imagination and exhaust invective." [...] Brown continued by referencing notorious Scottish murderer William Burke, whose method of murdering his victims became known as [...] "Burking." [...] At this point in the speech, Speaker of the House James G. Blaine interrupted Brown, asking if he was referring to a member of the House; Brown gave an ambiguous response before continuing: [...] "If I wished to describe all that was pusillanimous in war, inhuman in peace, forbidden in morals, and infamous in politics, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it 'Butlerizing'." [...] The House gallery exploded in protest at Brown's remark, and incensed Republican legislators called for Brown's immediate expulsion. Though not expelled, he was officially censured by the House for the use of unparliamentary language. The censure was expunged from the record by a subsequent Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Of Kipling's verse, {{such as his}} Barrack-Room Ballads, Eliot writes [...] "of {{a number}} of poets who have written great poetry, only... a very few whom <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> great verse writers. And unless I am mistaken, Kipling's {{position}} in this class is not only high, but unique." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joshua Slocum, {{a classic}} sailor and a forthright, honest man, not being {{concerned}} by {{the controversy over the}} seaworthiness capabilities, said simply, [...] "I have given in the plans of the Spray the dimensions of such a ship as <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> seaworthy in all conditions of weather and on all seas." [...] He also stated: [...] "I may some day see reason to modify the model of the dear old Spray, but out of my limited experience I strongly recommend her wholesome lines over those of pleasure-fliers for safety." ...|$|E
60|$|SMITH. [Staring at his cheque.] Liberal-minded!... Absent-minded, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> it.|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. No; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>call</b> that a conjuring trick. Or, in {{apology to}} your cloth, I will say a miracle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a few {{thousand}} volts ahead of the old shoot-'em-and-sink-'em game, but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> scarcely <b>call</b> it that. What shall I tell the Fleet, sir?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Right, right!" [...] {{said the}} Major; [...] "do {{not let him}} get a handle against you, though <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>call</b> you fit for duty yet, even for holiday-work like yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} it sounded like," [...] said the other. [...] "I didn't say it. It {{was the last}} thing <b>I</b> <b>should</b> 'ave <b>called</b> out. <b>I</b> didn't want to be saved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{thought you}} meant Miss Graham. Mrs. Bowen is my contemporary, and so I didn't {{think of her}} when you said young. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have <b>called</b> her pretty rather than beautiful." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] Norgate assented, [...] "but if {{you look}} out of the windows {{continually}} you will also see that every station-master on the line wears a military uniform, that every few miles you see barracks.
