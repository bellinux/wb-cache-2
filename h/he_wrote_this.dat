25|$|Luther's {{attitude}} toward the Jews took different forms during his lifetime. In his earlier period, until 1537 or not much earlier, he wanted to convert Jews to Christianity, but failed.

25|$|Nahum's {{writings}} {{could be}} taken as prophecy or as history. One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BC, just before the downfall of Assyria, while another account suggests that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> passage as liturgy just after its downfall in 612 BC.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{around the}} time <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> letter and {{continuing}} through {{the first part of}} 1787, Leopold's health was failing. He had become seriously ill by April 4. On this day, Wolfgang wrote to him in alarm at the news, though he did not travel to Salzburg to see him. When Leopold died on 28 May (see below), Wolfgang was unable to attend the funeral, the travel time to Salzburg being too long.|$|E

25|$|Debussy {{wrote one}} of his most famous works under the {{influence}} of Mallarmé, the revolutionary Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, which is truly original in form and execution. In contrast to the large orchestras so favoured by late romanticism, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> piece for a smaller ensemble, emphasizing instrumental colour and timbre. Despite Mallarmé himself and colleague and friend Paul Dukas having been impressed by the piece, it was controversial at its premiere, but nevertheless established Debussy as one of the leading composers of the era.|$|E
25|$|After his speech, he {{was asked}} by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more {{in the form of a}} book. He wrote Negry v Amerike in 1923. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> in Russian, and it was not {{translated}} into English until 1979. Later in life, he came to the conclusion that the Communist party suppressed the idea of individuality and independent thought. Before coming back to America, he denounced the Communist thoughts{citation needed|Date = October 2017}} and looked for other areas to meet his needs.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{amazing that}} <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> {{in the time}} period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E

500|$|... "Marge vs. the Monorail" [...] {{has been}} widely praised by fans and critics and is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} best episodes of the entire series. Writer Conan O'Brien has claimed that, of the Simpsons episodes that <b>he</b> <b>wrote,</b> <b>this</b> was his favorite. Leonard Nimoy's unexpected guest appearance was also widely praised. Despite this, the episode attracted some criticism when it was first aired due to the somewhat abstract and less situational nature of the plot, particularly from voice actor Yeardley Smith who in 1995 described the episode as [...] "truly one of our worst".|$|E
500|$|Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah ( [...] , [...] "The Golden Treatise") is {{a medical}} {{dissertation}} on health and remedies attributed to Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha (765818), the eighth Imam of Shia. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> dissertation {{in accordance with the}} demand of Ma'mun, the caliph of the time. It is revered as the most precious Islamic literature in the science of medicine, and was entitled [...] "the golden treatise" [...] as Ma'mun had ordered it written in gold ink. The chain of narrators is said to reach Muhammad ibn Jumhoor or al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali who is described as [...] "highly esteemed and trustworthy" [...] by al-Najjashi.|$|E

5000|$|The {{different}} syntactic {{behavior of}} the negative particle not and the negative inflectional suffix -nt in the interrogative constructions is also worth noting. In formal literary English of the sort in which contractions are avoided, not attaches itself to the main verb: Does <b>he</b> not <b>write?</b> When the colloquial contraction -nt is used, this attaches itself to the auxiliary do: Doesnt <b>he</b> <b>write?</b> <b>This</b> in fact is a contraction of a more archaic word order, still occasionally found in poetry: *Does not <b>he</b> <b>write?</b> ...|$|R
500|$|One {{mix of the}} two audiences is the British writer, Theodore Dalrymple, {{reviewing}} The Rage Against God and Christopher Hitchens' Hitch-22 for the American journal First Things. Dalrymple writes, Peter Hitchens [...] "has {{discovered that}} it is he, {{and not just the}} world, that was and is imperfect and that therefore humility is a virtue, even if one does not always live up to it. The first sentence of his first chapter reads, “I set fire to my Bible on the playing fields of my Cambridge boarding school one bright, windy spring afternoon in 1967.” One senses the deep—and, in my view, healthy—feeling of self-disgust with which <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this,</b> for indeed it describes an act of wickedness. Peter’s memoir...is more personally searching." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{live at the}} Holland Festival on June18, 2010, in the Muziekgebouw aan'tIJ. The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian Ictus Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by Ictus Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Loïc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player Géry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. Patton has said of the work, [...] "I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as I can to Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized... Maybe because of the language barrier, maybe because it’s not easily understood. Berio, who was teaching in California when <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> piece, was listening to jazz, pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{writing in}} Starship Troopers has {{received}} varied responses, with {{the scenes of}} military training and combat receiving praise. In a 2009 retrospective, Jo Walton wrote that Starship Troopers was [...] "military SF done extremely well". She went on to argue that [...] "Heinlein was absolutely at his peak when <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> in 1959. He had so much technical stylistic mastery of the craft of writing science fiction that he could [...] 'backwards and in high heels' {{and get away with}} it." [...] Others referred to it as very readable, and found the military scenes compelling. Heinlein's descriptions of training and boot camp in the novel, based on his own experiences in the military, have been described as being rendered with remarkable skill. A 1960 review in the New York Herald Tribune praised the [...] "brilliantly written" [...] passages describing infantry combat, and also called attention to the discussion of weapons and armor, which, according to other reviewers, demonstrated Heinlein's [...] "undiminished talent for invention". Scholar George Slusser described the book in 1986 as the [...] "ultimately convincing space-war epic", praising in particular the [...] "precisely imagined" [...] weapons and tactics, while a 1979 science fiction encyclopedia referred to it as the [...] "slickest" [...] of Heinlein's juvenile books.|$|E
