5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is about two-thirds as tall as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|The broad, {{triangular}} pectoral fins originate {{below the}} third or fourth gill slits, and are no longer than the front margin of the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The anal fin is about twice as long as the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and preceded by long ridges. The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> originates over the pectoral fin free rear tips, and the much smaller second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> originates over the last third of the anal fin base. The dorsal fins do not have a ridge between them. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is well-developed and the upper lobe has a ventral notch near the tip. This shark is plain gray, brown-gray, or purple-gray above, and white below. The leading edge of the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and the trailing edge of the caudal fin may be dark, and the trailing edges of the pectoral fins may be light.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is {{positioned}} well {{back on the}} body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters {{as high as the}} first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, dark spots unique to each individual. The tips of the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and upper caudal fin lobe, and sometimes also the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and lower caudal fin lobe, are bright white.|$|E
50|$|The shoal bass has {{scales on}} the base portion of the soft-rayed <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins,</b> clearly {{connected}} first and second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins,</b> and an upper jaw bone that does not extend beyond the eyes.|$|R
50|$|Raising all <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> precedes {{swimming}} over short distances. Repeated synchronous adduction of the pectoral fins thrusts {{the body}} forward and is aided by backwards- and downwards-movements of the pectoral fins. While swimming the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> are folded.|$|R
50|$|Having {{distinctive}} grey, white, {{and black}} markings {{and a short}} snout, they are most easily recognized by their round <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins.</b> Maui's dolphins are generally found close to shore in groups or pods of several dolphins. They have solidly built bodies with gently sloping snouts and a unique rounded <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins.</b> (Maui's and Hector's are the only dolphins with well-rounded black <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins.)</b> Females grow to 1.7 m long and weigh up to 50 kg. Males are slightly smaller and lighter. The dolphins are known {{to live up to}} 20 years.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is {{tall and}} {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by a}} low midline ridge running to the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, with a faint white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. The Galapagos shark can be distinguished from the dusky shark in having taller first and second dorsal fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the grey reef shark in having a less robust body and less pointed first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in the Galapagos shark, 8697 in the dusky shark, 110119 in the grey reef shark.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{killer whale}} {{can often be}} identified from its <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of killer whales to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into lifecycles and social structures.|$|E
5|$|Both dorsal fins are {{immediately}} preceded by stout, grooved spines, {{with the second}} much longer than the first. The small first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> has a rounded apex and a nearly straight trailing margin, with its origin lying behind the pectoral fins. The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is rather angular and has about double {{the area of the}} first, with its origin located opposite the midpoint of the pelvic fin bases. The pectoral fins are small and rounded. The pelvic fins are about as large as the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> with rounded tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The caudal peduncle is short and leads to a broad caudal fin comprising {{less than a quarter of}} the total length; the upper lobe has a convex upper margin leading to a squared-off tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is densely covered by tiny dermal denticles; each one is recurved and thorn-like, rising from an irregular star-shaped base. This species is a plain dark brown above, darkening to almost black below, with white <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> spines. Juvenile sharks have white edges on the dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins. Minute, luminescent dots are scattered about the skin without a regular pattern.|$|E

50|$|The fish is a {{yellowish}} colour, being darker above with a diffuse silver longitudinal mid-lateral band on the sides. All fins are hyaline in appearance, {{with the}} <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> being dusky {{with a narrow}} blackish margin.

5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E
5|$|The {{fin whale}} is usually {{distinguished}} by its tall spout, long back, prominent <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> and asymmetrical colouration.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{adaptive}} control of low speed bio-robotic autonomous underwater vehicles (BAUVs) in the dive plane using <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> is considered. It {{is assumed that}} the model parameters are completely unknown and only {{the depth of the}} vehicle is measured for feedback. Two <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> are mounted in the horizontal plane {{on either side of the}} BAUV. The normal force produced by the fins, when cambered, is used for the maneuvering. The BAUV model considered here is non-minimum phase. An indirect {{adaptive control}} system is designed for the depth control using the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins.</b> The control system consists of a gradient based identifier for online parameter estimation, an observer for state estimation, and an optimal controller. Simulation results are presented which show that the adaptive control system accomplishes precise depth control of the BAUV using <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> in spite of large uncertainties in the system parameters...|$|R

5|$|The snout {{is rather}} short, broad, and rounded, without {{prominent}} flaps of skin beside the nostrils. The eyes {{are large and}} circular, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). There are 1113 tooth rows in either half of both jaws. The teeth have broad bases, serrated edges, and narrow cusps; the front 24 teeth on each side are erect and the others increasingly oblique. The five pairs of gill slits are moderately long, with the third gill slit over {{the origin of the}} pectoral fins. The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is high and falcate (sickle-shaped). There is a low interdorsal ridge running behind it to the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> which is relatively large with a short free rear tip. The origin of the first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> lies over or slightly forward of the free rear tips of the pectoral fins, and that of the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> lies over or slightly forward of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are long and narrow, tapering to a point. The dermal denticles are closely spaced and overlapping, each with five (sometimes seven in large individuals) horizontal low ridges leading to marginal teeth.|$|E
5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. A small and stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|The fins are {{strongly}} falcate (sickle-shaped), particularly the dorsal fins, pelvic fins, and lower caudal fin lobe. The pectoral fins are narrow and pointed. The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is positioned about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is about two-thirds as tall as the first and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin. The anal fin is smaller than the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The dorsal surface of the caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping; each has five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey or bronze above, often with small white spots on the sides, and pale below. The dorsal fins are tipped in white, which is especially obvious on the second dorsal as the remainder of fin is mostly dark.|$|E

5|$|The {{grey reef shark}} has a streamlined, {{moderately}} stout {{body with}} a long, blunt snout and large, round eyes. The upper and lower jaws each have 13 or 14 teeth (usually 14 in the upper and 13 in the lower). The upper teeth are triangular with slanted cusps, while the bottom teeth have narrower, erect cusps. The tooth serrations are larger in the upper jaw than in the lower. The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is medium-sized, {{and there is no}} ridge running between it and the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The pectoral fins are narrow and falcate (sickle-shaped).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of teleost species {{belong to the}} clade Euteleostei, which consists of 17,419 species classified in 2,935 genera and 346 families. Shared traits of the euteleosts include similarities in the embryonic development of the bony or cartilaginous structures located between the head and <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> (supraneural bones), an outgrowth on the stegural bone (a bone located near the neural arches of the tail) and caudal median cartilages located between hypurals of the caudal base. The {{majority of}} euteleosts are in the clade Neoteleosti. A derived trait of neoteleosts is a muscle that controls the pharyngeal jaws, giving them a role in grinding food. Within neoteleosts, the Acanthopterygii have a spiny <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> which {{is in front of}} the soft-rayed <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> This fin helps provide thrust in locomotion and may also play a role in defense. Acanthomorphs have developed spiny ctenoid scales (as opposed to the cycloid scales of other groups), tooth-bearing premaxilla and greater adaptations to high speed swimming.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} large and rounded. The {{origin of the}} first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> lies over {{the last third of}} the pelvic fin bases, while the origin of the much larger second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> lies over the rear of the anal fin. The claspers of adult males are moderately long and tapering, though those of some individuals may be knob-shaped and spiky. The anal fin is roughly equal in size to the pelvic fins, and smaller but longer-based than the second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin.</b> The short caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick; the dermal denticles have three-pointed crowns and are widely spaced compared to other species in the genus. Coloured yellowish brown above and cream below, this shark has a characteristic series of ten dorsal saddles from the head to the tail; each saddle is dark brown with a darker edge and a lighter middle. Unlike in the similar lined catshark, there are no spots or additional markings between the saddles.|$|E
25|$|Their {{bodies are}} {{elongate}} and sleek, {{typical of the}} catshark family. Their dorsal side is a dark reddish brown with dark saddle patterns on their side. Their ventral sides are a creamy white with reddish spots. Redspotted catsharks have two <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins,</b> with the first dorsal axil over the pelvic region. Their <b>dorsal</b> <b>fins</b> do not have spines, and their tails have no upward bend.|$|R

5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin,</b> pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the {{pectoral}} fins are broad and roughly triangular. The moderately tall first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is placed about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is about three-quarters {{as high as the}} first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black spots that fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second <b>dorsal</b> <b>fin</b> is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
