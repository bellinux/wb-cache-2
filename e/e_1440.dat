40|$|The sugar {{industry}} is {{the backbone of}} Swaziland's economy, with annual revenue exceeding <b>E</b> <b>1440</b> million (US$ 160 million). As part of the agricultural {{as well as the}} manufacturing sector, industry, it a accounts for 18 % of the country’s GDP. Therefore, the economy of Swaziland is to a great extent based on the {{sugar industry}}. This study presents empirical findings on the determinants of the profitability of sugarcane growers in the Swaziland sugar supply chain. The study is based on data collected in 2001 from 124 smallholder cane growers who supply sugarcane to the three sugar mills in Swaziland (Simunye, Ubombo (Bigbend) and Mhlume). The study used purposive sampling, which is most desirable when certain important segments of the target population are intentionally represented in the sample. The results of the study revealed that the performance of these farmers is affected by farming experience, change in sucrose quota, yield per ha, sucrose content and the distance from the farm to the mill. The implications of this study suggests, that smallholder farmers need to be trained and motivated in order to be commercially oriented. The Swaziland Government should play a role in providing smallholder cane growers with some training in business management skills and in addressing issues of concern to farmers as they develop in order to improve their yields. This should be done through the government extension agents, provided specifically to assist smallholder sugarcane farmers, and the various government departments involved in providing training in business and management skills. There is also a need to limit the production of sugarcane to areas, which are closer to the mills in order to reduce transaction costs...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant human {{phenylalanine}} hydroxylase (hPAH) {{was produced}} in high yields in Escherichia coli using the pET and pMAL expression vectors. In the pMAL system, hPAH was fused through the target sequences of the restriction protease factor Xa (IEGR) or enterokinase (D 4 K) to the C-terminal end of the highly expressed E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP). The recombinant hPAH, recovered in soluble forms, revealed a high specific activity even in crude extracts and was detected as a homogeneous band by Western-blot analysis using affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-(rat PAH) antibodies. The enzyme expressed in the pET system was subject to limited proteolysis by host cell proteases and was difficult to purify with a satisfactory yield. By contrast, when expressed as a fusion protein in the pMAL system, hPAH was resistant to cleavage by host cell proteases and was conveniently purified by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin. Catalytically active tetramer-dimer (in equilibrium) forms of the fusion protein were separated from inactive, aggregated forms by size-exclusion h. p. l. c. After cleavage by restriction protease, factor Xa or enterokinase, hPAH was separated from uncleaved fusion protein, MBP and restriction proteases by hydroxylapatite or ion-exchange (DEAE) chromatography. The yield of highly purified hPAH was approx. 10 mg/l of culture. The specific activity of the isolated recombinant enzyme was high (i. <b>e.</b> <b>1440</b> nmol of tyrosine. min- 1. mg- 1 with tetrahydrobiopterin as the cofactor) and its catalytic and physicochemical properties are {{essentially the same as}} those reported for the enzyme isolated from human liver. The recombinant enzyme, both as a fusion protein and as purified full-length hPAH, was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylated from of hPAH electrophoretically displayed an apparently higher molecular mass (approximately 51 kDa) than the non-phosphorylated (approximately 50 kDa) form...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a need}} {{to develop}} {{sustainable}} and productive cropping systems for edible vegetable oilseeds in tropical Africa. Field trials were conducted during the late cropping season (July–Nov.) of 2001 and 2002 to determine the grain yields, and other yield attributes of sunflower and soyabeans and their productivity under monocropping and intercropping. Three sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) varieties (a local adapted var. Funtua and two exotic varieties Isaanka and Record from Argentina) and five improved, high yielding soyabean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) varieties: TGx 1448 - 2 <b>E</b> (late), TGx <b>1440</b> - 1 <b>E</b> (late), TGx 1019 - 2 EB (medium), TGx 1740 - 2 F (early) and TGx 1485 - 1 D (early maturing) were used. Funtua had significantly greater head weight and diameter, achene number and weight per head than Isaanka and Record during the dry and relatively hot cropping season of 2001. Cropping system significantly reduced soyabean grain yield in intercropping, relative to monocropping, except when soyabean was intercropped with Isaanka in 2001 and Record in 2002. All yield attributes of both crops exhibited significant positive relationship with grain yields, except height to the lowest pod of soyabean.

40|$|Mammary {{tumors are}} the most common tumor type in both human and canine females. Mutations in the breast cancer {{susceptibility}} gene, BRCA 2, have been found in most cases of inherited human breast cancer. Similarly, the canine BRCA 2 gene locus has been associated with mammary tumors in female dogs. However, deleterious mutations in canine BRCA 2 have not been reported, thus far. The BRCA 2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair via its interaction with RAD 51 recombinase, an interaction mediated by 8 BRC repeats. These repeats are 26 -amino acid, conserved motifs in mammalian BRCA 2. Previous structural analyses of cancer-associated mutations affecting the BRC repeats have shown that the weakening of RAD 51 ’s affinity for even 1 repeat is sufficient to increase breast cancer susceptibility. In this study, we focused on 2 previously reported canine BRCA 2 mutations (T 1425 P and K 1435 R) in BRC repeat 3 (BRC 3), derived from mammary tumor samples. These mutations affected the interaction of canine BRC 3 with RAD 51, and were considered deleterious.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The area of Chroberz (southern Poland) poses {{questions}} of an interdisciplinary character comprising geomor-phologic, sedimentation, and archaeological-historical problems. The main {{aim of this}} study was to identify the geomorpho-logic response to changes in the natural environment that took place in the area of the loess plateau (and its close vicinity) as a result of its settlement by man and of climate change. Periods of particularly intense human activity (land-use changes, deforestation, and agriculture) were recorded as changes in the type of sedimentation, i. e. organic sedimentation substituted for mineral one; it was extremely intensive during the Neolithic Age, Iron Age, and Early Middle Ages. The conducted field-work research, analysis of available archaeological materials, and radiocarbon dating results show that there is a direct con-nection between human economic activity in primeval and historic times and between soil erosion and accumulation of colluvial/alluvial fans in the surroundings of the locality of Chroberz. 14 C dates documenting the age of colluvial sediment formation show that individual areas of the upland were settled by humans asynchronously. On the basis of a low facial vari-ability, or, occasionally, even homogeneity, of individual colluvia (from soil erosion) and their considerable thickness, it can be concluded that the land was in constant use or that the intervals with no human activity were relatively short. The progress-ing human impact process is visible both in the form progradation recorded as the changes in 14 C ages (<b>e.</b> g. from <b>1440</b> ± 100 to 780 ± 80 BP) and in textural (e. g. chemical) features of sediments of which the examined fans are composed...|$|R

Material e Método: Foram selecionados 500 indivíduos de ambos os gêneros (Grupo Controle: n = 224, idade média 35, 3 anos; Grupo Periodontite [GP] n = 276, idade média 43, 4 anos) que procuraram atendimento na Faculdade de Odontologia de Araraquara. A partir de células da mucosa bucal, o DNA foi extraído por uma solução de solventes orgânicos (fenol:clorofórmio:álcool isoamílico; - 25 : 24 : 1). Os polimorfismos + 785 e + 1208 foram investigados pela técnica SSP-PCR (Sequence Specific Primer – PCR) enquanto que o polimorfismo + 1440 foi analisado por PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction – Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). Os fragmentos obtidos por PCR-RFLP e os produtos obtidos por SSP-PCR foram submetidos à eletroforese vertical em gel de poliacrilamida a 10 % (locus + 785 e + 1208) e 14 % (locus + 1440), sendo depois corados com nitrato de prata. Resultados: Considerando a frequência de alelos e genótipos de cada polimorfismo isoladamente, não foi encontrada diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos. Quando analisados em haplótipos, a freqüência do haplótipo TCG foi significativamente maior no Grupo Periodontite (p= 0, 005; {{odds ratio}} [OR] = 3, 54) do que no Controle. O haplótipo heterozigoto TCG/CCA foi relacionado com um aumento de suscetibilidade à periodontite na população total (p= 0, 015; OR= 3, 22). Conclusão: Os resultados deste estudo sugerem que haplótipos no gene CXCR 2 estão associados com suscetibilidade à periodontite em indivíduos brasileiros. Objective: This study investigated whether the + 785 (C/T), + 1208 (T/C) and + 1440 (G/A) {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) in the CXCR 2 gene, {{as well as their}} haplotypes, would be associated with susceptibility to periodontitis in Brazilian individuals. Methods: Five hundred individuals in both genders (Control Group [CG] = 224, mean age 35. 3 years; Periodontitis Group [PG] = 276, mean age 43. 4 years) were recruited for this study from the patient pool of the School of Dentistry of Araraquara – FOAr/UNESP. DNA was extracted from buccal epithelial cells with a solution of organic solvents (phenol/chlorophorm/isoamilic alcohol, - 25 : 24 : 1). The + 785 and + 1208 SNPs were investigated using the Sequence Specific Primers Polymerase Chain Reaction method (SSP-PCR). The + 1440 SNP was genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism). The SSP-PCR products and the RFLP fragments were submitted to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a concentration of 10 % and 14 %, respectively, which were stained by silver staining method. Results: Considering each polymorphism allele and genotype frequency isolated, no differences were found between groups. The frequency of TCG haplotype was significantly higher in the Periodontitis group (p= 0. 005, odds ratio [OR] = 3. 54) than in the Controls. The heterozygous haplotype TCG/CCA was related to an increased susceptibility to Periodontitis in the total casuistic (p= 0. 015, OR= 3. 22).

The second and third experiments were installed in upland and had the objective of evaluating the efficacy and selectivity of herbicides: bentazon (0, 180, 360, 720, 1440 and 2880 g ha- 1), fomesafen (0, 62, 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 g ha- 1), fluazifop-p-butyl (0, 62. 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 g ha- 1) and clethodim (0, 27, 54, 108, 216 and 432 g ha- 1) in cowpea crop and evaluated the effect of herbicides: bentazon (0, 180, 360, 720, 1440 and 2880 g ha- 1), fomesafen (0, 62. 5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 g ha- 1) and clethodim (0, 27, 54, 108, 216 and 432 g ha- 1) on the growth of the culture. In the floodplain area the herbicides bentazon, clethodim, fluazifop-p-butyl, linuron, oxyfluorfen and sulfentrazone reduced more than 50 % of the weeds. The cowpea tolerate the herbicides s-metolachlor, bentazon, fluazifop-p-butyl, clethodim, sulfentrazone and fomesafen. However, it was not tolerant to linuron and oxyfluorfen. The highest yields were obtained with bentazon, s-metolachlor and sulfentrazone. In the second experiment the herbicides bentazon and fomesafen reduced more than 50 % of the dry matter of weeds. The fluazifop-p-butyl and clethodim were not effective in controlling weeds. The cowpea was tolerant to herbicides bentazon, fluazifop-p-butyl and clethodim and was susceptible to fomesafen.

O objetivo deste estudo foi reconhecer a deposição de colágeno através dos poros de tela de polipropileno, implantada em parede {{abdominal}} de ratos adultos jovens e comparar à de ratos velhos. MÉTODOS: Utilizaram-se 10 ratos machos com idade entre 100 e 120 dias e 10 ratos com idade entre 850 e 900 dias. Sob anestesia inalatória fez-se uma incisão mediana na parede abdominal ventral e produziu-se uma falha com 4 cm², retirando-se o plano músculo-aponevrótico, mantendo-se o plano peritoneal. Corrigiu-se a falha com malha de polipropileno fixada com pontos separados de fio 5. 0, também de polipropileno e fez-se a síntese da pele. Após 30 dias fez-se a eutanásia e retirou-se a parede abdominal ventral com a prótese. Dividiu-se o retalho com o enxerto em 2 partes, uma ensaio de tração e a outra para estudo histopatológico. Coraram-se os cortes obtidos pela hematoxilina e eosina e Sirius-red. Estes foram examinados em microscópio de luz polarizada através do programa Image Plus. RESULTADOS: O ensaio de tração não demonstrou diferença significante de resistência entre os dois grupos. Reação inflamatória agudo-crônica, com grande quantidade de células gigantes de corpo estranho, esteve presente nos dois grupos com intensidade semelhante, o mesmo acontecendo com a concentração total de colágeno (p= 0, <b>1440)</b> <b>e</b> de colágeno tipo I (p= 0, 3981). Já a concentração de colágeno tipo III era maior nos cortes dos animais velhos (p= 0, 0364). CONCLUSÃO: Estes resultados permitem concluir que o envelhecimento não prejudica o ganho de resistência e a deposição de colágeno, porém existe atraso da maturação tecidual. PURPOSE: Some {{investigators have}} stated that collagen synthesis is slower in elderly individuals, others have reported a reduction of collagen I and III synthesis, and still others have reported normal synthesis. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the collagen deposition occurring through the pores of a propylene net implanted in the abdominal wall of young adult rats compared to old rats. METHODS: Ten male rats aged 100 to 120 days and 10 rats aged 850 to 900 days were used. Under inhalatory anesthesia, a median incision was made in the ventral abdominal wall and a 4 cm² gap was formed. The muscle-aponeurosis plane was removed and the peritoneal plane was maintained. The gap was corrected with a polypropylene mesh fixed with separate 5. 0 polypropylene sutures and the skin margins were joined. The animals were sacrificed 30 days later and the ventral abdominal wall with the prosthesis was removed. The flap with the graft was divided into 2 parts, one for the traction assay and the other for histopathological study. The sections obtained were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius-red and examined under a polarized light microscope using the Image Plus software. RESULTS: The traction assay did not demonstrate a significant difference in resistance between groups. An acute-chronic inflammatory reaction with large quantities of giant foreign body cells was present at similar intensity in both groups, the same being observed for total collagen concentration (p= 0. 1440) and type I collagen concentration (p= 0. 3981). In contrast, type III collagen concentration was higher in the sections from old animals (p= 0. 0364). CONCLUSIONS: These results permit us to conclude that aging does not impair the resistance gain or collagen deposition, although a delayed tissue maturation occurs...|$|R
40|$|O estudo foi realizado em duas etapas distintas. A primeira, composta por quatro ensaios, constou da aplicação de {{glyphosate}} (360 g e. a. L- 1) em eucalipto. Em todos os ensaios, mudas foram transplantadas em vasos de 5, 0 L. Nos ensaios 1 e 2, foram aplicados volumes de glyphosate no caule do eucalipto. No primeiro ensaio, uma solução de glyphosate na concentração de 3 % (v/v) foi aplicada nas doses: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 e 160 L. planta- 1 e, no segundo, a solução a 2 % (v/v) foi aplicada nas doses de: 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 e 150 L. planta- 1. Nos ensaios 3 e 4, foram feitas aplicações de glyphosate sobre o eucalipto. No ensaio 3 as doses foram: 0, 7, 2. 10 - 7, 7, 2. 10 - 6, 7, 2. 10 - 5, 7, 2. 10 - 4, 7, 2. 10 - 3, 7, 2. 10 - 2, 7, 2. 10 - 1, 7, 2, 72, 360 e 720 g e. a de glyphosate. ha- 1 e, no ensaio 4, as doses foram: 0, 9, 18, 36, 72, 144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 1080, <b>1440</b> <b>e</b> 2160 g e. a de glyphosate. ha- 1. Nos quatro ensaios foi utilizado o delineamento DIC, com três repetições. Nas plantas foram avaliadas: altura, área foliar, matéria seca de caule e folhas. Os resultados obtidos foram submetidos a análises de regressao. Na segunda etapa, conduzida em campo, o mesmo clone de eucalipto foi plantado em 02 / 04 / 2004. Aos 1, 3, 5, 7 e 9 meses após o plantio (MAP), doses 0, 36, 72, 144, 288, 432 g e. a. ha- 1 de glyphosate foram aplicadas sobre as plantas. O experimento foi montado em faixas de épocas de aplicação e doses do herbicida. As faixas tinham duas linhas de eucalipto por noventa metros, totalizando 90 plantas. Aos 10, 13, 26, 48 e 62 MAP foram feitas avaliações de altura e diâmetro. Com essas variáveis calculou-se o volume cilíndrico de madeira com casca. Ao final do ensaio (68 meses) foram feitas análises químicas de extrativos, lignina total, holoceluse e densidade basica da madeira nas doses de glyphosate aplicadas aos 5 MAP. Também foi avaliado o rendimento ao cozimento todas as épocas [...] . The {{study was}} conducted in two phase. The first, composed of four trials, consisted of the application of glyphosate (360 g a. e. L- 1) on eucalyptus. In all the tests, seedlings were transplanted to pots of 5. 0 L. In trials 1 and 2, it was applied volumes of glyphosate on the eucalyptus stem. In the first test, a glyphosate solution at 3 % (v/v) concentration was applied in the. doses: 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 4. plant- 1 and, in the second, the solution at 2 % (v/v) was applied in the doses of: 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 viL. plant- 1. In the trials 3 and 4, it was made applications of glyphosate on eucalyptus. In the trial 3 doses were 0, 7, 2. 10 - 7, 7, 2. 10 - 6, 7, 2. 10 - 5, 7, 2. 10 -a, 7, 2. 10 - 3, 7, 2. 10 - 2, 7, 2. 10 - 1, 7, 2, 72, 360 e 720 g a. e of glyphosate. ha- 1 and, in trial 4, the doses were: 0, 9, 18, 36, 72, 144, 288, 432, 576, 720, 1080, 1440 and 2160 g e. a of glyphosate. ha- 1. In the fourth tests it was used the randomized completely design, with three replicates. Plants were evaluated by height, leaf area, dry matter of stem and leaves. The results obtained were submitted to regression analyzes. In the second stage, conducted in the field, the same eucalyptus clone was planted in 04 - 02 - 2004. At 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 months after planting (MAP), doses 0, 36, 72, 144, 288, 432 g e. a. ha- 1 of glyphosate were applied on the plants. The experiment was installed in strip tests of varying herbicide doses. The strips had two lines of eucalyptus by ninety meters, total of 90 plants. At 10, 13, 26, 48 and 62 MAP assessments were held in height and diameter. With these variables it was calculated the wood volume with bark. At the end of the trial (68 months) it was performed chemical analysis of extractives, lignin total holoceluse and basic wood density at doses of glyphosate applied at 5 MAP. It was also evaluated the wood cooking, in all times of application and doses of glyphosate [...] . (Complete abstract click electronic access below...|$|R
