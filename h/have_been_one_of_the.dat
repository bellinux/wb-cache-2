5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E

5|$|Carolingian support may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{factors that}} helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} {{successes of the}} late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed {{at some time in}} the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the {{first of a series of}} internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{location}} {{along the}} coast and association with similar sites along the Swahili Coast made it an important trade center. Although there are few historical documents specifically associating Gedi with Indian Ocean trade, the site is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important sites {{along the coast}}. Gedi's architecture and an abundance of imported material culture including pottery, beads, and coins provide evidence of the city's rising prosperity {{over the course of}} its occupation from as early as the eleventh century to its abandonment in the early seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E

5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is claimed by the Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential source for the period—to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cities abandoned c. 587/8 {{as a result of}} the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria. This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact {{may have played}} a role in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors causing the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands of}} the Clyde may well have formed the power base of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde and his {{descendants}} by {{the last half of}} the 12th century. At about this time period, the authority of the Steward of Scotland seems to have encroached into the region; and there is reason to suspect that, by the turn of the 13th century, the islands were consumed by the expanding Stewart lordship. The western extension of Scottish authority appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors behind a Norwegian invasion of the region in 1230, in which the invaders seized Rothesay Castle.|$|E

5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work.

It would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E
5|$|The robbery {{also made}} the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups.

Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, but despite the fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, he appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.|$|E

5|$|Thomas is also speculated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{driving forces}} behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} {{that took place}} in 1240. The speculation is based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E
5|$|Under {{continuing}} {{pressure from}} Raff, Edison eventually conceded {{to investigate the}} possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson.

5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire financial straits. SMI's affiliation with Nissan could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a major shareholder of Nissan by then. One of the very early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).|$|E
5|$|Hearth-tax {{assessments}} of 1674 show the original hall to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest houses in Cheshire, its 42 hearths being surpassed only by Cholmondeley House and Rocksavage, {{neither of which}} have survived. As depicted in a painting of around 1710, the original building was square with sides of around , and featured gabled projecting bays and groups of octagonal chimney stacks. Built around a central open courtyard, the interior had a great hall and long gallery; the main entrance led to a screens passage and the main staircase was in a small east hall. Externally, there was a walled forecourt and formal walled gardens; a range of separate service buildings was located to the west.|$|E
