5|$|In November 1970, {{the group}} were {{involved}} in a car accident returning from a gig in Basingstoke. The band all suffered shock, and Kaye broke a foot. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the next few gigs, and the album cover's photo shoot, with it in plaster.|$|E
5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the book would require illustrations {{of the type}} and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book {{to be a success}} and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|At Bound for Glory, Anderson {{failed in}} his attempt to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship when Jeff Hardy, with Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff's assistance, pinned him in a {{three-way}} match (which also included Kurt Angle) to win the title, ending his partnership with Hardy in the process. On the October 21 edition of Impact!, Anderson was given an opportunity to earn a shot at Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point; all <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was survive an Ultimate X match with Fortune member Kazarian. Kazarian managed to win the match, following interference from his stable mates, but Anderson persevered and thus earned himself a World Heavyweight title shot against Hardy, who attacked him after the match. However, during the attack, Anderson suffered a legitimate concussion, which would sideline him for a few weeks and prevented him from taking part in the title match.|$|E

5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to survive. In the {{time spent in the}} brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{first thing}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was {{determine}} {{the characteristics of}} the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E

5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As {{a result of this}} he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a laboratory research career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E
25|$|Awaya {{took the}} mayoralty in July 1943. Militarists held bad {{feelings}} toward him, but among citizens his popularity was high for his rectitude.

25|$|Following Cabezas exile, Spínola {{escaped from}} Guatemala {{and went into}} Mexico, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> several menial jobs to survive; there, he met several {{important}} personalities of the time, including write and diplomat Federico Gamboa, who in his memories tells about Spínola difficult ordeal. Spínola had to work in whichever job he could find, including a third category municipal clerk in Orizaba, Veracruz.|$|E

25|$|According to Pinkerton, {{a captain}} of the roads {{reported}} {{that there was a}} plot to stab the President-elect. The alleged plan was to have several assassins, armed with knives, interspersed throughout the crowd that would gather to greet Lincoln at the President Street station. When Lincoln emerged from the car, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to change trains, {{at least one of the}} assassins would be able to get close enough to kill him.|$|E
25|$|Allison would mathematically {{clinch the}} {{championship}} if he finished sixth or better, {{regardless of the}} other five drivers' performances. If Allison were to lead a single lap during the race, all <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was finish 7th or better; if he had led the most laps, he needed only to finish 8th or better. Numerous other championship scenarios generally favored Allison, provided he finished ahead of his competitors, and led a lap during the race. Allison led second-place Alan Kulwicki by 30 points and Bill Elliott by 40.|$|E
25|$|Geary {{was also}} a capable lower order batsman who usually relied upon hitting, but could get runs with a quiet, if unstylish {{determination}} when they were desperately needed. Though he never scored a thousand runs - his best aggregates were 923 in 1929 and 900 in 1925 - his runs were frequently of great value to a county that never possessed any of the exceptionally high-class batsmen other counties could command in Geary's heyday. Owing to his considerable height and reach, Geary was an excellent slip catcher and, despite all the bowling <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> almost always his county's leading fielder.|$|E

25|$|Captain Nutsch soon {{requested}} {{replacements for}} the traditional small, hard, wooden saddles used by the Afghanistan soldiers. He specified a supply of lightweight saddles, either McClellan or Australian-style, suitable for the smaller Afghan horses. A supply of saddles was air-dropped in mid-November. The last U.S. Army unit to receive horseback training was the 28th Cavalry in 1943. A picture of the soldiers on horseback was shown by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld during a news conference on 15 November 2001. When sculptor Douwe Blumberg saw that image, he felt impressed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something and created what became the only public sculpture to commemorate special forces, America's Response Monument.|$|E
25|$|In 1217 Valdemar {{fled the}} Prince-Archbishopric towards his nephew Albert I, Duke of Saxony. Later Valdemar entered the Saxon Cistercian Loccum Abbey. The abbot {{thought he was}} sick unto death, dispended him {{for the time being}} from the bans and {{received}} him as a monk by 1219. After Valdemar had recovered, however, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> penance and went to Rome in 1220, where Pope Honorius III forgave him, lifted the anathema again, and reaccepted him in the Church's bosom, but forbade him to officiate as priest and sent him to the Cîteaux Abbey. The pope left it up to the abbots of the Cîteaux and Morimond Abbeys to determine Valdemar's future residence. Valdemar was sent to Loccum, as he wished for, living a decent monastic life.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, for {{the second}} time, Lee was {{dividing}} his army. Jackson would lead his Second Corps of 28,000 men around to attack the Union right flank while Lee exercised personal command of the remaining two divisions, about 13,000 men and 24 guns facing the 70,000 Union troops at Chancellorsville. For the plan to work, several things had to happen. First, Jackson {{had to make a}} 12-mile (19km) march via roundabout roads to reach the Union right, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it undetected. Second, Hooker had to stay tamely on the defensive. Third, Early would have to keep Sedgwick bottled up at Fredericksburg, despite the four-to-one Union advantage there. And when Jackson launched his attack, he had to hope that the Union forces were unprepared.|$|E

25|$|The group put {{themselves}} through challenges that {{forced them to}} find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold. For example, {{no one in the}} group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing. During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out {{in order to make a}} jump, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot. At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{ending with}} the {{conviction}} and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, {{the investigation into the}} break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so {{in a way that was}} least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974. On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.|$|E
25|$|After a lap {{behind the}} safety car, the field were let loose {{again at the}} {{beginning}} of lap three. Vernay closed in on his Italian team-mate, slipstreaming past him on the run to the Mandarin, and doing enough to hold off Mortara into Lisboa. For the ensuing laps, Vernay was doing what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to keep his team-mate, who had stepped back from GP2 to rid himself of his close defeat to Keisuke Kunimoto in the previous year's race. Further back, Bianchi, who had avoided the first lap incidents was quietly moving his way up the field, and was eleventh by the end of lap seven. Sims had also dropped to the tail of the field, after a move on Cozzolino failed, and he made an unscheduled trip up the Lisboa escape road. Mortara started charging back towards Vernay, and in the process, broke the Frenchman's lap record set the day before. Mortara lowered it to a lap of 2:10.732, lapping the circuit at close to 105mph, and well under the previous record held by Marko Asmer. Cozzolino exited the race on lap eleven, crashing at Black Sands without the need for the safety car to reappear.|$|E
