2500|$|The {{reserve is}} part of the Western Sudetes {{mountains}} stretching from south-central Poland along the northern border of the Czech Republic to eastern Germany. The mountains are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins. The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from submontane to alpine. The river valleys and lower layers form the sub-montane zone made up of forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). The higher parts form the montane vegetation zone characterized by forested areas of Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). Above [...] is the subalpine zone, which is marked by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo), mat-grass meadows and subarctic <b>highmoors.</b> There are three subapline bogs that support an extensive algal community important for migratory birds and raptors. The alpine vegetation zone, is characterized by large rocky deserts with herbaceous perennials such as Carici (rigidae)-Nardetum and Festucetum supinae.|$|R

50|$|Wigton School (also called Brookfield School or Friends' School) was {{a private}} {{boarding}} school {{on the outskirts of}} Wigton, Cumbria. The school was opened on 4 September 1815 by the Society of Friends (Quakers) for Cumberland and Northumberland.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the cottages, the village had six farms, each covering about 20 acres, to create employment and trade for the village. Three of the farm buildings survive: <b>Highmoor</b> Farm is still operational, White Farm served as stables into {{the early years of}} the 21st century, and Lollipop Farm has been converted into a dwelling house.

5000|$|In 1969 the Protected Landscape Area (CHKO) Jeseník was founded, {{comprising}} the mountain ridge of Hrubý Jeseník {{and a part}} of the Zlatohorská vrchovina (Highlands). Specifically valuable areas are protected in national reserves: Šerák-Keprník with conserved virgin forest and distinguished flora and Rejvíz with the <b>highmoor</b> bog and rich fauna and flora. Similar importance has the National Reserve Rašenliniště Skřitek ("the peat bog") and the largest and most valuable nature reservation Praděd (Mt.) with famous Velký and Malý Kotel (big and Little Kettle) called the [...] "Botanic Garden of the Middle Europe". The National Nature Monument Špičák is known with its karst formation and ingenuous growths of yew.|$|E
50|$|At the end {{of season}} Colin Millard {{resigned}} {{and was replaced by}} former Henley Town boss Roddy Slater. Roddy's stint in charge lasted only one season and he resigned at {{the end of}} 2010-11 to be succeeded by Mark Bartley. Under Mark Bartley the club {{went on to win the}} Hellenic League Supplementary cup, beating <b>Highmoor</b> Ibis 4-3 in the final. At the end of the season Bartley resigned due to not wanting to work on a smaller budget for the following season. Michael Butcher was appointed as Bartleys replacement but only lasted till January 2013 when he quit as manager and former manager Colin Millard took over. In June 2013 Millard's appointment was made permanent.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{climate and}} {{elevation}} differences both locations are characterised by grassland dominated by warm-season, C 4 grasses including Themeda triandra Forssk., Alloteropsis semialata (R.Br.) Hitchc., and Aristida junciformis Trin. & Rupr. Because {{of the higher}} elevation, <b>Highmoor</b> sits at a transition between sub-montane grassland dominated by warm-season species and mixed Themeda-Festuca montane grassland (Killick 1963). Thus, large patches of the cool-season, C 3 Festuca costata Nees occur among warm-season grassland at <b>Highmoor.</b>|$|E
30|$|At Ukulinga, the {{increase}} in predicted fire intensity as fuels cured was linear and consistent across species, {{with the exception of}} a sharp divergence on the 10 May sampling event, which was likely driven by differential responses of fuel moisture to a rain event the previous day. At <b>Highmoor,</b> predicted fire intensity increased later and more slowly than at Ukulinga. Predicted fire intensity varied considerably within and among species at <b>Highmoor</b> due to differences in high and low moisture content, but within-species variation in predicted fire intensity was relatively low at Ukulinga (Figure 3). The average scenario, which predicted fire intensity using mean fuel moisture across all species, had a relatively linear increase over time at Ukulinga, but was later and slower to increase at <b>Highmoor</b> (Figure 3).|$|E
30|$|The study {{included}} two locations in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a mid-altitude site (840 m a.s.l.) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal Ukulinga Research Farm in Pietermaritzburg (30 ° 24 ′ S, 29 ° 24 ′ E; hereafter Ukulinga) and a high-altitude site (1850 m a.s.l) at <b>Highmoor</b> {{in the central}} region of the uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park (20 ° 32 ′ 07 ″ S, 29 ° 62 ′ 16 ″ E). Ukulinga is characterised by hot summers, mild winters, and 838 mm mean annual precipitation, mostly from summer rainstorms (Buis et al. 2009). <b>Highmoor</b> is characterised by cold winters, mild summers, and 1400 mm mean annual rainfall (Mentis and Bigalke 1981) occurring over a long, foggy summer rainy season. The Soil and Terrain Database for southern Africa classifies soils at Ukulinga as Dystric Regosols and soils at <b>Highmoor</b> as Eutric Regosols (ISRIC 2008). Regosols are a taxonomic “rest group” of soils that do not fit other major soil groups due to {{a general lack of}} diagnostic horizons characteristic of eroded land and mountainous regions (FAO 2001). In our observations, soil at <b>Highmoor</b> tended to have higher proportions of organic matter than soils at Ukulinga.|$|E
30|$|We sampled {{fuel and}} soil {{moisture}} five times at approximately monthly intervals at both locations in 2014 (<b>Highmoor,</b> 8 March through 26 July; Ukulinga, 25 March through 2 August). Sampling was timed to span {{the end of}} the growing season into mid-winter when grassland fuels are typically fully cured (Everson et al. 1988). All three C 4 grasses (Themeda, Alloteropsis, Aristida) were collected at each location in addition to the C 3 Festuca collected only at <b>Highmoor.</b> We used a spatially nested design wherein two samples per sample type (three to four species plus soil) were collected at two sites per location during each sampling event (n = 2 true replicates per sample per event per location).|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} the effect of substrate type on growth of Corsican hellebore (Helleborus argutifolius Viviani). Plants were grown for two years in pots with substrates whose components included Klasmann <b>highmoor</b> peat and Hartmann <b>highmoor</b> peat, mineral soil, expanded clay and perlite at various volumetric ratios. Vegetative growth and flowering were observed in hellebores. It was shown that substrates exhibited a varied effect on plant growth. Corsican hellebore in a substrate with a considerable addition of mineral soil was lower, but more branched, and it did not form inflorescences. An optimal medium for growing H. argutifolius in pots was Hartmann’s de-acidified peat + mineral soil (1 : 1 v:v). In this medium vegetative growth of plants was extensive, flowering was early and abundant, and long peduncles were produced...|$|E
