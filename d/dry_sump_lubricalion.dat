50|$|Because of the <b>dry</b> <b>sump's</b> {{external}} oil reservoir, {{excess air}} can escape the oil before {{the oil is}} pumped back through the engine. <b>Dry</b> <b>sumps</b> also allow for more power because they {{reduce the amount of}} windage, oil sloshing up into the rotating assembly, and the vacuum from the scavenge pump improves ring seal. <b>Dry</b> <b>sumps</b> are more popular in racing applications because of the improved power and reduced oil sloshing that would otherwise reduce oil pressure. Disadvantages of <b>dry</b> <b>sumps</b> are increased weight, additional parts, and more chances for leaks and problems to occur.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{losses are}} of great {{significance}} to the automotive and motorsports industries. Many of these losses are incurred during power transmission through the gearbox. There has been considerable research in this area, however, generally gear losses are not calculated at part load condition, nor are so called <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> systems considered outside of motor racing. The method developed by Anderson & Loewenthal which considers efficiency over part-load conditions is used here to calculate geartrain losses with varying speed, load and temperature conditions in a spur gear type gearbox for motorsport application. Both oil bath (wet sump) and oil jet (<b>dry</b> <b>sump)</b> systems of lubrications are considered. The Changenet method {{is used to calculate}} the churning losses in the typical oil bath lubrication system. Seventeen different mineral and synthetic oils were evaluated. At 75 kW engine output, 1200 W were lost in the <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> gearbox whereas 1320 W were lost in the wet-sump gearbox – in 1 st gear at 9000 rpm engine speed. The oils studied showed a spread of total drive efficiency of 97. 8 to 99 % in the most extreme temperature case. Observation of how efficiency and film thickness relate to operating temperatures it is clear that tight temperature control is critical to obtain the potential benefits available from oil optimisation. The <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> gearbox is predicted to be more efficient only above 5000 rpm engine speed...|$|R

Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|R

40|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> {{lubrication}} {{system for a}} Formula SAE race car was designed and manufactured {{in order to gain}} the various advantages this type of system affords. A <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> system stores oil in an external tank and pumps it between the engine and tank as needed. This allows for a shallower oil pan, which permits lower engine placement. This lower placement improves handling through a lower center of gravity. Additionally, the highly stressed racing engine, a Honda CBR 600 F 4 i, receives more constant lubrication than a conventional wet sump system. The system included design of a new pan, tank and the associated bracketry and hoses that are needed to make the system functional. The design of the system stressed reliability while keeping an eye on weight to minimize it whenever possible. Detailed analysis and the methodology driving the design choices are presented here along with simple <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> theory. This document serves as the roadmap through the design of the first <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> system on an MIT FSAE car. It should prove beneficial to the team when the official design report is created for the competition. Lastly, it will help assist future members who certainly aim to refine the package in subsequent years to make it smaller, cheaper, lighter, more reliable and simply better performing overall. by Ehsan Farkhondeh.
