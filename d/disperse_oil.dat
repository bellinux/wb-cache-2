40|$|Abstract Background The use of dispersants {{can be an}} {{effective}} way to deal with acute oil spills to limit environmental damage, however very little is known about whether chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> have the same toxic effect on marine organisms as mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil.</b> We exposed Atlantic cod larvae to chemically and mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> for four days during the first-feeding stage of development, and collected larvae at 14 days post hatch for transcriptional analysis. A genome-wide microarray was used to screen for effects and to assess whether molecular responses to chemically and mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> were similar, given the same exposure to oil (droplet distribution and concentration) with and without the addition of a chemical dispersant (Dasic NS). Results Mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> induced expression changes in almost three times as many transcripts compared to chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> (fold change >+/− 1. 5). Functional analyses suggest that chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> affects partly different pathways than mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil.</b> By comparing the alteration in gene transcription in cod larvae exposed to the highest concentrations of either chemically or mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> directly, the chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> affected transcription of genes involved nucleosome regulation, i. e. genes encoding proteins participating in DNA replication and chromatin formation and regulation of cell proliferation, whereas the mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> most strongly affected genes encoding proteins involved in proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Cyp 1 a was the transcript that was most strongly affected in both exposure groups, with a 60 -fold induction in the two high-exposure groups according to the RT-qPCR data, but no significant difference in transcriptional levels was observed between the two treatments. Conclusions In summary, dispersants do not appear to add to the magnitude of transcriptional responses of oil compounds but rather appear to lower or modify the transcriptional effect on cod larvae. </p...|$|R

ABSTRACT The Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 raised {{concerns}} that dispersant and <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil,</b> {{as well as}} crude oil itself, could contaminate shellfish and seafood habitats with hazardous residues that had potential implications for {{human health and the}} ecosystem. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of crude oil and dispersant on the human fecal microbiota. The aim of this research was to evaluate the potential effects of Deepwater Horizon crude oil, Corexit 9500 dispersant, and their combina-tion on human fecal microbial communities, using an in vitro culture test system. Fecal specimens from healthy adult volunteers were made into suspensions, which were then treated with oil, dispersant, or oil-dispersant mixtures under anaerobic conditions in an in vitro culture test system. Perturbations of the microbial community, compared to untreated control cultures, were as-sessed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), real-time PCR, and pyrosequencing methods. DGGE and pyrose-quencing analysis showed that oil-dispersant mixtures reduced the diversity of fecal microbiota from all individuals. Real-time PCR results indicated that the copy numbers of 16 S rRNA genes in cultures treated with <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> or oil alone were signifi-cantly lower than those in control incubations. The abundance of the Bacteroidetes decreased in crude oil-treated and dispersed-oil-treated cultures, while the Proteobacteria increased in cultures treated with <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil.</b> In conclusion, the human fecal mi-crobiota was affected differently by <b>oil</b> and <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil,</b> and the influence of <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> was significantly greater than that of either oil or dispersant alone compared to control cultures...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} the {{enrichment}} culture technique, a mixed population of microorganisms was obtained which catalyzed the dispersion of crude oil in supplemented sea water. From this enrichment culture, eight pure cultures were isolated and studied. Only one of the isolates (RAG- 1) brought about a significant dispersion of crude oil. RAG- 1 has been tentatively characterized {{as a member of}} the genus Arthrobacter. The other seven isolates gave rise to colonies on supplemented oil agar, but were neither able to <b>disperse</b> <b>oil</b> nor to stimulate the dispersion catalyzed by RAG- 1. The dispersion of crude oil by either RAG- 1 or the enrichment culture was absolutely dependent on exogenous sources of nitrogen and phosphorous and completely inhibited by 10 − 2 m azide. The increase in cell number of RAG- 1 was directly proportional to the concentration of crude oil added to the medium over the range 0. 05 to 1. 0 mg/ml. Within this linear region, 1. 0 mg of crude oil yielded 9 × 107 cells and approximately 65 % of the oil was converted into a nonbenzene extractable form. Accompanying the emulsification was a decrease in the pH from 7. 6 to 5. 0. Acidic conditions, however, were neither necessary nor sufficient for oil dispersion. When sea water was supplemented with 0. 029 mm K 2 HPO 4 and 3. 8 mm (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and inoculated with RAG- 1, oil dispersion occurred within 1 day.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this Capstone is to evaluate the potential and probable effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and related remedial activities on brown (Farfantepenaeus aztecus) and white (Litopenaeus setiferus) shrimp in the northern Gulf of Mexico. This spill began on April 20, 2010, and continued for 87 days until the well was capped on July 15, 2010. Approximately 4. 9 {{million barrels of oil}} were spilled, which is considered to be the largest accidental release of oil to the marine environment. The oil spill occurred at a water depth of approximately 1, 500 m. Brown and white shrimp support a valuable commercial fishery in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a total value of $ 301 million in 2009 (the year before the oil spill). However, the spilled oil covered, on a cumulative basis, as much as 176, 100 km 2 (68, 000 square miles) of water, causing the closure of as much as 35 % of federal fishing grounds during June and early July. The spawning grounds of the two species of shrimp are inshore of the origin of the oil spill, typically occurring at water depths of 18 – 137 m for brown shrimp and 7 – 55 m for white shrimp. However, the oil slick moved through these spawning areas and sometimes penetrated the estuaries, which serve as important nursery areas for postlarval. juvenile, and subadult shrimp. In addition, the toxicity of the major chemical (Corexit 9500 A) used to <b>disperse</b> <b>oil</b> in the water column is evaluated. It was concluded by the U. S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that Corexit 9500 A tested alone was less toxic than oil tested alone, that when tested alone was less toxic than dispersant-oil mixtures, and that dispersant-oil mixtures were generally no more toxic than oil alone. Several remedial activities were conducted by the State of Louisiana in an attempt to mitigate the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The State opened gates along the levees of the Mississippi River to allow river water to flow into coastal marches, with the {{objective of}} forming a hydrodynamic barrier to the shoreward movement of oil. Low salinity of the river water has the potential to harm postlarval and juvenile brown shrimp, which are less tolerant of low salinity than white shrimp. However, the basic seasonal pattern of salinity in potentially impacted waters of Louisiana during most years before and after the oil spill cannot be distinguished from the pattern during the year of the spill. The State also proposed construction of up to 163 km of sandy berms offshore of its barrier islands to block inshore movement of oil. However, it ultimately constructed only 26 km of berms because, in part, of environmental concerns expressed by the scientific community. An evaluation of commercial shrimp landings (catches) in the northern Gulf of Mexico was performed as part of this Capstone. Total landings (all states combined) of brown shrimp tended to decrease during the years of 1990 – 2012, as reflected by a statistically significant coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 1912; whereas total catches of white shrimp increased over these years, with a highly significant R 2 of 0. 5369. Total landings of brown shrimp during 2010 (the year of the oil spill) were 73 million pounds, which was the lowest annual amount reported during the 1990 – 2012 time period. This catch was also uncharacteristically low in comparison to the lower limit of the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of 114. 1 to 133. 5 million pounds for the mean annual catch before the oil spill (1990 – 2009) of 123. 8 million pounds. For white shrimp, total landings in 2010 were 92 million pounds, which were not characteristically low {{in the context of the}} lower limit of the 95 % CI of 76. 8 to 96. 4 million pounds for the mean annual catch before the oil spill of 86. 6 million pounds. In addition, the decrease in total catch of white shrimp in 2010 (- 21. 1 %) was similar to the decrease that occurred in a previous year (- 24. 3 % in 2007). Commercial harvests of brown and white shrimp were also evaluated on a state-specific basis for the years just prior to and after the oil spill (2006 – 2012). This evaluation identified Texas as the state characterized by the least decrease in annual landings of brown shrimp from 2009 to 2010. In the case of white shrimp, although Louisiana and bordering states to the east (Mississippi and Alabama) experienced a decreased annual harvest from 2009 to 2010, Texas and Florida exhibited an increase in catch. The material reviewed and developed in this Capstone leads to several conclusions regarding the effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on penaeid shrimp. First, it is probable that eggs and larvae were the most vulnerable life stages of shrimp since these life stages inhabit offshore waters, which experienced the most continuous and widespread amounts of oil and its components. Other life stages of shrimp (late postlarvae, juveniles, subadults, and adults) typically inhabit the substrate of estuarine or marine waters, in which exposure to these materials would likely be intermittent. Second, it appears that any hazard to early life stages of penaeid shrimp was primarily caused by toxicity of oil and its components, as contrasted to detergents (primarily Corexit 9500 A). The effects of remedial responses to the oil spill by the State of Louisiana – release of fresh water from inland sources and construction of coastal barriers – are judged to be de minimis. Finally, evaluation of commercial landings of penaeid shrimp in the northern Gulf of Mexico has the potential to further explore possible effects of the oil spill on shrimp, when interpreted in the context of various simplifying assumptions. This evaluation suggests that brown shrimp were more affected by the oil spill than white shrimp, and that this effect was more pronounced in Louisiana (and nearby states of Mississippi and Alabama) than Texas. Total recovery of the brown shrimp fishery was evident in 2011...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This work {{presents}} the extreme-pressure behavior of 600 N base <b>oil</b> <b>dispersed</b> with MoS 2 Nano particles with 1 volume percent of polyisobutylenesuccinamide as dispersant. MoS 2 Nano particles were dispersed in 0. 05, 1. 0 wt. % and tested for Extreme pressure behavior on a 4 ball wear tester using the test method ASTM D 2783. The weld load and load wear index of base <b>oil</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>dispersed</b> with Nano particles are evaluated and compared for improvement. Prior to dispersion, the MoS 2 Nano particles are suitably surface modified {{to make them}} uniformly <b>disperse</b> in <b>oils.</b> The seizure load, weld load and load wear index of Nano particles <b>dispersed</b> <b>oils</b> have improved remarkably compared to Base oil. Metallographic studies done on the wear balls show that Nano particles get deposited on the worn area preventing the welding of the surfaces and hence higher weld load. The wear scar of bottom there balls are also found to be less for Nano <b>dispersed</b> <b>oils</b> compared to base oil and hence lower load-wear index...|$|R
40|$|In 1984, {{experimental}} <b>oil</b> and <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> spill {{sites were}} established along the Caribbean coast of Panama, in the Province of Bocas del Toro. Baseline biological, chemical, and physical parameters were collected prior to dosing. Over the following 2. 6 years, sites were monitored regularly and results {{presented in a}} comprehensive report (Ballou et at., 1987). Ten year follow-up surveys were conducted in 1994 (Dodge et al., 1995). Ten years after dosing, sediment core analysis confirmed the presence of degraded hydrocarbons at both the crude <b>oil</b> and <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> treatment sites. At the whole oil treatment, intertidal regions experienced further mortality in mangroves, while subtidal regions experienced few effects. At the <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> treatment, subtidal corals, significantly impacted following initial treatment, appeared to have recovered. The present study is based on site visits during 2001 - 022 ̆ 7, to the original crude <b>oil,</b> <b>dispersed</b> crude <b>oil,</b> and reference sites established in 1984. Despite the degradation of oil over the past 18 years, sheen is still visible leeching from non-dispersed, crude oil treatment sediments. Previously denuded intertidal mangrove regions currently carry a high sapling density, although recent offsite mangrove mortality may be indicative of continued toxicity and mobility of degraded hydrocarbons. Seagrass growth rates, highly variable at all sites over the duration of monitoring, {{appear to have been}} little influence by long-term treatment associated effects, while leaf area parameters at the crude oil treatment have significantly increased relative to the reference site. Sea grasses at the crude <b>oil</b> treatment and <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> treatment both exhibit significantly reduced density relative to the reference site. Within coral zone parameters, current data reveal increased coverage of finger coral (Porites furcata) at the crude oil treatment. Since treatment, percent coverage of P. furcata has grown from 25. 0...|$|R

40|$|Separation of oil-in-water {{emulsions}} using fiber bed coalescer was {{studied by}} response surface methodology. The bed was formed {{of polyethylene terephthalate}} fibers. The aim {{was to investigate the}} possibility of using response surface regression for the analysis and prediction of both the effluent oil concentration and critical velocity in broad ranges of flow rates, bed permeabilities, and nature of <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> phase. The developed response surface equations for a constant bed permeability are a responsive statistical method with the calculated multiple R higher than 90 %. It was found that <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> density, viscosity, neutralization number, and bed permeability influence significantly the oil removal efficiency of fiber bed coalescers. The region of highest critical velocity has been observed for a high viscosity and a high fiber bed permeability. The developed response surface models can be used to ensure high separation efficiency and improve coalescer performance when unexpected simultaneous changes in the bed permeability, hydrodynamic forces and <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> properties take place.

40|$|International audienceDispersing an {{oil slick}} is {{considered}} to be an effective response to offshore oil spills. However, in nearshore areas, dispersant application is a controversial countermeasure: environmental benefits are counteracted by the toxicity of dispersant use. In our study, the actual toxicity of the dispersant response technique in the nearshore area was evaluated through an experimental approach using juvenile Liza ramada. Fish were contaminated via the water column (i) by chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil,</b> simulating dispersant application, (ii) by dispersant, as an internal control of chemical dispersion, (iii) by mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil,</b> simulating only the effect of natural mixing processes, without dispersant application, and (iv) by the water soluble fraction of oil, simulating the toxicity of an oil slick before recovery. Bioconcentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and mortality were evaluated, and related to both total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in seawater. Fish exposed to chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> showed both a higher bioconcentration of PAH and a higher mortality than fish exposed to either the water soluble fraction of oil or the mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil.</b> These results suggest that (i) dispersion is a more toxic response technique than containment and recovery of the oil slick; (ii) in turbulent mixing areas, dispersant application increases the environmental risk for aquatic organisms living in the water column. Even if the experimental aspects of this study compel us to be cautious with our conclusions, responders could consider these results to establish a framework for dispersant use in nearshore areas...|$|R

In order to assess the toxicity of this technique, this study evaluated the cardiac toxicological effects on juvenile golden grey mullets Liza aurata exposed for 48 h to either dispersant alone, chemically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil,</b> mechanically <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil,</b> the water soluble fraction of oil or to a control condition. Following exposure, the positive inotropic effects of adrenaline were assessed in order to evaluate a potential impairment on the cardiac performance. The results revealed an impairment of the positive inotropic effects of adrenaline for all the contaminants (single dispersant, <b>dispersed</b> and undispersed <b>oil,</b> water soluble fraction of oil). This suggests that: (i) cardiac performance is a valuable parameter to study the physiopathological effects of dispersed oil; (ii) dispersant application is likely to impair cardiac performance...|$|R

50|$|An oil {{dispersant}} is {{a mixture}} of emulsifiers and solvents that helps break oil into small droplets following an oil spill. Small droplets are easier to disperse throughout a water volume, and small droplets may be more readily biodegraded by microbes. Dispersant use involves a trade-off between exposing coastal life to surface oil and exposing aquatic life to <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil.</b> While submerging the oil with dispersant may lessen exposure to marine life on the surface, it increases exposure for animals dwelling underwater, who may be harmed by toxicity of both <b>dispersed</b> <b>oil</b> and dispersant. Although dispersant reduces the amount of oil that lands ashore, it may allow faster, deeper penetration of oil into coastal terrain, where it is not easily biodegraded.|$|R
