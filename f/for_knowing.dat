Crow arrives and Anderton prepares to kill him, accusing him of being a serial child killer. Agatha talks Anderton out of shooting Crow by telling him {{that he has the}} ability to choose his future now that he is aware of it. Crow however begs to be killed, having been hired to plant the photos and be killed in exchange for his family's financial well being. Crow grabs Anderton's gun and pushes the trigger, killing himself. Anderton and Agatha flee to Lara's house outside the city for refuge. There they learn Lively was Agatha's drug-addicted mother who sold her to PreCrime. Lively had sobered up and attempted to reclaim Agatha, but was murdered. Anderton realizes he is being targeted <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> about Lively's existence and her connection to Agatha.|$|E
25|$|One common {{interpretation}} {{is that the}} possibility exists that one might misremember the sensation, and therefore {{one does not have}} any firm criterion for using S in each case. So, for example, I might one day focus on that sensation, and link it to the symbol S; but the next day, I have no criteria <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> that the sensation I have now {{is the same as the}} one yesterday, except for my memory; and since my memory might fail me, I have no firm criteria <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> that the sensation I have now is indeed S.|$|E

25|$|Because Jung's {{viewpoint}} {{was essentially}} subjectivist, he displayed a somewhat Neo-Kantian {{perspective of a}} skepticism <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> things in themselves and a preference of inner experience over empirical data. This skepticism opened Jung up {{to the charge of}} countering materialism with another kind of reductionism, one that reduces everything to subjective psychological explanation and wooly quasi-mystical assertions.|$|E

25|$|The {{analysis}} of errors computed using the Global Positioning System {{is important for}} understanding how GPS works, and <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> what magnitude of errors should be expected. The Global Positioning System makes corrections for receiver clock errors and other effects {{but there are still}} residual errors which are not corrected. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was created by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) in the 1970s. It has come to be widely used for navigation both by the U.S. military and the general public.|$|E

During his time in Sacramento, Brown estimates he raised close to US$75 million to help elect and reelect state Democrats.|$|E

Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role. Serafin thereafter served as Callas's mentor and supporter.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the newer}} {{application}} areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer vision based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations. Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, i.e. <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> where it is, or for producing a map of its environment (SLAM) and for detecting obstacles. It {{can also be used}} for detecting certain task specific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires. Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft. Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars, but this technology has still not reached a level where it can be put on the market. There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles, to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance. Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Mars Exploration Rover and ESA's ExoMars Rover.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor, who was actively involved in most elements of his government, Getty preferred to set the government's broad direction and leave lower-level details to his ministers. [...] Ralph Klein, while serving as Environment Minister under Getty, commented that [...] "If you are a minister, you run that portfolio yourself" [...] and expressed {{an appreciation for the}} freedom that the Premier gave his cabinet. [...] Al Adair, who served in two different portfolios under Getty, described this approach in his memoirs as [...] "you make the decisions, you run your department, but make mistakes and you're gone". [...] Lisac credits him <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> when to intervene and when not to, but Adair felt that his approach led to ministers working too much in isolation.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of shortening the adaptation, approximately one-third of the story was eventually edited out; entire subplots and characters were removed. Before becoming a screenwriter Hetreed worked as an editor, and credits this experience <b>for</b> <b>knowing</b> [...] "... about structure and {{what you need to}} say and what you can leave out. I am a big enthusiast for leaving things out." [...] She focused the story on the relationship between Griet and Vermeer, deciding what other storylines were [...] "... distracting and had to be jettisoned. Before editing, there was great stuff there, but Peter was fantastically ruthless." [...] Changes from the novel did not bother Chevalier, who felt that as a result the film gained [...] "... a focused, driven plot and a sumptuous visual feast." ...|$|E

I {{have to give him}} the marching orders and so forth." [...] Webb said, [...] "You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [...] He has that sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-à-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents." [...] Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.|$|E
