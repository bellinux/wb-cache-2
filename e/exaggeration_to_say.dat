And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no <b>exaggeration</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E

Screening cultural films was made compulsory by the Film Law (1939), the first cultural law in Japan, and these films were put on the screen for only 10 minutes. Through cultural media policies, the government intended to use films as entertainment media to easily and unpainfully raise public cultural awareness. In other words, films were expected {{to take the place of}} print media. It is no <b>exaggeration,</b> therefore, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the government's intention was to initiate an educational revolution from print media to visual media. However, the effect was contrary to their intention. Cultural films produced then were boring, perhaps an inevitability considering their short length of only 10 minutes As a result, audience response was cold. Having willingly gone to the theater for fun, the audience was turned off by the boring films and would vacate the theater when their screening began.

25|$|After {{the peace}} {{concluded}} with China, the Burmese king sent another {{small army of}} 5,000 to attack Siam in 1774. But it was completely surrounded by the Thais at Bangkeo in Ratchaburi, and eventually starvation compelled the Burmese to capitulate to King Taksin. It would be no <b>exaggeration</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that he could have}} massacred all of them if he wished to do so, but the fact that he took them alive was to promote the morale of the Thai people. The Burmese reinforcements who had encamped themselves in the province of Kanchanaburi were then mopped up. Undaunted by this defeat, King Hsinbyushin tried again to conquer Siam, and in October 1775 the greatest Burmese invasion in the Thonburi period began under Maha Thiha Thura, known in Thai history as Azaewunky. He had distinguished himself as a first rate general in the wars with China and in the suppression of a recent Peguan rising.|$|E
25|$|During the Franco years, marriages {{had to be}} {{canonical}} (that is, performed under Roman Catholic law and regulations) if {{even one}} of the partners was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy. These restrictions were probably one of the major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict. In the summer of 1981, the Congress of Deputies (lower chamber of the Cortes Generales, or Spanish Parliament) finally approved a divorce law with the votes of about thirty Union of the Democratic Center (Union de Centro Democratico or UCD) deputies who defied the instructions of party conservatives. As a consequence, Spain had a divorce law that permitted the termination of a marriage in as little as two years following the legal separation of the partners. Still, it would be an <b>exaggeration</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the new divorce law opened a floodgate for the termination of marriages. Between the time the law went into effect at the beginning of September 1981, and the end of 1984, only slightly more than 69,000 couples had availed themselves of the option of ending their marriages, and the number declined in both 1983 and 1984. There were already more divorced people than this in Spain in 1981 before the law took effect.|$|E

40|$|That today’s presidential {{campaign}} {{is essentially a}} mass media campaign is attested to by the attention campaign planners give {{to the press and}} the disproportionately huge sums of money political parties and candidates expend on the media (Arganoff, 1976). In Nigeria, for instance, long before the 1983 campaign proper, the major political parties felt they had to establish new newspapers, and/or build new radio and television stations. The existing media institutions were grossly tampered with, their programs resched-uled, and their personnel redeployed to the advantage of the ruling parties. This is not a uniquely Nigerian phenomenon; the drive among American politicians to get the editorial endorsements of major and local newspapers is a similar manifestation of the largely untested belief {{in the power of the}} media in election campaigns (Erickson, 1966; McCombs, 1967). It is naive to assume that the media determine what happens in the campaign, much less determine the outcome of the election (Schramm, 1973).

500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that plant {{growth and development}} is coordinated by plant hormones or plant growth regulators first emerged in the late 19th century.

About the same time, the role of auxins (from the Greek auxein, to grow) in control of plant growth was first outlined by the Dutch scientist Frits Went. The first known auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which promotes cell growth, was only isolated from plants about 50 years later. This compound mediates the tropic responses of shoots and roots towards light and gravity. The finding in 1939 that plant callus could be maintained in culture containing IAA, followed by the observation in 1947 that it could be induced to form roots and shoots by controlling the concentration of growth hormones were key steps in the development of plant biotechnology and genetic modification.|$|E
