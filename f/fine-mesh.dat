These shops are often established within walking distance. The {{reason for this}} <b>fine-meshed</b> shopping structure is the restrictive governmental policy concerning retail trade at the periphery: only a few branches were allowed to be established at the urban fringe or at other peripheral locations.

This research analyses possible future developments concerning more retail trade at the periphery and possible impacts on {{the quality of life in}} cities. Interviewing policy makers, stakeholders of the retail trade and stakeholders of consumers the following topics were examined: a. What do the respondents think about the new governmental policy? b.

Sars to investigate fisheries around the Norwegian coast. Sars found fish eggs, particularly cod eggs, drifting in the water. This established that fish eggs could be pelagic, living in the open water column like other plankton. Around {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, research interest in ichthyoplankton became more general when it emerged that, if ichthyoplankton was sampled quantitatively, then the samples could indicate the relative size or abundance of spawning fish stocks.|$|E

25|$|The webs of most Nephila spiders are complex, with a <b>fine-meshed</b> orb {{suspended}} in {{a maze of}} non-sticky barrier webs. As with many weavers of sticky spirals, the orb is renewed regularly if not daily, apparently because the stickiness of the orb declines with age.

The spider will remove and consume the portion to be replaced, build new radial elements, then spin the new spirals. This partial orb renewal is distinct from other orb-weaving spiders that usually replace the entire orb web.

40|$|For fatigue assessment, {{recently}} effective {{notch stress}} (ENS) approach is  {{accepted as a}} valid alternative to fracture mechanics approaches in Japan. However, at least one study showed that the fatigue assessment at weld root of load-carrying cruciform welded joints based on ENS approach does not capture the influence of plate thickness, weld size and weld penetration. Consequently, there are still uncertainties about the fatigue assessment. This paper discusses the evaluation method of the joints based on ENS approach. Effects of weld size, weld penetration, and plate thickness on ENS are determined by using <b>fine-meshed</b> FEM analyses. Validity of this method is determined by comparing the evaluation results with fracture mechanics approach.

The nylon bag caused a negative effect on the catch rate, while the clip showed no effect. Adding different types of binders to the bait showed that the binder affects the catchability. Redusing the bait loss from the bags without binding the stimulants too hard proved to be an important property of the binder. Compared with natural bait, nylon bags containing minced herring gave higher catch rates for torsk, ling and haddock, but lower catch rate for cod...|$|R
