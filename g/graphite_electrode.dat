25|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} {{carry the}} electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, {{which are the}} vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch.

They can vary in size up to 11feet long and 30 inches in diameter. An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is getting more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode.

40|$|The electrocatalytic {{properties}} of multi-walled carbon nanotube modified electrodes toward the oxidation of NADH are critically evaluated. Carbon nanotube modified electrodes are examined and compared with boron-doped diamond and glassy carbon electrodes, and most importantly, edge plane and basal pyrolytic <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes.</b> It is found that CNT modified electrodes {{are no more}} reactive than edge plane pyrolytic <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> with the comparison with edge plane and basal plane pyrolytic <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> allowing the electroactive sites for the electrochemical oxidation of NADH to be unambiguously determined as due to edge plane sites.

It is demonstrated that a detection limit of 5 microM is possible with cyclic voltammetry or 0. 3 microM using amperometry suggesting that edge plane pyrolytic <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> can conveniently replace carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes for biosensing applications with the relative advantages of reactivity, cost and simplicity of preparation.

50|$|Carbon {{arc welding}} (CAW) {{is a process}} which {{produces}} coalescence of metals by heating them with an arc between a non-consumable carbon (<b>graphite)</b> <b>electrode</b> and the work-piece. It was the first arc-welding process developed but is not used for many applications today, having been replaced by twin-carbon-arc welding and other variations. The purpose of arc welding is to form a bond between separate metals. In carbon-arc welding a carbon electrode is used to produce an electric arc between the electrode and the materials being bonded. This arc produces temperatures in excess of 3,000 °C. At this temperature the separate metals form a bond and become welded together.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{studying}} {{the effect of}} powder mixing electrical discharge machining (PMEDM) parameters using copper and <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> on the white layer thickness (WLT), the total heat flux generated and the fatigue life. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to plan and design the experimental work matrices for two groups of experiments: for the first EDM group, kerosene dielectric was used alone, whereas the second was treated by adding the SiC micro powders mixing to dielectric fluid (PMEDM). The total heat flux generated and fatigue lives after EDM and PMEDM models were developed by FEM using ANSYS 15. 0 software. The <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> gave a total heat flux higher than copper electrodes by 82. 4 %, while using the SiC powder and <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> gave a higher total heat flux than copper electrodes by 91. 5 %.

50|$|Titanium diboride is {{a popular}} {{material}} for handling molten aluminum due to its electrical conductivity, refractory properties, {{and its ability to}} wet with molten aluminum providing a superior electrical interface while not contaminating the aluminum with boron or titanium. TiB2 {{has been used as a}} drained cathode in the electroreduction of molten Al(III). In drained-cathode processes, aluminum can be produced with an electrode gap of only 0.25m with an accompanying reduction in required voltage. However, implementation of such technology still faces hurdles: with a reduction in voltage, there is a concomitant reduction in heat generation and better insulation at the top of the reactor is required. In addition to improved insulation, the technology requires better bonding methods between TiB2 and the bulk <b>graphite</b> <b>electrode</b> substrate. Bonding tiles of TiB2 or applying composite coatings each present their own unique challenges, with the high cost and large TiB2 capital cost of the former and the design difficulty of the latter. Composite materials must have each component degrade at the same rate, or the wettability and thermal conductivity of the surface will be lost with active material still remaining deeper within the electrode plate.|$|E

Ions and compounds of some of these components could be toxic. For example Cr(VI), found in chromate and dichromate ions, is highly toxic to cells (Garbisu et al. 1998). To determine the effects of metal ions generated during treatment, biofilms were also grown on <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> rather than stainless steel (Figure 6).

40|$|The {{possibility}} that electrodes {{might serve as}} an electron acceptor to simulate the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in anaerobic contaminated sediments was investigated. Initial studies with Geobacter metallireducens demonstrated that although toluene was rapidly adsorbed onto the <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> it was rapidly oxidized to carbon dioxide with the electrode serving as the sole electron acceptor. Providing <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> as an electron acceptor in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments significantly stimulated the removal of added toluene and benzene.

Introducing an electrode as an electron acceptor also accelerated the loss of added naphthalene and [(14) C]-naphthalene was converted to [(14) C]-CO(2). The results suggest that <b>graphite</b> <b>electrodes</b> can serve as an electron acceptor for the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbon contaminants in sediments, co-localizing the contaminants, the degradative organisms and the electron acceptor.
