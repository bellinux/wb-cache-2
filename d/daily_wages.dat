The <b>daily</b> <b>wages</b> of the agricultural labourers [...] is more than the rates fixed by the Tamil Nadu government, but due to the decline in number of days of work, the income levels are lower.

Due to the discontinuity in the working days, the labourers migrate to other states like Gujarat and Kerala. They also shift to other professions like construction industry in the urban centres and textile industry in the district. There are no industrial estates in the town and the district– as of 2012, a government proposal is formulated to develop one at Vaippur village. Modern agricultural tools like hullers have replaced labourers and reduce the profit margin of small trders and labourers. There are no co-operative societies who acquire the farm products and the District Purchasing Centre, operated by the government of Tamil Nadu is the major procurer.|$|E

60|$|This ethnographical outline Riehl {{fills up}} with special and typical descriptions, and then {{makes it the}} starting-point for a {{criticism}} of the actual political condition of Germany. The volume is fall of vivid pictures, as well as penetrating glances into the maladies and tendencies of modern society. It would be fascinating as literature {{if it were not}} important for its facts and philosophy. But we can only commend it to our readers, and pass on to the volume entitled “Die Bürgerliche Gesellschaft,” from which we have drawn our sketch of the German peasantry. Here Riehl gives us a series of studies in that natural history of the people which he regards as the proper basis of social policy. He holds that, in European society, there are three natural ranks or estates: the hereditary landed aristocracy, the citizens or commercial class, and the peasantry or agricultural class. By natural ranks he means ranks which have their roots deep in the historical structure of society, and are still, in the present, showing vitality above ground; he means those great social groups which are not only distinguished externally by their vocation, but essentially by their mental character, their habits, their mode of life—by the principle they represent in the historical development of society. In his conception of the “Fourth Estate” he differs from the usual interpretation, according to which it is simply equivalent to the Proletariat, or those who are dependent on <b>daily</b> <b>wages,</b> whose only capital is their skill or bodily strength—factory operatives, artisans, agricultural laborers, to whom might be added, especially in Germany, the day-laborers with the quill, the literary proletariat. This, Riehl observes, is a valid basis of economical classification, but not of social classification. In his view, the Fourth Estate is a stratum produced by the perpetual abrasion of the other great social groups; it is the sign and result of the decomposition which is commencing in the organic constitution of society. Its elements are derived alike from the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, and the peasantry. It assembles under its banner the deserters of historical society, and forms them into a terrible army, which is only just awaking to the consciousness of its corporate power. The tendency of this Fourth Estate, by the very process of its formation, is {{to do away with the}} distinctive historical character of the other estates, and to resolve their peculiar rank and vocation into a uniform social relation founded on an abstract conception of society. According to Riehl’s classification, the day-laborers, whom the political economist designates as the Fourth Estate, belong partly to the peasantry or agricultural class, and partly to the citizens or commercial class.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is another}} point {{concerning}} {{which it is}} very necessary to have clear ideas. Suppose a carpenter in Lanzerote {{to be engaged in}} making chests of drawers. Let us suppose that a, the timber, and b, the grain and meat needful for the man's sustenance until he can finish a chest of drawers, have to be paid for by that chest. Then the capital with which he starts is represented by a + b. He could not start at all unless he had it; day by day, he must destroy more or less of the substance and of the general adaptability of a in order to work it up into the special forms needed to constitute the chest of drawers; and, day by day, he must use up at least so much of b as will replace his loss of vital capital by the work of that day. Suppose it takes the carpenter and his workmen ten days to saw up the timber, to plane the boards, and to give them the shape and size proper for the various parts of the chest of drawers. And suppose that he then offers his heap of boards to the advancer of a + b as an equivalent for the wood + ten days' supply of vital capital? The latter will surely say: [...] "No. [167] I did not ask for a heap of boards. I asked for a chest of drawers. Up to this time, so far as I am concerned, you have done nothing and are as much in my debt as ever." [...] And if the carpenter maintained that he had [...] "virtually" [...] created two-thirds of a chest of drawers, inasmuch as it would take only five days more to put together the pieces of wood, and that the heap of boards ought to be accepted as the equivalent of two-thirds of his debt, I am afraid the creditor would regard him as little better than an impudent swindler. It obviously makes no sort of difference whether the Canariote or Teneriffian buyer advanced the wood and the food-stuffs, on which the carpenter had to maintain himself; or whether the carpenter had a stock of both, the consumption of which must be recouped by the exchange of a chest of drawers for a fresh supply. In the latter case, it is even less doubtful that, if the carpenter offered his boards to the man who wanted a chest of drawers, the latter would laugh in his face. And if he took the chest of drawers for himself, then so much of his vital capital would be sunk in it past recovery. Again, the payment of goods in a lump, for the chest of drawers, comes to the same thing as the payment of <b>daily</b> <b>wages</b> for the fifteen days that the carpenter was occupied in making it. If, {{at the end of each}} day, the carpenter chose to say to himself [...] "I have 'virtually' created, by my day's labour, a fifteenth of what I shall get for the chest [168] of drawers--therefore my wages are the produce of my day's labour"--there is no great harm in such metaphorical speech, so long as the poor man does not delude himself into the supposition that it represents the exact truth. [...] "Virtually" [...] is apt to cover more intellectual sins than [...] "charity" [...] does moral delicts. After what has been said, it surely must be plain enough that each day's work has involved the consumption of the carpenter's vital capital, and the fashioning of his timber, at the expense of more or less consumption of those forms of capital. Whether the a + b to be exchanged for the chest has been advanced as a loan, or is paid daily or weekly as wages, or, at some later time, as the price of a finished commodity--the essential element of the transaction, and the only essential element, is, that it must, at least, effect the replacement of the vital capital consumed. Neither boards nor chest of drawers are eatable; and, so far from the carpenter having produced the essential part of his wages by each day's labour, he has merely wasted that labour, unless somebody who happens to want a chest of drawers offers to exchange vital capital, or something that can procure it, equivalent to the amount consumed during the process of manufacture.* ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} trace {{the way in which}} various methods were used in the payment of wages in Yawata Steel Works from 1900 s to 1930 s. The widely held idea behind the wage payment in the post WW‡U Japanese society has {{required}} companies to pay wages which not only guarantee the amount of money sufficient to lead a family life according to his/her social status but also reflect the ability and performance of each employee. The predecessors of this idea will be found in the personnel practices of companies before the WW‡U. The development of wage system in Yawata Steel Works, along with those implemented in the National Railways and ship-building works, will represent the case which will show how a wage policy which gave employees both the guarantee of standard life style and the incentives for higher efficiency was developed at an enterprise level. By the rule of the Steel Works, all the workers were supposed to receive wages calculated on a fixed <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate which varied among workers corresponding to his experience and skill. This wage system resembled the time wages dominant in U. S. A in that wages were paid for the days workers were engaged in operations, but differed from the American system in that no hourly wage rate was fixed. A day rate fixed for each worker was reviewed occasionally, and in some times managers granted an increase in the rate. The <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate was quite effectual in giving workers the stability of daily life but rather weak in making them work harder. The weakness of the <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate system in giving work incentives became apparent soon after the Works started the system in 1900. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904 - 1905 created an opportunity for the Works to expand its production. To meet the growing demand, the managers of some rolling mills felt it necessary to use incentive plans to increase production. Under the condition where the maintenance of <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate was mandatory, they had recourse to a method which combined the <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate with premium bonus. Ten years later, another war necessitated the adoption of various kinds of incentives and benefits along with the <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate. After years of implementing incentive plans in various mills, incentive wage system gradually became {{an integral part of the}} wage system of the Works. Some times a group piece rate system with the minimum guarantee of the <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate was implemented, and in other cases the combination of the <b>daily</b> <b>wage</b> rate system and group incentive systems was preferred. In this way, the need to guarantee the standard life and the call for incentives were met in the payment of wages. ...|$|R
