[...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Detroit Lions 20–0 in Week 11 to improve to 10–0, {{and set a}} franchise record for wins to start to a season. Simms threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mark Ingram {{in the second quarter}} to run the score to 17–0. After the Giants kicked a field goal to make the score 20–0, the teams played a scoreless second half. The shutout was the Giants' first of the season, and coach Parcells commented, [...] "he defense played very well. The offense played well when <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>them.</b> We played conservatively in the second half. We played pretty much error-free. We didn't do anything stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|Maginnis {{describes}} {{the opening of}} the song as [...] "a burst of howling guitar feedback and jubilant, church-like organ", adding: [...] "The atmosphere hints at Harrison's fascination with Indian music and Hindu philosophy at the time, having a distinct, Eastern-flavored, droning undercurrent." [...] Following the intro to [...] "I Feel Fine" [...] in 1964, [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] is a rare example of the Beatles' use of feedback on a recording and suggests the influence of Jimi Hendrix. Womack credits this guitar part to Harrison, who played his Epiphone Casino using [...] "the instrument's Bigsby [...] bar in searing, full vibrato force". Harrison later rued the prominence of the brass accompaniment, saying: [...] "To this day I am still annoyed that <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> mess it up with those damn trumpets. Basically, the song's quite good but, you know, messed up with those trumpets." ...|$|E

And as for Mr. Smiler,--I never didn't care for him; that I didn't. He ain't the man to touch my heart,--not at all; and it was not likely either. A plain fellow,--very, Mr. Gager." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1975, President Hafez al-Assad {{explained}} why {{he refused to}} allow Jewish emigration: [...] "I cannot let them go, because if <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> go how can I stop the Soviet Union sending its Jews to Israel, where they will strengthen my enemy?" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} Moshe Zupnik why he risked {{his career to}} save other people, he said simply : [...] "I do it just because I have pity on the people. They {{want to get out}} so <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> have the visas." ...|$|E

I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings.

Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, but they think I punished him too hard. As I always say, when people cross my line and <b>I</b> <b>let</b> <b>them</b> know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E
