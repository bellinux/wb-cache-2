5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|NATO had decided, {{under the}} impetus of the Reagan administration, to deploy Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6–10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> it would be carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support {{at home and abroad}} to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home from}} Belgrade on 6 February, the {{aeroplane}} carrying Edwards {{and his team}} mates crashed on takeoff after a refuelling stop in Munich, Germany. Seven players and 14 other passengers died at the scene, and Edwards {{was taken to the}} Rechts der Isar Hospital with multiple leg fractures, fractured ribs and severely damaged kidneys. The doctors treating him were confident that he stood some chance of recovery, but were <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> he would ever be able to play football again.|$|E

25|$|The {{tax-exempt status}} of the JNF-USA was {{challenged}} in 2011 as violating the public policy of the United States with respect to ethnic and religious discrimination. However, it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> these policies would be applied to activities outside the United States.|$|E

25|$|Citrate {{inhibits}} phosphofructokinase when {{tested in}} vitro by enhancing the inhibitory effect of ATP. However, it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> {{this is a}} meaningful effect in vivo, because citrate in the cytosol is utilized mainly for conversion to acetyl-CoA for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Despite Fowler and Legebokoff {{having been}} {{identified}} as two of the killers in these cases, investigators are <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> they will ever solve all of the murders. They do have persons of interest in several other cases, but not enough evidence to lay charges.|$|E
25|$|Dope has {{finished}} their spring {{tour of the}} United States, the tour, which took place over two months, included 22 dates. Tripp Lee played live on bass with the band (although Brix is still listed, and seems <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> he will return) and a new drummer named Angel Bartolotta, formerly of Pig and The Genitorturers has joined.|$|E
60|$|A general {{outbreak}} of 'Me's' ensued, but mamma laid an embargo on Primrose, who must {{stay at home}} and 'help her,' while Gillian looked wistful and <b>doubtful,</b> knowing <b>that</b> more efficient help than the little one's might be desirable.|$|R
50|$|Apicalia chuni is {{a species}} of sea snail, a marine {{gastropod}} mollusk in the family Eulimidae. This taxon is however currently a species inquirenda, ({{a species of}} <b>doubtful</b> identity <b>that</b> needs further investigation) and so its status may change over time.|$|R

25|$|Brandon Mayfield {{was arrested}} 6 May 2004 on a {{material}} witness charge, {{on the basis}} of a fingerprint found after the 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks. Although Spanish authorities were <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> the identification was correct, he was held for two weeks in federal custody until they conclusively identified the fingerprint as belonging to another man and was released by the FBI authorities.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> Subhas Chandra Bose envisaged the Free India Legion {{would ever}} be an army {{sufficient}} or strong enough to conduct an effective campaign across Persia into India on its own. Instead, the IR 950 {{was to become a}} pathfinder, preceding a larger Indo-German force in a Caucasian campaign into the western frontiers of British India, that would encourage public resentment of the Raj and incite the British Indian Army into revolt.|$|E

25|$|Mel Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of The Christ saw a {{restricted}} release in Malaysia. Officially, {{the movie was}} open to Christians only. Attendance was discouraged since tickets were not carried by the usual box offices. Christian {{groups such as the}} National Evangelical Christian Fellowship arranged block bookings of cinemas and distributed tickets to various churches. An initial run of two-months was extended, making it appear <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> only Christians viewed the film.|$|E
25|$|In the 2001 general election, Alliance {{proposed}} a pro-Good Friday Agreement {{pact with the}} Ulster Unionist Party {{in the hopes of}} getting UUP support in Belfast East. However the UUP did not agree and so both parties stood. Robinson was re-elected with 42.5% of the vote, with the UUP, Alliance and Progressive Unionist Party carving up the pro-Agreement pro-union vote between them, but it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> an unopposed Alliance candidate could have consolidated all of that vote to beat Robinson.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to their leaders who had accepted Christianity, the Havolane population still worshipped old Slavic deities and opposed Albert's assumption of power. Jaxa of Köpenick, a possible relative of Pribislav and a claim-holder to Brandenburg, controlled Brandenburg with Polish help, and ruled {{the land of}} the Stodorans. Older historical research dates this conquest to 1153, although there are no definite sources for the date. More recent researchers (such as Lutz Partenheimer) date it to spring 1157, as it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> Albert would not have responded to Jaxa's actions for four years.|$|E

"After a {{study it}} became {{apparent}} that such an operation could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any case be of such <b>doubtful</b> efficacy <b>that</b> it would not warrant the use of our resources." ...|$|R
40|$|Abraham Lincoln {{yearned to}} leave a {{permanent}} legacy. It is <b>doubtful,</b> however, <b>that</b> Lincoln, even when Confederates surrendered, appreciated just how far he had stirred hearts and minds at home and abroad. Yet his death, just days after Lee laid down his arms at Appomattox, prompted a quite extraordinary explosion of mourning around the world...|$|R
50|$|Burrington {{is famous}} for its fine series of cast iron grave slabs {{situated}} outside the east end of the chancel. This type of memorial is associated with areas of early ironfounding, being particularly found in the Weald of Kent and Sussex, though it is <b>doubtful</b> if <b>that</b> area has a collection to rival Burrington.|$|R
25|$|The {{remaining}} WSC matches {{followed the}} Sydney Test. In the second final against Australia Shastri worsened the knee injury. At the later {{stages of the}} innings {{he was forced to}} stand and slog. After a few quick runs, it ended in an inevitable mishit to cover. He missed the remaining two Test matches, both of which India lost. For a while it seemed <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> {{he would be able to}} play the World Cup which was being hosted by Australia and New Zealand, but was included at the last moment.|$|E
25|$|The church {{interior}} was restored in the 18th century when box pews were replaced with oak pews {{to give a}} seating capacity of 1,000. The church was extensively damaged during World War II; in 1940 the chancel was destroyed by a stray bomb; being re-built after {{the war in the}} early English style and removing the Victorian 'restoration' of the east end. Rectors include Thomas Wolsey (who later became Cardinal) though it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> he ever attended, as he held a number of churches in plurality, employing a curate and keeping the tithes for himself.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} two life-changing events occurred. The first {{was when he}} {{returned}} to settle for a time in Florence in November 1484 and met Lorenzo de' Medici and Marsilio Ficino. It was an astrologically auspicious day that Ficino had chosen to publish his translations of the works of Plato from Greek into Latin, under Lorenzo's enthusiastic patronage. Pico appears to have charmed both men, and despite Ficino's philosophical differences, he was convinced of their Saturnine affinity and the divine providence of his arrival. Lorenzo would support and protect Pico until his death in 1492. Without Lorenzo's support it is <b>doubtful</b> <b>that</b> Pico would have survived the Inquisition coming after him.|$|E
50|$|A Honduran stock {{exchange}} {{was established in}} August 1990 with transactions confined to trading debt. Nine companies were registered with the exchange in 1991; in 1993 this number had grown to eighteen. It appears <b>doubtful,</b> however, <b>that</b> the market will develop fully, given the reluctance of family-held firms to open their books to public scrutiny.|$|R
