40|$|Our {{work offers}} both a {{solution}} to the problem of finding functional dependencies that are distorted by noise and to the open problem of efficiently finding strong (i. e., highly compressive) partial <b>determinations</b> per se. Briefly, we introduce a restricted form of search for partial <b>determinations</b> which is based on functional dependencies. Focusing attention on solely partial <b>determinations</b> derivable from overfitting functional dependencies enables efficient search for strong partial <b>determinations.</b> Furthermore, we generalize the compression-based measure for evaluating partial <b>determinations</b> to n-valued attributes. Applications to real-world data suggest that the restricted search indeed retrieves a subset of strong partial <b>determinations</b> in much shorter runtimes, thus showing the feasibility and usefulness of our approach. 1 Introduction Functional dependencies [Mannila & Raiha, 1994] are a fundamental form of knowledge to be discovered in databases.

5|$|O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation {{to develop}} a {{satellite}} position <b>determination</b> system {{for which he was}} granted a patent in 1982. The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio <b>Determination</b> Satellite Service (RDSS). In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into geosynchronous orbit in 1986. Its transmitter package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites. With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company {{at the same time it}} started to run into trouble. In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to Motorola for the Iridium satellite constellation project. Although the system was eventually replaced by GPS, O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position <b>determination.</b>|$|E

40|$|Courts {{deciding}} constitutional cases {{frequently have}} to make deference determinations—that is, decisions about whether to respect a political branch’s factual findings and policy judgments because of that branch’s institutional superiority. The U. S. Supreme Court’s approach {{to a wide range}} of these <b>determinations,</b> however, is inconsistent and undertheorized. Indeed, the Court’s difficulties with deference <b>determinations</b> mirror broader failures to resolve carefully and consistently a number of “stealth” <b>determinations</b> that recur in constitutional cases—determinations that fall outside the black-letter doctrinal framework but can still greatly impact a case’s outcome. Rather than relying on pithy platitudes about each government branch’s strengths and weaknesses, courts should examine the actual behavior and processes of the relevant governmental institution before deciding whether deference is appropriate. This contextual, institutional approach would provide better incentives for Congress and administrative agencies to craft policy utilizing their expertise and reinforcing their political accountability. It would also offer a more searching, rigorous model for courts approaching other extra-doctrinal <b>determinations,</b> thus improving the legal status of both deference <b>determinations</b> themselves and stealth constitutional <b>determinations</b> more generally...|$|R
