6000|$|But I cannot now {{write the}} history of those days of blundering and toil: of how Milton, one of the boys, fell from a plank to the beach, thirty feet perhaps, with his barrow and broke his arm and I believe a rib, of how I and Pollack set the limb and nursed him through the fever that followed, of how one man after another succumbed to a feverish malaria, and how I--by virtue of my {{scientific}} reputation--was obliged to play the part of doctor and dose them with quinine, and then finding that worse than nothing, with rum and small doses of Easton's Syrup, of which there chanced to be a case of bottles aboard--Heaven and Gordon-Nasmyth know why. For three long days we lay in misery and never shipped a barrow-load. Then, when they resumed, the men's hands broke out into sores. There were no gloves available; and I tried to get them, while they shovelled and wheeled, to cover their hands with stockings or greased rags. They would not do this {{on account of the}} heat and discomfort. This attempt of mine did, however, direct their attention to the quap as the source of their illness and precipitated what in the <b>end</b> <b>finished</b> our lading, an informal strike. [...] "We've had enough of this," [...] they said, and they meant it. They came aft to say as much. They cowed the captain.|$|E

50|$|In the Bezirksoberliga, Unterhaching II {{played for}} three seasons before earning another {{championship}} and being {{promoted to the}} Landesliga Bayern-Süd in 1999.

The second race of the weekend went {{a little bit better}} for Stepanov as he climbed to 4th place at one point, but in the <b>end</b> <b>finished</b> in 8th position. Nonetheless, even these poor results allowed him to collect points for both Driver's and Constructor's classifications and keep him and his B-tuning team in contention for high places. The only positive note of the weekend were the two podium finishes in the Seat Super Copa classification, keeping him en route for the season victory.|$|E

50|$|The 1919-20 season opened {{well with}} good sized crowds being entertained by a winning team. Stoke {{collected}} maximum points in eleven {{of the first}} 15 matches and they only failed to score in one. Bob Whittingham, who {{had been such a}} stalwart during the war, rejoined the club on a permanent transfer from Chelsea {{and at the same time}} (October) David Brown arrived from Dundee to give Stoke's forward line an impressive look. But amazingly and completely out of context, Stoke's fortunes took a dramatic turn as they lost the next five matches. The team did manage to recover and in the <b>end</b> <b>finished</b> in 10th spot. A mid-table position was acceptable since the club had sought, initially, to consolidate its position in the Second Division. But the supporters were disappointed with the end result after such a good start to the season.|$|E
50|$|The {{studio was}} {{completed}} in 1959 {{to the north of}} the house, with an addition on the west <b>end</b> <b>finished</b> in 1969.

Bolsius carved the entry doors for the studio; the main east entry is surrounded by a doorframe featuring empty beer bottles set into the brick.

The Oreca Peugeot, which was supposedly its rival, dropped a full eight laps down the order because the airjacks failed to come off. Audi continue to go flat out and in the <b>end</b> <b>finished</b> ten laps ahead of the Peugeot. Audi had now {{been able to achieve}} both the speed and reliability combination that they considered sufficient to match the Peugeot challenge for Le Mans. A full squad of three cars was entered for the next race which was the 2010 Spa 1000 km, finishing third (#7, behind the two Peugeots - No. 3 took first, No. 2 took second), fifthth (#9) and twelfth (#8) respectively. Audi treated the race as a setup exercise for car configuration at Spa that would then be used for the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans.|$|E
