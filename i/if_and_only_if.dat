5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an {{assignment}} {{of one of}} k colors to each vertex of a graph G such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k <b>if</b> <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable <b>if</b> <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it is K'k-colorable.|$|E

Moreover, this map is equivariant, namely it intertwines the natural actions of the Möbius groupAut(D) on functions and operators. This theory extends to some extent to the context of the open unit ballBninCn, but it fails in Cartan domains of rankr> 1, because in this case the mapb→Hbtrivializes as Hbis compact <b>only</b> <b>if</b> Hb= 0 (andbis constant). We study generalizations Abof Hankel operators in the context of weighted Bergman spaces over a Cartan domain of tube type with rankr> 1. The mapb→Abis equivariant and non-trivial.

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected <b>if</b> <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, <b>if</b> <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>if</b> it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
