60|$|The keepers did not {{ascertain}} {{the means by}} which we had left the barracks, though they had seen the cut pickets of course. We did not attempt, therefore, to cut through again, but resolved to climb. The English had strengthened the pickets with cross-pieces, which were a great assistance to us, and I now desire to <b>express</b> <b>my</b> <b>thanks</b> for the same. We waited for a warm, but dark and rainy night in May, before we commenced our new movement. We had still plenty of money, I having brought back with me to prison forty crowns, and having driven a thriving trade in the interval. We got out through the bars, precisely as we had done before, and at the very same window. This was a small job. After climbing the pickets, either Littlefield or Barnet dropped on the outside, a little too carelessly, and was overheard. The sentinel immediately called for the corporal of the guard, but we were in the water, swimming quite near the bridge, and some little distance from the guard-house on the main. There was a stir on the island, while we were in the water, but we all got ashore, safe and unseen.|$|E

60|$|I may, however, while <b>expressing</b> <b>my</b> <b>thanks</b> to the 'London Editor' {{for drawing}} my {{attention}} to this, I trust, purely American method of procedure, venture to differ from him {{in one of his}} criticisms. He states that he regards the expression 'complete' as applied to a story, as a specimen of the 'adjectival exuberance of the puffer.' Here, it seems to me, he sadly exaggerates. What my story is is an interesting problem. What my story is not is a 'novelette'--a term which you have more than once applied to it. There is no such word in the English language as novelette. It should not be used. It is merely part of the slang of Fleet Street.|$|R
6000|$|The count set {{his little}} {{daughter}} down, {{and coming up}} to Julian threw his arms round his neck and kissed him in Russian fashion. [...] "My benefactor!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I don't understand all that Stephanie has told me, but it is enough that you saved her life, and that you nursed her with the tenderness of a mother, and have restored her to us as one from the grave. Never can I fully <b>express</b> <b>my</b> <b>thanks</b> or prove my gratitude to you, but now you will, I trust, excuse me. I am burning to carry the news of our dear one's return to her mother, whose condition is giving us grave anxiety. She is far too weak to stand any sudden shock, and I will merely tell her now that news has come that a little girl whose description corresponds with that of Stephanie has been found and is on her way here, and may arrive very shortly. More than that I shall not venture upon to-day, unless, indeed, I find that the excitement and suspense {{is likely to be}} even more injurious to her than the state of dull despair in which she now lies. If I see that it is so I must go on, little by little, till she guesses the truth. Now, Stephanie, you had better come up to your own room. Of course, your friend will come with you," [...] he added with a smile as Stephanie took Julian's hand. [...] "But you had better wait three or four minutes so that I may give strict orders to the household that everything is to be kept perfectly quiet, and that not a sound is to be heard in the house. There will be time enough for rejoicings afterwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{compositions}} {{speak for}} themselves, and must stand or fall by their [...] own worth or demerit: thus far I feel highly gratified by your [...] favourable opinion. But my pretensions to virtue are unluckily so few, [...] that though I {{should be happy}} to merit, I cannot accept, your applause [...] in that respect. One passage in your letter struck me forcibly: you [...] mention the two Lords Lyttleton [2] in the manner they respectively [...] deserve, and will be surprised to hear {{the person who is}} now [...] addressing you has been frequently compared to the latter. I know I [...] am injuring myself in your esteem by this avowal, but the circumstance [...] was so remarkable from your observation, that I cannot help relating [...] the fact. The events of my short life have been of so singular a [...] nature, that, though the pride commonly called honour has, and I trust [...] ever will, prevent me from disgracing my name by a mean or cowardly [...] action, I have been already held up as the votary of licentiousness, [...] and the disciple of infidelity. How far justice may have dictated this [...] accusation, I cannot pretend to say; but, like the gentleman to whom [...] my religious friends, in the warmth of their charity, have already [...] devoted me, I am made worse than I really am. However, to quit myself [...] (the worst theme I could pitch upon), and return to my poems, I cannot [...] sufficiently <b>express</b> <b>my</b> <b>thanks,</b> and I hope I shall some day have an [...] opportunity of rendering them in person. A second edition is now in [...] the press, with some additions and considerable omissions; you will [...] allow me to present you with a copy. The 'Critical', [3] 'Monthly', [...] [4] and 'Anti-Jacobin [5] Reviews' have been very indulgent; but the [...] 'Eclectic' [6] has pronounced a furious Philippic, not against the [...] book but the author, where you will find all I have mentioned [...] asserted by a reverend divine who wrote the critique.|$|E
