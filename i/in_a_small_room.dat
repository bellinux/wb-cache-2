5|$|Phillips' Sound Recording Services was {{a studio}} {{in the house of}} Percy Francis Phillips (18961984) and his family at 38 Kensington, Kensington, Liverpool, England. Between the years of 1955 and 1969, Phillips {{recorded}} numerous tapes and acetate discs for Liverpool acts, people and businesses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> behind the shop his family owned.|$|E
5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> {{in his house}} on Old Compton Street. His audience grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E
5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room,</b> out of sight. The second prison official would then load the rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music critic}} for the Morning Chronicle, writing of a {{performance}} by Kirchgessner in 1794, said, [...] "Her taste is chastened and the dulcet notes of the instrument would be delightful indeed, were they more powerful and articulate; but that we believe the most perfect execution cannot make them. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>room</b> and <b>an</b> audience less numerous, the effect must be enchanting. Though the accompaniments were kept very much under, they were still occasionally too loud." ...|$|R
5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E
5|$|With {{the score}} now 2–0 {{in favor of}} Spassky, many {{observers}} believed that the match was over and Fischer would leave Iceland, and, indeed, Fischer looked to board the next plane out of Iceland, only to be dissuaded by his second, William Lombardy. His decision {{to stay in the}} match was attributed by some to another phone call from Kissinger and a deluge of cablegrams to Fischer. Spassky, owing to his sporting spirit and respect and sympathy for Fischer, agreed to play the third game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> backstage, {{out of sight of the}} spectators. According to Pal Benko and Burt Hochberg, this concession was a psychological mistake by Spassky.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was directed by Wataru Takeishi. It opens with Hamasaki watching her previous music videos on several television screens. Sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room,</b> she exits it and finds {{a large amount of}} fans and paparazzi bombarding her; scenes interspersed through the main plot feature her looking towards a mirror. Following the first chorus, Hamasaki is shown riding through Tokyo city, including her appearance at a recording studio singing the song, and on top of a skyscraper at night. The frames subsequently re-appear throughout the visual, with it ending with a blurry shot of Hamasaki looking away from the mirror, and the TV screens from the first shot displaying the logo of Avex Trax. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016). It was additionally used as the theme for Japanese television show Semi Double (1999).|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of construction paper cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E

25|$|Also in mid-2006 a major {{renovation}} of C-Block and the science laboratories {{on its first}} floor was completed. The new building work included two observation classrooms (one a laboratory {{and the other a}} normal classroom), with one way mirrors allowing people <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> in between the two observation classrooms to sit and observe lessons without being seen.|$|E

25|$|Gein {{held on to}} {{the farm}} and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, {{including}} the upstairs, downstairs parlor, and living room, leaving them untouched; {{while the rest of the}} house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived thereafter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading death-cult magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities.|$|E
25|$|Izambard {{childhood}} was hard, {{his parents had}} divorced and his father left {{him when he was}} six.

40|$|We used a {{reference}} memory paradigm {{to examine whether}} 4 - and 5 -year-old children could be trained to use landmark features to relocate targets after disorientation. In Experiment 1, half {{of the children were}} pretrained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> equilateral triangle-shaped <b>room.</b> Each of the three walls was a different color, and the target was always {{in the middle of the}} yellow wall. These children and a control group were tested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rectangular <b>room</b> with three white walls and one yellow wall; the target was placed in one of the corners. Children with pretraining responded more frequently to the correct corner than to the diagonally congruent corner on their first set of four trials in the rectangular room, whereas the children in the control group used geometric cues exclusively. Three additional groups of children (Experiment 2) showed that the use of landmark features—both salient and subtle—can be learned in as few as four practice trials <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rectangular <b>room.</b> The data support the view that both geometry and landmark features are adaptively combined in the same representation...|$|R

25|$|The Ainu {{people had}} {{various types of}} {{marriage}}. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents {{of his or her}} betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> called tunpu annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.|$|E
25|$|Later the {{emphasis}} was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek. From {{the latter part of}} the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there are now more than 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course. In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> attached to the science buildings. It used paper tape to store programs. Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Rangers {{emerged from}} {{the tragedy of the}} {{previous}} year to finally achieve success on the European stage. A Colin Stein goal and a Willie Johnston double helped secure a 3–2 victory over FC Dynamo Moscow at the Nou Camp, Barcelona, to lift the European Cup Winners' Cup. Captain John Greig received the trophy <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>room</b> within the Nou Camp following pitch invasions by Rangers fans reacting to the heavy handed tactics of the Spanish police, the majority of whom had been brought in from outwith Catalonia. The following season Rangers were invited by Barcelona FC to take part in their pre season tournament at the Camp Nou. Rangers were banned from Europe for two years for the behaviour of their fans, later reduced on appeal to one year.|$|E

50|$|Dog whippers {{became less}} common {{from the late}} 18th century onwards, presumably because animals were {{increasingly}} unwelcome at church services.
