Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have occurred early {{in the development of the}} Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as <b>enstatite</b> chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment.

To determine the changes in the spectra the resolution must be increased from 1 to 0. 25 cm^- 1 at both temperatures since a reduction in temperature reduces the phonon density, thereby reducing the width of the infrared peaks.

40|$|Far-infrared {{spectra of}} {{laboratory}} silicates are normally obtained {{at room temperature}} even though the grains responsible for astronomical silicate emission bands seen at wavelengths > 20 μm {{are likely to be}} at temperatures below ∼ 150 K. In order to investigate the effect of temperature on silicate spectra, we have obtained absorption spectra of powdered forsterite and olivine, along with two orthoenstatites and diopside clinopyroxene, at 3. 5 ± 0. 5 K and at room temperature (295 ± 2 K). To determine the changes in the spectra the resolution must be increased from ∼ 1 to 0. 25 cm− 1 at both temperatures, because a reduction in temperature reduces the phonon density, thereby reducing the width of the infrared peaks. Several bands observed at 295 K split at 3. 5 K. At 3. 5 K the widths of isolated single bands in olivine, <b>enstatites</b> and diopside are ∼ 90 per cent of their 295 -K widths. However, in forsterite the 3. 5 -K widths of the 31 -, 49 - and 69 -μm bands are, respectively, 90, 45 and 31 per cent of their 295 -K widths. Owing to an increase in phonon energy as the lattice contracts, 3. 5 -K singlet peaks occur at shorter wavelengths than do the corresponding 295 -K peaks; the magnitude of the wavelength shift increases from ∼ 0 – 0. 2 μm at 25 μm to ∼ 0. 9 μm at 80 μm. In olivines and <b>enstatites</b> the wavelength shifts can be approximated by polynomials of the form ax+bx 2 where x=λpk(295 K) and the coefficients a and b differ between minerals; for diopside this formula gives a lower limit to the shift. Changes in the relative absorbances of spectral peaks are also observed. The temperature dependence of λpk and bandwidth shows promise as a means to deduce characteristic temperatures of mineralogically distinct grain populations. In addition, the observed changes in band strength with temperature will affect estimates of grain masses and relative mineral abundances inferred using room-temperature laboratory data. Spectral measurements of a variety of minerals at a range of temperatures are required to quantify these effects fully...|$|R

Ni and Co extractions with sulphuric acid to the reduced pellets in which include 7. 5 % sulphur are improved 1 30 / 0 in Ni and 70 / 0 in Co as compared with to no addition of sulphur. In case of no addition of sulphur, the reduced nickel elements present as Ni-Fe alloys such as tetrataenite and josephinite. Forsterites are almost recrystallized as forsterite ferroan. On the other hand, <b>enstatites</b> do not contain iron element almost. With increase of addition of sulphur, the peak intensities of tetrataenite and josephinite decrease rapidly and peak intensities of metallic iron increase remarkablely. Peaks of NiS, CoS and FeS appear at 1. 0 %, 2. 5 %, and 1. 0 % respectively. These NiS, CoS and FeS are dissolved easily with heated sulphuric acid. Therefore, it is understood that an additive sulphur of more than 5 % promotes recrystallization of forsterite ferroan and reducibility of goethite. As a result, substitution between Ni(Co) and Fe is promoted {{and the formation of}} NiS and CoS are also increased.

A comprehensive mineral chemistry studies, done mainly by Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), allow proposing a petrogenetic history of these ultramafic xenoliths. The studied xenoliths contain spinel, attesting their generation at depths from 30 to 70 Km, the intermediate zone of the lithospheric upper mantle. The olivine forsterite contents (Fo) are higher in lherzolites than in wehrlite, Fo 88 – 91 and Fo 80 - 83, respectively. Orthopyroxenes are <b>enstatites</b> with high Mg#s (88 – 91). Clinopyroxenes display higher Mg# than olivines and orthopyroxenes, indicating equilibrium between the coexisting phases. Progressive impoverishment Clinopyroxene in lherzolites and generation of rocks with different amounts of clinopyroxene evidence partial melting processes. LREE enrichment in clinopyroxene combined with high Na and Ti contents indicate mantle metasomatic processes. The metasomatism resulted in refertilization of peridotites evidenced by recrystallization of clinopyroxene and LREE enrichment. The wehrlite lithologies may be the end product of the latter process. Given the above scenario, we believe that the mineralogical variations in the upper mantle beneath this part of the Middle Atlas Mountains can be attributed to a combination of two mantle processes: partial melting and metasomatism...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as <b>enstatite,</b> corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{occurrence of}} pyrope garnet in Archean lithospheric mantle {{remains one of}} the ‘holy grails’ of mantle petrology. Most garnets found in peridotitic mantle equilibrated with incompatible-trace-element-enriched melts or fluids and are the products of metasomatism. Less common are macroscopic intergrowths of pyrope garnet formed by exsolution from orthopyroxene. Spectacular examples of these are preserved in both mantle xenoliths and large, isolated crystals (megacrysts) from the Kaapvaal craton of southern Africa, and provide direct evidence that some garnet in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle initially formed by isochemical rather than metasomatic processes. The orthopyroxene hosts are <b>enstatites</b> and fully equilibrated with their exsolved phases (low-Cr pyrope garnet ± Cr-diopside). Significantly, P-T estimates of the post-exsolution orthopyroxenes plot along an unperturbed conductive Kaapvaal craton geotherm and reveal that they were entrained from a large continuous depth interval (85 to 175 km). They therefore represent snapshots of processes operating throughout almost the entire thickness of the sub-cratonic lithospheric mantle. New rare-earth element (REE) analyses show that the exsolved garnets occupy the full spectrum recorded by garnets in mantle peridotites and also diamond inclusions. A key finding is that a few low-temperature exsolved garnets, derived from depths of 90 km, are more depleted in light REEs than previously observed in any other mantle sample. Importantly, the REE patterns of these strongly LREE-depleted garnets resemble the hypothetical composition proposed for pre-metasomatic garnets that are thought to pre-date major enrichment events in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle, including those associated with diamond formation. The recalculated compositions of pre-exsolution orthopyroxenes have higher Al_ 2 O_ 3 and CaO contents than their post-exsolution counterparts and most likely formed as shallow residues of large amounts of adiabatic decompression melting in the spinel-stability field. It is inferred that exsolution of garnet from Kaapvaal orthopyroxenes may have been widespread, and perhaps accompanied cratonization at 2. 9 to 2. 75 Ga. Such a process would considerably increase the density and stability of the continental lithosphere...|$|R
40|$|Some twenty {{kimberlite}} pipes outcrop {{along the}} eastern and western borders of the Kundelungu plateau. Shaba Province, Zaire. They are arranged roughly along two north-south trending alignments. The pipes probably intruded the Bangweulu Block, which stabilized around 1800 Ma. The exceptionally fresh kimberlites contain mantle-derived nodules (peridotites and eclogites), as well as megacrysts which may reach up to several cm in diameter. The most important megacrysts are garnets, ilmenites, clinopyroxenes, orthopyroxenes and olivines. Micas and diamonds are rarely observed. The clinopyroxenes can be subdivided in two groups: (1) a Ca-rich, low-T type, similar to the Cr-rich diopsides found in 'depleted' (granular) peridotites; and (2) subcalcic clinopyroxene comparable to the megacrysts and to the clinopyroxenes of 'fertile' (sheared) peridotites. The orthopyroxenes are less frequent and are Ca-poor <b>enstatites</b> (0. 07 - 0. 42 wt. % CaO) and Ti-bronzites (CaO 4. 5 wt. % CaO) and all fall in the Iherzolite field defined by Sobolev et al., 1973. The low-Ca garnets which appear in many diamond-bearing kimberlites have never been observed in Zaire, neither in the diamond-poor Kundelungu pipes nor in the diamond-rich Mbuji-Mayi pipes. The ilmenites define a trend close to the 'magmatic Mg-enrichment trend'. The olivine macrocrysts have Fo contents {{comparable to those of}} peridotites (Fo 90 - 93). The ultramafic nodules comprise Iherzolites, harzburgites, pyroxenites, wehrlites and dunites. The granular textures and P-T equilibrium conditions (770 - 1380 degrees C and 28 - 61 kbar) deduced from their mineral compositions, show clearly that they were derived from a mantle zone on the continental geotherm (90 - 190 km depth). The eclogite nodules, which are less frequent, contain only two mineral phases (pyrope-almandine-grossular and omphacite), and the texture and the mineral compositions {{are similar to those of}} Roberts Victor eclogites. Our findings support the conclusion of Nixon and Condliffe (1989) that low-T peridotites, eclogites and pyroxenites derived from 'depleted' lithosphere, while Cr-poor garnet, subcalcic diopside and bronzite megacrysts cristallized from fertile asthenosphere. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Information on {{magnetisation}} {{of earth}} s crust comes {{from the study of}} magnetic anomalies measured at various elevations using ground, airborne and satellite data, as well as studies of deep-seated rocks exposed at the surface. In the Western Gneiss Region (WGR), western Norway, two well exposed bodies of garnetiferous peridotites lay on the island Otrøya. The WGR is a 25. 000 km 2 window of Proterozoic Baltica continental crust exposed in the Scandinavian Caledonides, {{and is one of the}} largest exposures of deeply subducted rocks on earth. The two bodies exposed on Otrøya contain evidence of the early stability of Archean tectonometamorphic megacrystic mineral assemblages that include high P/T <b>enstatites</b> and majoritic garnet (presently exsolved into Proterozoic and Scandian tectonometamorphic assemblages) (Van Roermund, 2008). The magnetic properties and anomaly responses of these peridotites and their immediate enclosing bedrocks were investigated by sampling orientated blocks, conducting magnetic measurements in field and at lab, as well as conducting a ground magnetic survey. This provides us with information on the magnetic properties of deeply subducted mantle fragments, and adds to the knowledge of what is magnetic in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle. The study of the two peridotite bodies at Otrøya displays several morphologies of magnetite, mostly displaying as discrete forms within seams and cracks, but also as well-defined rims around chromites. The remanent intensity and susceptibility of the rocks are low, however the remanent intensity is somewhat varying. The directions of remanent magnetisation within measured specimens are both negative and positive with positive directions commonly displaying the same direction as the ambient field as well as commonly carrying weaker intensities than the negative. All of the above could be indicative of several stages of magnetite creation, and/or several events of recording of natural remanent magnetisation. The immediate constricting bedrocks displayed substantially higher remanent and induced intensities. Within the measured specimens both intensities were varying with the remanence displaying the largest variance in addition to showing both positive and negative directions. This was reflected in the anomaly map created from the ground magnetic survey due to anomalies, both high and low, displaying within these bedrocks. However, the peridotites correlate with wide anomaly lows. With 2 D modelling a magnetic profile over the area was investigated with susceptibility and geometry of the bodies as input parameters. It became evident that the susceptibility contrast of the peridotites and the constricting bedrocks, as well as their geometries, could create anomaly lows as displayed in the anomaly map. However, it could not explain the most negative anomaly responses an indication on remanence being of importance...|$|R

Based on the measured temperature of the lava and the spectral measurements, some of the lava may be analogous to terrestrial komatiites. Compressional superheating, which could increase the temperature of magma during ascent to the surface during an eruption, may also be a factor in some of the higher temperature eruptions.|$|E

40|$|The Izu-Bonin forearc {{basement}} volcanic rocks {{recovered from}} Holes 792 E and 793 B {{show the same}} phenocrystic assemblage (i. e., plagioclase, two pyroxenes, and Fe-Ti oxides ±olivine), but they differ in the crystallization sequence and their phenocryst chemistry. All the igneous rocks have suffered low-grade hydrothermal alteration caused by interaction with seawater. As a result, only clinopyroxenes, plagioclases, and oxides have preserved their primary igneous compositions. The Neogene olivine-clinopyroxene diabasic intrusion (Unit II) recovered from Hole 793 B differs from the basement basaltic andesites because it lacks Cr-spinels and contains abundant titanomagnetites (Usp 38. 5 - 46. 4) and uncommon FeO-rich (FeO = 29 %) spinels. It displays petrological and geochemical similarities to the Izu Arc volcanoes and, thus, {{can be considered as}} related to Izu-Bonin Arc magmatic activity. The titanomagnetites (Usp 28. 5 - 33) in the calc-alkaline andesitic fragments of the Oligocene volcaniclastic breccia in Hole 793 B (Unit VI) represent an early crystallization phase. The Plagioclase phenocrysts enclosed in these rocks show oscillatory zoning and are less Ca-rich (An 78. 6 - 67. 8) than the plagioclase phenocrysts of the diabase sill and the basement basaltic andesites. Their clinopyroxenes are Fe-rich augites (Fs ? 19. 4; FeO = 12 %) and thus, differ significantly from the clinopyroxenes of the Hole 793 B arc-tholeiitic igneous rocks. The 30 - 32 Ma porphyritic, two-pyroxene andesites recovered from Hole 792 E are very similar to the andesitic clasts of the Neogene breccia recovered in Hole 793 B (Unit VI). Both rocks have the same crystallization sequence, and similar chemistry of the Fe-Ti oxides, clinopyroxenes, and plagioclases: that is, Ti-rich (Usp 25. 5 - 30. 4) magnetites, Fe-rich augites, and intensely oscillatory zoned plagioclases with bytownitic cores (An 86 - 63) and labradorite rims (An 73 - 68). They display a calc-alkaline differentiation trend (Taylor et al., this volume). So, the basement highly porphyritic andesites recovered at Hole 792 E, and the Hole 793 B andesitic clasts of Unit VI show the same petrological and geochemical characteristics, which are that of calc-alkaline suites. These Oligocene volcanic rocks represent likely the remnants of the Izu-Bonin normal arc magmatic activity, before the forearc rifting and extension. The crystallization sequence in the basaltic andesites recovered from Hole 793 B is olivine-orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene-plagioclase-Fe-Ti oxides, indicating a tholeiitic differentiation trend for these volcanic rocks. Type i is an olivine-and Cr-spinel bearing basaltic andesite whereas Type ii is a porphyritic pyroxene-rich basaltic andesite. The porphyritic plagioclase-rich basaltic andesite (Type iii) is similar, in most respects, to Type ii lavas but contains plagioclase phenocrysts. The last, and least common lava is an aphyric to sparsely phyric andesite (Type iv). Cr-spinels, included either in the olivine pseudomorphs of Type i lavas or in the groundmass of Type ii lavas, are Cr-rich and Mg-rich. In contrast, Cr-spinels included in clinopyroxenes and orthopyroxenes (Types i and ii lavas) show lower Cr* and Mg* ratios and higher aluminium contents. Orthopyroxenes from all rock types are Mg-rich <b>enstatites.</b> Clinopyroxenes display endiopsidic to augitic compositions and are TiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 depleted. All the crystals exhibit strong zoning patterns, usually normal, although, reverse zoning patterns are not uncommon. The plagioclases show compositions within the range of An 90 - 64. The Fe-Ti oxides of the groundmass are TiO 2 -poor (Usp 16 - 17). The Hole 793 B basaltic andesites show, like the Site 458 bronzites from the Mariana forearc, intermediate features between arc tholeiites and boninites: (1) Cr-spinel in olivine, (2) presence of Mg-rich bronzite, Ca-Mg-rich clinopyroxenes, and Ca-plagioclase phenocrysts, and (3) transitional trace element depletion and epsioln-Nd ratios between arc tholeiites and boninites. Thus, the forearc magmatism of the Izu-Bonin and Mariana arcs, linked to rifting and extension, is represented by a depleted tholeiitic suite that displays boninitic affinities...|$|R

These pyroxenite layers {{have come to be}} inferred as a yield of the reaction between rising magmas and peridotite of the upper mantle. The Southern Rio Grande Rift, including the Portrillo volcanic field, is an area where pyroxenites are most prevalent. Pyroxenites are generally coupled with zones of extension implying that there is a correlation between asthenospheric outpouring and invasive growth of mantle pyroxenites. [...] The methods by which pyroxenites are formed is somewhat undefined. Pyroxenites may possibly represent preserved remnants of Farallon (oceanic) plate that subducted under the North American plate and mixed with mantle melts and created the xenoliths that have surfaced in Kilbourne Hole and Potrillo Maar. However others suggest that they could be cumulates derived from alkali basaltic pyroxenite samples continue to preserve a more widespread reaction which is specifically helpful in examining the thermal and chemical alteration of the Rio Grande rifting.

It was therefore proposed that the Zakłodzie meteorite should be classified as a [...] "primitive <b>enstatite</b> achondrite". It {{was classified as}} an Aubrite-an (anomalous) in 2006. Currently the recommended classification is that the Zakłodzie meteorite is an ungrouped <b>enstatite</b> achondrite.|$|E

50|$|Bronzite is {{a member}} of the {{pyroxene}} group of minerals, belonging with <b>enstatite</b> and hypersthene to the orthorhombic series of the group. Rather than a distinct species, it is really a ferriferous variety of <b>enstatite,</b> which owing to partial alteration has acquired a bronze-like sub-metallic luster on the cleavage surfaces.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the soil}} sample 15602,29 {{collected}} near Hadley Rille was found {{an object in}} the 1 - 2 mm size. The Hadley Rille meteorite massed about 3 mg and contained <b>enstatite,</b> kamacite, niningerite, silica, schreibersite, troilite, albite, and daubréelite. It is classed as an <b>enstatite</b> chondrite (EH) by the Meteoritical Society.|$|E
50|$|Hypersthene is {{a common}} rock-forming {{inosilicate}} mineral belonging {{to the group of}} orthorhombic pyroxenes. Many references have formally abandoned this term, preferring to categorise this mineral as <b>enstatite</b> or ferrosilite. It is found in igneous and some metamorphic rocks as well as in stony and iron meteorites. It forms a solid solution series with the minerals <b>enstatite</b> and ferrosilite, being a mid-way member between the two. Pure <b>enstatite</b> contains no iron, while pure ferrosillite contains no magnesium; hypersthene is the name given to the mineral when a significant amount of both elements are present. The chemical formula is (Mg,Fe)SiO3.|$|E
50|$|Bronzite and hypersthene {{were known}} long before <b>enstatite,</b> which was first {{described}} by G. A. Kenngott in 1855. An emerald-green variety of <b>enstatite</b> is called chrome-enstatite and is cut as a gemstone. The green color {{is caused by}} traces of chromium, hence the varietal name. In addition, bronzite is also sometimes used as a gemstone.|$|E
