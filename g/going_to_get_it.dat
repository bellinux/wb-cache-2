Streep has said: [...] "She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You {{can do whatever you}} put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her." [...] Although Streep was naturally more introverted than her mother, at times when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother, asking her for advice.|$|E

No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E
500|$|The American {{release of}} Modern Life Is Rubbish {{features}} an altered track listing. Blur's American label SBK Records preferred the group's original demo of [...] "Chemical World", and included {{it on the}} album instead of the Stephen Street-produced version. According to Select magazine, this [...] "defeated the object of recording a heavy rock song in the first place". SBK inserted [...] "Popscene" [...] between [...] "Turn It Up" [...] and [...] "Resigned"; Blur had refused to include [...] "Popscene" [...] on the British version of Modern Life, disappointed by the tepid response it received when it was released as a single. [...] "We thought, If you didn’t fucking want {{it in the first}} place," [...] Coxon told Select, [...] "you’re not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> now".

500|$|The network had {{initially}} planned to place Star Trek in the 7:30pm Monday-night time slot freed up by The Man from U.N.C.L.E. completing its run. Instead, the enraged George Schlatter forced the network to insert Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In into the slot, and Roddenberry's series {{was moved to}} 10:00pm on Fridays. Realizing the show could not survive in that time slot and burned out from arguments with the network, Roddenberry resigned from the day-to-day running of Star Trek, although he continued to be credited as executive producer. Roddenberry cooperated with Stephen Edward Poe, writing as Stephen Whitfield, on the 1968 nonfiction book The Making of Star Trek for Ballantine Books, splitting the royalties evenly. Roddenberry explained to Whitfield: [...] "I had to get some money somewhere. I'm sure not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> from the profits of Star Trek." [...] Herbert Solow and Robert H. Justman observed that Whitfield never regretted his 50-50 deal with Roddenberry, since it gave him [...] "the opportunity {{to become the first}} chronicler of television's successful unsuccessful series." [...] Whitfield had previously been the national advertising and promotion director for model makers Aluminum Model Toys, better known as [...] "AMT", which then held the Star Trek license, and moved to run Lincoln Enterprises, Roddenberry's company set up to sell the series' merchandise.|$|E
500|$|By February 2005, Paul Lovett and David Elliot, {{who wrote}} di Bonaventura's Four Brothers, were {{rewriting}} Gordon's draft. In their script, the Rex character is corrupted and mutated into the Cobra Commander, whom Destro needs to lead {{an army of}} supersoldiers. Skip Woods was rewriting the script by March 2007, and he added the Alex Mann character from the British Action Man toy line. Di Bonaventura explained, [...] "Unfortunately, our president [...] has {{put us in a}} position internationally where {{it would be very difficult}} to release a movie called G.I. Joe. To add one character to the mix is sort of a fun thing to do." [...] The script was leaked online by El Mayimbe of Latino Review, who revealed Woods had dropped the Cobra Organization in favor of the Naja / Ryan, a crooked CIA agent. In this draft, Scarlett is married to Action Man but still has feelings for Duke, and is killed by the Baroness. Snake Eyes speaks, but his vocal cords are slashed during the story, rendering him mute. Mayimbe suggested Stuart Beattie rewrite the script. Fan response to the film following the script review was negative. Di Bonaventura promised with subsequent rewrites, [...] "I'm hoping we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right this time." [...] He admitted he had problems with Cobra, concurring with an interviewer [...] "they were probably the stupidest evil organization out there [...] ". Hasbro promised they would write Cobra back into the script.|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng {{wanted the}} film to look [...] "grittier and less clean and glossy" [...] than other superhero films, and decided to shoot with digital cameras but add film grain in {{post-production}} to keep texture in the images. Seng used Super Baltar lenses and Cooke zooms for the origin story timeline, opposed to Panavision primo lenses for the Deadpool scenes which gave them more clarity. Exterior scenes in the film have a consistent overcast look, but location shooting came with [...] "unpredictable" [...] weather. For instance, the production had use of the Georgia Viaduct for two weeks, and [...] "just had to keep shooting, rain or shine, because once our permit expired on the bridge, we were never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back." [...] Seng used more lighting on cloudy days and less on sunny days to keep the look consistent. Production designer Sean Haworth also worked closely with Miller, who had specific ideas for the sets. The production {{had to be very}} specific about which elements of each set were built physically to conserve the budget for visual effects. For the final scrapyard scene, garbage was built to a certain height to be extended with CGI, and a gimbal was used for a tilting section of the yard that had to interact with a lot of digital elements. That final sequence was filmed in a naval yard, and was dressed with scrap metal. Rubber casts of the metal were made for stunts.|$|E

500|$|As {{a college}} prospect, Rivals.com ranked him 30th nationally among dual-threat quarterbacks, Scouts, Inc. ranked him 33rd nationally among wide receivers, and SuperPrep placed him on its Virginia 33. ESPN {{assessed}} {{him as a}} [...] "do-it-all prospect" [...] and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, [...] "I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not afraid to say it. I kind of want {{to show them that}} they questioned my speed and whether I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> back. I want to show them that I'm all healed up." [...] Virginia head coach Al Groh said of the Fredericksburg native before the 2009 game against Maryland, [...] "Clearly if we [...] him being the type of player that he is now, he would be returning kicks for Virginia. So we are not above admitting that there is a player that certainly {{has turned out to be}} superior to what many people thought, including ourselves.
