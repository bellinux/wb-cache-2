5|$|Yusuf <b>has</b> <b>built</b> {{a largely}} subservient and loyal {{apparatus}} by putting his fellow Majerteen clansmen in strategic positions. The National Security Agency (NSA) under General Mohamed Warsame (“Darwish”) {{and the so-called}} “Majerteen militia” units in the TFG army operate in parallel and often above other security agencies. Their exact number is hard to ascertain, but estimates suggest about 2,000. They are well catered for, well armed and often carry out counter-insurgency operations {{with little or no}} coordination with other security agencies. In the short term, this strategy may appear effective for the president, who can unilaterally employ the force essentially as he pleases. However, it undermines morale in the security services and is a cause of their high desertion rates.|$|E
5|$|By 2010, B {{employed}} twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen. The {{company has}} made other {{contributions to the}} roller coaster industry.
