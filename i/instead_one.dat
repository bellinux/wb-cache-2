5|$|The club {{controversially}} {{rejoined the}} First Division in 1919, despite only finishing sixth in 1914–15, the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened — although {{an error in}} the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth, an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975. The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22, and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League. On past precedent the two places would {{be given to the}} two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated, namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. <b>Instead</b> <b>one</b> of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea - who had been the victims of a betting controversy - and a ballot was called for the remaining place. The candidates included 20th-placed Tottenham Hotspur and, from the second division, Barnsley (who had finished third); Wolves, (fourth); Birmingham (fifth later amended to sixth); Hull City (seventh); and Nottingham Forest (eighteenth).|$|E
5|$|The game {{world is}} not broken up into levels, but is <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> large area not {{separated}} by loading screens. As the player journeys through the largely linear world, they encounter numerous monsters and enemies of varying types that attack whenever the party of player characters approach. The party defends themselves and attacks enemies using melee and ranged weapons, and nature and combat magic. The player does not select a character class for the characters, unlike other role-playing video games; instead, using weapons or magic of a particular type increases the character's skill with them over time. Whenever a player gains enough experience points from killing enemies and reaches a new level in that weapon type, they gain some amount of points in their strength, dexterity, or intelligence statistics, which in turn relate {{to the amount of}} health points and mana that they have, and damage that they do with weapons.|$|E

25|$|The Christian {{doctrine}} of hell derives from passages in the New Testament. The word hell {{does not appear}} in the Greek New Testament, <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> of three words is used: the Greek words Tartarus, Hades or the Hebrew word Gehinnom.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} code inserts a node {{after an}} existing node in a singly linked list. The diagram shows how it works. Inserting a node before an existing one cannot be done directly; <b>instead,</b> <b>one</b> must {{keep track of}} the previous node and insert a node after it.|$|E
25|$|As for Hermitian matrices, the {{key point}} is to prove the {{existence}} {{of at least one}} nonzero eigenvector. To prove this, we cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. The above spectral theorem holds for real or complex Hilbert spaces.|$|E
50|$|Example 1. Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture Minangkabau do {{not even}} have a surname or family name, see this culture's own section below. In contrast, members do have a clan name, which is {{important}} in their lives although {{not included in the}} member's name. <b>Instead,</b> <b>one's</b> name is just one's given name.|$|R

25|$|Bertrand's {{point in}} {{constructing}} this example {{was to show}} that merely counting cases is not always proper. <b>Instead,</b> <b>one</b> should sum the probabilities that the cases would produce the observed result; and the two methods are equivalent only if this probability is either 1 or 0 in every case. This condition is correctly applied in the second solution method, {{but not in the}} first.|$|E
25|$|Radiohead {{released}} no singles {{or music}} videos to promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots. They became <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> {{of the first}} major acts {{to use the internet}} as a promotional tool; the album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. File sharing services shared bootlegs of early performances, and the album was leaked before release.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{interaction}} {{is described by}} SU(2), so that instantons {{can be expected to}} play a role there as well. If so, they would induce baryon number violation. Due to the Higgs mechanism, instantons are not exact solutions anymore, but approximations can be used <b>instead.</b> <b>One</b> of the conclusions is that the presence of a gauge boson mass suppresses large instantons, so that the instanton gas approximation is consistent.|$|E

25|$|Steven Nadler {{suggests}} that settling {{the question of}} Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God {{is not one of}} reverence or religious awe, but <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the French TGV or the Japanese Shinkansen systems, the vehicles, {{tracks and}} {{operations}} were not designed as an integrated whole; rather, the ICE {{system has been}} integrated into Germany's pre-existing system of railway lines <b>instead.</b> <b>One</b> {{of the effects of}} this is that the ICE 3 trains can reach a speed of 300km/h (186mph) only on some stretches of line and cannot currently reach their maximum allowed speed of 330km/h on German railway lines (though a speed of 320km/h is reached by ICE 3 in France).|$|E
25|$|Three {{important}} experimental paradigms {{have evolved}} in the search to find evidence for the speech mode hypothesis. These are dichotic listening, categorical perception, and duplex perception. Through the research in these categories {{it has been found}} that there may not be a specific speech mode but <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> for auditory codes that require complicated auditory processing. Also it seems that modularity is learned in perceptual systems. Despite this the evidence and counter-evidence for the speech mode hypothesis is still unclear and needs further research.|$|E

25|$|Young Schoendoerffer had {{realized}} he was not born to be a mariner, {{but he did not}} want to be a soldier either, thinking he would be wasting his time. What he wanted to do was filmmaking. As he failed to enter the television and cinema industries, he began photography <b>instead.</b> <b>One</b> day as he read a Le Figaro article about war cameraman Georges Kowal, Killed in action during the First Indochina War, he decided to try his luck in the Service Cinématographique des Armées ("Armies' Cinematographic Service", SCA, now ECPAD).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, if a goaltender acts {{in such a}} {{way that}} would cause a normal player to be given a penalty, such as {{slashing}} or tripping another player, the goaltender cannot be sent to the penalty box. <b>Instead,</b> <b>one</b> of the goaltender's teammates who was on the ice at the time of the infraction is sent to the penalty box in his or her place. However, the goalie does receive the penalty minutes on the scoresheet. If the goalie receives a Game Misconduct penalty, he is removed from the ice and a replacement goalie is played.|$|E
25|$|Social {{views on}} {{domestic}} violence vary {{from person to}} person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because {{in most of these}} countries the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but <b>instead</b> <b>one</b> in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries – for example, in Yemen, marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.|$|E

25|$|Following that film's {{successful}} {{release in}} 1935, Goldwyn purchased {{the rights to}} The Children's Hour for $35,000 while it still was running on Broadway. Hellman rewrote the play {{to conform to the}} standards of the Motion Picture Production Code, under which any mention of lesbianism was impossible. <b>Instead,</b> <b>one</b> schoolteacher is accused of having sex with the other's fiancé. It appeared in 1936 under the title, These Three. She next wrote the screenplay for Dead End (1937), which featured the first appearance of the Dead End Kids and premiered in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Dukkha Nirodha (cessation of suffering): One cannot {{possibly}} {{adjust the}} whole world to one's taste in order to eliminate suffering and hope that it will remain so forever. This would violate the chief principle of Change. <b>Instead,</b> <b>one</b> adjusts one's own mind through detachment so that the Change, of whatever nature, has no effect on one's peace of mind. Briefly stated, the third Noble Truth implies that elimination of the cause (craving) eliminates the result (suffering). This is implied by the scriptural quote by The Buddha, 'Whatever may result from a cause, shall be eliminated by the elimination of the cause'.|$|E
25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. <b>Instead,</b> <b>one</b> must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E
