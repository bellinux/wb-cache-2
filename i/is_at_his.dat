As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes {{in the same manner}} and he is sent to the principal's office.|$|E
5|$|Eguchi and Matsueda {{are noted}} for {{creating}} mainly jazzy and electronic tracks for the scores they have collaborated on; Eguchi is credited {{for most of}} the electronic music. The soundtrack to The Bouncer, of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot of the pieces, featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions. He has stated that {{most of the time he}} composes and arranges music <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home studio, where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate, however, Eguchi replaces them at the company's studio. He has said that by the time he is finished creating the music, he is only sleeping three to four hours a week.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} {{is not completely}} smooth, as Noah is still struggling somewhat with his own homosexuality, not able to express his feelings as freely as Luke. Noah continues to work on it, and it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> instigation that the pair become housemates. While Noah had wanted to get an apartment alone with Luke, he compromises on Luke's suggestion by moving into Luke's family home, although the couple {{are not permitted to}} share a bed.|$|E
25|$|Bhāskara II (1114 – c. 1185) was {{the leading}} {{mathematician}} of the 12th century. In Algebra, he gave the general solution of Pell's equation. He {{is the author of}} Lilavati and Vija-Ganita, which contain problems dealing with determinate and indeterminate linear and quadratic equations, and Pythagorean triples and he fails to distinguish between exact and approximate statements. Many of the problems in Lilavati and Vija-Ganita are derived from other Hindu sources, and so Bhaskara <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best in dealing with indeterminate analysis.|$|E
25|$|The crown <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet, and {{on either}} side the step is lined with two levels of text. The left hand upper line reads VITA SINE MORTE IN CAPITE ("Life without death on his head"), that on the right LUVENTUS SINE SENECTUTE IN FRONTE ("Youth without age on his forehead").

500|$|Critics also praised Louis-Dreyfus' and Alexander's performances; The Age critic Kenneth Nguyen {{stated that}} they [...] "characteristically, rock their line readings". Michael Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly, who graded the episode with an A−, commented, [...] "George <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> pressure-cooker best, but it's Elaine—famished and in high dudgeon—who is the centerpiece." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A+, saying [...] "it's a deftly-plotted, {{extremely}} funny example of the 'show about nothing' label that Seinfeld assigned itself".|$|E
500|$|Schenn is a defensive-defenceman {{who plays}} a {{physical}} game while attempting to prevent opponents from scoring. Since his rookie season, he {{has been among the}} NHL leaders in hits. He believes he <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best when he is playing a tough game, while staying responsible: [...] "You just want to be physical and play with a bit of an edge, but you don't want to put your team down short-handed." [...] Growing up, Schenn patterned his play after fellow defencemen Chris Pronger and Rob Blake.|$|E

Meanwhile, Smith <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> place of work at the Social Security Administration (SSA) when he is {{captured}} by the Smoking Man, and taken to a high-security prison. Mulder heads to his mother's home and encounters X (Steven Williams), who shows him his photos of Teena and the Smoking Man. Mulder searches the house and realizes that [...] "PALM" [...] was Teena's attempt to write [...] "LAMP". He then finds an alien stiletto weapon {{inside one of the}} lamps—the same kind used by the alien bounty hunter in previous episodes.|$|E
500|$|Mary Elizabeth Bartowski (Linda Hamilton) sneaks into a mine in Amacayacu, Colombia to {{retrieve}} the fully assembled [...] "Norseman" [...] weapon, only to be captured by Vivian Volkoff (Lauren Cohan) and Riley (Ray Wise). To ensure that Mary <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wedding, Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) travels to the mine and rescues Mary, leaving best man Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) in charge of creating a video montage as his wedding present to Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski). Morgan allows Jeff Barnes (Scott Krinsky), Lester Patel (Vik Sahay), and Big Mike (Mark Christopher Lawrence) to create the first cut {{so that he can}} partake in the mission, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) forces Morgan to stay in Burbank due to Alex McHugh's (Mekenna Melvin) worry for his safety.|$|E
500|$|He {{has stated}} that his biggest musical {{influences}} are [...] "old techno and progressive rock" [...] {{groups such as the}} Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra. When he was starting out in the field of music, he went under the pseudonym [...] "YmoH.S", a reference to Yellow Magic Orchestra. He also cites the American jazz musician Chick Corea as a major influence. While creating the music for Final Fantasy XII, however, his biggest musical inspiration was former regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu. Sakimoto enjoys listening to techno and jazz fusion in his spare time. While he sometimes gets inspiration while relaxing at home, Sakimoto feels that his best ideas come to him while he <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> studio concentrating. One of his favorite soundtracks he ever composed was the one for Vagrant Story.|$|E

The eighth episode, entitled [...] "Furt", opens with Burt and Carole telling their sons that they are engaged. Kurt insists that New Directions perform at the wedding and reception. At the wedding, New Directions perform [...] "Marry You" [...] by Bruno Mars as they, and then Burt and Carole, dance down the aisle. The couple marry, but use their honeymoon savings to transfer Kurt to Dalton Academy when a homophobic bully who has threatened Kurt's life is allowed to resume attending McKinley High.|$|E
500|$|Upon its 1965 release, The Cincinnati Kid was favorably {{reviewed}} by Variety which wrote [...] "Martin Ransohoff has constructed a taut, well-turned-out production. In Steve McQueen {{he has the}} near-perfect delineator of the title role. Edward G. Robinson <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> best in some years as the aging, ruthless Lancey Howard...." [...] Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film a [...] "respectably packaged drama" [...] that is [...] "strictly for those who relishor at least playstud poker" [...] and notes that the [...] "film pales beside The Hustler, to which it bears a striking similarity of theme and characterization." [...] Time magazine also noted the similarities to The Hustler, saying [...] "nearly everything about Cincinnati Kid is reminiscent" [...] of that film, but falls short in the comparison, {{in part because of}} the subject matter: ...|$|E
500|$|The actors' {{performances}} received overall {{praise from}} reviewers. Camerin Courtney of Christianity Today was dismayed {{that the main}} character engaged in {{a sexual relationship with}} a married man, but Weisz [...] "is wonderful as Bolkovac, a no-nonsense civil servant who is stunned at what she walks into" [...] while [...] "Vanessa Redgrave is a needed touch of strength and warmth as her mentor Madeleine, and David Strathairn <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> government thriller best as Peter Ward, an Internal Affairs agent. Raya is heart-breaking as the young victim." [...] Steve Rea of The Post and Courier praised Redgrave's acting in the supporting role of Madeleine Rees as [...] "forceful, elegant, precise". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Weisz gives a psychologically astute performance as a woman who can't leave things alone." [...] Rex Reed of The Observer called her [...] "superb" [...] in the lead role.|$|E

500|$|Traditionally, reviewers {{have been}} put off by Agârbiceanu's plot devices and epic mannerisms, and in {{particular}} by his explanatory comments and notes, which they deem superfluous and distracting. As Lovinescu notes, Agârbiceanu and other Transylvanian realists will [...] "accumulate in details", but will remain [...] "incapable of narrating {{on more than one}} level": [...] "for all their dynamism, his sketches are not exciting in the dramatic sense." [...] The moralizing aspect of Agârbiceanu's fiction makes it hard to separate between it and his purely theological productions: as Lovinescu notes, whenever Agârbiceanu depicts village drunks, it is as if [...] "for an anti-saloon exhibition." [...] Dragomirescu argues that Agârbiceanu's work amounts to a set of humanitarian [...] "directives", although, he concludes, its depiction of [...] "the bleak and mystical recess of life" [...] is a fine literary contribution, [...] "rising above" [...] his generation's. He states: [...] "Agârbiceanu is a socializing Poporanist or Sămănătorist only when he <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> weakest".|$|E
500|$|Odubade is {{generally}} deployed as a striker, but {{has also been}} used as a winger. He believes that his best asset is his turn of pace, and that he <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> most dangerous when he is [...] "running at opposition defences". He is predominantly right-footed, and scores the majority of his goals with his right foot, but is also comfortable using his left. During his time at Stevenage, manager Graham Westley has used Odubade as the second striker as part of a 4–4–2 formation sitting off the shoulder of the centre forward. Westley has also used him as part of a 4–3–3 formation, usually {{on the right side of}} a three-pronged attack. Odubade has been described as possessing [...] "blistering pace", which was emphasised following two goals away at Crawley Town in March 2010, whereby his pace left the Crawley defence [...] "in their tracks". Former Oxford United manager Darren Patterson said that Odubade needs [...] "to work on his movement up front, and he's got to realise what his assets are and play to them".|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine from BBC Music {{wrote that}} Brown <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> most ingratiating when he unites with Benassi [...] "for the {{electronic}} throb of [...] "Beautiful People"". Jamie Horne of The Border Mail {{wrote that the}} song [...] "is another thumping four-on-the-floor anthem." [...] Tom Howard from Yahoo! Music called the song [...] "cheesily euphoric... a single {{just in time to}} gain some momentum before the high season in Ibiza." [...] Sean Fennessey from The Washington Post gave [...] "Beautiful People" [...] a mixed review, writing, [...] "When Brown dabbles in shamelessly au courant Eurohouse, such as in 'Beautiful People' featuring and produced by the Italian pop-house staple Benny Benassi, that voice is nearly swallowed whole by wall-to-wall production." [...] James Montgomery from MTV News placed [...] "Beautiful People" [...] at number 18 on his list of the [...] "25 Best Songs of 2011". He wrote that [...] "this single represents his biggest reinvention to date. A slippery, shiny club track helmed by Benny Benassi, like most of Breezy's work it is undeniably sexy, but it's also subtly smart too. And that's where he made his biggest strides." [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was nominated for Best R/Urban Dance Track at the 27th Annual International Dance Music Awards.|$|E
