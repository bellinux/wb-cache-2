(These must not be confused with the arrows of Feynman diagrams which are actually simplified representations in two dimensions of a relationship between points in three dimensions of space and one of time.) The amplitude arrows are fundamental to the description of the world given by quantum theory. No satisfactory reason has been given for why they are needed. But pragmatically we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> they are an essential part of our description of all quantum phenomena. They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the square of the length of the corresponding amplitude arrow. So, for a given process, if two probability amplitudes, v and w, are involved, the probability of the process will be given either by ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the 2011 Assembly election concerns were raised by politicians and others about {{the time it took}} for ballots to be verified and counted.

The announcement of the final results for some constituencies came two days after the polls closed. In contrast, the first result for elections held in Scotland on the same day as the Assembly election came in at 12:54a.m., just under three hours after counting began, and the final result came in at 5:21p.m. on the same day (Friday 6 May). [...] In response to the criticisms about the speed of counting, Northern Ireland's Chief Electoral Officer, Graham Shields, defended the process, saying that it was [...] "about accuracy, not about speed", adding that [...] "This is a complicated process and people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that.</b> We will take {{as long as it takes}} to get it right." ...|$|E

[...] Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since a Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: [...] "The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> the Arab majority will decide?" [...] "Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me that's cut and dried: there's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins." ...|$|E

Farage has also called Carswell [...] "irrelevant", in response to them supporting different campaigns to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In response to Carswell calling for the party leader's resignation, Farage said that Carswell should [...] "put up or shut up", further saying that [...] "either he's going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> [...] or do something different". After Farage's resignation as UKIP leader following the EU referendum, Carswell tweeted a [...] "sunshades smiley emoji", which {{some parts of the}} media described as showing the [...] "uneasy relationship" [...] between the two men, Carswell later said to the BBC that [...] "I tweet smiley faces all the time, I'm very optimistic".

The couple also appeared on the syndicated television show Divorce Court in April 2009. On the program, Ted says he wanted his wife to divorce him after the scandal, saying that he thought he had become so [...] "toxic" [...] that divorce was best for Gayle and their children. On March 11, 2009, Haggard attended a performance in New York of This Beautiful City, a play about him and the Colorado Springs evangelical community. In August 2009, Haggard told Charisma magazine: [...] "I do not believe my childhood experience is an excuse. I fell into sin and failed to extract myself. I am responsible, and I have repented."

2500|$|The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Michaelangelo Matos {{opined that}} [...] "while One Life Stands mindset is Hot Chip's most overtly serious, {{the album is}} also its most musically accomplished. The melodies are Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard's longest-lined, and the melodies often unfurl beautifully." [...] Ian Mathers of PopMatters viewed it as [...] "Hot Chip's most kinetic album" [...] and stated that [...] "One Life Stand may be less pleasingly idiosyncratic than Hot Chip's previous work, but it pays off in their most consistently winning set of songs to date. It's still not quite as raucous as their incredible live show, [...] but those who felt that Made in the Dark never built up enough momentum ought to find this one's straightforward drive more satisfying." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork named One Life Stand the band's [...] "most consistent and most complete record", but remarked that [...] "it's missing an A-list single on par with 'Boy From School', 'Over and Over', or 'Ready for the Floor'. It's also missing dance songs {{in the mode of}} the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley wrote that the album [...] "sees their familiar pick'n'mix genre-shopping combined with unprecedented levels of Mills & Boon sentimentality. It's a heady cocktail, but when mixed in the right proportions the results are stunning." [...] Jamie Fullerton of NME concluded that the album [...] "does have some of the best songs of the year on it. But, again, waiting for Hot Chip to make that classic album is a bit like waiting for an alcoholic parent to arrive at your birthday party. There's a kind of unconditional love that'll keep you hoping every time one comes around, but there may be a point where you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>that</b> it's just never going to happen." [...] Chris Beanland of BBC Music felt that [...] "his is an imbalanced record, and one that leaves you frustrated rather than elated.
