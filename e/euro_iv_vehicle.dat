40|$|Passenger {{vehicles}} {{are one of}} the most significant source of pollution in the cities. The emissions production of a vehicle is strictly dependent on how the vehicle is used. This paper has the objective to characterize a <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> <b>vehicle</b> so to understand in depth the behavior in its real usage on road in terms of fuel consumption and emissions. An Honda Civic 2. 0 Euro 4 vehicle has been tested and the experimental results are reported. The experiments have been carried out by means of two tools: a OBD 2 interface to connect a laptop PC to the vehicle for collecting engine parameters (Alessandrini et al. 2006) and the HORIBA OBS 1300 equipment to measure CO, NOx, HC emissions and the exhaust gas flow, pressure and temperature. Three types of experimental tests have been made: a set of them on a dynamometer chassis and a part on road. The warm-up phase, as foreseeable, is the main source of HC (up to 550 ppm) and CO (up to 10 %Vol), while in steady conditions the emissions are often too low to be appreciated by the sensors. At full open throttle, the air-fuel ratio is no more stoichiometric, correspondingly the highest measured values of CO and NOx are encountered, being the first significantly influenced by this parameter while the NOx mostly by high combustion temperatures. Under transient conditions, typical of urban cycles, the peak values for CO are 2. 6 %Vol and 500 ppm for NOx, mainly due to the enrichment of the air-fuel mixture; the engine ECU (Electronic Control Unit) has a delay in counteracting the correct quantity of fuel to be injected and the mixture is purposefully enriched to give better engine performances in such critical moments. The HC are always negligible. The driver behavior as well has an important impact on the emissions and the accelerator pedal usage (and its temporal derivative) is the most relevant factor that influences fuel consumption and emissions. Several drivers have been engaged and the behavior analyzed shows how the vehicle maintains its Euro 4 characteristics if never driven at full throttle regime. Transient conditions and in particular severe accelerations are the worst conditions concerning consumption and emission...|$|E

2500|$|Before the Ecopass {{came into}} force there were around 98 {{thousand}} vehicles entering the restricted zone every day, but now {{traffic in the}} ZTL is approaching 87,000 daily vehicles (91,7 thousand in November 2008) and it seems traffic jams are slowly {{coming back to the}} pre-Ecopass levels. In the same regard, another criticism is the slow erosion of the system benefits, as the Ecopass price structure has been an incentive for car owners to buy new vehicles, and now more than 7,000 vehicles per day have free access. Despite the fact that these vehicles having less polluting engines, the free access helps less with the congestion problem. [...] This trend is contributing to a return to previous traffic levels {{and at the same time}} reducing revenue collected. [...] This threatens the ability to keep the system in operation. Also it was criticized the decision to maintain the exemption for <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> diesel <b>vehicles</b> when authorities decided to extend the Ecopass until December 2009, because this decision is also contributing to the fading of the initial benefits.|$|R

40|$|Gasoline {{vehicles}} have elevated {{emissions of}} {{volatile organic compounds}} during cold starts and idling and have recently been pointed out as potentially {{the main source of}} anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in megacities. However, {{there is a lack of}} laboratory studies to systematically investigate SOA formation in real-world exhaust. In this study, SOA formation from pure aromatic precursors, idling and cold start gasoline exhaust from one Euro II, one Euro III and one <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> passenger <b>vehicles</b> were investigated using photo-oxidation experiments in a 6 m 3 smog chamber. The experiments were carried out at atmospherically relevant organic aerosol mass concentrations. The characterization methods included a high resolution aerosol mass spectrometer and a proton transfer mass spectrometer. It was found that gasoline exhaust readily forms SOA with a signature aerosol mass spectrum similar to the oxidized organic aerosol that commonly dominates the organic aerosol mass spectra downwind urban areas. After 4 h aging the formed SOA was 1 – 2 orders of magnitude higher than the Primary OA emissions. The SOA mass spectrum from a relevant mixture of traditional light aromatic precursors gave f 43 (mass fraction at m/z = 4 3) approximately two times higher than to the gasoline SOA. However O : C and H : C ratios were similar for the two cases. Classical C 6 –C 9 light aromatic precursors were responsible for up to 60 % of the formed SOA, which is significantly higher than for diesel exhaust. Important candidates for additional precursors are higher order aromatic compounds such as C 10 , C 11 light aromatics, naphthalene and methyl-naphthalenes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Due {{to their}} toxicity, diesel {{emissions}} {{have been submitted}} to progressively more restrictive regulations in developed countries. However, in Brazil, {{the implementation of the}} Cleaner Diesel Technologies policy (<b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> standards for <b>vehicles</b> produced in 2009 and low-sulfur diesel with 50 ppm of sulfur) was postponed until 2012 without a comprehensive analysis of the effect of this delay on public health parameters. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the delay in implementing the Cleaner Diesel Technologies policy on health indicators and monetary health costs in Brazil. METHODS: The primary estimator of exposure to air pollution was the concentration of ambient fine particulate matter (particles with aerodynamic diameters < 2. 5 &# 956;m, [PM 2. 5]). This parameter was measured daily in six Brazilian metropolitan areas during 2007 - 2008. We calculated 1) the projected reduction in the PM 2. 5 that would have been achieved if the <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> standards had been implemented in 2009 and 2) the expected reduction after implementation in 2012. The difference between these two time curves was transformed into health outcomes using previous dose-response curves. The economic valuation was performed based on the DALY (disability-adjusted life years) method. RESULTS: The delay in implementing the Cleaner Diesel Technologies policy will result in an estimated excess of 13, 984 deaths up to 2040. Health expenditures are projected to be increased by nearly US$ 11. 5 billion for the same period. CONCLUSIONS: The present results indicate that a significant health burden will occur because of the postponement in implementing the Cleaner Diesel Technologies policy. These results also reinforce the concept that health effects must be considered when revising fuel and emission policies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we report the first direct {{measurements}} of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) in the UK using a vehicle emission remote sensing technique. Measurements of NO, NO 2 and ammonia (NH 3) from almost 70, 000 vehicles were made spanning vehicle model years from 1985 to 2012. These measurements were carefully matched with detailed vehicle information data {{to understand the}} emission characteristics {{of a wide range}} of vehicles in a detailed way. Overall it is found that only petrol fuelled vehicles have shown an appreciable reduction in total NOx emissions over the past 15 – 20 years. Emissions of NOx from diesel vehicles, including those with after-treatment systems designed to reduce emissions of NOx, have not reduced over the same period of time. It is also evident that the vehicle manufacturer has a strong influence on emissions of NO 2 for Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars and urban buses. Smaller-engined Euro 4 / 5 diesel cars are also shown to emit less NO 2 than larger-engined vehicles. It is shown that NOx emissions from urban buses fitted with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are comparable to those using Exhaust Gas Recirculation for Euro V vehicles, while reductions in NOx of about 30 % are observed for <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> and EEV <b>vehicles.</b> However, the emissions of NO 2 vary widely dependent on the bus technology used. Almost all the NOx emission from <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> buses with SCR is in the form of NO, whereas EEV vehicles (Enhanced Environmentally friendly Vehicle) emit about 30 % of the NOx as NO 2. We find similarly low amounts of NO 2 from trucks (3. 5 – 12 t and > 12 t). Finally, we show that NH 3 emissions are most important for older generation catalyst-equipped petrol vehicles and SCR-equipped buses. The NH 3 emissions from petrol cars have decreased by over a factor of three from the vehicles manufactured in the late 1990 s compared with those manufactured in 2012. Tables of emission factors are presented for NOx, NO 2 and NH 3 together with uncertainties to assist the development of new emission inventories...|$|R

40|$|Raman Microspectroscopy (RM), Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) were {{combined}} to get comprehensive {{information on the}} relationship between structure and reactivity of soot in samples of spark discharge (GfG), heavy duty engine diesel (<b>EURO</b> VI and <b>IV)</b> soot and Graphite powder upon oxidation by oxygen at increasing temperatures. GfG soot and Graphite powder represent the higher and lower reactivity limits. Raman microspectroscopic analysis was conducted by determination of spectral parameters using a five band fitting procedure (G, D 1 -D 4) as well as by evaluation of the dispersive character of the D mode. The analysis of spectral parameters shows a higher degree of disorder and a higher amount of molecular carbon for untreated GfG soot samples than for samples of untreated EURO VI and <b>EURO</b> <b>IV</b> soot. The structural analysis based on the dispersive character of D mode revealed substantial differences in ordering descending from Graphite powder, <b>EURO</b> <b>IV,</b> VI to GfG soot. HRTEM images and EELS analysis of <b>EURO</b> <b>IV</b> and VI samples indicated a different morphology and a higher structural order as compared to GfG soot in full agreement with the Raman analysis.

50|$|There {{has been}} {{criticism}} {{of the fact that}} the Indian norms lag the Euro norms. As of 2014, only a few cities meet <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> or Bharat Stage IV standards that are nine years behind Europe. The rest of India gets Bharat Stage III standard fuel and vehicles, which are 14 years behind Europe. Also, there was a suggestion from some bodies to implement <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> norms after <b>Euro</b> II norms, skipping the Euro III norms totally. This is because the Euro III norms are only a small improvement over Euro II, whereas <b>Euro</b> <b>IV</b> norms mark a big leap over Euro II. According to a study conducted by the Desert Research Institute and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the only way to stabilise fine particulates (PM2.5) at the 2011 levels despite the five-fold rise in vehicular density is nationwide implementation of Bharat V standards by 2015.|$|R
