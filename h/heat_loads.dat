40|$|AbstractDistrict heating (DH) {{systems with}} the {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) have become {{widespread}} and heat accumulation tanks are installed in most cogeneration heating plants. A <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variation {{is one of the}} main parameters that need to be taken into account when planning thermal energy storage. Both seasonal and daily <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variations need to be analysed in order to determine the most suitable capacity of the accumulation system. The main aim of the article is to determine the necessary capacity of the thermal energy storage in order to level the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variation in different seasons. Two different methods have been used to analyse the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variation. The relative daily variation of heat supply for the particular DH system ranges from 1. 66 to 2. 06 %. The largest daily <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variation reaches 29 % from the daily average heat supply. Results show that it would be necessary to install TES with the capacity of around 5500 MWh to prevent weekly <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variations and 634 MWh for daily <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> variations in the winter period.

50|$|Heat pipes are {{excellent}} heat transfer devices but their sphere of application is mainly confined to transferring relatively small <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> over relatively short distances when the evaporator and condenser are at same horizontal level. This limitation {{on the part}} of the heat pipes is mainly related to the major pressure losses associated with the liquid flow through the porous structure, present along the entire length of the heat pipe and viscous interaction between the vapor and liquid phases, also called entrainment losses. For the applications involving transfer of large <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> over long distances, the thermal performance of the heat pipes is badly affected by increase in these losses. For the same reason conventional heat pipes are very sensitive to the change in orientation in gravitational field. For the unfavorable slopes in evaporator-above-condenser configuration, the pressure losses due to the mass forces in gravity field adds to the total pressure losses and further affect the efficiency of the heat transfer process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This article {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} thermal performance of thermoelectric air-cooling module which comprises a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) and an air-cooling heat sink. The influences of input current and <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> are determined. And performances under each situation are quantified by thermal resistance analysis. Since TEC generates Joule heat, this nature makes construction of thermal resistance network difficult. To simplify the analysis, this article emphasizes on the resistance <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> might meet when {{passing through the}} device. Therefore, the thermal resistances in this paper are to divide temperature differences by <b>heat</b> <b>load.</b> According to the result, there exists an optimum input current under every heating power. In this case, the optimum input current is around 6 A or 7 A. The performance of the heat sink would be improved with TEC under certain heating power and input current, especially at a low <b>heat</b> <b>load.</b> According to the result, the device can even make the heat source cooler than the ambient. However, TEC is not always effective at every <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> and input current. In some situation, the device works worse than the heat sink without TEC. To determine the availability of TEC, this study figures out the effective operating region in which the TEC air-cooling module works better than the heat sink without TEC. The result shows that TEC is more effective at a lower <b>heat</b> <b>load.</b> If <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> is too high, heat sink with TEC will perform worse than without TEC. The limit of this device is 57 W. Besides, TEC is not helpful if input current is too high or too low. There is an effective range of input current, and the range becomes narrower when the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> grows. Keywords—Thermoelectric cooler, TEC, electronic cooling, heat sink. I I...|$|R
