3000|$|In Kirchhoff’s theory, w(x, y) {{obtained}} above {{corresponds to}} neutral plane deflection w 0 N with <b>edge</b> <b>condition</b> w 0 N = 0. Obviously, this <b>edge</b> <b>condition</b> {{is not required}} to obtain [u 1, v 1] and face deflection. With reference to the present analysis, it is relevant to note the following observations: In the preliminary solution, σ z, α[τ xz, τ yz], α 2 [σ x, σ y, τ xy] are of O(1). As such, estimation of in-plane stresses, thereby, in-plane displacements, are not dependent on w 0. The support condition w 0 = 0 along the plate edge does not play any role in the estimation of in-plane displacements. In fact, Kirchhoff’s theory gives only a lower bound for α for the validity of small deformation theory. Validity of its application is a questionable proposition for small values of α even slightly higher than this lower bound since the theory gives highly constrained solutions for displacements. Shear deformations are included in FSDT in which face shear conditions are not satisfied and Reissner’s theory in which <b>edge</b> <b>condition</b> on w 0 is not satisfied. Both of these theories give {{more or less the same}} maximum vertical deflection. It shows that satisfying either <b>edge</b> <b>condition</b> on w 0 or face shear conditions has equal effect on deformations. In each of these theories, both conditions are satisfied only in the limit. Limiting process, however, nullifies the effect due to the applied or reactive edge stress τ xy [...] in the bending problem. Moreover, linear variation of σ z [...] in z is neglected in constitutive relations. The present analysis shows that this linear σ z [...] results in more flexible plate deformations in conjunction with zero face shear conditions.|$|E

A four-resonator H-plane filter is analyzed by the mode-matching technique (MMT) and the CIET for comparison and results in a reduction of central-processing-unit (CPU) time {{of the order of}} 400. A set of CIE’s for the tangential electric fields at the apertures of the discontinuities are derived and solved by the moment method.

The final <b>edge</b> <b>conditions</b> {{that exist in}} mesoscale objects are created {{not only by the}} manufacturing process but, because of their size, also by part handling procedures. In these parts, the concern is not only with burrs, which can be formed by some mesoscale manufacturing processes, but also with the shape and size of the edge. These properties are critically important as the edge can constitute {{a large percentage of the}} smallest features of mesoscale objects.
