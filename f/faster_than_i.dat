He could figure them out <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> could. He would open a gate, and go for a stroll." [...] Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight {{breeding}} seasons, and 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. Of his foals, 108started races, and 77won, earning a total of $476,949. The most successful of his foals, Lightning Belle, earned $60,134 (approximately $ as of [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Jackson — in {{the late}} 1960s, Ketcham decided to add an African American {{character}} named Jackson to the cast. Ketcham designed Jackson {{in the tradition of}} a stereotypical cartoon pickaninny, with huge lips, big white eyes, and just a suggestion of an Afro hair style. A panel from May 13, 1970 depicted Jackson and Dennis playing in the backyard, with Dennis saying to his father, [...] "I'm havin' some race trouble with Jackson. He runs <b>FASTER</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> do!" [...] The attempt to integrate the feature did not go over well. Protests erupted in Detroit, Little Rock, Miami, and St. Louis, and debris was thrown at the offices of the Post Dispatch. Taken aback, Ketcham issued a statement explaining that his intentions were innocent, and Jackson was not used again. However, another African American character named Jay Weldon appeared in the 1986 animated series to far less controversy, as he was not a stereotype.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — By {{implementing}} a control program with hardwired logic using reconfigurable devices (e. g., FPGA), a flexible and highly responsive {{system can be}} realized. This new system also contributes to securing intellectual property, while reducing implementation space and cost. This study outlines a converter that translates PLC instruction sequence into logic description. A design framework is also described, which integrates control logic and peripheral functions on an FPGA chip. A productive ladder program was examined with Mitsubishi Electric FX 2 N PLC and Altera APEX 20 KE FPGA, and the derived logic designs were shown to fit into an actual FPGA chip. A straightforward Sequential design {{was estimated to be}} 79 times <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> PLC, while a performance-oriented Flat design was estimated to be 43 times <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> Sequential design (<b>i.</b> e., 3397 times <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> PLC). <b>I...</b>|$|R
60|$|I had to claw {{away from}} the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep from {{knocking}} the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing--it was floating a little <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> what <b>I</b> was.|$|R

That bullet was in its heart.|$|R

40|$|Rat insulin II, unlike rat insulin I {{and other}} non-rodent insulins, {{contains}} a unique methionine residue at position B 29. Reversed-phase HPLC allows {{for separation of}} the two rat insulins, with insulin <b>I</b> typically eluting <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> insulin II. An anomalous peak of insulin immunoreactive material was found eluting even <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> insulin <b>I</b> following acid extraction of rat insulin-producing cells. This early peak co-eluted with [Met-OB 29]insulin II suggesting that during cell extraction and subsequent purification steps, rat insulin II is subject to selective oxidation at MetB 29. Such oxidation of rat proinsulin II affords improved separation from rat proinsulin I compared to the native form...|$|R
