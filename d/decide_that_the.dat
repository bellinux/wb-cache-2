5|$|Black {{takes his}} family to the {{woodland}} cabin, where he and Catherine <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dose of vaccine {{should be given to}} Jordan. Black and Catherine discuss how they would handle infection; Catherine asks to be euthanized, Black states he would wander off to die alone. That night, Catherine wakes up, experiencing symptoms of the disease. She quietly leaves the cabin and walks into the forest. The next morning, Black wakes up, and finding blood on Catherine's pillow, realizes she has gone. He cradles his daughter as the screen flashes images of the collapse of society, interspersed with video noise.|$|E
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved hunting and fishing rights. In {{the event that the}} court would <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hunting and fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E

5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from Lithuania, the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> future of Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, Lithuania, and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in Lithuania. In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and Lithuania, Vilnius {{and the surrounding area}} was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After Lithuania took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between Lithuania and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that Lithuania restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E
5|$|Andre {{reveals that}} an idol of Baphomet has been {{discovered}} in Paris, and George gains access to the excavation. Using the chalice, he discovers {{an image of a}} church with a square tower. George returns to the Countess, and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it. Compiling their clues, George, Nicole and Andre <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Templars are going to Bannockburn, Scotland. George and Nicole board a train, but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing. He reaches the conductor's carriage, where the old woman, Khan in disguise, throws Flap out of the carriage. However, Khan is shot and killed by another man. George and Nicole reach the church {{in time to see the}} Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols—the Sword of Baphomet, or the Broken Sword. After trying to tempt George to join their ranks, the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed, but they escape with the aid of explosives. The church explodes, killing Guido, the Templars and—presumably—the Grand Master. The game ends with George and Nico on their last date on the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's case {{is brought}} to trial the {{following}} morning, {{with the assistance of}} the cobbler Richard Two-Shoes (Kaye). Elizabeth's daughter Sarah (Matthews) and son-in-law Thomas Nutter (Howick) testify that they have witnessed Elizabeth sucking from the teat of a furry creature, and speaking to a mouse (believed to be a demon). Elizabeth claims that Sarah and Thomas have falsely accused her, and want to be rid of her to make room in their house. George Waterhouse (Cooper) testifies against Elizabeth, and the accused is questioned. When others in the courtroom begin laughing at her responses, Warren declares that the next person to laugh will be executed as a witch. After an argument breaks out, the witch-finders and Pike <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of the trial should be conducted in private. Elizabeth is pricked with a needle to test her for the devil's mark. A remorseful Sarah tries to profess her mother's innocence, but Warren does not believe her. Elizabeth confesses that she has been prostituting herself to Two-Shoes, who wears a fur coat, but Two-Shoes denies this, and the trial is adjourned. Throughout proceedings, Warren is accusatory while Clarke is more cautious; Pike, meanwhile, is fascinated both by the lewd acts in which Elizabeth has supposedly engaged and by the witch-finders' torturous implements.|$|E

Bennett to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coastal ferry service in B.C. needed to be government-owned, and so it set about creating BC Ferries. Minister of Highways Phil Gaglardi was tasked with overseeing the new Crown corporation and its rapid expansion.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, females {{choose not}} to {{struggle}} and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. This can happen when they <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cost of resisting would be greater {{than the cost of}} mating. They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury. This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons.|$|E

25|$|King Frotho of Denmark {{tried to}} mediate, {{but had to}} <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> matter be settled in a holmgang. During the combat Hithinus was seriously wounded, and started losing blood.

25|$|In the novel, Treebeard and the Ents and Huorns {{go to war}} {{immediately}} upon the conclusion of Entmoot.

Pippin tricks Treebeard into taking them south by Isengard where the Ent witnesses the mass clearing of trees by Saruman's forces, upon which Treebeard promptly calls the Ents and Huorns off to war.|$|E
25|$|The Valkyrie flew for {{the first}} time around June 1926 in the hands of Frank Courtney and went to Air Ministry trials in the late spring of 1927 where the overall {{assessment}} was unenthusiastic. Nonetheless, in August the Valkyrie joined a Scandinavian tour, organised by the Flying Boat Development Flight, together with Blackburn Iris, Short Singapore and Supermarine Southampton flying boats. This tour helped the Air Ministry to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> future of flying boats was with metal, rather than wooden hulls with their water absorbing properties. The sole Valkyrie was broken up in 1929.|$|E

25|$|Knox was knighted in 1921, {{the only}} Chief Justice to be knighted during his term. Some of the Knox court's early work {{related to the}} {{aftermath}} of World War I. In Roche v Kronheimer (1921), the Court upheld federal legislation which allowed for the making of regulations to implement Australia's obligations under the Treaty of Versailles. The majority decided the case on the defence power, but Higgins decided it on the external affairs power, the first case to <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> external affairs power {{could be used to}} implement an international treaty in Australia.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{advanced}} triage may become necessary when medical professionals <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> medical resources available {{are not sufficient}} to treat {{all the people who}} need help. The treatment being prioritized can include the time spent on medical care, or drugs or other limited resources. This has happened in disasters such as terrorist attacks, mass shootings, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and rail accidents. In these cases some percentage of patients will die regardless of medical care because of the severity of their injuries. Others would live if given immediate medical care, but would die without it.|$|E
25|$|Aeschylus {{continued}} {{his emphasis on}} the polis with The Suppliants in 463 BC (Hiketides), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens {{in advance of the}} establishment of a democratic government in 461. In the play, the Danaids, the fifty daughters of Danaus, founder of Argos, flee a forced marriage to their cousins in Egypt. They turn to King Pelasgus of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos weigh in on the decision, a distinctly democratic move {{on the part of the}} king. The people <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Danaids deserve protection, and they are allowed within the walls of Argos despite Egyptian protests.|$|E

50|$|On 1 July 1947 it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> medal {{would only}} be awarded in gold of the 6th size.

25|$|The Court {{operates}} in two divisions, where either three or five justices sit {{to hear a}} case before the Court. For especially important cases, the President of the Court may <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bench be constituted by seven justices. When a case is heard by five or seven justices, these shall usually be the most senior justices on the Court. The main rule is that cases are presented orally before the Supreme Court, and the court sessions are generally open to the public. The President of the Supreme Court presides over the session or, in his absence, the Vice-President. If neither of them is hearing the case, the most senior justice in session will preside.|$|E
25|$|Goldstein further {{argued that}} {{the large number of}} pro-criminal-defendant summary {{dismissals}} (usually cases where the justices <b>decide</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument) were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological. Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.|$|E
25|$|The four Clans of warrior cats, ThunderClan, ShadowClan, RiverClan and WindClan, {{discover}} a lake {{which serves as}} their new home, replacing their old home which is destroyed by humans.

During a meeting, Firestar, leader of ThunderClan, calls up Squirrelpaw, his daughter who is an apprentice, and promotes her to the status of warrior, giving her the warrior name Squirrelflight. The next day, the leaders call upon the four remaining cats that go on the journey to the sun-drown-place in Midnight, Brambleclaw, Squirrelflight, Crowfeather, and Tawnypelt, as well as Mistyfoot of RiverClan to explore around the lake and find camps for each Clan.|$|E
