2500|$|Despite the provisions, {{control and}} {{regulations}} of Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India {{had continued to}} be {{owned and operated by}} private persons. Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies, and ignoring the priority sector. Furthermore, there was a great resentment against class banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority population) unbanked. After becoming Prime Minister, Gandhi expressed the intention of nationalising the banks in a paper titled, [...] "Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation" [...] in order to alleviate poverty. The paper received the overwhelming support of the public. In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks. After the nationalisation of banks, the branches of the public sector banks in India rose to approximate 800 percent in deposits, and advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent. Nationalisation also resulted in a significant growth in the geographical coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in the unbanked, rural areas. The nationalization drive not only helped to increase <b>household</b> <b>savings,</b> but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India's industrial and agricultural base. Jayaprakash Narayan, who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, was solid in his praise for her bank nationalisations.|$|E

Our results show that the average of the Chinese <b>household</b> <b>saving</b> rate during the 1992 – 2004 period falls from 29. 4 to 22. 9 percent, and is lower than 20 percent in 2000, 2001, and 2003.

40|$|The {{recession}} {{following the}} 2008 Global Financial Crisis highlighted {{the problem of}} deficient <b>household</b> <b>saving</b> and imprudent consumer credit. Studies of selected economies reveal that <b>household</b> <b>saving</b> tends to decline as economies move to higher stages of development. Following rapid economic growth, China’s <b>household</b> <b>saving,</b> possibly due {{to the influence of}} traditional culture, has remained high by international standards while consumer credit levels are low. This significant phenomenon has prompted the question of what this development trajectory may become as China proceeds to higher income levels. Whereas the economic, social and financial development factors related to <b>household</b> <b>saving</b> and development have been well researched, from the perspective of this investigation, there are missing ‘cultural values’ in the analysis. Consequently, the Institutional Economics concept of ‘culture as a value’ provides the basis for this thesis into the influence of culture on China’s <b>household</b> <b>saving</b> and its effects. By extending Keynes’s General Theory in relation to saving, and incorporating studies from both the Chinese and Western scholarly traditions, five themes are identified as influencing the cultural preferences of China’s <b>household</b> <b>saving.</b> These are: (i) precautionary motives; (ii) habit formation; (iii) children’s education; (iv) consumer credit; and (v) teaching thrift. The holistic approach of this study has allowed {{a deeper understanding of the}} role of cultural values on agency and structure in economic events and their subsequent impact on <b>household</b> <b>saving.</b> Results of this investigation indicate that the Confucian value of family ties and ‘Zhong Yong’ – the Golden Mean, which translates essentially as balance, enable Chinese households to save. This development has highlighted a growing tension, in China’s modernity process, between the traditional Confucian value of thrift and the Western cultural influence of stimulating economic growth by consumption. After consideration of current saving practices and the anticipation of economic changes, this research advocates the striking of a balance between <b>household</b> <b>saving</b> and increasing consumption in China in order to avert a future financial crisis and to facilitate economic growth.

The ratio differs considerably over time and between countries.
