5000|$|Several items {{belonging}} to Hribal were seized from his home, including a notebook with writing {{in it and}} a <b>knife</b> <b>holder</b> assumed to have held the two knives used in the attack. A cellphone was also seized from Hribal's school locker, as was a note dated April 6, which read, [...] "I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks {{on the faces of}} the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that isn't a plebian [...]" ...|$|E
5000|$|At Fort Washington High, Sarah (Mireille Enos) discovers a {{peephole}} in The Cage. Principal Meyers (Kerry Sandomirsky) unlocks a room adjoining The Cage {{to which}} only she and school janitor Lyndon Johnson Rosales have a key. The peephole provides {{a clear view}} of The Cage. Later, Oakes (Garry Chalk) asks Sarah to remain on the job {{through the end of the}} week because he feels that Holder isn't currently capable of controlling the case. Holder (Joel Kinnaman) boasts to Sarah about finding the crime scene. She dismisses it as an assumption and orders him to stop intimidating suspects. In Rosales’ apartment, Holder distracts the mother while Sarah explores. When she notices a teen-themed porn magazine on the floor, Rosales (VJ Delos Reyes) comes up behind her and slashes her arm with a <b>knife.</b> <b>Holder</b> rushes him, with gun drawn, while Sarah pleads with Rosales that they just want to talk to him. He jumps out the window. At the hospital, Rosales is diagnosed with a skull fracture and rushed into surgery. While a medic stitches and bandages Sarah’s arm, Holder lists the suspect’s priors: indecent exposure and [...] "kid diddlin'." [...] He also notes that this suspect has an alibi: picked up for a DUI, he spent Friday night in the drunk tank. In his hospital room, Sarah questions Rosales. He confirms seeing Rosie, but not Jasper, at the Halloween dance. Pointing to a yearbook photo of Kris Echols, Rosales whispers, [...] "El diablo (Spanish for 'the devil')." ...|$|E

60|$|Hugh and Dick knew no Italian, {{yet they}} {{both of them}} understood, and with a shout leaped forward toward those hungry <b>knives.</b> But their <b>holders</b> never waited for them. Some sudden panic seized them all, so that they turned and ran--ran {{straight}} across the wide Place of Arms and vanished into the network of narrow streets by which it was surrounded.|$|R
50|$|Today, the {{majority}} of microtomes are a knife-block design with a changeable <b>knife,</b> a specimen <b>holder</b> and an advancement mechanism. In most devices the cutting of the sample begins by moving the sample over the knife, where the advancement mechanism automatically moves forward such that the next cut for a chosen thickness can be made. The section thickness is controlled by an adjustment mechanism, allowing for precise control.|$|R
50|$|In the XVI—XIX centuries {{the best}} {{furniture}} {{was made of}} Ceylon ebony. The wood was preferred for making door and window handles, table-ware shanks, while the cutting was used for knitting needles and hooks or razor handles making. Today the wood is perfectly used in handmade artwork and for producing some parts of musical instruments (for example, grand piano keys, necks, string holders and tripods for instruments), turnery (including chess pieces), <b>knife</b> hafts, brush <b>holders</b> and chopsticks. Also {{it is good for}} mosaic wooden inlay.|$|R

Based on the evaluation of the operating conditions of the machine, examination of the condition of the <b>knife</b> <b>holder</b> after the failure, analysis of the fractured surface, as well as the material properties of the examined structural elements, it was possible to draw conclusions as to the reasons of eventual failures...|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} section-mounting {{stage and}} miniature hot plate {{has been made}} to be used with the Huxley ultramicrotome. It facilitates precision in the handling of 0 - 2 to 2 fj, sections during mounting and staining for light microscopy. Both processes can be carried out under continuous binocular magnification. The advance mechanism of the microtome has been fitted with a simple bell circuit to give an audible signal {{at the beginning and end}} of the full travel of the mechanical advance. This signal may be calibrated by readings on the vernier advance of the <b>knife</b> <b>holder,</b> for re-setting the microtome on a given block face. During prolonged bouts of sectioning the audible signal is a useful warning of full extension of the advance mechanism...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{device for}} the {{controlled}} trimming of plastic specimen blocks for light and electron microscopy is described. Many advantages of previously reported instruments together with 1) a {{rack and pinion}} control of knife movement, and 2) a control of rotation of the specimen block at 90 0, 1800, 2700, or 3600 are incorporated. In conjunction with an ocular micrometer, the device allows accurate removal of thin slices during trimming. Several devices and techniques have been described which aid in the trimming of plastic embedded specimen blocks to form "pyramids " (= truncated pyramids) before they are mounted into the microtome (Boyde 1960, Butler 1974, Danon 1961, Guglielmotti 1976, Schneider and Sasaki 1976, Sjostrand 1967). Gorycki (1978) described a "rectangular trimming block " which, {{in conjunction with a}} small mirror mounted on the <b>knife</b> <b>holder</b> of the ultramicrotome, squarely re-trimmed the block face of a preformed truncated pyramid. Similarly, Sjostrand's device (Sjostrand 1967) is a trimming aid intended only for the final trimming and retrimming of tissue blocks. Using such instruments, block faces with parallel edge alignment can be, with an experienced hand, precisely produced...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is related}} to the {{decision}} of the real engineering task – calculation and constructing of stand for tests on the shock loading <b>holder</b> of <b>knife</b> and bolzen (pin) of industrial mower, producible the machine-building enterprise of “Cigler”. It is set that during exploitation of mowers on the elements of cutting part <b>holder</b> <b>knife</b> and bolzen (pin), loadings of shocks, resulting in their destruction operate.
