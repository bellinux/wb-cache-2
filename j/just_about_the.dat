5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E

Basques and American natives of the Labrador-Saint Lawrence area developed a simplified language for the mutual understanding, but it shows a strong Mi'kmaq imprint.|$|E

This firebox construction was not dissimilar to some types of vertical boiler, but this was only part of Ericsson’s design.|$|E

25|$|Pierson & Dorman Long {{wanted to}} build a {{steelworks}} at Richborough Port, with new towns to house the workers at Woodnesborough and Ash and using coal from its colliery at Betteshanger. It regarded the EKLR as a nuisance, and never encouraged it. However, the EKLR did ship coal for export from Snowdown from 1929 to the mid thirties, and pit props in the other direction. All plans were abandoned at the Depression. A main line link for coal traffic was actually authorised for Dover Eastern Harbour via a tunnel under the castle in 1933, <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time when it was finally realized that the Kent coalfield was a commercial failure.|$|E
25|$|Simplicity to Friends has {{generally}} been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to {{what they need to}} live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nature of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.|$|E
25|$|In Latin and Greek, the Christian celebration was, {{and still}} is, called Pascha (Greek: Πάσχα), a word derived from Aramaic פסחא (Paskha), cognate to Hebrew פֶּסַח (Pesach). The word {{originally}} denoted the Jewish festival known in English as Passover, commemorating the Jewish Exodus from slavery in Egypt. As {{early as the}} 50s of the 1st century, Paul, writing from Ephesus to the Christians in Corinth, applied the term to Christ, and {{it is unlikely that}} the Ephesian and Corinthian Christians were the first to hear Exodus 12 interpreted as speaking about the death of Jesus, not <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Passover ritual. In most of the non-English speaking world, the feast is known by names derived from Greek and Latin Pascha. Pascha is also a name by which Jesus himself is remembered in the Orthodox Church, especially in connection with his resurrection and with the season of its celebration.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{two hours}} elapsed {{between the time}} the ships got under way until the opening shots were fired. In that time, they found that New Ironsides had severe {{handling}} problems in the strong current and shallow water. She was forced to stop and anchor to avoid going aground, <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time that the lead monitors were coming under fire. She {{dropped out of the}} line, and the four ships following her passed around, with some difficulty. The waiting Rebels could not have chosen a better place for New Ironsides to anchor, as she was directly over a 3000-pound (1360kg) electrically-triggered torpedo that would be activated by closing a switch on shore. Their high hopes were dashed, however, when the switch was closed and nothing happened. Two explanations for the failure have been offered. According to the one, an ordnance wagon had broken the wires by being driven over them. The other holds that the wires were simply too long, so the electric current would not be great enough to create a spark and detonate the charge.|$|E
500|$|Earache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, {{saying that}} Napalm Death [...] "put {{hardcore}} and metal through an accelerator." [...] Pearson, however, said that grindcore [...] "wasn't <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> speed of [...] drums, blast beats, etc." [...] He claimed that [...] "it actually was coined {{to describe the}} guitars - heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [...] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [...] proponents." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> singer. It's not <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> band." ...|$|E
