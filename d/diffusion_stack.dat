To this purpose, a geometric model, based on a random distribution of noninterpenetrating stacks, with each one being made of regularly spaced lamellae, was developed. The developed model is able to account for <b>diffusion</b> between <b>stacks</b> (interstack <b>diffusion)</b> as well as <b>diffusion</b> inside <b>stacks</b> (intrastack <b>diffusion).</b> Simulation results showed that intrastack diffusion, related to flow inside galleries, can be quite relevant, particularly at high values of gallery thickness. Comparison of the simulation results with literature models shows that when intrastack diffusion is not taken into account, the diffusion behavior in intercalated nanocomposites is not well predicted. Therefore, intrastack permeability of nanofillers such as organic modified clays cannot be neglected. Such intrastack diffusivity is shown to depend on the morphological features of the nanofiller requiring the development of a proper mathematical model...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of phosphorus into epitaxial silicon {{has been investigated}} by evaluating the electrical and structural characteristics of the epitaxial diffused guard-r ing junctions. The effects of stacking faults in epitaxial silicon on the junction characteristics were found {{to depend on the}} surface condition of the epitaxial layer before diffusion. Localized breakdown, as evidenced by light emission, was observed at the stacking fault grooves only when the epitaxial layer was etched before <b>diffusion.</b> <b>Stacking</b> faults were also found to be trans-formed into other defects after diffusion; chemical etching of the epitaxial layer also had a great influence on this transformation. Dislocations were observed in the phosphorus-diffused r gions.

To evaluate the performance of the segmentation processes studied in this paper, we introduce an objective measure to assess the quality of a segmentation when the ground truth segmentation is known.

All-carbon supercapacitor electrodes are made by solution processing and filtering electrochemically-exfoliated graphene sheets mixed with clusters of spontaneously entangled multiwall carbon nanotubes. We maximize the capacitance by using a 1 : 1 weight ratio of graphene to multi-wall carbon nanotubes and by controlling their packing in the electrode film so as to maximize accessible surface and further enhance the charge collection. This electrode is transferred onto a plastic-paper-supported double-wall carbon nanotube film used as current collector. These all-carbon thin films are combined with plastic paper and gelled electrolyte to produce solid-state bendable thin film supercapacitors. We assembled supercapacitor cells in series in a planar configuration to increase the operating voltage and find that the shape of our supercapacitor film strongly affects its capacitance. An in-line superposition of rectangular sheets is superior to a cross superposition in maintaining high capacitance when subject to fast charge/discharge cycles. The effect is explained by addressing the mechanism of ion <b>diffusion</b> into <b>stacked</b> graphene sheets...|$|R

A protective coating consisting of a SiO x (250 nm) /SiN y (250 nm) stack deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) was used. The stability of the contact metallizations during long-term thermal treatments in air and air/moisture was studied. The best performance was achieved with Ti ohmic contacts without the Ti/TaSi x /Pt stack. This system successfully withstood 1000 h thermal treatment at 500 °C in air followed by 1000 h at 500 °C in air/ 10 % moisture. After the aging, the contact failure ratio was below 1 % and the specific contact resistivity amounted to (2. 5 ± 1. 1) × 10 - 4 cm 2.

40|$|A {{more general}} form of {{proportional}} {{model has been}} derived from the steady-state dispersion equation. Since the model {{is based on the}} diffusion model, it can take into account <b>diffusion</b> effects of <b>stack</b> height and spatial distribution of sources. The model, however, does not require so much input data and complex computations as does a diffusion model. In addition to the good features of a proportional model, namely, minimum input requirement and ease of handling, the model explicitly interrelates percentages and amounts of emission reduction with the resulting improvement in air quality. It is applicable for multicategory emission-source situations (for example industrial - residential emission sources) as well as for single-category emission situations (for example automotive emission sources). In the process of model formulation a number of new parameters such as growth factors and relative transfer coefficients are introduced and values of some of these parameters are determined. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate computational procedures and indicate uses of the model in air pollution abatement. ...|$|R

In the present study, the chemical reaction equation is analytically solved, and using the result, the oxidation stacking fault radius (r) is analytically expressed against the oxidation time (t). Comparing the obtained relation of r=r(t) with the experimental results of the stacking faults, the analytical expression of ω is determined and the physical meaning of ω is clarified.

40|$|The {{life-time}} of {{fuel cells}} {{is one of}} the main barriers for using fuel cells as electric power generators or sources in mass market products. Therefore, in the last years the research activit to investigate the degradation processes and mechanisms of fuel cells has intensified significantly. Consequently, many degradation processes in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEFC) have been identified and some of the degradation mechanisms are understood quantitatively. However, still not all significant degradation mechanisms are understood sufficiently and the relation of the degradation rates and the accelerating operating conditions are unclear for most degradation processes. For many degradation processes the water management, especially a liquid water phase inside the cell is a crucial factor for the degradatio processes. In addition, the water management will also be changed by the degradation processes. Consequently, these complex interactions have to be investigated in detail. In this context the European Commission is funding the DECODE project. The main topic is the investigation of the complex interactions of water balance and degradation processes.

40|$|Black silicon (b-Si) is a {{promising}} surface structure for solar cells {{due to its}} low reflectance and excellent light trapping properties. While atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al 2 O 3 {{has been shown to}} passivate efficiently lightly-doped b-Si surfaces and boron emitters, the negative fixed charge characteristic of Al 2 O 3 thin films makes it unfavorable for the passivation of more commonly used n+ emitters. This work studies the potential of ALD SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 stacks for the passivation of b-Si phosphorus emitters fabricated by an industrially viable POCl 3 gas phase <b>diffusion</b> process. The <b>stacks</b> have positive charge density (Qtot = 5. 5 · 1011 cm- 2) combined with high quality interface (Dit = 2. 0 · 1011 cm- 2 eV- 1) which is favorable for such heavily-doped n-type surfaces. Indeed, a clear improvement in emitter saturation current density, J 0 e, is achieved with the stacks compared to bare Al 2 O 3 in both b-Si and planar emitters. However, although the positive charge density in the case of black silicon is even higher (Qtot = 2. 0 · 1012 cm- 2), the measured J 0 e is limited by the recombination in the emitter due to heavy doping of the nanostructures. The results thus imply that in order to obtain lower saturation current density on b-Si, careful optimization of the black silicon emitter profile is needed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Dicumarol (3, 3 '-methylenebis[4 -hydroxycoumarin]) is an {{inhibitor}} of brefeldin-A-dependent ADP-ribosylation that antagonises brefeldin-A-dependent Golgi tubulation and redistribution to the endoplasmic reticulum. We {{have investigated}} whether dicumarol can directly affect the morphology of the Golgi apparatus. Here {{we show that}} dicumarol induces {{the breakdown of the}} tubular reticular networks that interconnect adjacent Golgi stacks and that contain either soluble or membrane-associated cargo proteins. This results in the formation of 65 - 120 -nm vesicles that are sometimes invaginated. In contrast, smaller vesicles (45 - 65 nm in diameter, a size consistent with that of coat-protein-I-dependent vesicles) that excluded cargo proteins from their lumen are not affected by dicumarol. All other endomembranes are largely unaffected by dicumarol, including Golgi stacks, the ER, multivesicular bodies and the trans-Golgi network. In permeabilized cells, dicumarol activity depends on the function of CtBP 3 /BARS protein and pre-ADP-ribosylation of cytosol inhibits the breakdown of Golgi tubules by dicumarol. In functional experiments, dicumarol markedly slows down intra-Golgi traffic of VSV-G transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi, and inhibits the diffusional mobility of both galactosyl transferase and VSV-G tagged with green fluorescent protein. However, it does not affect: transport from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface; Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum traffic of ERGIC 58; coat-protein-I-dependent Golgi vesiculation by AlF 4 or ADP-ribosylation factor; or ADP-ribosylation factor and beta-coat protein binding to Golgi membranes. Thus the ADP-ribosylation inhibitor dicumarol induces the selective breakdown of the tubular components of the Golgi complex and inhibition of intra-Golgi transport. This suggests that lateral <b>diffusion</b> between adjacent <b>stacks</b> has a role in protein transport through the Golgi complex...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{histology}} is {{the gold}} standard for tissue studies, but it is intrinsically reliant on two-dimensional (2 D) images. Study of volumetric tissue samples such as whole hearts produces a stack of misaligned and distorted 2 D images that need to be reconstructed to recover a congruent volume with the original sample's shape. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework called Transformation <b>Diffusion</b> (TD) for <b>stack</b> alignment refinement as a solution to the heat diffusion equation. This general framework does not require contour segmentation, is independent of the registration method used, and is trivially parallelizable. After the first stack sweep, we also replace registration operations by operations in the space of transformations, several orders of magnitude faster and less memory-consuming. Implementing TD with operations in the space of transformations produces our Transformation Diffusion Reconstruction (TDR) algorithm, applicable to general transformations that are closed under inversion and composition. In particular, we provide formulas for translation and affine transformations. We also propose an Approximated TDR (ATDR) algorithm that extends the same principles to tensor-product B-spline transformations. Using TDR and ATDR, we reconstruct a full mouse heart at pixel size 0. 92 µm × 0. 92 µm, cut 10 µm thick, spaced 20 µm (84 G). Our algorithms employ only local information from transformations between neighboring slices, but the TD framework allows theoretical analysis of the refinement as applying a global Gaussian low-pass filter to the unknown stack misalignments. We also show that reconstruction without an external reference produces large shape artifacts in a cardiac specimen while still optimizing slice-to-slice alignment. To overcome this problem, we use a pre-cutting blockface imaging process previously developed by our group that takes advantage of Brewster's angle and a polarizer to capture the outline of only the topmost layer of wax in the block containing embedded tissue for histological sectioning...|$|R
