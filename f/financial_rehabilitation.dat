40|$|PURPOSE: Knowledge on {{the meaning}} of quality of life in {{individuals}} with spinal cord injury in developing countries is limited. This study aims to explore the meaning and components of quality of life for individuals with spinal cord injury in a rural area in Indonesia. METHOD: Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 12 individuals with paraplegia (8 males, 4 females) aged 24 - 67 [*]years. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes that constitute meaning and components of quality of life. RESULTS: Quality of life was not an easily understood concept, while "life satisfaction" and "happiness" were. Life satisfaction was associated with a person's feeling when achieving goals or dreams and related to fulfillment of needs. Thirteen components of life satisfaction were identified and categorized into five domains as follows: (1) participation: earning income and work, being useful to others, community participation, and having skills and knowledge, (2) social support: social support, social relationship, (3) relationship with God: injury is God's will, praying, (4) independence: being independent, mobility and accessibility, and health, and (5) psychological resources: accepting the condition, maintaining goals and motivation. CONCLUSIONS: Social, cultural and religious influences were prominent in the perception of life satisfaction. The measurement of quality of life for individuals with spinal cord injury in Indonesia needs to consider locally perceived meaning and components of quality of life. Implications for <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Financial,</b> social and health needs of individuals with spinal cord injury in Indonesia must be immediately addressed. To increase <b>financial</b> independence, <b>rehabilitation</b> professionals should equip individuals with spinal cord injury with adequate self-employment skills.

40|$|The {{worst of}} the global {{financial}} crisis is behind us, but the trajectory to recovery varies widely across economies. Employing a dynamic structural multi-country model with a financial accelerator, this paper studies the roles of two important policy actions in economic recovery: fiscal stimulus and financial sector rehabilitation. The main finding is that while both factors contribute to economic recovery, the former {{is likely to be}} less effective from a medium-term perspective and may generate some negative side effects. This suggests that policy priority should be on continued financial sector rehabilitation, particularly in advanced economies. Moreover, international policy co-ordination is beneficial as it can generate spill-over effects to regional economies. We also study a potential risk to economic recovery down the road: an over-estimation of the post-crisis potential output by the monetary authorities in advanced economies. It is found that this may lead to an overly accommodative monetary policy stance, which could lead to a resurgence in inflation and hence will darken the medium-term growth prospects of the world economy.

40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} factor in seismic rehabilitation planning for infrastructure assets. An inventory of structures is screened to identify seismically susceptible parts and prioritize them in the order of need for rehabilitation purposes. In most cases, the <b>financial</b> resources for <b>rehabilitation</b> of infrastructure assets are limited. Therefore, there is a need to efficiently allocate such resources to various projects. The main goal of this research is to develop a budget allocation management model for rehabilitation of infrastructure projects, when there isn’t sufficient budget to allocate to all projects. Accordingly, a decision support system is developed and exercised in this research to optimize the budget for rehabilitation projects in three categories of road structures. To accomplish this, a computer-based Multiple Strategy Budget Allocation decision support System (MSBAS©) was developed to identify (including selection and prioritization) the best configuration (package) of seismic rehabilitation projects across existing structures. This system employs a multi-criteria assessment module that takes into account desirable criteria to estimate the <b>financial</b> needs for <b>rehabilitation</b> based on the existing budget constraints in a fiscal year. To select the optimal package of projects, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization module is also developed. Multi-objective decision making is conducted under a specific decision strategy with solving a 0 - 1 Knapsack Problem. To demonstrate the applicability of the GA-based approach, a hypothetical decision making problem is presented. Using this system, managers can compare their decisions for different strategies and significantly improve management efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Anastasius' long rule at {{the turn}} of the sixth century has tended to be neglected, yet it was a {{critical}} time in the history of the Later Roman Empire. On his accession, there were many problems facing the state: conflicts, both internal and external, religious disputes, and financial and administrative chaos. It is the aim of this thesis to assess the significance of Anastasius' reign, with a systematic survey of the key areas of imperial government. After an introductory chapter examining the primary sources, the second and third chapters consider revolts and wars. Chapter Two looks at two internal uprisings, that of the Isaurians (491 - 498) and that of Vitalian (514 - 516). The third chapter concentrates on external conflicts and political relations. The first section considers the Persian offensive (502 - 506) and the role of the Arabs, while the second part examines the ambiguous position of Theoderic in Italy, and explores how Anastasius sought to stabilize the balance of power with counter-alliances with the Franks and Burgundians. Chapter Four deals with the doctrinal schism dividing the orthodox from the monophysite. It outlines the background to this crisis and investigates the vicissitudes of Anastasius' policy as he sought to reconcile increasing eastern monophysitism with the west's intransigent orthodoxy. Chapter Five examines Anastasius' <b>financial</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> of the state and concludes that his success lay in a much wider reorganisation of the empire's resources: he restructured the fisc and introduced changes to municipal administration, agrarian legislation and the organisation of the army. This chapter also considers measures to halt the escalating violence of the faction riots, and it closes with a survey of the emperor's building policy. The thesis concludes that Anastasius' reign resolved many of the problems facing the empire in the fifth century, paving the way for Justinian in the sixth. </p...|$|E

Regarding this, if adolescences with thalassemia {{are treated}} well, they will grow into an adult {{who will have}} a good potential for participating in society. Objectives: to determine the strongest predictor of QOL, compare QOL between the adolescents with beta-type major and their peers in Abadan city. Materials and Methods This was a cross-sectional study; the population consisted of 65 beta thalassemia major patients and 65  healthy peers with the same ages as the witness group. The data collection tools included SF- 36 questionnaire and a questionnaire for demographic information.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to learn and {{understand}} what significant events; positive and negative ex-prisoners encountered during their transition processes into society. Main areas of interest, however, were to explore the influence of formal institutions and informal social networks and support to ex-prisoners who are returning back into society after accomplished their sentences in prisons. Further, was to understand what obstacles they face during the process. The researcher has used qualitative method to study and understand the nature of the problem. Besides, semi-structured interviews were main tools used to collect data from seven ex-prisoners who interviewed separately. Symbolic interactionism, ecological and social psychological perspectives were used to analyze interviews data. The results obtained shown that both formal institutions and informal social networks had influenced ex-prisoners in various ways and its effects differ. While formal institutions helped ex-prisoners accession to various social assistances like <b>financial,</b> accommodations, <b>rehabilitations,</b> and smooth re-adjustments into community, informal social networks (families, peers, relatives or neighbors) had dual impacts; in one hand had provided social supports like, emotional, psychological, counseling, advice and material supports which facilitated ex-prisoners start new life easier. On the other hand, had negatively influenced some participants by denied those assistances due to their criminality behaviors they maintained. This situation has cause more serious problems to ex-prisoners themselves and to the general public, because ex-prisoners had relapsed into their former criminal careers. The study had revealed that the formation of former criminals and drug addicts networks (KRIS) has lead ex-prisoners to have their own life style which is slightly different to ordinary people in society. The network or self-help organization has various programmes for serving inmates in prisons and ex-prisoners to overcoming various difficulties in their processes to re-integrate into society. However, it has been learnt that, due to its efficiency in provision of important and timed social assistances that associated with caring and giving hope to its clients, has attracted more newly released prisoners who seek change and rehabilitation. Moreover, in their transition processes, ex-prisoners have faced varieties of obstacles that originated from ineffective pre-released plan in correctional institutions as well as post-release interventions in various social agencies that deal with prisoners and ex-prisoners matters. Prisoners when leaving correctional facilities have limited human capital that prevent them accession to different opportunities available in society.
