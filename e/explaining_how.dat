Raskolnikov arouses Zamyotov's suspicions by <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> he, Raskolnikov, would have {{committed}} various crimes, although Zamyotov later apologizes, believing, much to Raskolnikov's amusement, that it was all a farce to expose how ridiculous the suspicions were.|$|E
5|$|At the {{survivors}}' camp, Jim (Andrew Rothenberg) begins digging holes, {{refusing to}} explain why. As the survivors press him, he lashes back at them, forcing Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) to restrain Jim. Jim breaks down, <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> {{he lost his}} family to walkers, and that a dream inspired him to dig the holes. Jim warns Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) to keep her son Carl (Chandler Riggs) safe.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, DisneyToon Studios began {{development}} on a computer-animated prequel to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, titled The Seven Dwarfs. Director Mike Disa and screenwriter Evan Spiliotopoulos pitched a story <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> the Dwarfs met, {{and how the}} Evil Queen killed Snow White's father and took the throne. According to Disa, DisneyToon management changed the prequel to center around how Dopey lost his voice upon witnessing {{the death of his}} mother. After Disney purchased Pixar in 2006, John Lasseter, DisneyToons' new Chief Creative Officer, canceled Dwarfs.|$|E

5|$|John Edward Brownlee {{served as}} Attorney-General of the {{province}} of Alberta in western Canada from 1921 until 1926, in the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) government of Herbert Greenfield. As Brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed almost entirely of farmers, his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorney-general, and ranged from providing legal advice to <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> to write a business letter; he also became the government's de facto leader in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta.|$|E

During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> the Heimlich maneuver works is {{on the wall behind}} him. In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E

At this point the screen fades and the mission is declared a success; it is presumed that the Nihilanth warps them back to Xen and installs the crystals in his cave.|$|E
5|$|There were minor {{differences}} between the original text and the version published by Princeton. In the Princeton publication, first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations. In response to public concerns about radioactivity, Groves had text added to paragraph 12.18 <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> {{the height of the}} explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up into the upper atmosphere. He also had a one-sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in the production reactors redacted. This deletion was soon noticed by the Russian translators, and only served to highlight its importance to the Soviet atomic bomb project.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E

Nestorian Christianity had existed in China earlier during the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) when a Persian monk named Alopen (Chinese: Āluósī; 阿羅本; 阿羅斯) came to the capital Chang'an in 653 to proselytize, as described in a dual Chinese and Syriac language inscription from Chang'an (modern Xi'an) dated to the year 781.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|The book {{contains}} an evenly distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies, including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only {{the most remarkable}} discoveries of animals and plants are described, and theories such as evolution and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper, Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.|$|E
