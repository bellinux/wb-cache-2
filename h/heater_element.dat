40|$|The {{development}} of fiber metal laminates to multi-functional materials by embedding <b>heater</b> <b>elements</b> in the laminate extends their field of application. Fiber metal laminates with embedded <b>heater</b> <b>elements</b> {{are likely to}} be used for the de- and anti-icing of leading edges in aircraft as they combine structural and heating functions. Hence, those heated fiber metal laminates are exposed to frequent temperature changes when the de- or anti-icing devices are switched on. In order to examine the possible effects of thermal fatigue loading on the material characteristics, a thermal cycling setup was developed. The experimental setup has the ability to perform thermal cycling tests of materials with and without embedded <b>heater</b> <b>elements.</b> For structural materials, the thermal cycling setup provides external cooling and external heating using Peltier elements. For multi-functional materials (materials with embedded <b>heater</b> <b>elements),</b> the experimental setup enables thermal cycling tests by providing external cooling using Peltier elements and internal heating using the embedded heater mesh. The multi-functional material which is thermal cycled in this study is heated GLARE (Glass Laminate Aluminum Reinforced Epoxy). The temperatures recorded by thermo couples at different specimen positions are presented. The thermal cycle times were about 62 s for temperature cycles from 0 °C to 60 °C and 2 mm thick heated GLARE specimens. Similar thermal cycling times can be reached for both external cooling and heating and external cooling and internal heating. However, the use of Peltier elements to heat the specimens outer surfaces (external heating) leads to more homogeneous temperature distributions than when using the embedded <b>heater</b> <b>elements</b> as internal heating. The presented experimental setup can be adapted to different specimen dimensions, enables thermal cycling of multiple specimens of the same material, and is applicable for different temperature ranges and heating or cooling rates.

40|$|We {{present the}} design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of a mechanically flexible diaphragm-based microvalve actuator employing {{a reservoir of}} the thermally responsive hydrogel PNIPAAm and a conductive nanocomposite polymer (C-NCP) <b>heater</b> <b>element.</b> The microvalve actuator can be fabricated employing traditional soft lithography processes for fabrication of all components, including the tungsten-based C-NCP <b>heater</b> <b>element,</b> the hydrogel reservoir, and the deflecting polymer membrane. Shrinking of the hydrogel under the application of heat supplied by the flexible heater, or the removal of this thermal energy by turning off the heater, forces the diaphragm to move.

40|$|The {{control of}} the {{transition}} from laminar to turbulent flow in a boundary layer of a flat plate is investigated using numerical simulations. The numerical model {{is based on the}} incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which is coupled with the energy equation through the temperature dependent viscosity. A fully implicit finite difference spectral method was used to solve the governing equations. The numerical model allows for the spatial evolution of the disturbances in a non-parallel boundary layer. Active control of wave packet disturbances in the non-isothermal boundary layer is studied in detail. Wave packet disturbances are created in the flow field by simulating the effect of thermally activated <b>heater</b> <b>elements</b> on the plate surface. Through a controlled spanwise variation of the temperature of the <b>heater</b> <b>elements,</b> two- and three-dimensional wave packet disturbances can be studied. The propagation and amplification of the wave packet disturbances in the boundary layer is examined. The <b>heater</b> <b>elements</b> on the plate surface act as locally strong heat sources causing thermal wakes within the boundary layer that spread in the downstream direction. A transfer function technique is used for the control strategy. The transfer function is based on the vorticity response to a finite temperature fluctuation at the heater strip and is obtained from the numerical simulations. With additional heater segments (controller) located downstream of an excitation source, the possibility of attenuating wave packet disturbances is investigated. With the numerical transfer function, a successful control strategy for the wave packet cancellation could be developed. Initially, for the low amplitude, two-dimensional disturbances in the transition process with the implemented control strategy the wave packet disturbances could be almost completely cancelled. For the attentuation of three-dimensional wave packet disturbances, the transfer function technique was extended to allow for spanwise variations. The attenuation of three-dimensional wave packets with the modified transfer function technique was almost equally as successful as for the purely two-dimensional flow disturbances. For the simulation of the three-dimensional flow development with no control applied, nonlinear interaction of wave components of the wave packet first appeared for the oblique modes in the low frequency range, which was also observed in experimental investigations. The attenuation of only the two-dimensional components of a three-dimensional wave packet disturbance delays the onset of the nonlinear interaction of the oblique spanwise modes in the lower frequency range...|$|R
