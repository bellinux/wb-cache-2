40|$|How the {{conservation}} of charge {{can lead to a}} faster-than-c effect: A simple example White Paper of December 3, 2010 by R. Y. Chiao Within the general relativity community, there is still much doubt that any non-trivial faster-than-light effects can ever occur. In particular, it is widely believed that superluminal mass currents cannot exist in Nature. However, there now exists a substantial amount of experimental evidence that superlu-minal group velocities do indeed exist in Nature. For example, the tunneling of quantum particles, including photons, through a classically forbidden barrier has been shown to occur at speeds that exceed c [1]. Thus quantum currents have been demonstrated to become superluminal under certain circumstances, in the sense that, within quantum matter, these currents have been shown to transport particles faster than c. Superluminal quantum mass currents can therefore exist within matter, {{and there has been a}} recent theoretical paper “Faster than light? ” by Geroch [2], which suggests that the community should take a serious look at the possibility of superlu-minal effects which can occur in standard general relativity, and yet they do not violate causality. Recently, it has also been suggested that superluminal mass currents within quantum matter may imply the possibility of the genera-tion and reflection of gravitational waves quantum mechanically that would be impossible classically [3]. The purpose of this White Paper is to give a simple example of how {{the conservation}} of charge can lead to superluminal effects. Let us start from the continuity equation ∇ · J+ ∂ρ ∂t = 0 (1) where J is the electrical current density, and ρ is the electrical charge density in an ordinary conducting body, such as a copper sphere. Consider the simple thought experiment illustrated in Figure 1. A pulsed electron beam enters through a long, hollow copper tube, which is grounded near its entrance so that it forms a Faraday cage that shields the electrons inside the tube [4]. This tube is inserted into a hole which is drilled into a solid copper sphere in such a way that the hole stops just before it reaches the center of the sphere at point A. Moreover, the tube forms a tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>sleeve</b> within the copper sphere, and therefore makes an intimate electrical contact with the walls of the drilled hole within the sphere. 1 a...|$|E

This style of linen Polonaise can be looped up and worn over a {{corresponding}} linen skirt also. ... Overskirts to the dress, or the Polonaise skirt, must be very long and only looped up at the sides....Cretonne costumes are the novelty of the season: they were introduced last year at French watering places, and a few have been imported here this season. They are intended for country wear only, and are made of the chintz figured cretonnes used for upholstering furniture; the grounds are black, brown, green, blue, buff, with large brilliant colored flowers and figures. They are made with a ruffled skirt and Polonaise, caught up by large bows of black velvet. These costumes certainly carry us {{back to the days of}} our grandmothers, and will, we fear, meet with but little favor for a season; but if fashion decrees, there will always be some to follow her mandate.|$|R

The dress fabric is called abu hizz ahmar (black cotton ground with purple, orange and green stipes of cotton and silk), from Majdal. The only embroidery on the front is below the neck opening. The back panel has three horizontal bands of embroidery, and a local version of the khem-el-basha ("the pashas tent") motif along the hem.|$|R

Instead, pipe and fittings with plain (non-belled) connections are butted against each other, and clamped with special rubber sleeve (or [...] "no-hub") <b>fittings.</b> The rubber <b>sleeves</b> are jacketed with stainless steel clamps, which compress the rubber to make a tight seal around the pipes and fittings. Although the materials are not cheap, they are durable (the rubber is typically neoprene or PVC).|$|R
40|$|An {{extension}} is preseted of {{the evaluation}} of graphite/aluminum metal matrix composites (MMC) for space structures application. A tubular DWG graphite/aluminum truss assembly was fabricated having the structural integrity and thermal stability needed for space application. DWG is a proprietary thin ply continuous graphite reinforced aluminum composite. The truss end fittings were constructed using the discontinuous ceramic particulate reinforced MMC DWAl 20 (trademark). Thermal stability was incorporated in the truss by utilizing high stiffness, negative {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) P 100 graphite fibers in a 6061 aluminum matrix, crossplied to provide minimized CTE in the assembled truss. Tube CTE was designed to be slightly negative to offset the effects of the end <b>fitting</b> and <b>sleeve,</b> CTE values of which are approx. 1 / 2 that of aluminum. In the design of the truss configuration, the CTE contribution of each component was evaluated to establish the component dimension and layup configuration required to provide a net zero CTE in the subassemblies which would then translate to a zero CTE for the entire truss bay produced...|$|R

The wires may also be printed on by a special machine during the cutting process or on a {{separate}} machine. After this, {{the ends of the}} wires are stripped to expose the metal (or core) of the wires, which are fitted with any required terminals or connector housings. The cables are assembled and clamped together on a special workbench, or onto a pin board (assembly board), according to the design specification, to form the cable harness. After <b>fitting</b> any protective <b>sleeves,</b> conduit, or extruded yarn, the harness is either fitted directly in the vehicle or shipped.|$|R

The dress is of white commercial cotton and the embroidery is multicolored cotton, mainly in red and blue. The qabbeh (the square chest panel) is not a separate panel, but instead executed directly on the dress. The embroidery on the skirt and sleeves is also done directly on the dress. There is some machine embroidery, but most is by hand. The dress has an uncommon round neckline, which was an innovation and was only used here and {{in the village of}} Salama, near Jaffa.|$|R

50|$|A woman's thob (loose <b>fitting</b> robe with <b>sleeves)</b> {{dated to}} about 1910 that was {{produced}} in Al-Dawayima {{is part of the}} Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe. The dress is of hand-woven blue indigo linen. The embroidery is in predominantly red silk cross-stitch, with touches of violet, orange, yellow, white, green and black. The upper half of the qabbeh (the square chest panel) is embroidered with alternating columns of diamonds, (a pattern known as el-ferraneh), and eight-pointed stars, (called qamr ("moons")). The lower half of the qabbeh is in the qelayed ("necklaces") pattern. The side-panels of the skirt are completely covered with embroidered columns. Among the patterns used here are: nakhleh ("palm") motif, ward-wil-aleq ("rose-and-leech") and khem-el-basha ("the pashas tent"). Each column is topped with various trees. There is no embroidery on the long, pointed sleeves.|$|R
40|$|Steel {{conveying}} rollers used in {{hot rolling}} mills must be changed very frequently at great cost because hot conveyed strips induce wear on the roller surface in short periods. In this study new roller structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve {{is connected with}} two short shafts at both ends by shrink <b>fitting.</b> Here, ceramics <b>sleeve</b> may provide longer life and reduce the cost for the maintenance. However, care should be taken for the maximum tensile stress between the sleeve and shafts because the fracture toughness of ceramics is extremely lower than the values of steel. In this study FEM analysis {{is applied to the}} structure, and the maximum tensile stress has been investigated with varying the dimensions of the structure. It is found that the maximum tensile stress appearing at the end of sleeve takes a minimum value at a certain amount of shrink fitting ratio...|$|R

60|$|She did {{not want}} to dress yet, but rather to sit down and think, so she twisted up her hair into a little knot, slipped a skirt over her nightdress, and sat on a chair near the window and began looking around. The decorations of the room had been centred on the mantelpiece; the chief {{ornament}} consisted of a pear and an apple, a pineapple, a bunch of grapes, and several fat plums, all very beautifully done in wax, as was the fashion about the middle of this most glorious reign. They were appropriately coloured--the apple blushing red, the grapes an inky black, emerald green leaves were scattered here and there to lend finish, and the whole was mounted on an ebonised stand covered with black velvet, and protected from dust and dirt by a beautiful glass cover bordered with red plush. Liza's eyes rested on this with approbation, and the pineapple quite made her mouth water. At either end of the mantelpiece were pink jars with blue flowers on the front; round the top in Gothic letters of gold was inscribed: 'A Present from a Friend'--these were products of a later, but not less artistic age. The intervening spaces were taken up with little jars and cups and saucers--gold inside, with a view of a town outside, and surrounding them, 'A Present from Clacton-on-Sea,' or, alliteratively, 'A Memento of Margate.' Of these many were broken, but they had been mended with glue, and {{it is well known that}} pottery in the eyes of the connoisseur loses none of its value by a crack or two. Then there were portraits innumerable--little yellow cartes-de-visite in velvet frames, some of which were decorated with shells; they showed strange people with old-fashioned clothes, the women with bodices and <b>sleeves</b> <b>fitting</b> close to the figure, stern-featured females with hair carefully parted in the middle and plastered down on each side, firm chins and mouths, with small, pig-like eyes and wrinkled faces, and the men were uncomfortably clad in Sunday garments, very stiff and uneasy in their awkward postures, with large whiskers and shaved chins and upper lips and a general air of horny-handed toil. Then there were one or two daguerreotypes, little full-length figures framed in gold paper. There was one of Mrs. Kemp's father and one of her mother, and there were several photographs of betrothed or newly-married couples, the lady sitting down and the man standing behind her with his hand on the chair, or the man sitting and the woman with her hand on his shoulder. And from all sides of the room, standing on the mantelpiece, hanging above it, on the wall and over the bed, they stared full-face into the room, self-consciously fixed for ever in their stiff discomfort.|$|R
