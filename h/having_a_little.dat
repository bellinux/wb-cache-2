25|$|In October, Snow Patrol {{embarked}} on a second European Tour. The tour saw them visit countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Germany and France. Artists like The Cinematics, Declan O'Rourke, Asyl and Joseph D'Anvers supported the band throughout the tour on different dates. Midway through the tour, Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder. The bassist had been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> muscle strain, but he had ignored the pain and carried on playing. It built up and became {{too much for him}} to play on-stage. As a result, four French and two German dates were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|As {{children}} grow older they slowly grow into their roles within their society. Both genders learn from adults {{how to do}} certain things that later will help the tribe. For example, girls learn how to make doll clothing, which teaches them how to make real garments. Boys, on the other hand, are given miniature bows for them to practice hunting very small game with. Children at young ages are integrated into society evenly. They are given small tasks based on their age to follow. Boys practice hunting and follow men on some hunting events. Having little boys follow the men into hunting events lets them learn firsthand how to hunt, receive tips on what to do while hunting, and gain experience for when they do events when they are older. Girls learn the same way. They watch the women of the society do their daily routines and mimic them on smaller scales. Like the example given above with the doll making. <b>Having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl make the clothes for themselves teaches them how to make clothing they would want in the future.|$|E

500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A Times Editor review from The St. Petersburg Times also {{described}} it as sounding similar to other hits: [...] "She hankers for a boy who either doesn't love her back or wants to ditch this small town." [...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "You Belong with Me"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". The same magazine later ranked the song at number 10 on its annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine recommended for readers to download [...] "You Belong with Me", and Jeniffer Webb, also from About.com, predicted that the song would reach different age groups. Webb said, [...] "It continues the artist's tradition of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something for everyone, so it's no wonder she has such a large fanbase." ...|$|E
500|$|Forty-four {{seconds after}} Moosally's order, Lieutenant Buch {{reported}} that Turret Two's right gun was loaded {{and ready to}} fire. Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, [...] "We have a problem here. We are not ready yet. We have a problem here." [...] Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, [...] "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trouble. We'll straighten that out." [...] Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that {{the left and right}} guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, [...] "I'm not ready yet! I'm not ready yet!" [...] Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, [...] "Mort! Mort! Mort!" [...] Ziegler shouted, [...] "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" [...] At this time, Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer's booth {{in the rear of the}} turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed. About this same time, Hanyecz yelled over the phone circuit, [...] "Oh, my God! There's a flash!" ...|$|E

500|$|Patrick Stewart {{thought that}} the first Next Generation film, Star Trek Generations, was too much like a {{television}} episode but thought that his character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, was redefined as a [...] "movie hero" [...] in [...] He was concerned that in the new film, the character would return to that seen in the television series. Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E
500|$|She then {{embarked}} on an affair with fellow resident Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was [...] "punching above her weight" [...] with Jason. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: [...] "Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, {{and it was no}} strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her." [...] When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: [...] "I think he's turned it around. She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!" [...] Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a serious of romanctic plots in which ITV dubbed the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] season of the soap, with advertisements airing.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley {{said that}} Brave New World was {{inspired}} by the utopian novels of H. G. Wells, including A Modern Utopia (1905) and Men Like Gods (1923). Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novel, which became Brave New World. He {{wrote in a letter to}} Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had [...] "been <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells," [...] but then he [...] "got caught up in the excitement of [...] own ideas." [...] Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to Brave New World as a [...] "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own The Sleeper Awakes (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of D. H. Lawrence.|$|E

He also had many vocal disagreements with his superiors and his own gunner crew over free-fire zones, including an incident in which one of his crew shot a wagon that wound up <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl inside it. He went on to Airborne School and Ranger School before receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature and graduate degrees in international relations and national security. He attended the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and later returned there to teach. [...] He later served as deputy director of the Marine Corps War College at Quantico.|$|E
