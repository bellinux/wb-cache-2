5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as <b>fellow</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E

25|$|Robeson {{connected}} his {{own life}} and history not only to his <b>fellow</b> <b>Americans</b> and to his people in the South, but {{to all the people}} of Africa and its diaspora whose lives had been fundamentally shaped by the same processes that had brought his ancestors to America. While a consensus definition of his legacy remains controversial, to deny his courage in the face of public and governmental pressure would be to defame his courage.|$|E
25|$|As {{a supreme}} realist, Eakins {{appeared}} heavy and vulgar {{to a public}} that thought of art, and culture in general, largely {{in terms of a}} graceful sentimentality. Today he seems to us to have recorded his <b>fellow</b> <b>Americans</b> with a perception that was often as tender as it was vigorous, and to have preserved for us the essence of an American life which, indeed, he did not idealize — because it seemed to him beautiful beyond the necessity of idealization.|$|E

25|$|Kelly {{used the}} G.I. Bill to study from 1946-47 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, {{where he took}} {{advantage}} of the museum's collections, and then at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. While in Paris Kelly established his aesthetic. There in the City of Lights he attended classes infrequently, but immersed himself in the rich artistic resources of the French capital. He had heard a lecture by Max Beckmann on the French artist Paul Cézanne in 1948 and moved to Paris that year. There he encountered <b>fellow</b> <b>Americans</b> John Cage and Merce Cunningham, experimenting in music and dance, respectively; the French Surrealist artist Jean Arp; and the abstract sculptor Constantin Brâncuși, whose simplification of natural forms had a lasting effect on him. The experience of visiting artists such as Alberto Magnelli, Francis Picabia, Alberto Giacometti and Georges Vantongerloo in their studios was transformative.|$|E

500|$|Beyond the European continent, folk metal is {{relatively}} rare {{with only a}} few known acts including the aforementioned The Lord Weird Slough Feg and their <b>fellow</b> <b>Americans</b> Agalloch.

[...] Tuatha de Danann is another geographical anomaly with their Celtic metal from Brazil. Moreover there is also Skiltron who play Scottish Celtic Metal who hail from Argentina, Conrad a Folk Metal band from Barbados, The Nine Treasures from China, Orphaned Land from Israel, Myrath from Tunisia, Tengger Cavalry from Mongolia.|$|E
