5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, {{largely because of}} the variety of species and habitats. The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple.

5|$|According to the National Trust, {{the grass}} is trimmed {{regularly}} and the giant is fully re-chalked every 25 years. Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site. However, in 2008 a lack of sheep, coupled with a wet spring causing extra plant growth, forced a re-chalking of the giant, with 17 tonnes of new chalk being poured in and tamped down by hand. In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the <b>green-winged</b> <b>orchid,</b> clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
