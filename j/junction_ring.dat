50|$|This {{property}} was exploited by Tsuei et al. by manufacturing {{a series of}} YBCO ring Josephson junctions which crossed 110 Bragg planes of a single YBCO crystal (figure). In a Josephson <b>junction</b> <b>ring</b> the superconducting electrons form a coherent wave function, just as in a superconductor. As the wavefunction must have only one value at each point, the overall phase factor obtained after traversing the entire Josephson circuit must be an integer multiple of 2π, as otherwise, one would obtain a different value of the probability density depending {{on the number of}} times one traversed the ring.|$|E

The quantum phase-slip amplitude is sensitive to the normal mode structure of superconducting phase oscillations in the ring (Mooij-Schön modes).

40|$|Cell-cell {{junctions}} {{are distributed}} evenly around the lateral circumference of cells within an epithelium. We Þnd that the even distribution of adherens junctions {{is an active}} process that requires the small guanosine triphosphatase Rap 1. Cells mutant for Rap 1 condensed their adherens junctions {{to one side of}} the cell. This disrupted normal epithelial cell behavior, and mutant cell clones dispersed into the surrounding wild-type tissue. Rap 1 is enriched at adherens junctions, particularly between newly divided sister cells where it may reseal the adherens <b>junction</b> <b>ring.</b> The regulation of adherens junction positioning could play a role in cell mobility and cell division. Cells within an epithelium are linked by sev-eral types of junctions.

40|$|Immunological synapses are {{organized}} cell-cell junctions between T lymphocytes and APCs composed of an adhesion ring, the peripheral supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC), and a central T cell receptor cluster, the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC). In CD 8 (+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the immunological synapse {{is thought to}} facilitate specific killing by confining cytotoxic agents to the synaptic cleft. We have investigated the interaction of human CTLs and helper T cells with supported planar bilayers containing ICAM- 1. This artificial substrate provides identical ligands to CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells, allowing a quantitative comparison. We found that cytotoxic T lymphocytes form a <b>ring</b> <b>junction</b> similar to a pSMAC in response to high surface densities of ICAM- 1 in the planar bilayer.

40|$|GC-MS {{analysis}} {{of a series of}} severely altered bitumen from a Spanish quarry revealed the presence of a complex mixture of regular polycyclic polyprenoid hydrocarbons comprising non demethylated and demethylated components. The latter occur mainly as hydrocarbons demethylated at <b>junction</b> of <b>rings</b> A/B, compounds demethylated at rings E/F/G and compounds both demethylated at rings A/B and rings E/F/G, as evidenced by NMR structural identification of three isolated homologues (1 and structures cited in Grosjean et al. 2001, cf.

The presence, throughout the World, of non demethylated polycyclic polyprenoid hydrocarbons together with the hydrocarbon series demethylated at rings E/F/G in sediment extracts and crude oils comprising both biodegraded and unaltered samples gives clues to the biological precursor lipids of highly cyclized polyprenoids.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{continuation}} of the work by Bonnert to produce taxanes from glucose. The application of a Stork silyl methylene radical cyclisation to the allylic alcohol (1) led to the diol (2). This has a trans <b>ring</b> <b>junction</b> and has introduced regiospecifically a hydroxy methylene group adjacent to an hydroxyl group. This provides the necessary stereochemistry for the B-C <b>ring</b> <b>junction</b> in taxanes. However the ring hydroxyl group has the wrong stereochemistry for taxinine. In an endeavour to correct this, the allylic alcohol (1) was inverted and the radical cyclisation performed again. This resulted though in the radical and the hydrogen atom adding trans, once more, despite the fact that this gave rise to the formation of two cis <b>ring</b> <b>junctions.</b> Therefore, this too produced the wrong stereochemistry at the B-C <b>ring</b> <b>junction.</b> A series of studies were undertaken to assess the generality of the Robinson annulation of a carbohydrate. This study was extended to the incorporation the C- 7 hydroxyl group in taxol during this annulation. A study of the C-ring functionality was performed leading to the formation of a carbohydrate oxetane. Several attempts at the production of 2 -trimethyl- 3 -lithiobutadiene, as a synthetic building block, resulted in failure. Following previous work at Leicester, involving the use of intramolecular Diels-Alder reactions in the synthesis of taxanes, studies were initiated to convert (2) and (3) into diene-dienophile systems. The first approach was to construct the dienophile, prior to the diene, on C- 9 (C- 1 carbohydrate numbering). This approach failed due to the difficulties encountered when differentially protecting several similar hydroxyl groups. Altering our initial ideas, such that the diene is built before the dienophile, on C- 6, has met though with more success. However, before attempting the construction of the diene on our intermediate (4) a model study was undertaken on a simple carbohydrate aldehyde, using a selenium directed synthesis. This was successful and so this approach has the potential for providing the means for the formation of a diene-dienophile system in our intermediate (4), and hence eventually resulting {{in the creation of a}} highly substituted taxane skeleton...|$|R
