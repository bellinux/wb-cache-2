The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibility of implementing axial compressors in the proposed single shaft Pebble Bed Micro Model (PBMM) cycle. Software for the development of preliminary axial compressor design was written with the aid of Engineering Equation Solver (EES), The preliminary design parameters obtained from the EES program was then used as input for the compressor analysis in Concepts NREC. An extensive literature review was conducted to obtain the required technical information concerning cycle analysis and compressor design. Cycle simulations were carried out with both Helium and Nitrogen as the working fluid to rationalise the most suitable cycle for this application. EES and Concepts NREC (Axial) were used to validate the software programs written for the cycle analysis and the preliminary compressor design. The EES output parameters of both programs closely resemble that of the verification software. Axial and radial compressors were considered during the selection of the most appropriate compressor to be utilized in the cycle. As a result of this study it could be concluded that radial compressors with Nitrogen as the working fluid will be the best option in terms of complexity and expenses. A detailed cost analysis is recommended as it was not part of this study's scope. A detailed cost investigation could advance the conclusion of this study.

Design improvements and technology innovations associated with inflow radial turbine, turbo expander, {{have been the}} main motivation for the improved and more productive ethylene plant processes. The early process design {{that was based on}} Jule Thompson expansion valve was replaced by the process designs that utilize several stages of expander -compressor or expander- generators. The latest technology innovation that was embraced by the ethylene plant engineering companies and the owners was expander-compressor with active magnetic bearings.

40|$|The {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines with fractional slot and concentrated winding configuration have been steadily gaining traction in various applications in recent times. This is mainly driven by several advantages offered by this configuration such as high-torque density, outstanding efficiency, and easy and low-cost fabrication. The {{main focus of}} this thesis {{is dedicated to the}} investigation of three main topologies of fractional-slot and concentratedwinding {{permanent magnet}} synchronous machines specifically suited for particular applications. Additionally, the cogging torque and torque ripple reduction technique based on a novel axial pole pairing scheme in two different radial-flux permanent magnet synchronous machines with fractional-slot and concentratedwinding configuration are investigated. First, an axial flux permanent magnet segmented-armature-torus machine with laminated stator is proposed for in-wheel direct drive application. Both simplified analytical method and three-dimensional finite element analysis model accounting for anisotropic property of lamination are developed to analyze the machine performance. The predicted and experimental results are in good agreement and indicate that the proposed machine could deliver exciting and excellent performance. The impact of magnet segmentation on magnet eddy current losses in the prototype is carried out by the proposed three-dimensional finite element analysis model. The results show that the eddy current losses in the magnet could be effectively reduced by either circumferentially or radially segmenting the magnets. Furthermore, a magnet shaping scheme is employed and investigated to reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple of the prototype. This is validated using the three-dimensional finite element analysis model as well. Second, a coreless axial flux permanent magnet machine with circular magnets and coils is proposed as a generator for man-portable power platform. Approximate analytical and three-dimensional finite element analysis models are developed to analyze and optimize the electromagnetic performance of the machine. Comprehensive mechanical stress analysis has been carried out by threedimensional structural finite element analysis, which would ensure the rotor integrity at expected high rotational speed. The results from both three-dimensional finite element analysis and experiments have validated that the proposed prototype is a compact and efficient <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>generator</b> with very simple and robust structure. Additionally, this structure offers simplified assembly and manufacturing processes utilizing off-the-shelf magnets. Third, a novel radial flux outer rotor permanent magnet flux switching machine is proposed for urban electric vehicle propulsion. Initial design based on the analytical sizing equations would lead to severe saturation and excessive magnet volumes in the machine and subsequently poor efficiency. An improved design is accomplished by optimizing the geometric parameters, which can significantly improve the machine efficiency and effectively reduce the overall magnet volumes. Magnet segmentations can be employed to further improve the machine performance. Finally, a novel axial pole pairing technique is proposed to reduce the cogging torque and torque ripple in radial flux fractional-slot and concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machines. The implementation of the technique in outer rotor surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous machine shows that the cogging torque and torque ripple can be reduced very effectively with different magnet pairs. However, careful pair selection is of particular importance for compromise between cogging torque and torque ripple minimizations during the machine design stage. This technique is also employed to minimize the cogging torque in a permanent magnet flux switching integrated-stator-generator and it is compared with rotor step skewed technique. The estimated and experimental results show that the axial pole pairing technique can not mitigate the torque ripple of the machine as effectively as rotor step skewed approach although both the techniques could reduce the cogging torque to the same level...|$|E

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} use of a <b>high</b> <b>speed,</b> {{squirrel}} cage induction generator and power converter for producing DC electrical power onboard ships and submarines. Potential advantages of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> induction <b>generators</b> include smaller size and weight, increased durability, and decreased cost and maintenance. Unfortunately, induction generators require a "supply of reactive power" to run and suffer from variation in output voltage and frequency with any changes to the input reactive power excitation, mechanical drive speed, and load. A power converter can resolve some of these issues by circulating the changing reactive power demanded by the generator while simultaneously controlling the stator frequency to adjust the machine slip and manage the real output power. This combination of real and reactive power control will ensure a constant voltage DC bus over the full load range. Tests were performed on a three horsepower motor to help validate models and simulations at both the two kilowatt and 5 megawatt level. After determining the equivalent circuit of the demonstration motor, it was tested as a generator under grid connected and capacitor excited conditions. A stand-alone five megawatt, 12, 000 RPM generator designed specifically to operate at high efficiency and power factor over the full load rang was used to design converter parameters. A variety of reactive power excitation strategies were briefly examined before the flow of reactive currents through a converter was explained using a six step inverter with two different switching schemes.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the part load {{performance}} of a small scale (100 kWe) combined heat and power (CHP) plant fired by natural gas and solid biomass to serve a residential energy demand. The plant is based on a modified regenerative micro gas turbine (MGT), where compressed air exiting from recuperator is externally heated by the hot gases produced in a biomass furnace; then the air is conveyed to combustion chamber where a conventional internal combustion with natural gas takes place, reaching the maximum cycle temperature allowed by the blade turbine temperature. The hot gas expands in the turbine and then feeds the recuperator, while the biomass combustion flue gases are used for pre-heating the combustion air that feeds the furnace. The part load efficiency is examined considering a single shaft layout of the gas turbine and two regulation options: constant rotational speed and variable speed. In this last case, it is assumed that the turbine shaft is connected to a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> electric <b>generator</b> and a frequency converter is used to adjust the frequency of the produced electric power. The results show that the variable rotational <b>speed</b> operation allows <b>high</b> the part load efficiency, mainly due to maximum cycle temperature that can be kept about constant, the lower the pressure ratio and the slightly higher efficiency of the heat exchangers. Different biomass/natural gas energy input ratios are also modelled, in order to assess the trade-offs between: (i) lower energy conversion efficiency and higher investment cost when increasing the biomass input rate; (ii) higher primary energy savings and revenues from feed-in tariff available for biomass electricity fed into the grid. The strategies of baseload (BL), heat driven (HD) and electricity driven (ED) plant operation are compared, for an aggregate of residential end-users in cold, average and mild climate conditions...|$|R
