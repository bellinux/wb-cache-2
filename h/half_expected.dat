500|$|Andy Kellman of Allmusic called [...] "Carry Out" [...] the dirtiest {{track on}} the album and noted that the two artists aimed for a {{contemporary}} form of The Lonely Island's [...] "Dick in a Box" [...] (Incredibad, 2009), on which Timberlake was featured. Brian Linder of IGN commented that the production on the song is tight, but panned the single for its food-sex metaphors, calling it [...] "unforgivably stupid" [...] and [...] " [...] such a joke that we <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> Andy Samberg to show up with his dick in a happy meal box," [...] making reference to [...] "Dick in a Box", which premiered on Saturday Night Live in 2006. Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine called the collaboration and [...] "Say Something" [...] "admirable turns" [...] {{on the album}}, but commented that they are [...] "forced to operate with unenviably tepid production." [...] Cataldo concludes, writing, [...] "The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming {{from one of the}} most renowned producers of the last decade." [...] Hugh Montgomery of The Observer noted it as one of the album's best tracks but called it [...] "merely passable" [...] and said it was [...] " [...] weighed down by [...] own leaden rapping and with nothing new to add to the familiar, futurist R formula." ...|$|E
500|$|Rob Markman of MTV News {{wrote that}} the singers [...] "display good {{chemistry}} on the song". The Washington Posts Sarah Godfrey classified [...] "Love a Woman" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album adding that [...] "The ballad, with its cheesy, delightful... R production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige." [...] Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song [...] "clearly knows how to love a woman right". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé [...] "showcase their powerful pipes" [...] as they tell their men what they want from a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television {{wrote that the}} song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a [...] "breathtaking duet". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as [...] "a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed [...] "the soaring nature of the song", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a [...] "lesson in love". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an [...] "inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> Keith Sweat to jump in". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, [...] "'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats. Forget Dr. Phil, MJB and Ms. B is all you need to help you maintain a loving relationship with your partner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Africa will {{experience}} a [...] "demographic dividend" [...] by 2035, when its young and growing labour force will have fewer children and retired people as dependents as {{a proportion of}} the population, making it more demographically comparable to the US and Europe. It is becoming a more educated labour force, with nearly <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> to have some secondary-level education by 2020. A consumer class is also emerging in Africa and is expected to keep booming. Africa has around 90 million people with household incomes exceeding $5,000, meaning that they can direct more than half of their income towards discretionary spending rather than necessities. This number could reach a projected 128 million by 2020.|$|E
60|$|She spoke excitedly, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> her {{antagonist}} to {{give her}} back the move.|$|R
60|$|Mary was <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> him, for in {{his last}} letter to her {{he had told her}} he hoped to arrive in Paris that evening.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘What lady?’ cried our friend, {{starting}} up, {{not quite}} certain that his dream was an illusion, and <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> {{that it might}} be Rose herself.—‘What lady? Where?’ ...|$|R
60|$|I'm {{absolutely}} {{ashamed of}} myself. I <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> to find you'd all gone to bed.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} she seemed {{as though she were}} {{summoning}} all her courage to tell the lie which he <b>half</b> <b>expected.</b> Instead she changed her mind.|$|E
60|$|He {{heard her}} without any change of expression, but {{somehow or other}} {{it was easy to}} see that her news, {{although}} more than <b>half</b> <b>expected,</b> had stung him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, sir," [...] he answered, {{opening the}} door. I stepped inside, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> {{to see the}} man whom Mr. Ravenor had refused to receive; but it was quite empty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't," [...] growled Nick Jasniff. [...] "Any more?" [...] and {{he gazed}} anxiously into the cab, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> {{an officer of}} the law to put in an appearance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, I was <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> {{something}} like that," [...] he said. [...] "It was quite irrational, {{but it was}} hanging about in the atmosphere, like thunder in the air." ...|$|R
60|$|Stealing {{down the}} passage, she entered {{his room and}} shook him gently. He awoke, and {{she put her hand}} on his face to check the exclamation she <b>half</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
60|$|She sighed her relief. I {{really believe}} she <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> {{to find me}} {{trotting}} about Florence with miscellaneous samples of Messrs. Abel Woodward's esteemed productions protruding from my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{learned from}} a chopper that I wasn't far behind him, and I <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> you would have headed him off. I can't think he has passed this spot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I called in, {{on my way}} upstairs, {{more than}} <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> to find you here,' said Ralph, {{addressing}} his niece, and looking contemptuously at the portrait. 'Is that my niece's portrait, ma'am?' ...|$|R
60|$|It was half-past ten {{when there}} came a ring {{at the front door}} bell. Fouquier-Tinville, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> citizen Chauvelin to pay him a final visit, shuffled to the door and opened it.|$|R
60|$|Jet looked around, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> {{to see his}} seedy {{friend of}} the {{previous}} evening come back to tell him {{it was all a}} joke, when the small guide Jim stepped into view.|$|R
60|$|Thence I {{made my way}} to Mr. Robbie's, where I {{rang the}} bell. A servant {{answered}} the summons, and told me the lawyer was engaged, as I had <b>half</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} meant to flout her when he acted on her suggestion, and I <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> {{something}} of a scene," [...] said Mrs. Ashborne. [...] "The woman has a temper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{just one}} message I must send" [...] she said, [...] "to a stupid house where I am <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> to dine. It will not take me half a minute." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{returned}} to the house <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> that she would have vanished. No; there she was--just coming out from the inner room, the marks of sleep upon her eyelids, and exhibiting a generally refreshed air.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks out}} of the question, and it's very hot," [...] she said. [...] "Couldn't you stop a little earlier, for once, and ride over to the Range? Mrs. Custer <b>half</b> <b>expects</b> you at supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it now?" [...] {{he asked}} in a fearful voice. He stood by her side and gazed at the well, as though <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> to see the cause of her alarm emerge from it.|$|R
60|$|For answer, Joe {{pointed to}} the cabin, and that with so much {{expression}} on his features that Mr. Green, following his gaze, <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> to see something horrible emerge from the companion.|$|E
60|$|The light spread, {{falling on}} Walthew's {{recumbent}} figure and sparkling on his pistol, but the messenger did not throw it {{down as the}} American had <b>half</b> <b>expected.</b> Instead, he coolly held it up.|$|E
60|$|He felt no fear. He had <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> it. Her coming was the {{complement}} of his dreams. She looked older and graver than he remembered her, {{but for that}} the face was the sweeter.|$|E
6000|$|... "A good deal, off and on. But it's getting chilly and I <b>half</b> <b>expect</b> a reproving lecture from Miss Hume when I go in. First, though, tell me {{a little}} more about the young Canadian you had with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then came a pause. Harry stopped, and Dr. May waited, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> to {{hear that}} the boy was only brought to {{confession}} by finding himself in a scrape. Margaret spoke. [...] "And he could not be happy till he had told you." ...|$|R
60|$|But she {{continued}} to gaze at him with widened, enigmatic eyes--whether of reproach or contempt or anger he could not say. The situation transcended his experience. He took an uncertain step toward her, as though <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> her to flee, and stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, Jacques," [...] he said, as {{they left}} the tent, [...] "ask whether a chief called Redfeather is here. I knew him of old, and <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> to find him at this place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I'm glad to say that, as I <b>half</b> <b>expected,</b> we {{have got}} the fellow; corralled him for horse-stealing a while ago, and he'll be charged with robbing you in due time. But go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|The young hunter's {{ears were}} on the alert, for he <b>half</b> <b>expected</b> that Barringford might be coming up behind him to cut his bonds. At last he heard his name {{mentioned}} in a low, guarded tone: ...|$|E
60|$|He eyed Mr. Negget closely, {{as though}} <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> another outburst, but none being forthcoming, {{sat back in}} his chair again and smoked in silence, while Mrs. Negget, with a carpet-brush which almost spoke, swept the pieces of dried mud from the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... “Come in, come in,” said he. “Come in {{and take}} a seat. Carstairs” (to his servant), “make up the fire, {{and then you can}} bring a bit of supper,” and again to Archie, with a very trivial accent: “I was <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> you,” he added.|$|R
60|$|He turns, <b>half</b> <b>expecting</b> to {{see only}} the empty air and to wonder at the {{delirium}} in his brain. She puts her hand in his, and their eyes meet; and in that moment, {{for the first time}} in their lives, these two see one another.|$|R
