40|$|Dynamic {{cerebral}} autoregulation (dCA) <b>estimates</b> <b>require</b> <b>mean</b> {{arterial blood}} pressure (MABP) fluctuations of sufficient amplitude. Current methods to induce fluctuations {{are not easily}} implemented or require patient cooperation. In search of an alternative method, we evaluated if MABP fluctuations could be increased by passive cyclic leg raising (LR) and tested if reproducibility and variability of dCA parameters could be improved. Middle cerebral artery cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), MABP and end tidal CO 2 (PetCO(2)) were obtained at rest and during LR at 0. 1 Hz in 16 healthy subjects. The MABP-CBFV phase difference and gain were determined at 0. 1 Hz and in the low frequency (LF) range (0. 06 - 0. 14 Hz). In addition the autoregulation index (ARI) was calculated. The LR maneuver increased the power of MABP fluctuations at 0. 1 Hz and across the LF range. Despite a clear correlation between both phase and gain reproducibility and MABP variability in the rest condition, only the reproducibility of gain increased significantly with the maneuver. During the maneuver patients were breathing faster and more irregularly, accompanied by increased PetCO(2) fluctuations and increased coherence between PetCO(2) and CBFV. Multiple regression analysis showed that these concomitant changes were negatively correlated with the MABP-CBFV phase difference at 0. 1 Hz Variability was not reduced by LR {{for any of the}} dCA parameters. The clinical utility of cyclic passive leg raising is limited because of the concomitant changes in PetCO(2). This limits reproducibility of the most important dCA parameters. Future research on reproducibility and variability of dCA parameters should incorporate PetCO(2) variability or find methods to keep PetCO(2) levels constant. (C) 2013 IPEM.

40|$|Difference-based methods do not <b>require</b> <b>estimating</b> the <b>mean</b> {{function}} in nonparametric regression {{and are therefore}} popular in practice. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for variance estimation that combines the linear regression method with the higher-order difference estimators systematically. The unified framework has greatly enriched the existing literature on variance estimation that includes most existing estimators as special cases. More importantly, the unified framework has also provided a smart way to solve the challenging difference sequence selection problem that remains a long-standing controversial issue in nonparametric regression for several decades. Using both theory and simulations, we recommend to use the ordinary difference sequence in the unified framework, no matter if the sample size is small or if the signal-to-noise ratio is large. Finally, to cater for {{the demands of the}} application, we have developed a unified R package, named VarED, that integrates the existing difference-based estimators and the unified estimators in nonparametric regression and have made it freely available in the R statistical program [URL]...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} task for network operators is to properly dimension {{the capacity of}} their links. Often, this is done by simple rules of thumb based on coarse traffic measurements provided, e. g., by SNMP. More accurate estimations of the required link capacity typically require packet-level measurements, which are hard to implement in todayâ€™s high-speed networks. The challenge is, therefore, to accurately estimate the traffic statistics needed for <b>estimating</b> the <b>required</b> link capacity with minimal traffic measurement effort. This paper proposes a novel, hybrid procedure for link dimensioning that combines flow-level measurements, minimal efforts on packet captures, and an analytical traffic model. The result is an efficient and robust method to <b>estimate</b> <b>required</b> link capacities. Although the idea of <b>estimating</b> <b>required</b> capacities from flows is not new, the novelty {{of this paper is}} that it proposes a complete, efficient and deployable procedure. The proposed procedure has been extensively validated using real-world traffic captures dating from 2011 and 2012. Results show that, with minimal measurement effort, we are able to efficiently <b>estimate</b> the <b>required</b> bandwidth at timescales as low as 1 millisecond. Keywords...|$|R

In large SaaS applications that are developed using service-oriented architecture model, each service is deployed in a separated virtual machine and may use one or more services to complete its task. Although, scaling service independently from its required services propagates scaling problem to other services, most of current elasticity approaches do not consider functional dependencies between services, which increases the probability of violating service level agreement.
