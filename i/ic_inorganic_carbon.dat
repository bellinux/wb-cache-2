Photosynthesis is carried out mainly by the epidermis cells of the numerous segments into which the leaf is finely dissected. In these cells, containing most of the chloroplasts, a peculiar organization of the wall has been identified by cytochemical tests. A thin compact outer region covers the cell surface and splits up forming large lacunae between adjacent cells. Below it, a thick and loose inner region rich in hydrophilic pectic acids occurs, which grows in along the cell sides giving rise to wide transfer areas. In this latter cell wall region, in which the cell/environment contact and exchanges are amplified, the systems for inorganic carbon supply to photosynthetic cells operate. The leaves of R. trichophyllus can rely on environmental CO 2 and HCO 3 – as sources of inorganic carbon for photosynthesis. A mechanism for bicarbonate utilization seems to involve its conversion to CO 2 by an apoplastic carbonic anhydrase, whose activity gains importance as the availability of environmental CO 2 decreases. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that in this species CO 2 can also be obtained from HCO 3 – by a photodependent increase in plasmamembrane H+-ATPase activity in the transfer areas of the epidermis cells. This {{is the first time that}} such a mechanism has been noted in a nonpolar leaf of a submerged macrophyte...|$|E

At pH 5. 1, where CO 2 is the predominant species of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon,</b> both acetazolamide and the dextran-bound sulfonamide had no effect on the concentration of CO 2 required for the half-maximal rate of photosynthetic O 2 evolution (K 0. 5 [CO 2]) or <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> accumulation.

These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CO 2 is the species of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> which crosses the plasmalemma and that extracellular carbonic anhydrase is required to replenish CO 2 from HCO 3 − at high pH.

The relative bicarbonate contribution (i. e. the ratio of bicarbonate uptake to total <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> uptake) and leakage (i. e. the ratio of CO 2 efflux to total <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> uptake) varied from 0. 2 to 0. 5 and 0. 4 to 0. 7, respectively, and differed significantly between species.

The results showed that there is considerable SDIC content in SIC, and the variations of SDIC and SIC contents in the saline soil profile were much larger than that in the alkaline profile. SDIC storage accounted for more than 20 % of SIC storage, indicating that more than 1 / 5 of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> in both saline and alkaline soil is not in non-leachable forms. Deep layer soil contains considerable <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon,</b> with more than 80 % of the soil carbon stored below 1 m, whether for SDIC or SIC.

40|$|When buoyant {{cyanobacteria}} form {{a surface}} bloom, they may obtain <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> {{from the water}} and the atmosphere. In this study, artificial blooms of cyanobacteria were exposed to different concentrations of CO(2) in the atmosphere and HCO 3 - in the water. The conditions and photosynthetic activity within the bloom were measured with microelectrodes sensing O- 2, pH, and light. Net rates of photosynthesis increased with the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere (air = 350 ppm). However, even under 3, 500 ppm CO 2, reducing the concentration of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> in the water reduced rates of photosynthesis. Thus, both air and water acted as sources of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon.</b> Bloom formation may give cyanobacteria an advantage in competition for light and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> with other groups of phytoplankton; by placing a dense biomass close to the water surface they are able to intercept a large amount of the flux of light and <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon.</b> The high surface pH produced in the bloom will promote influx of CO 2 from the atmosphere by "chemical enhancement. " The obvious advantage of being close to the water surface may be offset by the risk of photoinhibition at high photon irradiance. The dense packing of colonies in the bloom furthermore caused a high local demand for <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> and consequently extreme carbon depletion. This combination of high photon irradiance and carbon limitation proved to be especially detrimental in blooms. When the availability of <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> was restricted, nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence increased, showing some removal of excess excitation energy, but not to the extent that photodamage was prevented. Depending on the outcome of several interacting processes, surface bloom formation may be advantageous or deleterious for the cyanobacteria involved. This also depends on the environmental conditions to which cells were acclimated prior to bloom formation. Cyanobacteria {{have a better chance of}} withstanding the conditions in surface blooms if the cells were already acclimated to high average irradiance prior to floating to the surface...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> accumulation {{in relation to}} photosynthesis in the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum micans. Measurement of the internal <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> pool showed a 10 -fold accumulation in relation to external dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> (DIC). Dextran-bound sulfonamide (DBS), which inhibited extracellular carbonic anhydrase, caused more than 95 % inhibition of DIC accumulation and photosynthesis. We used real-time imaging of living cells with confocal laser scanning microscopy and a fluorescent pH indicator dye to measure transient pH changes in relation to <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> availability. When steady-state photosynthesizing cells were DIC limited, the chloroplast pH decreased from 8. 3 to 6. 9 and cytosolic pH decreased from 7. 7 to 7. 1. Re-addition of HCO 3 − led to a rapid re-establishment of the steady-state pH values abolished by DBS. The addition of DBS to photosynthesizing cells under steady-state conditions resulted in a transient increase in intracellular pH, with photosynthesis maintained for 6 s, {{the amount of time}} needed for depletion of the intracellular <b>inorganic</b> <b>carbon</b> pool. These results demonstrate the key role of extracellular carbonic anhydrase in facilitating the availability of CO 2 at the exofacial surface of the plasma membrane necessary to maintain the photosynthetic rate. The need for a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism at ambient CO 2 concentrations may reflect the difference in the specificity factor of ribulose- 1, 5 bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase in dinoflagellates compared with other algal phyla...|$|R
