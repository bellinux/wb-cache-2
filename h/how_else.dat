5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} <b>how</b> <b>else</b> {{he might make}} a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy and then of journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E

It is with God's help that we found this corn, for <b>how</b> <b>else</b> could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (<b>How</b> <b>else</b> could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

[...] Virginia Rohan of The Seattle Times thought the [...] "death of troubled Shannon, {{just as she was}} {{becoming}} more likable and had found love with Sayid, was sadder than the first-season death of her stepbrother, Boone. Still, it would grieve me far more to lose Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Locke, Sun or Jin." [...] Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune felt fans echoed this view, describing their reaction as [...] "muted," [...] as they were more angry at Ana Lucia for shooting Shannon.

He also considered that [...] "Describing an incident as racist may say as much about a victim's mindset as the offender. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> can one explain the British Crime Survey finding that 3,100 car thefts from Asians were deemed to be racially motivated?" [...] Yasmin Alibhai-Brown condemned the double standards of racial equality campaigners in relation to the case, suggesting black activists should [...] "march and remember victims like Ross Parker ... our values are worthless unless all victims of these senseless deaths matter equally". She went on to write that [...] "to treat some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable and a betrayal of anti-racism itself".|$|E
500|$|While {{he appears}} to have been {{attracted}} to young women throughout his life, and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice, there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind. He recorded in his diary in 1830 that [...] "it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc". He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that [...] "it fills up a couple of hours in the evening, I should be at a loss <b>how</b> <b>else</b> to employ".|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly gave a [...] "B+" [...] rating to {{the first}} half of the film and a [...] "C-" [...] rating to the second half, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "As {{political}} theater, Che moves from faith to impotence, which is certainly a valid reading of Communism in the 20th century. Yet as drama, that makes the second half of the film borderline deadly ... Che is twice as long as it needs to be, but it is also only half the movie it should have been". James Verniere of The Boston Herald gave the film a B-, describing the work as a new genre of [...] "arthouse guerrilla nostalgia", while lamenting Che as the film version of Alberto Korda’s iconic 1960 photograph Guerrillero Heroico. In Verniere's view, so much information was missing, that he recommended one first see The Motorcycle Diaries to fill in the background. In her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig wrote, [...] "With its lyrical beauty and strong performances, the film can be riveting. Its excessive length and rambling scenes also make it maddening. It is worth seeing for its attention to visual detail and ambitious filmmaking, but as a psychological portrait of a compelling historical figure, it is oddly bland and unrevealing". Anthony Lane, in his review for The New Yorker, wrote, [...] "for all the movie’s narrative momentum, Che retains the air of a study exercise—of an interest brilliantly explored. <b>How</b> <b>else</b> to explain one’s total flatness of feeling at the climax of each movie?" [...] Taking a more positive stance, film critic Chris Barsanti compared Che to a [...] "guerrilla take on Patton", calling it [...] "an exceptionally good" [...] war film, which rivaled The Battle of Algiers in its [...] "you-are-there sensibility". Roger Ebert awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and addressed the film's length: [...] "You may wonder if the film is too long. I think there's a good reason for its length. Guevara's experience in Cuba and especially Bolivia was not a series of events and anecdotes, but a trial of endurance that might almost be called mad".|$|E

2500|$|Zigu Ornea's early ideological {{commitments}} were retrospectively {{reviewed and}} placed in relation to his scientific contributions by his România Literară colleague, literary historian Nicolae Manolescu: [...] "Z. Ornea was among those few to be passionate by the history of (literary, social, political) ideas, during a period when {{it was easier to}} approach literature from an aesthetic rather than ideological angle. [...] Shaped, <b>how</b> <b>else?,</b> under the impression of Marxism during the early fifties, Z. Ornea was never a dogmatic one." [...] In Manolescu's assessment, Ornea's adaptation of Marxist critique was stood against the [...] "rudimentary and often contradictory" [...] official version, by tackling subjects uncomfortable for both the proletarian internationalism of the 1950s and the nationalist revival of the Ceaușescu era, by providing readers with glimpses into the works of writers condemned for being [...] "reactionary", and by attempting to avoid [...] "the Marxist clichés in fashion at the time." [...] Daniel Barbu mirrors this assessment by reviewing Ornea as one of the [...] "confessed and innovative Marxists".|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918.

[...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game?

[...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it.
