5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made harder than the Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and omission of a password system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics and controls, received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items, attributing it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, October 8, {{was a hot}} {{and sunny}} day on the island. At approximately, 11:00 a.m. local time, some Marines were {{taking a break from}} official duties and resting at a beach-side campsite during a lull in the training. They thus did not have live ammunition in their rifles for training purposes, although a few commissioned officers and senior NCOs carried Beretta M9 sidearms loaded with live ammunition. Soon thereafter, the two gunmen began shooting at the Marines with Kalashnikov rifles, specifically targeting two Marines playing a makeshift game of baseball during a rest in the training. One nearby Marine became disgruntled after hearing the gunfire, mistaking <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> of his fellow Marines, but soon realized otherwise.|$|E

The story also came under scrutiny from some reviewers for being too generic and too similar to existing Japanese RPGs, with slow pacing during the beginning of the game. Eurogamer stated that the apparent lack of effort put into the facial animations for each character resulted in a limited ability to express emotion. They also noted that the mouth movements are well timed, but {{that the rest of the}} characters' facial movements are [...] "static".|$|E

500|$|After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{disliked the}} series {{so much that}} he {{discouraged}} viewers from watching <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored. Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the [...] "woefully underdeveloped" [...] characters of Devil Survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible to figure out who exactly is a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension. Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain (or antihero) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined. This helps give an in-depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain.|$|E
500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast. In January 2007, Laura Michelle Kelly was cast as Lucy Barker. Timothy Spall {{was added to the}} cast, and said he was urged to audition by his daughter, who wanted him to work with Depp. He recalled, [...] "I really wanted this one – I knew Tim was directing and that Johnny Depp {{was going to be in}} it.

500|$|Academics {{began writing}} {{analyses}} of the film {{almost as soon as}} it was released, and the boom in home video formats helped establish a growing cult around the film, which scholars have dissected for its dystopic aspects, its questions regarding [...] "authentic" [...] humanity, its ecofeminist aspects, and its use of conventions from multiple genres. Popular culture began to reassess its impact as a classic several years after it was released. Roger Ebert praised the visuals of both the original and the Director's Cut versions and recommended <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin. He later added The Final Cut to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. Critic Chris Rodley and Janet Maslin theorized that Blade Runner changed cinematic and cultural discourse through its image repertoire, and subsequent influence on films. In 2012, Time film critic Richard Corliss surgically analyzed the durability, complexity, screenplay, sets and production dynamics from a personal, three-decade perspective. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Blade Runner holds an approval rating of 90% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece." [...] Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 89 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Denis Villeneuve, who directed the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, cites the film as a huge influence for him and many others.|$|E

I was however a bit concerned about the text, specifically the reference to 'devil daughters'. I said, 'As much as I love this song, I really can't sing <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason.' Peter Mensch offered to contact Cedric Bixler-Zavala and asked if the text could be changed, since the overall meaning of the song wasn't completely clear anyway. Cedric responded, [...] "Sure, she can change it. I would just {{like it to be}} known that in no way is the lyric supposed to paint women in a bad light... The song feels like it was written during the Salem Witch Trials, and it sarcastically takes the religious right wing slang of how all women were treated.

Its main goal was achieved in early May 1932, when Lang's government was dismissed by Sir Philip Game, the Governor of New South Wales. Lang had refused to pay interest on loans from overseas creditors, and withdrew government money from bank accounts to prevent the federal government from appropriating <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose. He was replaced as premier by Bertram Stevens, who led a coalition of the conservative United Australia Party and United Country Party to a landslide victory at the subsequent June 1932 state election.
