Specific research questions in this study are: What are the factors related to adaptive capacity in coastal communities of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic?</b> <b>Do</b> these factors vary between direct resource users and non-direct resource users? Do these factors vary amongst individuals who do and do not share household responsibility for income?^ Principal component analysis of responses to 26 likert statements resulted in seven factors related to occupational adaptive capacity: ability to plan, learn, and reorganize; attachment to occupation; occupational adaptability/flexibility; attachment to place; employment security; financial security; and occupational mobility. Factor scores were compared between direct resource users and non-direct resource users, as well as between individuals who are the sole providers of household income and those who share the responsibility of providing income to the home, to explore if there is a difference in vulnerability and adaptive capacity between these groups of coastal residents. Results suggest that responses to many of the factors related to vulnerability and adaptive capacity are similar for all coastal individuals. However, direct resource users displayed greater attachment to occupation and sole providers of household income exhibited lower financial security.

From the Japanese government's perspective, the goal of the emigration policy was to improve Japan's international reputation by having Japanese people {{contribute to the development of}} foreign countries. Latin America was the only potential outlet for emigration; the United States' Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 and Immigration Act of 1924 and Australia's White Australia policy eliminated the option of settlement in those two countries, while anti-Japanese sentiment in Asia due to Japan's wartime atrocities meant that none of those countries would accept Japanese migrants either. Rafael Trujillo, dictator of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> since 1930, for his part sought to use European and later Japanese migrants as a demographic buffer against black Haitian squatters, by settling them along the country's western border with Haiti.|$|R

Those around her were split in their opinions, reportedly, with Bill Clinton said to be the most in favor of her running again, Chelsea Clinton leaning towards it, but several of her closest aides against it.

Tropical cyclones are certainly powerful atmospheric hazards causing heavy rain, high wind and sea surge, but the related disasters are not falling from the sky. Disasters are always {{the combination of a}} hazardous event and vulnerable population. There {{is no such thing as}} a "natural disaster". Otherwise how can we explain the range of casualties in various communities affected by the same event with comparable winds and rains? For instance the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> and Haiti are located on the same island, but Jeanne claimed, respectively, less than twenty and over 2, 700 victims. This was perhaps an exceptional event, but if we look at the statistics for 1980 - 2003 the death toll per inhabitant exposed to cyclones is on average 4. 6 times higher in Haiti than in the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic.</b> <b>Does</b> wealth explain such an enormous difference?

However, sustainable approaches can be both subtle and radical for their application to this country.

The Passive House standard, which focuses on energy efficiency by super insulating and air tightening the envelope, {{is one of the}} most rigorous energy standards in Europe and the United States. Dominican vernacular architecture, without any specific set of standards uses the opposite approach of cross ventilation and open air. It has been proven itself to satisfy user’s needs for comfort since being colonized by Spain. With the help of design software that analyzes the energy performance of buildings, this thesis will compare, analyze and contrast the performance of an average Dominican house against modified versions that applies vernacular and passive house techniques.
