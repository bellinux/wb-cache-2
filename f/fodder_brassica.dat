40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the dispersal rate of wild cabbage root flies in agricultural systems, to test a migration hypothesis and the predictions of a computer simulation model. The dispersal rate was determined by a new method, from the age-grouping of wild flies instead of releasing marked culture flies. The mean distance dispersed was calculated from-the slope of density of captured flies on distance; the mean age was calculated from laboratory measurements of development at constant temperatures. A new method of male age determination was developed, based on the changes in pupal fat and testes colour. The published method of female age determination was improved to allow more rapid separation of nulliparous and parous flies. The values of the slope and intercept fitted to the-density- distance data were strongly correlated. A computer simulation demonstrated that random noise causes a progressive underestimation of the slope, as the catch decreases. The slope for gravid females reaches a limiting value of approxiamately 0. 2, indicating a mean distance dispersed of 500 m. A numerical integration suggests that 95 % of the flies move less than 580 m. There {{was no evidence of}} the female migratory phase, proposed by Finch & Skinner(1975), which was probably an artefact of the use of ANCS attractant. The dispersal rate was estimated at 49 - 165 m/day, compared with 29 - 87 m/day predicted by the simulation model. There was little evidence that dispersal alters with agricultural practice. A proportion of the first generation were found to delay emergence on one site, which may be connected with the planting of <b>fodder</b> <b>brassica</b> crops at midsummer.

40|$|Conservation {{involves}} sustaining {{of biological}} diversity as its main goal. Description of all taxa and their relative abundance {{are the most important}} components of biodiversity conservation within an ecosystem. Lepidoptera {{is one of the largest}} orders of the class Insecta. They are phytophagous as well as pollinators. Parasitoids are the biological control agents cosmopolitan in nature and keep check on caterpillars, by parasitizing them. Identifying and conserving these biological control agents is important as it allows us to rely less on chemicals, and hence reduce their impacts on ecosystems. The Braconidae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea) is among one of the largest families, being used successfully in biological control programs worldwide. The present study aimed at identifying the relative abundance of some of the braconids and their lepidopteran hosts from the cropland of district Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. For this purpose, sampling was carried out from four crops, namely wheat, <b>fodder,</b> <b>brassica</b> and vegetables, for one year from June, 2010 to May, 2011. Fodder was the most infested crop, with 37. 28 % of the total lepidopteran specimens, followed by vegetables (36. 25 %), brassica (23. 08 %) and the least being wheat (3. 38 %). A similar trend was observed for braconids, being 31. 90 %, 25. 38 %, 21. 63 % and 21. 08 % for fodder, vegetables, brassica and wheat, respectively. Host-parasitoid associations, helpful in designing biological control programs, were assessed by regression analysis. Pieris brassicae showed the best probable association with Heterospilus spp., Cotesia flavipes and Cotesia vestalis, having R 2 values as 0. 96, 0. 95 and 0. 94, respectively. Quantification of foraging of lepidopteran caterpillars was done to understand suitability of different host plants for cultural control measures. P. brassicae was found to be the most destructive species, with maximum larval duration of 17. 67 Â± 0. 47 days on brassica plants, followed by Helicoverpa armigera 17. 00 Â± 0. 82 days on cauliflower. Trichoplusia ni had maximum larval duration of 14. 3 Â± 0. 47 days on cabbage, and those of Spodoptera exigua had 14. 00 Â± 0. 47 days on cauliflower. The average consumption of all food offered by larvae of P. brassicae, H. armigera, T. ni and S. exigua was calculated as 14. 67 Â± 5. 75 g, 11. 76 Â± 5. 25 g, 10. 75 Â± 5. 25 g and 8. 99 Â± 6. 15 g respectively. Brassica was the preferred crop for P. brassicae, as maximum larval length (36. 45 Â± 0. 05 mm), pupal length (20. 00 Â± 0. 82 mm) and adult length (43. 00 Â± 0. 81 mm) was observed when larvae fed on this crop. Cauliflower was the preferred diet for S. exigua and H. armigera. Both of the species showed maximum size of larvae (35. 4 Â± 0. 00 mm, and 47. 00 Â± 0. 00 mm), pupae (18. 33 Â± 0. 47 mm and 19. 67 Â± 0. 47 mm) and adults (26. 00 Â± 0. 47 mm and 35 Â± 0. 81 mm), respectively, when fed on cauliflower. P. brassicae was found to be a potential host for two species of the genus Cotesia, namely C. vestalis and C flavipes. In the present study Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs) could only be developed for species identification of T. ni due to experimental and financial limits. Such types of studies are very helpful in designing biological control programs for assessment and control of economic pests...|$|E
40|$|The paleohexaploid crop Brassica rapa harbors an {{enormous}} reservoir of morphological variation, encompassing leafy vegetables, vegetable and <b>fodder</b> turnips (<b>Brassica</b> rapa, ssp. campestris), and oil crops, with different crops having very different leaf morphologies. In the triplicated B. rapa genome, many genes have multiple paralogs {{that may be}} regulated differentially and contribute to phenotypic variation. Using a genetical genomics approach, phenotypic data from a segregating doubled haploid population derived from a cross between cultivar Yellow sarson (oil type) and cultivar Pak choi (vegetable type) were used to identify loci controlling leaf development. Twenty-five colocalized phenotypic quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contributing to natural variation for leaf morphological traits, leaf number, plant architecture, and flowering time were identified. Genetic analysis showed that four colocalized phenotypic QTLs colocalized with flowering time and leaf trait candidate genes, with their cis-expression QTLs and cis- or trans-expression QTLs for homologs of genes {{playing a role in}} leaf development in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The leaf gene BRASSICA RAPA KIP-RELATED PROTEIN 2 _A 03 colocalized with QTLs for leaf shape and plant height; BRASSICA RAPA ERECTA_A 09 colocalized with QTLs for leaf color and leaf shape; BRASSICA RAPA LONGIFOLIA 1 _A 10 colocalized with QTLs for leaf size, leaf color, plant branching, and flowering time; while the major flowering time gene, BRASSICA RAPA FLOWERING LOCUS C_A 02, colocalized with QTLs explaining variation in flowering time, plant architectural traits, and leaf size. Colocalization of these QTLs points to pleiotropic regulation of leaf development and plant architectural traits in B. rapa...|$|R
