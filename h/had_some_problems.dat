25|$|In Florida a {{small number}} of protesters staged a naked protest on Palm Beach. They {{initially}} <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> getting permission for the action, but on the Thursday before, a U.S. District court ruled that the planned nude protest was legal at the public beach. Most of the attendees had come from the four-day Mid-Winter Naturist Festival that was taking place at the same time. There was also a demonstration of 900 people (USA Today estimate) on the island of Puerto Rico.|$|E

25|$|Northamptonshire {{lost the}} wicket of Bilal Shafayat in their eight overs before stumps on day two but {{could still be}} {{reasonably}} pleased with the first two days' play. However, on the third day, their side collapsed with Gareth Andrew taking three for 31 as they crashed to 100 all out – Ian Blackwell removing two in his only over, which was also a maiden. In chasing 155, Somerset <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> in tackling the bowling of Johann Louw, who took two wickets, but still managed a relatively comfortable six-wicket win.|$|E
25|$|Though it <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems,</b> {{the earlier}} M.35 proved {{sufficient}} {{to show the}} idea had merits, and the larger M.39 was drawn up as a twin-engined design prepared to meet Specification B.11/41 which had been issued by the Air Ministry for a high speed bomber. The specification had been written for the P.1005 proposal by Hawker, powered by two Napier Sabre engines, estimated to achieve 400+ mph at 25,000ft and deliver a 2,000lb bomb load over 1,600 miles. The P.1005 was cancelled after several delays {{on behalf of the}} Air Ministry and before Miles submitted his design to the Ministry in July. In November 1943 a full-size prototype (to use the serial RR910) was ordered, but not built.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 9, Rick Mastracchio and Clay Anderson {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Their tasks included hooking up the ammonia and nitrogen lines to the new Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA), installing the old ATA in the shuttle's payload bay, retrieving some Micro-Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) shields, bolting a grapple bar (which had been removed from the old ATA) onto the new ATA, and preparation of some cables on the Z1 truss and tools to be used during STS-132. During the installation of the old ATA in Discoverys payload bay, the spacewalkers <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> securing a bolt on the ATA to the LMC. The spacewalk took 6 hours and 24 minutes, bringing the total EVA time to 20 hours and 19 minutes. While the EVA was going on, commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki continued transferring items from the MPLM to the ISS. Transfer is more than seventy-five percent complete.|$|E

25|$|Glamorgan {{never had}} a settled team {{and there were a}} number of new arrivals at the end of the season {{including}} Gilbert Parkhouse, Jim Eaglestone, Norman Hever and Phil Clift. This might suggest a club in transition but there were grounds for optimism which were realised in 1948 when the club won its first championship. Glamorgan's bowling in 1947 suffered an early blow when their only real pace bowler Peter Judge was ruled out for the season after being injured in only the second match. Dynamic captain Wilf Wooller had to carry the seam attack almost single-handedly and took 85 wickets in addition to scoring 1,270 runs. Glamorgan relied mostly on spin with Len Muncer and the veteran Johnnie Clay bowling off breaks and opening batsman Emrys Davies helping out with his slow left. Davies created a county record by scoring five centuries in the season and formed an effective opening partnership with Arnold Dyson, both of them scoring more than 1,500 runs in the championship. Future Test player Allan Watkins exceeded 1,000 runs and there were some good innings by Wat Jones and George Lavis. The main wicketkeeper was Haydn Davies who claimed 47 victims in the championship but <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> with a damaged hand. Other players included veteran Austin Matthews in his final season, Jim Pleass, Arthur Porter and Maurice Robinson.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing the bolts and hooks that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts. Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The crew {{will be able to}} ingress it tomorrow, but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared the tools that they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> with its communications equipment.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair would shortly stop {{producing}} calculators {{and instead}} focus on computers, {{starting with the}} MK14 in 1977. The loss of the calculator market was {{due in part to}} technological development leading to smaller and cheaper components, which put heavy pressure on profit margins. An import levy of up to 17.5% was placed on components, but the duty for calculators imported from Japan or Hong Kong could be as little as 5%, making it unprofitable to produce calculators in the UK. Sinclair also <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> with the reliability of earlier calculators that had adversely affected its reputation, but the Sovereign was sold with a [...] "full and unconditional" [...] five year guarantee.|$|E

500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> in filming some scenes. Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an {{incredible}} adventure, but it's also been really difficult, {{because there are}} so many people, and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Evra {{initially}} <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> {{adapting to}} the English game. He made his debut for the club on 14 January in a 3–1 away defeat to Manchester City in the Premier League. He was substituted out at half-time after failing to make an impact. After {{the conclusion of the}} match, Ferguson stated, [...] "Maybe {{it was a bit of}} a gamble playing Evra," [...] while the player himself admitted that [...] "playing for Manchester United was something I was not prepared for". Despite the initial set-back, Evra started in the team's ensuing match against Liverpool, a 1–0 victory, and was praised for his performance by teammate Rio Ferdinand. On 26 February, Evra appeared as a substitute in United's 4–0 win over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 League Cup final. On 2 March, it was reported that Liverpool defender Steve Finnan had racially abused Evra in the match. The abuse claims surfaced from two deaf television viewers lodging a police complaint. The viewers claimed to have lip-read Finnan abusing Evra during the televised match. Finnan denied the charge and, after an investigation, The Football Association (FA) decided against charging the player. Evra regularly alternated between the bench and the starting 11 to close out the campaign. He finished the season with 14 total appearances for his new club.|$|E
500|$|By 2008, her {{continued}} {{drug problems}} threatened her career. Even as Nick Gatfield, {{the president of}} Island Records, {{toyed with the idea}} of releasing Winehouse [...] "to deal with her problems," [...] he remarked on her talent, saying, [...] "It's a reflection of her status [...] that when you flick through the TV coverage [...] it's her image they use." [...] Post-Grammys, some questioned whether Winehouse should have been honoured with the awards given her recent personal and drug problems, including Natalie Cole, who introduced Winehouse at the ceremony and who herself battled substance-abuse problems while winning a Grammy for Best New Artist in 1975. (Winehouse was prevented from travelling to and performing at the Grammy Awards ceremony in the US due to failing a drug test.) In a newspaper commentary, the executive director of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Antonio Maria Costa, said that the alleged drug habits of Winehouse and other celebrities sent a bad message [...] "to others who are vulnerable to addiction" [...] and undermine the efforts of other celebrities trying to raise awareness of problems in Africa, now that more cocaine used in Europe passes through that continent. Winehouse's spokesperson noted that [...] "Amy has never given a quote about drugs or flaunted it in any way. She's <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> and is trying to get better. The U.N. should get its own house in order." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{requirements}} {{for a new}} class of dreadnoughts were in a state of flux during 1907, but Vickers Ltd submitted a design that met the latest specifications and was very nearly accepted by the Navy for a [...] ship with twelve [...] guns in triple, superimposed turrets. However rumors of a contract with Vickers raised a public outcry as they <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> with the armored cruiser [...] then building in England. The Naval Ministry defused the situation on 30 December 1907 by announcing an international design contest with the ship built in Russia regardless of the nationality of the winning firm. By the deadline of 12 March 1908 a total of 51 designs had been submitted by 13 different shipyards. The winner of the competition was a design from the German firm of Blohm & Voss, but the French protested that {{they did not want to}} see any of the money that they had loaned Russia to build up its defenses in German pockets. The Russians bought the design for 250,000 rubles and shelved it to placate both sides. A design by the Baltic Works had been the runner-up and was revised for the Navy's updated requirements with a complete design to be presented by 22 March 1909. This was extended by a month to allow the Baltic Works to finalize its contract with the British firm of John Brown & Company for design assistance with the hull form and machinery.|$|E
500|$|Preparation for All Hope Is Gone {{began in}} 2007. Drummer Joey Jordison explained, [...] "I've {{told them to}} demo {{whatever}} they can so we've got as much material to choose from as possible." [...] In February 2008, Slipknot entered the Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa with producer Dave Fortman. All Hope Is Gone is the band's first album written and recorded in their home state of Iowa. Bassist Paul Gray explained that the band decided to record in Iowa because {{there were too many}} distractions in Los Angeles, where production of their previous albums had taken place. The band also stated that being close to home was good for their mindset; vocalist Corey Taylor drove home every night to see his son. Unlike Slipknot's previous releases, the album's writing process involved all nine band members, who wrote over 30songs. Jordison commented, [...] "I {{have to say that the}} band is at its peak; everyone—I mean everyone—is now completely involved in the writing process, and it's a beautiful thing." [...] Taylor felt the writing process <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems,</b> but also noted that the creation of every Slipknot album has had conflict and that the band has come to embrace it after realizing that the conflict helps to bring out their creativity. Taylor and guitarist Jim Root paired up with Sid Wilson, performing on keyboards, and percussionist Shawn Crahan to work on [...] "oblique, arty pieces". Taylor also experimented with tracking in an old well, stating, [...] "There was this natural reverb to it that was just intense." [...] According to Crahan none of the experimental tracks made it onto the album. However, one of them, [...] "Til We Die", appears as a bonus track on the album's special edition along with [...] "Child Of Burning Time" [...] and the similarly experimental Bloodstone Mix of [...] "Vermillion Pt. 2". The track [...] "Sulfur" [...] was the first combined effort of Jordison and Root, who wrote the song in one evening.|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} bricks were moderately received but <b>had</b> <b>some</b> <b>problems</b> from a technical standpoint: their [...] "locking" [...] ability was limited, {{and they were}} not versatile.

[...] However, since these comments, many Muslims and non-Muslims have come out in defence of Mourinho, saying that no offense was meant towards the player, but while the manager could have been more tactful in his treatment of the issue {{it stands to reason that}} a lack of food and water will affect a player's stamina and energy level.|$|E
