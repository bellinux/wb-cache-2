Upon {{returning}} to Metropolis in his human identity of Clark Kent, he is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance.|$|E
5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{man who had been}} happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E

According to Sukumar, Gautham looked like the actor <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child. When the {{director}} approached Mahesh and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, Gautham Krishna was only six and they were apprehensive. His introduction scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein, since the boy was afraid of gunfire. Naveen Polisetty played a supporting role as Mahesh's friend in the film, and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist. Nassar, Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles.|$|E

25|$|Over half {{a century}} since their last short film was released, the Three Stooges remain popular with audiences. Their films have never left American {{television}} since first appearing in 1958, {{and they continue to}} delight old fans while attracting new admirers. They were a hard-working group of comedians who were never the critics' darlings, a durable act who endured several personnel changes in their careers that would have permanently sidelined a less persistent act. The Stooges would not have lasted as long as they <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unit without Moe Howard's guiding hand.|$|E
25|$|Deux Amis left Jersey on 23 May and at 3:30 in {{the morning}} she hit a rock. Despite efforts to save her, water entered the ship faster than the pumps could remove it.

While Deux Amis was in distress at sea, local fishing boats came to help; once she ran ashore, the local populace gave priority to plundering rather than rescue. When Captain Green of the North Hants militia heard what was happening, he and his officers sent a strong detachment to enforce order.|$|E

25|$|Prominent BBC {{appointments}} {{are constantly}} {{assessed by the}} British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, {{as well as a}} friend of Tony Blair. The BBC's current Political Editor, Nick Robinson, was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of The Independent, a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000.|$|E

In 1977, Lyle donated copies of her tape recordings to the National Library of Australia. The work she <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute of Harvard University in 1974-75 gave her increased visibility as a ballad scholar and led to many more visits to Harvard, including an appointment at the Center for the Study of World Religions in 1995.|$|E
25|$|The Burley and Burnell estates in South Shropshire {{were closely}} entwined {{with those of}} Sir Richard Ludlow, a much more {{powerful}} landowner who had inherited eleven manors in Shropshire. For about a decade, until Ludlow's death late in 1390, Burley worked closely with {{him as one of}} his feoffees. For example, Burley was {{one of a group of}} feoffees whom Ludlow was licensed to appoint on 20 January 1383 in relation to lands at Hodnet and elsewhere, the aim being to ensure they passed to John Ludlow, Richard's brother, should he die sine prole, as he actually <b>did.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> feoffee Burley exercised many of Ludlow's responsibilities and powers on his behalf. The register of Joh Gilbert, the Bishop of Hereford, shows that Burley jointly exercised the advowson of the church at Wistanstow, presenting Edmund de Ludlowe as rector on 6 August 1385.|$|E

25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded better than we <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that sounds more like the music I listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E
25|$|The {{gas line}} {{from the back of}} the house's furnace had been pulled out in an attempt to conceal {{evidence}} of the homicide. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate 10 hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. Burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the remains of the burnt out house. They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10). Investigators have theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what he <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{continued}} her stellar play in her sophomore year; her coaches {{noticed that she}} was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> freshman, but usually only if {{she thought she was}} playing well. By the end of her sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference, an honor she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year, only the third time in history a sophomore had claimed the honor. The other two sophomore recipients were UConn's Maya Moore and Oklahoma's Courtney Paris. Stewart started and played in all 40 games of 2013–2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per contest, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn annals. Her 324 boards marked the 12th-highest single-season total in school history, and her 110 rejections was the third-highest mark.|$|E
