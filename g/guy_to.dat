5|$|Instead of a {{conventional}} script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its storyboard, which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> create the series.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> {{publish a}} comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become interested in making it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E

With {{the advent of}} league football in Bradford, thousands of people came to home games, resulting in the club's end-of-season receipts totalling £3,896. It resulted in a small operating loss from the first season, but donations helped the club record a profit of £39 in their first season in the Football League.

5|$|The Griffin {{family first}} {{appeared}} on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998. Family Guy was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show MADtv, but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought {{that that was the}} place to create a prime-time animation show. Family Guy was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.|$|E

The episode also featured the first official crossover between Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, and included cameo appearances by several of The Cleveland Shows main characters. The episode was first announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E

25|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Gilmore Girls {{received}} {{financial support from}} the script development fund of the Family Friendly Programming Forum, which includes some of the nation's leading advertisers, {{making it one of}} the first network shows to reach the air with such funding.

Her husband Daniel Palladino was a consultant and occasional writer for the first season, then agreed to quit his producer position on Family <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> commit to Gilmore Girls; he became an executive producer with the second season, and also played a major role. The show's third executive producer was Gavin Polone.|$|E
25|$|The mid-thirteenth century Old French Continuation of William of Tyre (formerly {{attributed}} to Ernoul) claims that Agnes advised {{her son to}} marry Sibylla to Guy, and that Amalric had brought <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem specifically for him to marry Sibylla. However, this is improbable: given {{the speed with which}} the marriage was arranged, Guy must have already been in the kingdom when the decision was made. With the new King of France, Philip II, a minor, the chief hope of external aid was Baldwin's first cousin Henry II, who owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage on account of the Thomas Becket affair. Guy was a vassal of Richard of Poitou and Henry II, and as a formerly rebellious vassal, it was in their interests to keep him overseas.|$|E

25|$|Andrew Hamilton Russell, {{known as}} <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> his family, {{was born on}} 23 February 1868 at Napier, New Zealand, the oldest son of a farmer and his wife. The Russell family had a long {{military}} history {{dating back to the}} Napoleonic Wars; Guy's great-grandfather served in the Black Watch Regiment and his grandfather, also named Andrew Hamilton Russell, fought in the New Zealand Wars of the 1840s with the 58th Regiment. After retiring from the British Army, Guy's grandfather took up farming in the Hawke's Bay region of the North Island of New Zealand. His sons followed in his footsteps, and Guy's father, another Andrew Hamilton Russell, also served in the 58th Regiment and ran an isolated sheep station with his brother in the Hawke's Bay.|$|E
25|$|Guy's {{decision}} to leave the secure base provided by his well-watered assembly point at La Saphorie, {{was the result of}} a Crusader war council held the night of July 2. Though reports of what happened at this meeting are biased due to personal feuds among the Franks, it seems Raymond argued that a march from Acre to Tiberias was exactly what Saladin wanted while La Saphorie was a strong position for the Crusaders to defend. Furthermore, Guy shouldn't worry about Tiberias, which Raymond held personally and was willing to give up for the safety of the kingdom. In response to this argument, and despite their reconciliation (internal court politics remaining strong), Raymond was accused of cowardice by Gerard and Raynald. The latter influenced <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> attack immediately.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 4, the crusaders were blinded by smoke from the fires set by Saladin's forces. The Ayyubid army was arrayed in three divisions: the centre under Saladin, the right under his nephew Al-Muzaffar Umar (Taki ad-Din) and the left, {{commanded}} by Gökböri. The Franks came under fire from Muslim mounted archers from the division commanded by Gökböri, who had been resupplied with 400 loads of arrows that had been brought up during the night. Gerard and Raynald advised <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> form battle lines and attack, which was done by Guy's brother Amalric. Raymond led the first division with Raymond of Antioch, the son of Bohemund III of Antioch, while Balian and Joscelin III of Edessa formed the rearguard.|$|E

25|$|Ham, {{founder and}} chief {{executive}} officer of the Young Earth creationist (YEC) ministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), challenged Nye, a science educator best known for hosting the 1990s television series Bill Nye the Science <b>Guy,</b> <b>to</b> the debate after taking exception to a YouTube video featuring Nye lamenting the refusal of a large segment of the U.S. population to accept the theory of evolution. Tickets to the event sold out within minutes, and according to a Christian public relations firm an estimated 3 million people viewed the event live via video streams on the Internet. During the debate, Ham advocated the legitimacy of a YEC model of the universe's origins, while Nye cited observations from a variety of scientific fields to defend the scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old.|$|E
25|$|Saladin {{decided to}} launch a {{full-scale}} invasion against the kingdom and started mustering his forces from his whole empire in early 1187. The barons of the realm convinced <b>Guy</b> <b>to</b> seek a reconciliation with Raymond. The masters of the two military orders, Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre, Raynald of Sidon and Balian of Ibelin were appointed to start negotiations with Raymond in Tiberias. Saladin's son, Al-Afdal, sent Muzaffar al-Din, lord of Harenc and Edessa, to make a raid against the kingdom. In accordance with his treaty with Saladin, Raymond allowed the Syrian troops a free entry to Galilee. After Al-Afdal began raiding the region of Nazareth, the masters of the military orders, Gerard of Ridefort and Roger des Moulins, attacked the invaders although the enemy forces extremely outnumbered their retinue. The raiders almost annihilated the crusaders at the springs of Cresson on 1 May. Only Ridefort and three knights could escape from the battlefield. The Estoire de Eracles blamed Ridefort for the catastrophe, emphasizing that Raymond's envoys had warned him not to attack the large Syrian army. The invaders rode back to Syria across Galilee, displaying the severed heads of the crusaders {{who had been killed}} in the battle on the points of their lances.|$|E
