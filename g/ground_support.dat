5|$|Aerial {{support for}} the {{offensive}} was provided by Luftflotte 5 and the Finnish Air Force. The Luftwaffe created a new headquarters for the operation and moved it into Finland. The Finnish air force fielded about 230 aircraft of various types. Luftflotte 5 assigned 60 planes to Silver Fox and used Junkers Ju 87, Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft for <b>ground</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Sino-Japanese War, Hōshō {{returned}} to the Third Fleet and supported land operations of the army in China around August or October 1937 with Ryūjō, later joined by Kaga. Hōshō's air unit began flying <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> missions in the Shanghai area on 16 July. Three of the ship's Nakajima A2N fighters engaged two Martin B-10 heavy bombers on 25 July, shooting down one of them.|$|E
5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's flight operations, no human being had yet flown in space. In fact, the task before him was vast, {{requiring}} attention to flight plans, timelines, procedures, mission rules, spacecraft tracking, telemetry, <b>ground</b> <b>support,</b> telecommunications networks and contingency management.|$|E

5|$|T1E4/M13 – The Martin turret was {{replaced}} by the M33 and was based on the M3 Half-track. It was accepted as the M13 Half-track in July 1942. A total of 139 examples of this variant saw action at Anzio as a <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> weapon used to repel heavy German attacks. It {{was replaced}} by the M16 in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{artificial}} intelligence in Halo has been favorably received. Enemies take cover and use suppressive fire and grenades. Some enemies retreat when their superiors are killed. The player is often aided by United Nations Space Command (UNSC) Marines, who offer <b>ground</b> <b>support,</b> such as manning gun turrets or riding shotgun while the player is driving a vehicle.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

EVA Air has partnered with General Electric since 1998 to operate the Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation (EGAT), a heavy maintenance and aircraft overhaul service. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation provides safety, repair, and refit services for EVA Air, other airlines' aircraft, and has handled the modification of four Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter aircraft for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program.|$|E
5|$|Graf, a pre-war {{football}} player and glider pilot, {{he joined the}} Luftwaffe and started flight training in 1936. He was initially selected for transport aviation but was subsequently posted to Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51—51st Fighter Wing) in May 1939. At the outbreak of war he was stationed on the Franco–German border flying uneventful patrols. He was then posted as a flight instructor stationed in Romania {{as part of a}} German military mission training Romanian pilots. Graf flew a few <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> missions in the closing days of the German invasion of Crete.|$|E
5|$|In December 1941, Noel F Parrish {{became the}} Director of Training at the school. By {{the end of}} 1942 Parrish had been {{promoted}} {{to the position of}} Tuskegee Army Air Field Commander. As Director of Training and later Tuskegee Field commander, Parrish {{played a key role in}} the program's success. There were approximately 14,000 <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> personnel at Tuskegee Field during WW II and almost 1,000 graduating pilots, of which about 450 saw active combat during the war.|$|E

5|$|Indiana {{returned}} to Puget Sound naval yard for a needed overhaul. The work lasted until January 1945; the ship {{returned to}} active duty on the 24th of that month. Indiana {{took part in the}} bombardment of Iwo Jima, as well as in attacks on the Japanese home islands. Following the shore bombardments, Indiana joined the task force that had assembled to invade Okinawa; the ship provided <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> fire as well as anti-aircraft defense against the increasing number of Kamikazes that were attacking the invasion fleet. Indiana continued in these duties {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945.|$|E
5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E
5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
50|$|With his friend's help, Goffeney {{developed}} his own technique, learning guitar and bass. He would lay the guitar on the <b>ground,</b> <b>supporting</b> the neck with whatever {{he could get}} his feet on. He would strum with his left foot and make chords with his right.|$|R

5|$|The American {{troops were}} also {{supported}} by air and naval units. At {{the time of}} the counterattack, the US Navy force assigned to the island comprised the six destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 22, a squadron of PT boats, a small number of Landing Craft Infantry fitted as gunboats and several armed landing craft. The air units on Bougainville (designated AirSols) had 64 SBD Dauntless dive bombers and 32 TBF Avenger torpedo bombers available for <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> tasks.|$|E
5|$|The M13 {{served at}} the landing at Anzio with the VI Corps of the Fifth United States Army in January 1944. It {{was used as an}} {{anti-aircraft}} weapon during the initial landing and then later as a <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> weapon to repel heavy German panzer attacks on the beachhead. It was replaced three months later by the M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage in April 1944. Only 139 examples were deployed overseas by the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> echelon of the 509th Composite Group {{moved by}} rail on April 26, 1945, to its port of {{embarkation}} at Seattle, Washington. On May 6 the support elements sailed on the SS Cape Victory for the Marianas, while group materiel was shipped on the SS Emile Berliner. The Cape Victory made brief port calls at Honolulu and Eniwetok but the passengers were not permitted to leave the dock area. An advance party of the air echelon, consisting of 29 officers and 61 enlisted men flew by C-54 to North Field on Tinian, between May 15 and May 22.|$|E

5|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War, the {{probability}} of a ground invasion of Switzerland ended, substantially changing Swiss military doctrine and resulting in reduction of both the budget {{and the size of the}} Swiss Armed Forces. In Armed Forces Reform 95, and its supporting program Defense Guidelines 95, the Air Force retained its basic structure and organization, but became a totally independent service, now called the Swiss Air Force, on 1January 1996. For the first time since its inception, subordination of the counter-air role to the <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> mission ended, and defense of domestic airspace was made its highest priority and primary task.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct <b>ground</b> <b>support</b> damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
