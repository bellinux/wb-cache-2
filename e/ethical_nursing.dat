One such claim is that <b>ethical</b> <b>nursing</b> is what happens when a good nurse does the right thing. The purpose of this descriptive, qualitative study was therefore to examine nurses ’ per-ceptions {{of what it means to}} be a good nurse and to do the right thing. Fifty-three nurses responded to two open-ended questions: (1) a good nurse is one who [...] .; and (2) how does a nurse go about doing the right thing? Three hundred and thirty-one data units were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Seven categories emerged: personal characteristics, professional characteristics, patient centredness, advocacy, competence, critical thinking and patient care. Participants viewed <b>ethical</b> <b>nursing</b> as a complex endeavour in which a variety of decision-making frameworks are used. Consistent with virtue ethics, high value was placed on both intuitive and analytical personal attributes that nurses bring into nursing by virtue of the persons they are.

Many structural, economic, and sociopolitical challenges confront Ugandan nurses in their efforts to incorporate compassion into their care of persons with HIV illness. After reviewing the literature related to compassion fatigue, the author describes nursing in sub-Saharan Africa and presents a qualitative study exploring the impact of education on 24 nurses’ lives, including their capacity to avoid or mitigate the development of compassion fatigue. Data were collected through interviews, observation, and focus group discussions. Findings illustrate the barriers participants faced in providing competent care and the liberating effects of new knowledge and skills.

The major point is that the kind of nursing ethics education that is given reflects the theory that is held of nursing. Three components of a fundamental <b>ethical</b> view on <b>nursing</b> are analysed more deeply: (1) nursing considered as moral practice; (2) the intersubjective character of nursing; and (3) moral perception. It is argued that the fundamental <b>ethical</b> view on <b>nursing</b> goes together with a virtue ethics approach. Suggestions are made for the ethics education of nurses. In particular, three implications are considered: (1) an attitude versus action-orientated ethics education; (2) an integral versus rationalistic ethics education; and (3) a contextual model of ethics education.

The study sample consisted of 269 nurses working in three training-treatment hospitals affiliated to Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. These nurses selected by census sampling method. For assessing the <b>ethical</b> development of <b>nurses,</b> nursing dilemma test was used. This questionnaire was designed based on Kohlbergs’ theory of ethical development and assessed ethical development in pre-convetional, conventional and post-convetional levels.

40|$|M. Cur. (Nursing Management) Empowerment is {{a process}} of {{increasing}} learner nurses’ access to independent thought and creating an environment to allow him/her to experience the autonomy of the effects of independent thoughts (Harris, 2005 : 49). In this study the term empowerment refers to participative decision-making, power-sharing and motivation of learner nurses by the operational manager in unit management. Third year learner nurses are placed or allocated in nursing units as part of their clinical training to acquire competencies in unit management. Through empowerment, operational managers need to support and guide learner nurses to attain competencies necessary to manage safe, competent, and <b>ethical</b> <b>nursing</b> care (Cho, Laschinger & Wong, 2006 : 46). The researcher had, during clinical accompaniment of third-year learner nurses, observed that they found it difficult to apply management principles and that learner nurses would complain that they were not empowered by operational managers to perform management activities. For the purpose of this quantitative, exploratory and descriptive study the objectives were to:  Explore and describe empowerment of the third-year learner nurses in unit management by operational managers in an academic hospital.  Develop recommendations for the operational managers to empower third-year learner nurses in unit management in an academic hospital.

The ability of forensic mental health nurses to provide competent and <b>ethical</b> <b>nursing</b> care is often compromised by personal, social, and political animosity regarding crime, criminality, and mental disorder.   Pausing to reflect on the stories of clients and nurses, within a narrative context, evokes understanding, and contributes to the creation of person centered care. In paper one, the coercive treatments experienced by a man who has spent many years in compulsory care in a variety of secure psychiatric settings is explored in response to his confession “I don’t dare to tell them I feel okay!” In paper two, how nurses transition to their roles as forensic nurses is considered as they straddle the custodial and therapeutic aspects of their work, often expressing concerns with their perceptions of “education of the fly” or “faking it ‘til you make it. ” In paper three, the mental health contributions of nurses who practice in prisons and correctional institutions is captured in the words “that’s why I bought into this profession, to instill hope and recovery. ” Through the examination of these vignettes that have emerged through research and practice, participants will be engaged in an interactive discussion as we consider the implications of narrative nursing vis-à-vis the vast tensions that exist between theory, practice, and research in forensic mental health nursing.   Finally, the universal nature of these issues, highlighting contributions from Sweden, Germany and Canada will be illustrated. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} moral {{distress}} was first {{developed in the}} mid 1980 ?s by the American philosopher Dr. Andrew Jameton. Since then, moral distress has been studied in many health care practice settings and among various disciplines. However, moral distress among nurses in community health care settings has remained largely unexplored. Community health nurses (CHNs) work with clients, families, and communities {{with a variety of}} diverse care needs. Therefore, in this research I cast a wide net by asking a broad question, ?What guides us here?? What guides nurses through the ethical landscape of community health nursing? The purpose of this research, then, is to explore CHNs experiences of everyday ethical issues and moral distress and identify educational opportunities for ongoing learning and support. To do this I used a narrative inquiry approach and interviewed 20 Canadian CHNs by phone. Based on my analysis of the data, categories of key ethical issues, themes, and educational needs were explored and identified. From the interview data, participants? stories were then re-storied by me into meta-narratives. Nine meta-narratives, inspired by multiple-participant interview responses, were created as an end product of this study. The meta-narratives represent stories that are true to life in the details regarding situations that the CHNs reported from their nursing practice. At the same time, however, the meta-narratives do not describe any one situation; rather they reflect aspects of several stories combined. Thus, the meta-narratives offer protection of confidentiality, provide an evidence-based, detailed account of these experiences, and are educational resources for CHNs. I also designed and had participants evaluate an educational intervention {{in the form of a}} self-directed e-learning module (e-module). Based on the research findings, I offer recommendations for action to promote <b>ethical</b> <b>nursing</b> practice and support CHNs, which include implications for education, theory, research, and nursing practice.

Para el análisis se ha realizado el estudio de su principal obra y su epistolario, además de fuentes secundarias de teóricas mas recientes, quienes han desarrollado sus propias teorías y modelos a partir de la lógica del pensamiento nightingaleano.

40|$|Part of {{the mandate}} of the Canadian Nursing Association is to develop and {{maintain}} a 'code of ethics'. Provincial professional nursing associations have largely based their own ethical frameworks on this code. However, as Mitchell and Benner have argued, ethical codes fail to capture some essential elements of the <b>ethical</b> life of <b>nurses.</b> This signals a need for a more accurate and experience based <b>ethical</b> framework for <b>nurses.</b> One such attempt is a document published by the Registered Nurses Association of Ontario entitled 'Client Centred Care' that presents an ethical framework that relies on a nurses' practical wisdom and that emphasizes individual experiences of ethical situations based on close relationships with patients. Some traditional ethical frameworks in the philosophical field have come under attack by Neo-Aristotelian Virtue Ethicists for the same reasons. These philosophers, including Wiggins, Maclntyre, Hursthouse, Zagzebski, and MacDowell, have supplemented unsatisfactory, traditional ethical frameworks with one that emphasizes perception of salience, practical wisdom, and practice. Because they are similar in their approaches to ethical life, and in their criticisms of traditional ethical frameworks, 'Client Centred Care' lends itself well to the vocabulary and conceptual structure of Virtue Ethics. However, for all its merits, 'Client Centred Care' does not provide us with the rigor of a serious ethical text, leaving terms inadequately defined and many questions unanswered. This work is an effort to clarify the ethical claims of this text through the lens of Virtue Ethics.
