The first forty or fifty lines of these addenda are, no doubt, in their way, admirable, too; but many would prefer the Joan of Southey.|$|E
25|$|After {{these details}} emerged, at least 27 {{different}} lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws against Pilatus, Morvan and Arista Records. One such filing occurred on 22 November 1990, in Ohio, where lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit asking for refunds {{on behalf of}} a local woman in Cuyahoga County, who had bought <b>Girl</b> <b>You</b> Know It's True. At the time the lawsuit was filed, it was estimated at least 1,000 Ohio residents had bought the album. On 12 August 1991, a proposed settlement of a refund lawsuit in Chicago, Illinois, was rejected. This settlement would have refunded buyers of Milli Vanilli CDs, cassettes, records, or singles. However, the refunds would only be given as a credit for a future Arista release. On 28 August, a new settlement was approved; it refunded those who attended concerts along with those who bought Milli Vanilli recordings. An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund and they could keep the refunded recordings as well. The deadline to claim refunds passed on 8 March 1992.|$|E
500|$|I just wanna be the <b>girl</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>girl</b> <b>you</b> like". The closing {{minute of}} the song {{features}} a French spoken word interpolation, which translates roughly as: [...] "Do you like sex? Sex. I mean, the physical activity. Coitus. Do you like it? You're not interested in sex? Men think that feminists hate sex, but it's a very stimulating and natural activity that women love". David Haglund and Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine noted undeniable similarities between this spoken section and a similar quote by actress Julianne Moore in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. In May 2014, during an interview with Vanity Fair, Lewinsky addressed the lyrics of the song mentioning her, saying, [...] "Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we're verbing, I think you meant 'Bill Clinton'd all on my gown'".|$|E

500|$|... "My First Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Sean Foreman and Nathaniel Motte {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. The song was produced by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. While being interviewed by MTV, Foreman explained the song's inspiration: [...] "The song is about a <b>girl</b> <b>you</b> really like, and the story line of going through your first kiss with a girl to exploring further parts of the relationship." [...] While composing the song, Foreman and Motte decided {{that they needed to}} add a female to the song. Kesha, who had worked with Blanco and Luke, was asked to participate in the song and later came into the studio to contribute her lines.|$|E
500|$|Kristen Bell {{was chosen}} to portray Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. On casting the lead role, Thomas later commented, [...] "When you're casting 20-year-old hot <b>girl,</b> <b>you</b> {{see a lot of}} bad actors." [...] Bell felt that it was [...] "just luck" [...] that Rob Thomas saw that [...] "I have some sass to me, and that's exactly what he wanted". Bell thought that it was her {{cheerleader}} looks and an outsider's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned. Bell's life shared many similarities with that of her character—her father had [...] "an investigative bent", and her best friend died in high school in a car crash.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Cameron Duddy and Mars was released on October 15, 2012. The concept of the video shows Mars {{having a good time}} with his bandmates, doing things like smoking, drinking beer and playing games. He is also seen singing the song with his band at a club. The video has a vintage style reminiscent of VHS tapes. Mars explained to MTV News, [...] "The concept is just old-fashioned fun. No story line, it's not me singing to a <b>girl,</b> <b>you</b> get a good sense of what you're going to get live... It's very VHS-y. I love that man, it takes me back to my childhood, when the tracking is off and the color is off, there's a beauty in that.

So you put up one finger, put up another, and then 'Deuces. The song appeared as the opening track on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011).|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately <b>girl</b> <b>you</b> get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E

500|$|With the {{departure}} of several cast members throughout the seasons, many new characters {{were added to the}} drama's ensemble. McKidd and Capshaw were referred to as [...] "fresh additions" [...] to the series, by Monfette of IGN. In addition, Matt Roush of TV Guide commented: [...] "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to Grey's Anatomy in quite a while." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide noted that Robbins [...] "quickly established herself as a fan favorite", describing her as: [...] "a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace. On April Kepner and Jackson Avery Courtney Morrison of TVFanatic wrote [...] "April has grown since her character was introduced. She’s no longer much less annoying than she used to be, and she’s honest. A girl with principles is a <b>girl</b> <b>you</b> want to do well." [...] and described her and Avery as [...] "a couple for whom viewers can root". Speaking of the new cast members, in addition to the remaining original, Robert Bianco from USA Today called them the show's [...] "best ensemble in years".|$|E
500|$|... "You Rock My World" [...] is {{credited}} {{as being an}} uptempo disco-pop and R song that has vibrating vocal harmonies. The song is played in the time signature of common time in the key E minor, with Jackson's vocal range spanning from the tonal nodes of E4 to Bb5. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] has a moderate tempo of 95 [...] beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is Em7–C9-Bm7–Am7–D–Em7. The song's composition {{has been compared to}} Jackson's previous material with Quincy Jones from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the disco-theme from Jackson's 1979 single, [...] "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". Chris Tucker voices the vocal introduction of the song while all the instruments heard on the track were played by Jackson and Rodney Jerkins. Lyrically, the song's lyrics are about being in love, as well as the effect that it can have, as evident in the opening line, [...] "My life will never be the same, 'cause, <b>girl,</b> <b>you</b> came and changed the way I walk, the way I talk, I cannot explain".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, <b>girl,</b> <b>you</b> got me froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". Batey found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to how I felt at another moment." ...|$|E

Nina Bertok of Rip It Up, an Adelaide street press magazine, called the album a collection of [...] "tear-jerking ballads... pop nuggets... dance bangers" [...] and [...] "quirkier numbers". Bertok recommended the CSS remix of [...] "Buttons" [...] and awarded the compilation three out of five stars. One reviewer from the Sydney Star Observer wrote that [...] "Breathe Me" [...] stands as Sia's best song but thought her songs [...] "Don't Bring Me Down" [...] and [...] "I'm in Here" [...] should have been included on the album.|$|E
500|$|TV Week {{described}} Donna as [...] "beautiful and a {{free spirit}} {{who is also a}} little loud and obnoxious", while the Metro called her [...] "kooky."

The official Neighbours website states that Donna has become a warm, loveable, charming and playful girl. Her integration into the street and the lives of the other residents has matured Donna and she leads the normal life she always wanted. In May 2009, Robbie said that Donna is a [...] "really likeable character" [...] and that she gets to play out funny and crazy storylines while playing her. In November of that year, it was revealed that Robbie had begged the scriptwriters to let Donna go off the rails or go to rehab. Robbie said that she would like a dramatic storyline, but the show's G rating makes it difficult. Robbie also said that she enjoys playing Donna, as she is [...] "great" [...] and a [...] "bit crazy". She added [...] "I'm really glad I get to play her and not an average, boring teenage <b>girl.</b> <b>You</b> can be an average, boring teenage girl every other day of the week.

500|$|Nagy {{realized}} she would [...] "pass {{time in a}} different way" [...] to the novel, eliminating elements that were unnecessary and slowed down {{the story in the}} screenplay. She had [...] "great freedom" [...] developing the screenplay in England while no studio or director was attached and it was just her and the producer. Over the years, five [...] "proper" [...] drafts of the screenplay materialized. Nagy said that after all the previous collaborations on the script, [...] "working for Todd was easy and quick. We both have an interest in restraint." [...] Haynes and Nagy collaborated on honing the screenplay. When Haynes came on board they had discussions about [...] "what became the framing device"; the story reminded Haynes of the 1945 classic film Brief Encounter and he proposed a framing device {{similar to that of the}} classic film, which Nagy [...] "then ran with in a certain way". [...] "He was interested in the same things, tonally, that the script was interested in – which isn't always the case", she noted. [...] "We were able to keep that restraint going". Working with Haynes, Nagy made the story more enigmatic, pruning some of the backstory in light of a significant line that Carol says to Therese early in the film: [...] "What a strange <b>girl</b> <b>you</b> are, flung out of space." [...] Nagy and Haynes were comparably determined not to make [...] "an agenda film" [...] or a [...] "look how far we've come" [...] film.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I say to myself, 'Baby <b>girl,</b> <b>you</b> can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness.
