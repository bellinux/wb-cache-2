5|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production.|$|E

5|$|Sigmund Freud {{may have}} been among the first to stress the {{potential}} effect of loss of the mother on the developing child, but his concern was less with the actual experience of maternal care than with the anxiety the child might feel about the loss of the nourishing breast.

5|$|The Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Uranus, {{broke the}} thinly-held German flanks on 19 November; by 22 November, the encirclement of the 6th Army was complete. The {{concern of the}} {{propaganda}} organisations, both military and civilian, was how to present this military disaster to the public. Initially, every <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> hide the true scope of the events from the population. The communiqués published between 19 and 24 November merely mentioned the Soviet attack in the southern sector of the East front, not addressing the extent of Wehrmacht's difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts {{featured}} well-known voice actors {{for both}} the Japanese and English versions. The Japanese version featured Miyu Irino as Sora, Risa Uchida as Kairi, and Mamoru Miyano as Riku. Other notable voice actors included Kōichi Yamadera, Hideo Ishikawa, and Maaya Sakamoto. A special <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> preserve the official voice actors of characters from the Disney movies used in Kingdom Hearts. Some of the voice actors from the related television series or direct-to-video sequels were chosen over the original voice actors from films, where applicable (e.g. Dan Castellaneta as Genie, rather than Robin Williams). The English version featured Haley Joel Osment as Sora, David Gallagher as Riku, and Hayden Panettiere as Kairi. Other notable voice actors included Billy Zane, Christy Carlson Romano, David Boreanaz, James Woods, and Mandy Moore.|$|E
5|$|No {{immediate}} <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> {{start the}} works {{and they were}} postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases {{had to be made}} of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E

At the time, Džakula held the position of deputy prime minister, while Ećimović was a government minister in the RSK. Signatories on {{behalf of the}} Croatian local authorities were Zlatko Kos, Zdravko Sokić, Ivan Volf, Vladimir Delač and Želimir Malnar. Fischer signed the agreement as a witness. According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia testimony given by Džakula at the trial of Milan Martić, Ivan Milas was present at the signing of the agreement {{as a representative of the}} Government of Croatia, accompanied by Joško Morić, Croatian Deputy Interior Minister. According to Džakula, no <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> conceal the signing of the agreement, even though the negotiations beforehand were kept secret.|$|E
5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza {{complained that they}} had only received one ration {{of food and water}} within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for typhoid fever and tetanus, but the supply of syringes ran short. A large memorial service was held on October2 in a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the unemployment situation in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> recruit Cornish women {{to work in the}} mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. The trail of the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A degaussing cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, but it was still sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Later in the year, the U.S. {{launched}} its most intense and sustained attempt to force North Vietnam into peace negotiations. Almost {{all of the}} targets on the Joint Chiefs' list had been authorized for attack, including airfields that had been previously off limits. Only central Hanoi, Haiphong, and the PRC border area remained prohibited from attack. A major <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> isolate the urban areas by downing bridges and attacking LOCs. Also struck were the Thai Nguyen steel complex (origin of the Pardo's Push), thermal and electrical power plants, ship and rail repair facilities, and warehouses. North Vietnamese MiGs entered the battle en masse, as their capital was threatened and kill ratios fell to one U.S. aircraft lost for every two MiGs. During 1968, MiGs accounted for 22 percent of the 184 American aircraft (75 Air Force, 59 Navy, and five Marine Corps) lost over the north. As a result, operations against the last of North Vietnam's airfields, previously off-limits to attack, were authorized.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium were lined with Irish troops and sharpshooters in case violence broke out.|$|E
5|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular; there were {{divisions}} {{even within the}} Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word {{he did not want}} to be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.|$|E
