O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado em esquema fatorial de 2 x 4, com quatro ou cinco repetições, sendo a parcela constituída por um vaso com uma planta. Avaliou-se a severidade da <b>fusariose,</b> medindo-se o comprimento da lesão (cm) no colo da planta e o número de galhas no sistema radicular. As duas variedades mostraram-se suscetíveis a F. solani. Apenas na variedade Afruvec, a presença do nematoide resultou em aumento da <b>fusariose.</b> Quanto à reação ao nematoide, ‘Maguari’ comportou-se como resistente, tanto na presença como na ausência do fungo. Ao contrário, para a variedade Afruvec, a presença do fungo resultou em diminuição da resistência aonematoide, passando de moderadamente resistente para suscetível. <br<The present {{work was}} conducted in greenhouse conditions at APTA/Bauru, São Paulo State, during the first semester of 2007, {{with the objective of}} evaluating the resistance of two varieties of yellow passion fruit, Maguari and Afruvec, to the Fusarium solani- Meloidogyne incognita race 3 complex. The experimental delineation was entirely randomized in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement, with 4 - 5 repetitions, with the plot constituted by 1 vase containing 1 plant. The appraised parameters in the assay were disease severity, caused by F. solani, measuring the lesion length (cm) in the collar zone of plants and number of galls formed by M. incognita race 3 in the root system. The two varieties of yellow passion fruit showed susceptibility to F. solani. Only in the Afruvec variety, the presence of nematode resulted in increase of fusariosis. As for resistance to the phytonematode, the Maguary variety was classified as resistant in {{the presence or absence of}} Fusarium. In contrast, for the Afruvec variety, the presence of Fusarium resulted in reduction of resistance to the nematode, going from moderately resistant to susceptible...|$|E

40|$|Fusarium {{diseases}} in winter wheat are {{serious problem in}} today's cereal production. The Fusarium species are seedborne pathogens {{and are able to}} cause seeding blight when are presented in seeds or in the soil. In later stages of plant development the same pathogens may infect heads with consequent scab and accumulation of Fusarium metabolites in kernels and chaff. Fusarium metabolites exhibit phytotoxic properties to cereal tissues and are inhibitors of seed germination and seedling growth. The main aim of my final thesis was to watch plants of winter wheat attacked by <b>fusarioses</b> during vegetation and to verify possibilities of protection against this disease. All experiments were executed in Agricultural Research Institute Kromeriz. Reactions of sorts of winter wheat to Fusarium culmorum were tested in the field trials inoculated with conidial suspension during 1994 and 1995. At the turn of 1995 was proved influence of fungicides on the yield of winter wheat inoculated with the same pathogen. In the investigated and the possibility of chemical protection was veryfied. Also the attack of germinated kernels was evaluated and influence of fungicides for protection of seed in laboratory conditions was tested. From above mentioned results there are following successive conclusions: 1. Sorts of winter wheat Alka, Ilona and Hana show good tolerance against Fusarium head blight. 2. Application of effective fungicides expressively decreases attack by Fusasrium head blight. In the trials very good effect proved fungicides Sportak 45 EC, Opus and Tango, but too Alert, Alto Combi 420 SC and Folicur Plus 375 EC. 3. Very good results were achieved with application of reduced doses of the fungicides. This is very interesting from the economic and ecologic point of view too. 4. In regions with long-term of snow cover it is better to grow sorts with higher tolerance against <b>fusarioses,</b> respectively snow mould. In the trials the best result achieved German sort of winter wheat Trane. 5. Application of the fungicides against <b>fusarioses</b> during dormancy is unnecessary. 6. In all casses is very advantageous the seed treatment. As fungicid with the highest effect against <b>fusarioses</b> was evaluated Prelude SP WS. The resistance to infection by Fusaria is polygenic and breeding for resistance is rather difficult. Creation of resistant (or tolerant) genotypes is not very effective from the short-term point of view. For successful protection greater attention must be paid to the study of pathogen biology in order to eliminate its spreading.

Some of common lupine diseases are <b>fusarioses</b> caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lupini. Morphometric and metabolic changes were investigated in yellow lupine seedlings infected with F. oxysporum f. sp. lupini. It was found that infection caused temporary inhibition of seedling growth, overcome at later development, and activation of ß -glycosidase and peroxidases.

40|$|Fusarium {{species have}} been {{isolated}} from over 100 plant species in Serbia. From the economic aspect, they have been and still {{are the most important}} for the production and storage of small grains and maize, and are exceptionally important for some other species. Total of 63 species, 35 varieties (var.) and 19 specialised forms (f. sp.) of basic species, particularly of F. oxysporum (4 var. and 12 f. sp.) and F. solani (7 var. and 3 f. sp.) were identified. Species F. langsethiae and F. thapsinum, recently identified, have been isolated from wheat and s o r g h u m seeds, respectively. F. graminearum is the most important pathogen for wheat, barely and maize, while F. poae is also important for wheat and barely. Furthermore, species of the section Liseola (F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans and F. proliferatum) are important for maize and sorghum. In recent years, species of the section Liseola have been increasingly occurring in wheat and barley. The June-October period in Serbia is the most critical period for quality maintenance of stored maize, as the abundance and frequency of fungi, particularly of toxigenic species of the genus Fusarium, are the greatest during that period. In general, {{there is a lack of}} data about <b>fusarioses</b> of industrial crops in Serbia. There are mere descriptions of specific cases in which the development of Fusarium species was mostly emphasised by agroecological conditions. The presence of recently determined Fusarium species in kernels of these plant species indicates their importance from the aspect of the yield reduction and grain quality debasement and the mycotoxin contamination. Root rot and plant wilt are characteristic symptoms of <b>fusarioses</b> for forage and vegetable crops, while pathological changes in fruits provoked by Fusarium species are less frequent.

Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases known to affect wheat crop. FHB, caused mainly by Fusarium graminearum, results in severe losses of productivity and grain quality besides its harmful effects to human and animal health due to the accumulation of mycotoxins in infected grains. Genetic resistance is the best way to control FHB which affects crops in several parts of the world. FHB resistance shows a quantitative heritage, hence are QTLs (quantitativetrait- loci) that have a weak effect on character. Studies with microsatellite markers have generated a great number of information related to the position of those QTLs in the genome, in addition to the development of new varieties to be used in breeding programs. The microsatellites are short sequence repeats, spread thoroughly in the organism s genome. For amplification of those sequences it is used specific primers to each loco. Due to the genetic relation between species, information generated from the study in one species can be used successfully when studying related species. Therefore, primers designed for microsatellites in one species can be used to detect markers in related species and to associating those markers with characteristics of interest. Here, the main objective of my work was to verify the transferability of microsatellites from rice to wheat in search of markers related to FHB resistance. It was tested different wheat genotypes showing different levels of resistance to Fusarium and was verified the existence of polymorphism among those genotypes. A number of 55 primer pairs of microsatellites isolated from the rice genome were tested in 13 wheat cultivars classified as susceptible, moderately susceptible, moderately resistant and resistant. In my results, the rate of microsatellite transferability was of 76. 4 %, where from these, 23. 8 % showed polymorphism and 76. 2 % showed monomorphism. In spite of the high rate of the microsatellite transferability observed in my results, the analysis of polymorphism did not allow the identification of markers that could be possibly associated with resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat...|$|E

Sequence typing revealed that the isolates were nearly evenly divided among the Fusarium solani (FSSC, N = 18), the F. oxysporum (FOSC, N = 20) and Gibberella (Fusarium) fujikuroi (GFSC, N = 20) species complexes. The three-locus typing scheme used {{for members of the}} FSSC identified 18 novel STs distributed among six phylogenetically distinct species, yielding an index of discrimination of 1. 0. Phylogenetic analysis of the FOSC two-locus dataset identified nine STs, including four which were novel, and nine isolates of ST 33, the previously described widespread clonal lineage. With the inclusion of eight epidemiologically unrelated ST 33 isolates, the FOSC typing scheme scored a discrimination index of 0. 787. The two-locus GFSC typing scheme, which was designed primarily to identify species, received the lowest discrimination index with a score of 0. 492. The GFSC scheme, however, was used to successfully identify 17 isolates as F. verticillioides, two as F. sacchari and one as F. guttiforme. The present study represents the first report of the latter species causing a human mycotic infection, which was supported by detailed morphological analysis. In addition, results of a pathogenicity experiment revealed that the human isolate of F. guttiforme was able to induce fusariosis of pineapple, heretofore its only known host...|$|R
40|$|Members of the species-rich Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) are {{responsible}} for approximately two-thirds all <b>fusarioses</b> of humans and other animals. In addition, many economically important phytopathogenic species are nested within this complex. Due to their increasing clinical relevance and {{because most of the}} human pathogenic and plant pathogenic FSSC lack Latin binomials, we have extended the multilocus haplotype nomenclatural system introduced in a previous study (D. C. Chang, G. B. Grant, K. O'Donnell, K. A. Wannemuehler, J. Noble-Wang, C. Y. Rao, L. M. Jacobson, C. S. Crowell, R. S. Sneed, F. M. T. Lewis, J. K. Schaffzin, M. A. Kainer, C. A. Genese, E. C. Alfonso, D. B. Jones, A. Srinivasan, S. K. Fridkin, and B. J. Park, JAMA 296 : 953 - 963, 2006) to all 34 species within the medically important FSSC clade 3 to facilitate global epidemiological studies. The typing scheme is based on polymorphisms in portions of the following three genes: the internal transcribed spacer region and domains D 1 plus D 2 of the nuclear large-subunit rRNA, the translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EF- 1 α), and the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II gene (RPB 2). Of the 251 isolates subjected to multilocus DNA sequence typing, 191 sequence types were differentiated, and these were distributed among three strongly supported clades designated 1, 2, and 3. All of the mycosis-associated isolates were restricted to FSSC clade 3, as previously reported (N. Zhang, K. O'Donnell, D. A. Sutton, F. A Nalim, R. C. Summerbell, A. A. Padhye, and D. M. Geiser, J.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, human infections by Fusarium species (Fungi) have shown global increase, both in immunocompromised and in immunocompetent patients. These infections can be {{classified}} in four classes: (1) superficial infections of skin and nails, (2) keratitis of the cornea, and (3) deep localized and (4) disseminated infections. In this PhD project we addressed {{some of the major}} problems connected to human <b>fusarioses.</b> (1) We first identified and delimited the species that are etiological agents of different types of infections. Our molecular and phylogenetic studies were performed by using multi-gene analysis of BT, TEF 1, TOPO 1, PGK, RPB 2 and ITS. The results confirmed that Fusarium is monophyletic. (2) Subsequently we aimed to understand which properties are essential in virulence of these opportunists, {{given the fact that the}} great majority of their saprobic and plant-pathogenic relatives are not known to be involved in human disease. (3) Furthermore, we developed diagnostic tools for the clinical laboratory. Knowing that current culture-dependent characterization methods for deep infections are often too slow, we introduced faster DNA-based or whole cell-based identification techniques such as MALDI-TOF MS to characterize these species. MALDI-TOF MS approach can be performed with minimal amounts of sample and takes only 15 − 30 minutes and are cheap. AFLP fingerprinting has successfully been applied in this study with a large numbers of clinical and environmental strains. Our findings indicate that AFLP analysis and MLSA analysis provide high resolution data allowing discrimination between Fusarium species and genotypes. (4) Finally, once etiological agents have been properly recognized and identified, we tested susceptibility profiles of most of opportunistic Fusarium against a panel of anitifungal compounds. In vitro antifungal testing showed that amphotericin B and voriconazole were the antimycotics with the best overall in vitro activity, followed by posaconazole. In vitro combination activity of natamycin alone and in combination with voriconazole was judged optimal for Fusarium keratitis and showed 70 % synergism...|$|R

Fernando Abstract: A {{decade of}} losses and damage due to {{fusarium}} head blight in cereals in North America {{and other parts of}} the world has resulted in great efforts to understand the factors that cause and intensify the disease. This review considers our current understanding of the importance of the contribution of cultural practices to the increase or decrease of inoculum levels, spore dispersal, and biological control of spore production and {{fusarium head blight}}. Perithecia of Gibberella zeae develop on aboveground residues, and on maize and wheat kernels rather than maize stems and wheat spikes, at temperatures of 15 and 25 °C, but not below 15 °C or above 30 °C. Ascospores are released during the evening, in response to rising relative humidity, and there is evidence for both local and longdistance dispersal. The effect of rotation and tillage system on the development of inoculum and FHB requires further research, but several studies indicate that weather may be the principal factor in development of the disease. Several fungal and bacterial species have been reported to inhibit hyphal and perithecial formation of G. zeae. These are discussed with an appraisal of the conditions and requirements to produce an effective biological control of G. zeae.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science (Water Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Ubiquitous in agro-environments, Fusarium species infect {{and damage}} {{economically}} important crops and contaminate food commodities with harmful secondary metabolites called mycotoxins. In addition, human infection by pathogenic Fusarium strains has now {{emerged as a}} major problem particularly among individuals with suppressed immunity. Trichothecenes, deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, rnoniliforme and fumonisins are potent toxins produced by Fusorium species including F. poae, F. nygami, F. oxysporum, F. proilferatum and F. verticillioides. The last three, together with F. solani and F. chlamydosporum are presently recognised as major role players in the occurrence of <b>fusarioses</b> in individuals with compromised immunity. In subsistence situations in rural areas of South Africa, a variety of traditional leafy vegetables, collectively known as morogo, supplement maize-based staple diets with minerals and vitamins. The utilisations of these traditional vegetables are generally based on indigenous knowledge pertaining to production and processing. Morogo plants are not natural hosts to mycotoxigenic and mycotic Fusarium species that are mainly associated with pathogeneses of grain crops such as maize. However, morogo growing in close proximity of maize in typical subsistence agricultural situations might be at risk of Fusarium contamination from maize. The {{study was conducted in}} the Dikgale Demographic Surveillance Site (DDSS), a rural area in the Limpopo Province characterised by the production of maize and different types of traditional morogo for household subsistence. HIVIAIDS is prevalent in the Limpopo Province. Chronic dietary exposure to Fusarium toxins and disseminated <b>fusarioses</b> might enhance disease outcomes associated with AIDS in affected individuals, thus adding to the burden of disease in DDSS communities. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the occurrence of mycotic and mycotoxigenic Fusarium species in traditional morogo and ago-environments in DDSS. Questionnaires were employed to obtain relevant information and indigenous knowledge from communities of Sefateng. Madiga, Mantheding and Moduane related to the utilisation of raditional morogo. At each village thepe (amaranth) and lerotho (African cabbage) were sampled on two occasions, namely before maize planting (M-) and when maize was fully grown (M+). Maize, soil and air were sampled at the same time. Botanical species identification was carried out on specimens of lerotho and thepe from each village. Lerotho. thepe, maize, soil and air samples were subjected to mycological analysis to determine the average fungal levels and Fusarium species that occurred. Samples of fresh and traditionally sun-dried samples of thepe and lerotho were analysed by HPLC for fumonisins. Average fungal plate counts of morogo from all four villages were notably higher in lerotho compared to thepe. Lerotho sampled from M- fields of Madiga, Mantheding and Moduane exhibited higher average fungal levels than those from the M+ fields. However, in lerotho sampled from the M+ field of Sefateng average fungal levels were significantly higher than that of the M- field. Fungal levels in maize growing close to morogo were lowest in Sefateng and highest in Moduane. The highest fungal counts in soil were reported for Sefateng's M- field and the lowest for Sefateng M+ field. Fungal levels were high in air samples of M+ fields of all four villages and the lowest in M- field of Sefateng. The majority Fusarium isolates retrieved from morogo and environmental samples belonged to known mycotoxigenic and/or mycotic species, though predominant species and levels thereof varied in samples from M- and M+ fields of the four villages. Fusarium levels in thepe from both M- and M+ fields were shown to be lower as in lerotho. In samples of the Sefateng M- field, F. poae occurred predominantly in lerotho, thepe, soil as well as air, while F. subglutinans was the predominant species in lerotho and air samples of Mantheding. In Sefateng samples from M+ field, F. chlamydosporum predominated among isolates retrieved from lerotho, F. prolifiratum and F. gramenearum among those from maize and F. solani among those from soil and air. F. proliferatum dominated among isolates from lerotho, maize, soil and air of M+ sites of Madiga and F. chlamydosporum in soil and air samples of Mantheding. HPLC analysis detected fumonisin B 1 in traditionally sun-dried as well as fresh samples of lerorho as well as thepe. The occurrence of mycotoxigenic and rnycotic Fusarium species in traditional morogo and agro-environments might be an aggravating health risk factor for DDSS communities. Master...|$|R
