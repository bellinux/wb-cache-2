5000|$|Alex Denney of NME said, [...] "Written {{around the}} time Tillman got hitched to this girlfriend, it's a hugely ambitious, caustically funny album about the redemptive {{possibilities}} of love, and being heartily sick of your own bullshit." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe, on the other hand, criticized the album's lyrics, writing [...] "with a default mode of arch snarkery, Misty doesn't have much to say; he gets off a sharp line here and there, but can't string them together into anything greater." [...] In an otherwise positive review, PopMatters Sean McCarthy wrote [...] "After an amazingly solid first half, {{the second half of}} <b>Honeybear</b> suffers some lag, either because of some tracks have a lack of a memorable hook or chorus ("Strange Encounter"), or experiments that just don't pan out (see the laugh track on [...] "Bored in the U.S.A.")." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Upping the spectacle from Fear Fun his 2012 debut, I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> is an autobiographical set about love, marriage and derangement that's both ironic and empathic." [...] Q stated, [...] "For its black lyrical humour alone, I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> would be a winner. The fact that it's matched to towering songwriting makes it masterful stuff." ...|$|E

5000|$|Further on in {{the same}} article the label {{explains}} its decision to release I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> as a double LP: [...] "Due to its length and the wide audio spectrum of the recording, we at Sub Pop, together with Father John Misty, decided that the album sounded much better cut at 45 RPM over 2 pieces of vinyl.

Club said, [...] "With a welcoming tenor and a likeably schmaltzy delivery that finds him displaying loads of range and emotions, he's {{able to give}} his subject matter the unforgiving and ultimately warm treatment it deserves." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune said, [...] "Misty's music cushions {{some of his most}} outrageous observations in plush wordless harmonies, strings and orchestral-pop melodies, sometimes to a point where he melts into background music." [...] Mojo stated, [...] "There are grand arrangements and barbed bon mots in the style of Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, but what's most striking are the more restrained moments." [...] Exclaim!s Matthew Ritchie gave the album a perfect score, writing that [...] "Tillman's intentions and feelings as a songwriter have never seemed so clear." [...] Laura Studarus of DIY said, [...] "Still, for all his determination to thumb his nose at convention, I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> finds Tillman falling face first into perhaps the most expected of musical tropes: the [...] "mature" [...] sophomore release." ...|$|E

5000|$|Robert Towne, the screenwriter of Chinatown, cited Eastman as {{an early}} {{influence}} on his work: [...] "Chuck Eastman—Adrian Joyce's brother—wrote <b>Honeybear,</b> I Think I Love You, a very influential screenplay in the fifties that never got made that affected me strongly {{because there was a}} guy who was able to use life around him and push as far as anybody writing a novel was going to push." [...] He later elaborated, [...] "For me, it was quite a revelation {{because it was the first}} contemporary screenplay I had read that just opened up the possibilities of everything that you could put into a screenplay in terms of language and the observations of contemporary life".|$|E

As the original idea wasn't realisable, Tillman said about the final version: [...] "I don't care all that much {{if you like the}} music video or not. The label isn't crazy about it. Management isn't crazy about it. … I made it on an iPad on my wedding anniversary with the one I love." ...|$|E
