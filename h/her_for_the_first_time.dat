5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from him or <b>her.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the finished product. Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his {{backyard}} where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the choice}} of her next feature, Hepburn decided to star in George Cukor's new project, Sylvia Scarlett (1935), which paired <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> with Cary Grant. Her hair was cut short for the part, as her {{character}} masquerades as a boy {{for much of the}} film. Critics disliked Sylvia Scarlett and it was unpopular with the public. She next played Mary Stuart in John Ford's Mary of Scotland (1936), which met with a similarly poor reception. A Woman Rebels (1936) followed, a Victorian era drama where Hepburn's character defied convention by having a child out of wedlock. Quality Street (1937) also had a period setting, this time a comedy. Neither movie was popular with the public, which meant she had made four unsuccessful pictures in a row.|$|E

5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes <b>her.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{was born}} Norma Jeane Mortenson at the Los Angeles County Hospital on June 1, 1926 {{as the third}} child of Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984). Gladys, the {{daughter}} of two poor Midwestern migrants to California, was a flapper {{and worked as a}} film negative cutter at Consolidated Film Industries. When she was fifteen, Gladys married a man nine years her senior, John Newton Baker, and had two children by him, Robert (1917–1933) and Berniece (born 1919). She filed for divorce in 1921, and Baker took the children with him to his native Kentucky. Monroe was not told that she had a sister until she was twelve, and met <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> as an adult. In 1924, Gladys married her second husband—Martin Edward Mortensen—but they separated before she became pregnant with Monroe by a different man; they divorced in 1928. The identity of Monroe's father is unknown and Baker was most often used as her surname.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E

Subsequently, they break up because Penny felt she was not as smart as Leonard would like.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to have made <b>her,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|One day of 1925, while tiding his room, Bourguiba {{found the}} address of a woman his {{protector}} recommended to meet: Mathilde Lefras, a 35 years old widow whose husband died during the war. He met <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in her apartment, {{on the first floor}} of a building in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. She invited him to enter and asked him to tell his story. Touched by it, she asked to see him once again, and, in the upcoming months, invited him to move in with her. Since then, he gave his room in the campus away and settled with Mathilde.|$|E
25|$|Prince Charles saw <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in Eutin in 1770 and {{remarked that}} she was pretty. The {{marriage}} was suggested in 1772, and the first ceremony took place in Wismar 21 June 1774: she arrived in Sweden 3 June. She entered Stockholm by gondola 7 June, and the wedding ceremony took place the same night, followed by a masquerade ball in Kungsträdgården. She was noted for her beauty — her waist measured a mere 48cm (19") and her shoe size 31 (girls' size 13) — and, as the marriage of the monarch had not been consummated after nine years, there were hopes that she would provide an heir for the throne.|$|E

25|$|The play Lover’s Vows {{marks the}} novel’s turning point as despite her dislike for {{a play that}} “combines {{political}} radicalism and sexual permissiveness”, Price reluctantly takes part as she sees {{the importance of being}} socially involved to influence society for the better. Previously lost in a world of books, Price sees she must stand up to win the love she craves from Edmund. It is this change in personality, seen by Sir Thomas, who now appreciates Price’s moral qualities, who allows Price a dinner with the Grants and provides her with a carriage that befits a lady, despite the efforts of Mrs. Norris to sabotage Price’s social coming out. When Henry Crawford complains of how Lover's Vows was shut down by Sir Thomas, Price firmly expresses her disapproval of his attitude, which makes Crawford to pay attention to <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Reflecting her new social prestige, Price is given the honor of opening the ball at Mansfield Park.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{received}} some funds from Jews in New York, the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling {{the paper on}} street corners and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating the influence of Marxism and historical materialism in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the Arbeter Fraint published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination of Marxism in Yiddish, according to William J. Fishman. Arbeter Fraints unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised {{to him when he}} took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to cease publication for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist Emma Goldman visited London and Rocker met <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> After hearing of the Arbeter Fraints situation she held three lectures to raise funds, but that was not enough.|$|E
500|$|How I Met Your Mother was {{inspired}} by creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's idea to [...] "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York," [...] where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife. Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed {{if they could get}} Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted’s seeing <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> America’s seeing <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E

500|$|... "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} {{composer}} Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater for Walt Disney Pictures' 50th animated feature film Tangled (2010). Included on the film's official soundtrack, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] is a musical theatre-inspired pop and jazz ballad performed by American actress and singer Donna Murphy in her animated role as Mother Gothel, the film's villain. Incorporating a series of passive-aggressive insults into its lyrics, the song serves as Gothel's attempt to frighten Rapunzel into remaining in their secluded tower despite her constant requests to see the floating lanterns {{so that she can}} continue exploiting her hair's regenerating abilities to remain youthful. [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] is eventually reprised in a more sinister, vengeful manner by Gothel after Rapunzel, having left the tower, openly defies <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
500|$|Amidst all of {{this family}} turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin {{in the summer of}} 1816 and he and Imlay {{discussed}} the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too [...] "romantic", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth. That same summer, George Blood—the brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake—came to meet <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: [...] "I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to such a mother... I have found that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's [...] to love and esteem me" [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} calm {{broke off}} {{near the end}} of April 1950, when Boddy's Daily News and affiliated newspapers referred to the congresswoman as [...] "decidedly pink" [...] and [...] "pink shading to deep red". At the end of the month, the Daily News referred to <b>her</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> as [...] "the pink lady". Douglas generally ignored Boddy's attacks, which continued unabated through May. In a Daily News column, Boddy wrote that Douglas was part of [...] "a small minority of red hots" [...] which proposed to use the election to [...] "establish a beachhead on which to launch a Communist attack on the United States". One Boddy campaign publication was printed with red ink, and stated that Douglas [...] "has too often teamed up with the notorious extreme radical, Vito Marcantonio of New York City, on votes that seem more in the interest of Soviet Russia than of the United States".|$|E
