5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E
25|$|The chicks hatch after 15–16 days; {{they are}} {{initially}} hairless, save for some grey {{down on the}} back, and have dark skin. They start to grow feathers 5 <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after hatching, starting with the remiges; the rectrices begin to emerge about 3 days later. The young are fed 1-2 times per hour on average, and the female spends {{about half of the}} day brooding and feeding her offspring, and the other half flying around and feeding. The young fledge after 22–24 days but still return to the nest to sleep and be brooded for some more days; they are independent some 2–3 weeks after fledging. Two broods may be raised subsequently, sometimes reusing the nest; due to the prolonged breeding season, three broods might be raised per year in theory, but this does not seem to happen. The species first breeds at 1–2 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Scott's planning, {{equipment}} and rations had {{been based on}} three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply. It also meant the Evans party of three {{had to try to}} split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.|$|E

500|$|Actual {{spawning}} {{occurs when}} a collection of males gather around gravid females, and begin writhing, twisting, bumping into and slithering {{over the tops of}} females, an activity which triggers the release of eggs. [...] Males release clouds of milt to fertilize the eggs as they are released into the water column. [...] The sticky eggs then attach to submerged vegetation, and development begins. [...] It takes only a few days for the eggs to hatch into larval fish, and another ten <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> for the larval fish to detach from the vegetation and start moving about as young fry. Egg production is variable, and believed to be dependent {{on the size of the}} female. [...] A common formula used for predicting the volume of eggs a female can produce is 4.1 eggs/gram of body weight which gives an average of about 150,000 eggs per spawn. [...] The eggs of alligator gar are bright red and poisonous to humans if ingested.|$|E
500|$|Storm petrels are monogamous {{and form}} {{long-term}} pair bonds that last {{a number of}} years. Studies of paternity using DNA fingerprinting have shown that, unlike many other monogamous birds, infidelity (extra-pair mating) is very rare. As with the other Procellariiformes, a single egg is laid by a pair in a breeding season; if the egg fails, then usually no attempt is made to re-lay (although it happens rarely). Both sexes incubate in shifts of up to six days. The egg hatches after 40 or 50 days; the young is brooded continuously for another 7 <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> before being left alone in the nest {{during the day and}} fed by regurgitation at night. Meals fed to the chick weigh around 10–20% of the parent's body weight, and consist of both prey items and stomach oil. Stomach oil is an energy rich (its calorific value is around 9600 calories per gram) oil created by partly digested prey {{in a part of the}} foregut known as the proventriculus. By partly converting prey items into stomach oil storm petrels can maximise the amount of energy chicks receive during feed, an advantage for small seabirds that can only make a single visit to the chick during a 24-hour period (at night). The average age at which chicks fledge depends on the species, taking between 50 or 70 days. The time taken to hatch and raise the young is long for the bird's size but is typical of seabirds, which in general are K-selected, living much longer, delay breeding for longer, and invest more effort into fewer young. The young leave there burrow at about 62 days. They are independent almost at once and quickly disperse into the ocean. They return to their original colony after 2 [...] or 3 years, but will not breed until at least 4 years old. Storm petrels have been recorded living as long as 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|Rations {{were always}} meagre but {{decreased}} in both {{quantity and quality}} as the war progressed. The women and children drew the same rations as the men. The Japanese controlled all food supplies, releasing only what was needed for the day. At the beginning, the rations comprised rice and local vegetables (such as kangkung), with every 10 <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> some pork (such as offal, or a head, or some poor-meat bearing part of the animal). The daily rice ration in late 1943 was 11 ounces (312grams) a day; {{by the end of}} the war the rice ration was about 4 ounces (113grams) per man daily. In September 1944, children were recorded as receiving [...] of milk a day.|$|E

2500|$|In March the Colonist, then {{owned by}} Mr. White, put {{together}} the first major prospecting party to travel to Port Moresby via Cooktown with about 25 prospectors travelling from Sydney and about another 10 being onloaded at Cooktown.

They each ship about five cwt provisions and outfit, {{and many of them are}} equipped with guns and other defensive weapons, as well as with the appliances for prospecting."

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve <b>days</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
