40|$|IP prefix {{hijacking}} {{remains a}} major threat to the security of the Internet routing system {{due to a lack of}} authoritative prefix ownership information. Despite many efforts in designing IP prefix hijack detection schemes, no existing design can satisfy all the critical requirements of a truly effective system: real-time, accurate, light-weight, easily and incrementally deployable, as well as robust in victim notification. In this paper, we present a novel approach that fulfills all these goals by monitoring network reachability from key <b>external</b> <b>transit</b> networks to one’s own network through lightweight prefix-owner-based active probing. Using the prefix-owner’s view of reachability, our detection system, ISPY, can differentiate between IP prefix hijacking and network failures based on the observation that hijacking is likely to result in topologically more diverse polluted networks and unreachability. Through detailed simulations of Internet routing, 25 -day deployment in 88 ASes (108 prefixes), and experiments with hijacking events of our own prefix from multiple locations, we demonstrate that ISPY is accurate with false negative ratio below 0. 45 % and false positive ratio below 0. 17 %. Furthermore, ISPY is truly real-time; it can detect hijacking events within a few minutes...|$|E
40|$|The article substantiates the {{assumption}} about {{the correlation of}} Samosdelka settlement located in the Volga delta with {{the remnants of the}} city of Saksin, which is known according to written sources. The assumption became possible through the comparison of the materials excavated on the territory of Samosdelka settlement with the descriptions of the city of Saksin composed by Abu Hamid al-Garnati, a medieval Arab traveler. The traveler writes about the city located in the country of the Khazars upon the vast river. The city was inhabited by the Oghuzs, the Bulgars, the Savirs, and the Khazars. Besides, al-Garnati mentions the thousands of merchants of various nationalities, including Arabs from the Maghreb. This allows us to characterize Saksin as a center of transit trade on the Volga-Caspian trade route. The traveler mentions salt, fish, and meat as domestic products of Saksin. The trading system of Saksin is partly reconstructed in the present article. The author states the underdevelopment of monetary circulation in Saksin, and suggests that the domestic trade was based on the use of lead ingots as an exchange equivalent equated to the Arab and Persian monetary and weight units. <b>External</b> <b>transit</b> trade was also carried out, probably on the principles of coinless exchange. Domestic economy of Saksin was complex and was based on beef cattle breeding, fishing, and growing crops – cereals and fruits. Archaeological materials illustrate a developed fishing, a supply to the city of marketable meat and the cultivation of crops {{in the vicinity of the}} city. The same information we can find in the book of al-Garnati...|$|E

Hence, a high level risk assessment has been conducted for evaluating the safety performance of dry bulk cargo transportation. This included the preparatory step for setting the problem's boundary limits, hazard identification for the prioritization of causes and effects, risk analysis for the quantification of risks and risk evaluation for assessing the significance and the acceptability of the estimated risk. The relevant aspects that {{are taken into account}} consist of the vessel's function (carriage of payload), operational phase (ocean <b>transit),</b> <b>external</b> weather conditions, routeing and internal (cargoes) influences, accident category foundering and the risk associated with crew (fatalities) and property (loss of vessel and cargo).

40|$|We {{consider}} theoretically spin correlations in an 1 D {{quantum wire}} with Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (RDI). The correlations of non-interacting electrons display electron-spin resonance at a frequency {{proportional to the}} RDI coupling. Interacting electrons on varying the direction of <b>external</b> magnetic field <b>transit</b> {{from the state of}} Luttinger liquid (LL) to the spin density wave (SDW) state. We show that the two-time total spin correlations of these states are significantly different. In the LL the projection of total spin to the direction of the RDI induced field is conserved and the corresponding correlator is equal to zero. The correlators of two components perpendicular to the RDI field display a sharp ESR driven by RDI induced intrinsic field. In contrast, in the SDW state the longitudinal projection of spin dominates, whereas the transverse components are suppressed. This prediction indicates a simple way for experimental diagnostic of the SDW in a quantum wire. Comment: 19 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|Two {{inert gas}} methods for {{measurement}} of tissue blood flow were com-pared. The two methods are (1) Kety and Schmidt's inert gas saturation method, {{in which the}} tissue saturation is followed by detecting the concen-tration of the tracer in the venous blood leaving the organ and (2) the intra-arterial radioactive inert gas injection method where the tissue washout is measured by detecting the residue inside the tissue by an external scintilla-tion detector. Theoretical considerations show a close relation between the two methods when carried {{to the time of}} full saturation or desaturation of the tissue or when stopped before full saturation. Experimental studies of cerebral blood flow in nine human subjects using Kr 86 revealed a close correlation between the two methods without any sys-tematic difference between the two sets of data. The Kety-Schmidt outflow detection method is the method of choice for studying over-all tissue perfusion and metabolism. The residue detection method is best suited for measuring flow through circumscribed regions inside an organ and for resolving the flow curve to yield estimates of flow and rela-tive weight of various tissue components. ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS Kr« 0 tissue Kr 86 clearance <b>external</b> counting indicator <b>transit</b> times theoretical analysis • In 1945 Kety and Schmidt introduced the use of an inert gas as a tracer for measure-ment of organ blood flow (1). The method they described is based on inhalation of the gas, e. g. nitrous oxide or Kr* 5, and on follow-ing the rate of tissue uptake by analysis of multiple arterial and venous blood samples. It provides measurements of the average blood flow and metabolism per 100 g of tissue in the brain, myocardium or kidney. Since the essen-tial feature of the method and its modifications is detecting the uptake of the tracer by mea-surements on the venous outflow, we will call it the outflow detection method...|$|R
40|$|This thesis covers several topics {{related to}} transit costs, {{productivity}}, efficiency, and benefits. We first show that labor productivity growth among transit {{agencies in the}} United States is slow or stagnant, and it is significantly lower than productivity growth in most industries. According to Baumol's cost disease theory, {{this leads to a}} spiraling trend in cost escalation over time and it is a threat to long run financial sustainability. In fact, we find that transit costs increase not only above the inflation rate but above the rate predicted by Baumol's theory, which is evidence of additional compounding factors, such as the bargaining power of labor unions, and political or managerial issues. First, we extend the analysis to calculate total factor productivity, and the results validate the findings of sluggish labor productivity growth. The calculations also reveal that while productivity may grow with efficiency gains, these gain are bounded by a frontier, and, in the long run, the inherent nature of low productivity growth in the transit sector will continue to drive transit costs faster than other sectors. We also assess whether contracting out transit operations alleviates the implications of Baumol's cost disease, and the results show that in spite of lower average costs, contracted service also has significant cost escalation over the long run, evidence that the implications also apply to the private delivery of transit service. In addition, we also consider other sectors within the larger transportation industry and analyze whether productivity and costs follow the same pattern predicted by Baumol's cost disease. The results vary widely, from vehicle maintenance on the one hand (with low productivity growth and high cost increase) to automobile manufacturing on the other hand. The transit construction industry also shows signs of Baumol's cost disease, but not as severe as those for transit operations. Finally, despite the spiraling nature of transit costs, we also show that the internal and <b>external</b> benefits of <b>transit</b> tend to grow over time, which can justify higher fares and additional subsidy. Although there is no clear antidote to Baumol's cost disease, policymakers should recognize that as the economy becomes more productive and prosperous overall, it can continue to support growing levels of transit service in recognition of its growing external benefits, despite its inherent nature of stagnant productivity growth. by Javier Morales Sarriera.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of factors {{involved}} in the transport of animals for slaughter in Canada that can potentially affect the welfare implications of transportation. These include fitness for transport, animal handling, climatic conditions (including vehicle ventilation) and journey duration. Legislation has been put in place as a means of control of industry practices to protect animal welfare during transport. This thesis examines the law relating to the protection of animal welfare during transport in Canada and assesses the impact of legislation in relation to animal welfare. The deliberations of the Canada Agricultural Review Tribunal in terms of its decisions in cases where they heard an appeal against a Notice Of Violation issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for an infringement of Part XII of the Health of Animals Regulations provided one useful source of data with which to assess the effectiveness of the enforcement of the regulations for the protection of animal welfare during transport in Canada. Welfare issues when transporting poultry for slaughter are prominent. This led to a retrospective observational study of the risk factors when transporting broiler chickens for slaughter in Atlantic Canada. Results indicated that there are numerous interrelated risk factors inherent in the transport process affecting mortality during transit in Canada, with the most prominent being the weather conditions in which animals are transported. A significant interaction between the stocking density and the <b>external</b> temperature during <b>transit</b> was identified in the analysis. The mortality risk was higher in cold weather conditions compared with hot weather conditions. At very cold external temperatures, the mortality risk was reduced at high compared with low crate stocking densities, but it still remained higher than that at warmer temperatures. The stocking densities used by the slaughter plant were within the maximum recommended in the Canadian codes of practice for transport of poultry. Environmental conditions of high temperature and high humidity while at the holding barn, as indicated by an apparent equivalent temperature in the ‘high risk’ zone, resulted in a higher mortality risk than when the AET was in the medium or low risk zones. Keeping birds dry during transport results in lower mortality risk than when birds become wet. Large temperature gradients were recorded between the external temperature and that recorded within the trailer during transit and during the holding barn period, particularly in winter conditions when vehicle ventilation openings were most likely to be closed. This indicates a potential for heat stress to occur, even in winter conditions. Improvements in the monitoring and control of the thermal conditions (hot and cold) within trailers and the holding barn would be beneficial in reducing the mortality risk. During extreme weather conditions, consideration should be given to the ability of the equipment and facilities to provide appropriate conditions for the broilers when making decisions as to whether loading and transportation should be undertaken...|$|R
