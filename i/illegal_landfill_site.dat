40|$|Abstract: Forensic geology, {{forensic}} geoscience and geoforensics (see {{the text}} for definitions) are largely concerned with searches for buried objects {{or the use}} of sediment and soil analysis as evi-dence. Geophysics, remote sensing, geostatistics, geochemistry and geomorphology are considered part of these disciplines. Traditional outcrop geology is not often considered, with very few pub-lications considering the role of mapped and logged geology. This work comprises a review of the few publishedworks, followed by a range of case studies that demonstrate how traditional, outcrop-scale drift and solid geology can be used in forensic geology. These include: using geology in the search for buried explosives and human remains; the logging of solid and drift geology for analysis of disputed rock quality; and modelling groundwater flow from an <b>illegal</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>site.</b> Geological mapping may assist in limiting a search area or in understanding what failed in a search or forensic investigation. The scale of forensic geology discussed bridges the gap between the two traditions of forensic geology outlined above: that of searching large areas of ground and trace evidence analysis. Forensic geology (Murray & Tedrow 1975, 1986; Murray 2004, 2011) is concerned primarily wit...|$|E

40|$|Landfill {{management}} {{is a complex}} discipline, requiring very high levels of organisation, and considerable investment. Until the early 1990 ’s most Irish <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> were not managed to modern standards. <b>Illegal</b> <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> are, of course, usually not managed at all. Landfills are very active. The traditional idea of ‘put it {{in the ground and}} forget about it’ is entirely misleading. There is a lot of chemical and biological activity underground. This produces complex changes in the chemistry of the landfill, and of the emissions from the site. The main emissions of concern are landfill gases and contaminated water (which is known as leachate). Both of these emissions have complex and changing chemical compositions, and both depend critically on what has been put into the landfill. The gases spread mainly through the atmosphere, but also through the soil, while the leachate (the water) spreads through surface waters and the local groundwater. Essentially all unmanaged landfills will discharge large volumes of leachate into the local groundwater. In sites where the waste accepted has been properly regulated, and where no hazardous wastes are present, there is a lot known about the likely composition of this leachate and there is some knowledge of its likely biological and health effects. This is not the case for poorly regulated sites, where the composition of the waste accepted is unknown. It is possible to monitor the emissions from landfills, and to reduce some of the adverse health and environmental effects of these. These emissions, and hence the possible health effects, depend greatly on the content of the landfill, and on the details of the local geology and landscape. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a clear link between cancers and exposure to landfill, however, it is noted that there may be an association with adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and birth defects. It should be noted, however, that modern landfills, run in strict accordance with standard operation procedures, would have much less impact on the health of residents living in proximity to the site...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} {{of the solid}} wastes in <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> should be properly monitored by analyzing samples from soil, water, and landfill gases within the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites.</b> Nevertheless, ground monitoring scheme requires intensive efforts and cost, and sometime {{it is difficult to}} be achieved in large geographic extent. Remote sensing technology has been introduced for waste disposal management and monitoring effects of the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> on the environment. This paper presents a case study to evaluate the use of multi-temporal remote sensing data to monitor and assess the effects of <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> on the environment. The study area covers the Nepean and Trail Road <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> (the main municipal waste disposal site for the city of Ottawa). The Nepean <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> was opened in 1960 s, accepted waste until 1980 s and finally capped in 1993. With the increasing amount of waste disposal, the Trail Road landfill was then constructed and was in operation in early 1980. The Trail Road landfill, which is still in operation, is comprised of four phases developed sequentially. Thirteen bi-yearly multi-temporal Landsat satellite images acquired during July and August from the year 1985 to 2009 are used to calculate the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The differences of the LST between the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> (due to the release of the landfill gases within the <b>landfill</b> <b>site)</b> and the surrounding areas are analyzed. Furthermore, the LST of the <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> are monitored to assess the decomposition activities of the waste disposal. Preliminary data analysis reveals that the LST of the <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> is higher than the immediate surrounding areas and the air temperature during the decomposition process by up to 9 °C and 14 °C, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a truck queuing problem at <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> due to a static rest time of truck drivers in a waste collection vehicle routing problem. The analysis {{is based on a}} solution of two datasets from a benchmark waste collection problem using the nearest greedy heuristic algorithm. In this problem, all drivers need to have a one-hour rest break during their collection. The rest break can start from 11. 00 a. m. to 12. 00 p. m. However, based on the solution from a previous study, all drivers have their rest break almost at the same time. Consequently, all drivers travelled to <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> to unload waste approximately at the same time. Based on the truck queuing analysis presented in this paper, there is a long queue at <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> 3 (ten trucks arrived between 2. 52 p. m. to 2. 53 p. m.) for dataset 1; whereas for dataset 2, 13 trucks arrived at <b>landfill</b> <b>site</b> 1 between 4. 10 p. m. to 4. 55 p. m. Thus, it may be concluded that the static rest time period of truck drivers can cause truck queuing at <b>landfill</b> <b>sites.</b> Long queues at <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> will increase the service time at <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> as well as affect the drivers’ arrival time at customers. This paper suggests that future works need to consider a dynamic rest time period in solution techniques to overcome the truck queuing problem at <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> for solving the waste collection vehicle routing problem...|$|R

These <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> {{do not have any}} base liner or leachate collection and treatment system. Therefore, all the leachate generated finds its path into the surrounding environment. LPI values indicate the leachate contamination potential of <b>landfill</b> <b>sites</b> in a given geographical area on a comparative scale and used as a hazard identification tool. It is an increasing scale index, where a higher value indicates poor environmental condition based on the Delphi technique.
