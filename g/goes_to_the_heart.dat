The problem {{we are faced}} with now, he claims, {{is that we have a}} bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E

2500|$|An {{insurance}} underwriter's job is {{to evaluate}} a given risk as to {{the likelihood that a}} loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent. Thus, [...] "discrimination" [...] against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.|$|E

[...] Though the deposition questions were brought under the pretext of compelling discovery for use in Landmark Education's lawsuit against CAN, Pressman concluded that the deposition questioning was mainly a form of harassment. The discovery commissioner who entered an interim order in the matter, commented that [...] "it does not appear that the information sought [...] is directly relevant or <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of the [...] action, or that alternative sources have been exhausted or are inadequate". The action against Pressman was dropped after the Cult Awareness Network litigation was settled. [...] As {{a result of the}} Cult Awareness Network settlement with Landmark Education, CAN agreed to cease selling copies of Outrageous Betrayal {{for at least five years}}. [...] From the resolution of the CAN board of directors: [...] "In the interests of settling a dispute and in deference to Landmark's preference, however, CAN now agrees not to sell the Pressman Book for at least five years after CAN emerges from bankruptcy". [...] CAN's executive director maintained that the purpose of Landmark Education's lawsuits was not to recover lost funds, but to [...] "gag critics". [...] Along with Scientology, Landmark Education was granted access to Cult Awareness Network's files, which contained phone records and data on individuals who had previously sought information on these groups.|$|E
