5|$|Barton's {{career and}} life have {{been marked by}} {{numerous}} controversial incidents and disciplinary problems {{and he has been}} convicted twice on charges of violence. On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> prison term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach and for attacking three players {{on the final day of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that month}} on 16 December came the last German counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge, as over 250,000 German troops, {{supported}} by over 1,000 tanks and assault guns assaulted {{the lines of}} VIII Corps, some 40 {{miles to the north}} of III Corps. The next day Patton, the Third Army commander, warned III Corps that it would likely be ordered to assist. At that time the corps consisted of the 26th and 80th Infantry Divisions and the 4th Armored Division. III Corps was moved north to assist in the relief of Bastogne, Belgium, with the attack commencing at 04:00 on 22 December 1944. The corps advanced north, catching the German forces by surprise on their south flank, cutting them off. The 4th Armored Division was eventually able to reach Bastogne, where the 101st Airborne Division had been surrounded by German forces, and relieve it. During the first 10 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> action, III Corps liberated more than 100 towns, including Bastogne. This operation was key in halting the German offensive and the eventual drive to the Rhine River.|$|E

25|$|An {{eruption}} on {{the morning}} of 13 May 2008, immediately to the east of Etna's summit craters was accompanied by a swarm of more than 200 earthquakes and significant ground deformation in the summit area. The eruption continued at a slowly diminishing rate for 417 days, until 6 July 2009, making this the longest flank eruption of Etna since the 1991–1993 eruption that lasted 473 days. Previous eruptions, in 2001, 2002–2003, and 2004–2005 had lasted 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Lava flows advanced 6.5km during the first few <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> eruption but thereafter stagnated at much minor distances from the vents; during the last months of the eruption lava rarely advanced more than 1km downslope.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 2007, Northern Rock {{asked the}} Bank of England, as lender {{of last resort}} in the United Kingdom, for a {{liquidity}} support facility due to problems in raising funds in the money market to replace maturing money market borrowings. The problems arose from difficulties banks faced over the summer of 2007 in raising funds in the money market. The bank's assets were always sufficient to cover its liabilities in the long run, {{but it had a}} liquidity problem because institutional lenders became nervous about lending to mortgage banks following the US sub-prime crisis. Bank of England figures suggest that Northern Rock borrowed £3 billion from the Bank of England in the first few <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> crisis.|$|E

The following year he made his first-class debut against the Netherlands in the 2009–10 ICC Intercontinental Cup, scoring a maiden half century with 65 runs in Scotland's first-innings. Following the match he made his One Day International (ODI) debut against the same opposition. Four days after the conclusion of this match he played his second against England at Raeburn Place, scoring two runs before he was dismissed by Graeme Swann in an English victory.

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1862 Ueno opened a {{commercial}} photographic studio by the Nakashima River in Nagasaki and he also began importing cameras. At first the business was unsuccessful, but it gradually grew, allowing the studio {{to move to a}} large and well-lit building in 1882, becoming popular with Japanese and foreign notables and receiving mention in guidebooks, in Edmond Cotteau's Un touriste dans l'Extrême-Orient (1884) and in Pierre Loti's novel, Madame Chrysanthème (1887). The patronage of foreigners in turn greatly increased Ueno's income, which allowed him to use more expensive materials and to expand his studios. Still in the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> imported technology, Ueno overcame the reticence of many Japanese to be photographed and took portraits of such figures as Sakamoto Ryōma, Itō Shunsuke, Takasugi Shinsaku, and Katsu Kaishū. During their visits to Japan Ueno photographed Ulysses S. Grant in 1879 and the Russian crown prince (later Tsar Nicholas II) in 1891. With the help of such patronage, Ueno's studio operated {{until the end of the}} century.|$|E

Although defeating Canterbury on 20August, Taranaki's pack was particularly weakened by Dewar's absence, and only managed to win 6–5 with a last minute try. Against a second challenge from Wellington on 10September, the conspicuous absence of this [...] "fine leader of forwards" [...] contributed to the loss of the Shield.|$|E

500|$|Manningham {{examined}} Toft {{and thought}} something {{remained in the}} cavity of her uterus, and so he successfully persuaded Clarges {{to allow her to}} remain at the bagnio. [...] Douglas, who had by then visited Toft, questioned her on three or four occasions, each time for several hours. [...] After several <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her, and on 7December, in the presence of Manningham, Douglas, John Montagu and Frederick Calvert, Toft finally confessed. [...] Following her miscarriage and while her cervix permitted access, an accomplice had inserted into her womb the claws and body of a cat, and the head of a rabbit. [...] They had also invented a story in which Toft claimed that during her pregnancy and while working in a field, she had been startled by a rabbit, and had since become obsessed with rabbits. [...] For later parturitions, animal parts had been inserted into her vagina.|$|E
500|$|On 30 September 1941, the Gruppe was {{temporarily}} {{transferred from the}} southern sector of the Eastern Front. Their new area of operation was Sechtschinskaja, approximately [...] southeast of Roslavl. The Gruppe was then subordinated to the 2nd Air Corps {{under the command of}} General Bruno Loerzer and was part of the preparations for Operation Typhoon, the planned assault on Moscow. All available German forces were concentrated under the command of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock's Army Group Centre for the attack which began on 2 October 1941. In the first <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> campaign, II. Gruppe supported the advance northeast by 4th Panzer Group and the 4th Army towards Vyazma and Yukhnov. Predominantly flying escort missions for Ju87 dive bombers and combat air patrols over the battle zone east of Desna, Gollob claimed one enemy aircraft shot down on 4 October and two more the following day, including his 50th aerial victory over a I-61.|$|E
500|$|From October 1999 to January 2000, Manning forced Climbié {{to sleep}} in a bin liner in the bathtub in her own excrement. During a later police interview, Manning said this was because of her {{frequent}} bedwetting. At Haringey social services on 1 November 1999, Kouao told social workers that Manning sexually assaulted Climbié, but withdrew the accusation the following day. In one of Arthurworrey's visits, during a conversation about housing, Arthurworrey said that the council accommodated only children who were believed to be at serious risk. Laming said in his report, [...] "it may be no coincidence that within three <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conversation, Kouao contacted Ms. Arthurworrey to make allegations which, if true, would have placed Victoria squarely within that category". Jones sent a letter to Kouao, which was ignored, and no further action was taken. Manning later denied the allegation. Alan Hodges, the police sergeant overseeing the investigation, claimed in the inquiry that the social workers were obstructing the police in dealing with child protection cases. Between December 1999 and January 2000, Arthurworrey made three visits to the flat, but she received no answer. She speculated to her supervisor, Carole Baptiste, that they had returned to France. Despite no evidence, her supervisor wrote on Climbié's file that they had left the area. On 18 February 2000 they wrote to Kouao saying that if they did not receive any contact from them, they would close the case. A week later, on 25 February 2000, they closed the case—on the same day that Climbié died.|$|E

500|$|In late August 1968, {{a program}} of {{vigorous}} torture methods began on McCain. The North Vietnamese used rope bindings to put him into prolonged, painful positions and severely beat him every two hours, all while {{he was suffering from}} dysentery. His right leg was reinjured, his ribs were cracked, some teeth were broken at the gumline, and his left arm was re-fractured. Lying in his own waste, his spirit was broken; the beginnings of a suicide attempt were stopped by guards. After four <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> McCain signed and taped an anti-American propaganda [...] "confession" [...] that said, in part, [...] "I am a black criminal and I have performed the deeds of an air pirate. I almost died, and the Vietnamese people saved my life, thanks to the doctors." [...] He used stilted Communist jargon and ungrammatical language to signal that the statement was forced. McCain was haunted then and since with the belief that he had dishonored his country, his family, his comrades and himself by his statement, but as he later wrote, [...] "I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine." [...] Two weeks later his captors tried to force him to sign a second statement; his will to resist restored, he refused. He sometimes received two to three beatings per week because of his continued resistance; the sustained mistreatment went on for over a year. His refusals to cooperate, laced with loud obscenities directed towards his guards, were often heard by other POWs. His boxing experience from his Naval Academy days helped him withstand the battering, and the North Vietnamese did not break him again.|$|E
