40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the optical and physical requirements of marking trailing vortices that emanate from aircraft wings {{was carried out by}} considering particulate light-scattering properties, ability of particles to follow trailing vortices, and survival time of particles to vortex dissipation. Liquid droplets undergoing evaporation and molecular dispersion were investigated. Droplets should have lifetimes of about 300 sec. Droplet size should be about 1 micron to maximize light scattering with the minimum mass of liquid required. Droplets of this small size would spiral outward very slowly and essentially remain in the vortex cores. Nontoxic <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquids,</b> having an affinity for moisture in the air, have been identified. These liquids have relatively low vapor pressures of order 10 to the - 5 mm Hg that would insure droplet persistence long enough to mark trailing vortices...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a miniaturized coplanar capacitive sensor is presented whose electrode arrays can also function as resistive microheaters for thermocapillary actuation of liquid films and droplets. Optimal compromise between large capacitive signal and high spatial resolution is obtained for electrode widths comparable to the liquid film thickness measured, in agreement with supporting numerical simulations which include mutual capacitance effects. An interdigitated, variable width design, allowing for wider central electrodes, increases the capacitive signal for liquid structures with non-uniform height profiles. The capacitive resolution and time response of the current design is approximately 0. 03 pF and 10 ms, respectively, which makes possible a number of sensing functions for nanoliter droplets. These include detection of droplet position, size, composition or percentage water uptake for <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquids.</b> Its rapid response time allows measurements of the rate of mass loss in evaporating droplets...|$|R

40|$|Zeta {{potentials}} {{of several}} polar protic (water, ethylene glycol, formamide) {{as well as}} polar aprotic (dimethyl sulfoxide) liquids were measured in contact with three non-polar surfaces using closed-cell electro-osmosis. The test surfaces were chemisorbed monolayers of alkyl siloxanes, fluoroalkyl siloxanes and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) grafted on glass slides. All these liquids exhibited substantial electrokinetics {{in contact with the}} non-polar surfaces with these observations: the electrokinetic effect on the fluorocarbon-coated surface is the strongest; and on a PDMS grafted surface, the effect is the weakest. Even though these <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquids</b> contain small amounts of water, the current models of charging based on the adsorption of hydroxide ions at the interface or the dissociation of preexisting functionalities (e. g., silanol groups) appear to be insufficient to account for the various facets of the experimental observations. The results illustrate how ubiquitous the phenomenon of electro-kinetics is with polar liquids contacting such apparently passive non-polar surfaces. We hope that these results will inspire further experimental and theoretical studies in this important area of research that has potential practical implications...|$|R

40|$|Broad-band {{dielectric}} spectroscopy is {{a commonly}} used {{tool in the}} study of glass-forming liquids. The high sensitivity of the technique together with the wide range of probed time scales makes it a powerful method for investigating the relaxation spectra of liquids. One particularly important class of glass-forming liquids that is often studied using this technique consists of liquids dominated by hydrogen (H) bond interactions. When investigating such liquids, particular caution has to be taken during sample preparation due to their often highly hygroscopic nature. Water can easily be absorbed from the atmosphere, and dielectric spectroscopy is a very sensitive probe of such contamination due to the large dipole moment of water. Our knowledge concerning the effects of small quantities of water on the dielectric properties of these commonly investigated liquids is limited. We here demonstrate the effects due to the presence of small amounts of water on the dielectric response of a typical H-bonded model glass former, tripropylene glycol. We show how the relaxation processes present in the pure liquid are affected by addition of water, and we find that a characteristic water induced relaxation response is observed for water contents as low as 0. 15 wt %. We stress the importance of careful purification of <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquids</b> before experiments and quantify what the effects are if such procedures are not undertaken...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} novel phosphinate-based ionic liquids have been {{synthesised}} using various organic phosphorus acids, such as mono-n-octylphosphinic acid (octylPO₂H₂), mono-n-hexylphosphinic acid (hexylPO₂H₂), di-n-octylphosphinic acid ((octyl) ₂PO₂H), di-n-hexylphosphinic acid ((hexyl) ₂PO₂H) and bis(2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid ((TMP) ₂PO₂H), by reaction with tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (Bu₄POH), tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Bu₄NOH), pyridine (py) and triethylamine (Et₃N). Reactions simply involve neutralizing the organophosphorus acids with bases. The only byproduct, water, and excess amine, py/Et₃N {{can be easily}} removed under vacuum (Chapter 2). Some of the {{physical and chemical properties}} of these ionic liquids have been characterized by NMR, ES-MS, TGA, UV-Visible spectroscopy etc. The formed tetraalkylphosphonium/tetraalkylammonium phosphinate ionic <b>liquids</b> are viscous, <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquids,</b> but are more thermally stable than trialkylammonium and pyridinium analogues. For example, for the most stable ionic liquid, [Bu₄P][(octyl) ₂PO₂], its onset temperature of decomposition in thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) is 358 °C (Chapter 2). One of the applications of these novel phosphinate-based ionic liquids has been investigated. Au(0), Rh(0) and Ir(0) nanoparticles have been prepared in some of these phosphinate-based ionic liquids as a media and (or) reducing agents and have been characterized by SEM, TEM, Zetasizer, UV-Visible spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. In general, the average particles size of Au(0), and Ir(0) were ca. 25 nm, but some of the particles average size formed was less than 2 nm, such as Rh(0) and Ir(0) nanoparticles formed in [Bu₄P][(octyl) ₂PO₂] or [Bu₄P][(TMP) ₂PO₂]. Generally, these phosphinate-based ionic liquids are good media to prevent nanoparticle aggregation (Chapter 3) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} isothermals have been {{determined}} for the sorption of the vapours of amino compounds on silica and ferric oxide gels. The sorbates studied include the normal aliphatic amines, from ethylamine to n-heptylamine, t-butylamine, ethylene diamine, cyclohexylamine and pyridine. Data for ethyl alcohol and water is also included, for comparative purposes. A standard 'gravimetric' technique {{has been used}} in every case, except that of ethylamine, for which a new technique has been developed. The ferric oxide isothermals all contain a large. hysteresis loop, the size of which does not vary with increasing molecular diameter. Silica gel B 2 isothermals show a large loop with water, and small loops with ethyl alcohol, n-propylamine and ethylene diamine. Larger molecules give completely reversible isothermals. This data confirms the most important prediction of the 'open-pore' theory of capillary condensation. Reference is made to data in the literature which provides further confirmation of this prediction. Silica gel C and silica gel D systems both contain large hysteresis loops. Only a few results are quoted for the former system, as the isothermals obtained were not reproducible. Where possible, the Kelvin equation has been used to estimate the most frequent occurring pore space available for capillary condensation. In some cases an estimate of the true pore radius has been made, by correcting for the thickness of the adsorbed layer. Evidence is presented for orientation of sorbate molecules in the first layer on ferric oxide gel, and, to some extent, on silica gel D. The volumes adsorbed at saturation obey Gurwitsch Rule in every case. Ethylene diamine has been shown to have a lower freezing point in the adsorbed state than in the bulk state. The vapour pressures and surface tensions of some of the sorbates have been determined, using methods suitable for <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquids.</b> <p...|$|R
50|$|Tetraethyl {{pyrophosphate}} is a {{very toxic}} organophosphorus ester. In its pure form it is a colourless, <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquid.</b> It is fully miscible with water and various types of organic solvents, except for petroleum based solvents. The liquid evaporates very slowly and hydrolyses very rapidly in water. Because the mechanism for the hydrolysis is first order, the half-lifes were determined to be 7.5 hours at 25 °C and 3.1 hours at 40 °C when dissolved in distilled water. If one heats TEPP it will start to decompose at around 150-200 °C, which produces ethylene gas. Furthermore, acidic fumes of phosphoric acid and carbon monoxide could be formed. At lower temperatures TEPP could form triethylphosphate and ethyl metaphosphates, which are acid catalysed reactions.|$|E
5000|$|MSF is a clear, colorless to {{yellowish}} <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquid</b> (attracts {{and holds}} water by absorption or adsorption). It is corrosive and highly toxic. It is an oxydiaphoric inhibitor (acid-transferring inhibitor) of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. MSF, {{which is a}} liquid at room temperature, has a vapor pressure of 19.2 mmHg, slightly more volatile than water which has a vapor pressure of 18.8 mmHg at 21 °C. This vapor has an LCt50 (lethal concentration, 50% death rate in a given time) in rats of between 4 and 5 parts per million (ppm) during one hour of exposure or between 1 and 1.2 ppm during 7 hours of exposure. MSF produced no subtle biological effects from direct action of MSF independent {{of its ability to}} inhibit cholinesterase. Repeated exposures to 1/10 of the LCt50 did not produce overt systemic toxicity or significant pathology. [...] MSF can also cause severe skin burns and serious eye damage, if contact is made.

Voltammograms revealed complex electrochemical behaviour and several cathodic and anodic signals that {{could be attributed to}} the formation of indium chloro complexes during the scan, due to changes in the concentration ratio [Cl−]/[In(III) ] of interfacial species during the In(III) reduction reaction. A procedure for the electrodeposition of indium avoiding the use of the indium chloride precursor is then proposed. It offers an improved morphology of the electrodeposit and an increase in faradic yield from 33 % to 85 % compared to chloride-containing RTILs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe liquid/vapour {{phase change}} {{of water in}} soil is {{involved}} in many environmental geotechnical processes. In the case of <b>hygroscopic</b> soils, the <b>liquid</b> water is strongly adsorbed on the solid phase and this particular thermodynamic state can highly influence the phase change kinetics. Based on the linear Thermodynamic of Irreversible Processes ideas, the non-equilibrium phase change rate is written as a linear function of the water chemical potential difference between the liquid and vapour state. In this relation, the system {{is characterized by a}} phenomenological coefficient which depends on the state variables. Using an original experimental set-up able to analyse the response of a porous medium subjected to non-equilibrium conditions, the phase change coefficient is determined in various configurations. This paper focuses on the influence of the gas phase pressure and underlines that a low gas pressure decreases the phase change kinetics. Then, evaporation and condensation processes are compared showing an asymmetric behaviour. These experimental results are interpreted from a microscopic point of view by relying on recent works dealing with molecular dynamics numerical simulation of the liquid/gas interface...|$|R

30|$|Classically, when spore {{prints are}} to be {{produced}} from mushrooms with open hymenia such as for species identification or when individual basidiospores {{are to be}} isolated for germination, mushroom caps are laid facing down onto a surface (see “Introduction” section), in compliance to their orientation in nature. Under saturating levels of humidity, matured basidiospores are propelled off from the sterigmata on their basidia by fast hygroscopic development and subsequent actions of Buller’s drop. The surface energy obtained from the Buller’s drop by its fusion with the also <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquid</b> adaxial spore film is calculated to be sufficient for the spores to just reach the middle in between two lamellae or ridges or of a pore in order to then fall {{down out of the}} mushroom by gravity (Ingold 1939, 1957, 1992; Webster et al. 1984 a, 1989; Turner and Webster 1991; Pringle et al. 2005; Noblin et al. 2009; Fischer et al. 2010 a, b). In this study, we show indirectly by a dependence on high humidity that ejection of ballistospores from their sterigmata is a prerequisite for later collection of basidiospores from plastic lids positioned above upside-down incubated mushrooms with open hymenia. This is however not all.|$|E
40|$|Evaporative pads are {{frequently}} {{used for the}} cooling of greenhouses. However, a drawback of this method is the consumption of freshwater. In this paper it is shown, both theoretically and through a practical example, that effective evaporative cooling can be achieved using seawater in place of fresh water. The advantages and drawbacks of using seawater are discussed more generally. In climates that are both hot and humid, evaporative systems cannot always provide sufficient cooling, {{with the result that}} cultivation often has to be halted during the hottest months of the year. To overcome this, we propose a concept in which a desiccant pad is used to dehumidify the air before it enters the evaporative pad. The desiccant pad is supplied with a <b>hygroscopic</b> <b>liquid</b> that is regenerated by the energy of the sun. The performance of this concept has been modelled and the properties of various liquids have been compared.
