The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). Stead began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>or</b> why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E
5|$|The French army {{experienced}} {{a variety of}} command problems, especially in its early operations in southwestern Germany. After the defeat at Stockach, the army withdrew into the Black Forest. Jourdan relinquished command provisionally to Ernouf, who was a capable staff officer but had insufficient experience to hold together a varied and demoralized force. Jourdan retired to Strasbourg, where <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>or</b> claimed he was, indisposed. By the time Masséna arrived to take command, organization and discipline was in shambles. Only four divisional generals had remained at their posts: Klein, Ferino, Souham, and Vandamme. Decaen was under arrest in Strasbourg, pending a Courts-martial, as was d'Hautpoul, for his failure to organize a timely cavalry attack at Stockach. The others had disappeared to {{different parts of the}} southwest or had gone to France. No one knew where Bernadotte had gone, and Saint Cyr had retired to Mannheim. The latter was at least reachable. Lecourbe, who had been injured at Stockach, had withdrawn to Paris to recover; in a strategically astute move, he remained there until late November, when he was able to offer Napoleon direct assistance in his coup, and thus acquired Bonaparte's attention and gratitude.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless {{for all of}} {{his wealth}} and {{innovation}} Little's ignominious end ensured he was quickly forgotten, and by the time Edwin Lefèvre published his now-classic Reminiscences of a Stock Operator in 1923 he was virtually unknown. To demonstrate this Lefèvre details asking nine seasoned members of the NYSE whether or not they had ever heard of Jacob Little before; only three of them did, and none could name who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>or</b> what he had done, only knowing of his existence from having heard his name before. Lefèvre provided for this fact by saying [...] "what happened to Jacob was no more than what happens to thousands every year. The difference in degree does not make it more memorable." [...] Though it had once been that [...] "on change his tread was that of a king", today Little has been relegated to obscurity, and survives only as a footnote in histories of the stock market.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>or</b> {{what he was going to}} do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

500|$|They {{considered}} {{working on}} the show {{to be similar to}} working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] and [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." [...] Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to [...] "liven up the show", the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>or</b> why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show." [...] The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E

2500|$|If Pătrașcu's {{claim was}} truthful, Radu Paisie {{may have also}} been the posthumous {{grandfather}} of Princes Petru Cercel and Michael the Brave. According to Cîrstina, the [...] "circle of power, formed around the family of Radu Paisie", was active in obtaining the throne for both of his presumed grandsons. However, Filipescu doubts Michael's claim and the legends associated with it, noting that [...] "no historian of ours (or foreign) attests as to who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>or</b> how he took the throne". According to an early assessment by Iorga, Michael was born to Pătrașcu's paramour, Teodora, rather than to Princess-consort Voica; this account was backed by other scholars. In contrast, Nicolaescu underlined that, beyond all doubt, Teodora was Pătrașcu's legal wife. Dan Pleșia also endorses the Radu—Pătrașcu—Michael genealogy. Moreover, he argues that another son of Prince Radu had heirs, which included Radu Florescu, who was at once Michael's Clucer, confidant, uncle and in-law.|$|E
2500|$|Progressively after Nicolae Ceauşescu's arrival to power, {{an event}} which {{signaled}} {{the start of}} relative liberalization together with the open encouragement of nationalism, Georgescu responded to the official policies. Dimisianu mentions Georgescu, together with Miron-Radu Parashivescu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, Baconsky, Dumitrescu, Jebeleanu, Bogza, and Cohmălniceanu, among those who actively helped his generation, as [...] "writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and [...] were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism". At that stage, Bedros Horasangian argues, Georgescu [...] "played along", transforming himself from a [...] "not at all naïve or innocent critic and literary ideologue" [...] into a person who acknowledged the change in perspective. According to Horasangian, Georgescu himself was [...] "joking that 'Winter and summer are different things'—he probably always knew, just like Leonte Răutu, who, the more vigilant <b>he</b> <b>was</b> (<b>or</b> appeared), the more intensely he was reading 'rightist' French newspapers and magazines". During a 2004 interview, reflecting {{on the value of}} literature produced under communism, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu recalled: [...] "Paul Georgescu had a saying he used when I was asking him with half-irony: 'Mr. Paul, how was it possible that you wrote so badly in the years of dogmatism?'.

2500|$|... "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" [...] mainly {{deals with}} themes {{commonly}} known as [...] "jumping the shark," [...] instances that usually occur when a failing show adds a new character or twist to boost ratings. Before production of season eight began, Fox executives suggested the staff to add a new character to the show, who would live with the Simpsons on a permanent basis. The staff, amused with the idea, decided to write this episode as a commentary on {{what it was like}} to work on a television show that had been on the air for several years. Parallel to Poochie being introduced on Itchy & Scratchy, they inserted the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>or</b> why he was there, as a reference to the executive's proposal. Usually, this is a technique used in shows that involves children who have grown up. This was the case in [...] "Oliver" [...] in The Brady Bunch or [...] "Luke" [...] on Growing Pains. The episode was intended to be a commentary on {{what it was like to}} work on a television show that had been on the air for a long time but was nearing its end. It was intended to show that The Simpsons could still be good after eight seasons, even though it no longer had the [...] "shock value" [...] it did in the early years. The Simpsons would, in a later episode [...] "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase," [...] mock the addition of The Great Gazoo into some of the final episodes of The Flintstones by stating that, in future episodes, Homer would meet a green space alien named Ozmodiar that only he can see.|$|E
