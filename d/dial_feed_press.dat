40|$|For {{dairy farmers}} {{involved}} in winter milk production a high intake of forage {{is required by}} autumn calved dairy cows to produce a high milk yield with a moderate level of concentrate supplementation. Since intake of grass silage is often limiting, alternative forages or feeds {{may be needed to}} maximise forage intake. In areas not suitable for growing maize alternative forages need to be considered. These could include limited amounts of very high quality grass silage (DMD 750 - 800 g /kg), grazed autumn pasture or bulky by-product feeds, e. g. superpressed sugar beet pulp. An experiment was conducted involving 5 treatments in which a standard good quality grass silage (S) was partially replaced with either very high quality grass silage, which was either unwilted (U) or wilted (W), ensiled pressed sugar beet pulp (P) or with autumn pasture (G). These additional feeds were fed at a level of 5 kg DM/day to autumn calved cows in early lactation over a period of 8 weeks from late October to late December. The pressed pulp diet (P) included 0. 5 kg DM soyabean meal to increase its protein level. The autumn grass was cut daily and fed indoors. The additional feeds were fed on top of the standard silage in individual feeding boxes and the standard silage was fed ad libitum to cows on all treatments. The cows were fed concentrates at 6 kg/day in two feeds on all treatments. The digestibility of the standard grass silage (754 g DMD/kg) was higher than planned and was only slightly less than that of the high quality supplementary silages (783 g DMD/kg). Feeding the U and W silages did not increase total forage intake but did increase milk yield by 1. 7 - 1. 9 kg/day compared with silage S alone. Milk fat and protein concentration tended to be reduced on the diets containing U and W silages, consequently yield of fat and protein were not significantly increased compared with silage S. Forage intake was increased by 8 % (0. 8 kg DM/day) when silage S was supplemented with autumn grass and milk yield was increased by 1. 5 kg/day without affecting milk composition. Intake of silage was reduced by 37 % by feeding grass. <b>Feeding</b> the <b>pressed</b> pulp supplement (P) increased intake of forage (+ 1. 1 kg DM/day), increased milk yield by 2. 7 kg/day and also improved milk protein concentration and yield (+ 121 g/day). Cows gained in liveweight to a similar extent on all diets. It was concluded that <b>feeding</b> <b>pressed</b> pulp with a good quality grass silage had the greatest effect on forage intake and milk production whereas feeding high quality grass silages or autumn grass had a smaller effect. Larger increases in intake and milk production would be expected from these feeds if the standard grass silage was of lower digestibility (~ 700 g DMD/kg), similar to average quality first cut silage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the MANPRESS robot: a simple, low-cost and newly developed industrial device primarily devoted to <b>press</b> <b>feeding.</b> This robot exhibits two major features: great flexibility to accommodate different machines and products, and optimal performance in loading/unloading {{one or more}} machines. The first {{is due to the}} usage of modular, off the shelf and easy to control system components. The second {{is the result of the}} devising and implementation of modern control algorithms derived from discrete event systems theory. Loading/unloading strategies that can be used in automatic <b>press</b> <b>feeding</b> and their associated performance is an actual and important subject, but seldom noticed in current scientific literature. Contributing to fill this gap, this is the major subject of the present paper. A case study is provided illustrating the developed theory. Moreover, the same case study shows that in a realistic scenario a gain in performance of 15 % can be easily achieved when the proper loading/unloading strategy is used. However, and in practice, such a benefit can only be attained from a simple to control and very flexible loading/unloading device such as the MANPRESS robot. Thus, the main mechanical and control features of the robot are also described in this paper...|$|R
50|$|During these years, Tirso and {{his family}} {{maintained}} their close relations with Carlos VII's family and were frequent visitors to the Palazzo Loredan in Venice.

It seems that his sons have already started to assume some of his tasks and it is indeed difficult to tell which Olazábal is referred to in various press notes from that period. Tirso is known to have exchanged vast correspondence with other Carlist leaders and upon death of the then Jefe Delegado Matías Barrio in 1909 he was invariably reported by the press as one of his potential successors; though the job went to Bartolomé Feliu instead.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Massó {{intended}} to instaurate the Carlist dynasty by means of new social mobilization or he tried to promote profound transformation using Carlos Hugo as an agent of change; anyway, the two threads became intertwined. The immediate political objective of Massó was to prevent the Alfonsist restoration. The young Carlists dogged the juanista niño, boycotting or jeering Juan Carlos; they publicly humiliated the royal prince and his wife a few times. At the same time, Massó engineered a campaign to promote Carlos Hugo across the country. The operation revealed much understanding of the media role in the consumer society, as it exploited common tabloid threads and kept <b>feeding</b> the <b>press</b> with new scoops (the prince as a miner in Asturias, at a parachute course, at Sanfermines) and taking advantage of charm and youth of the prince's three sisters. The efforts proved fairly successful, as in the tightly censured media the Borbon-Parmas gained sort of nationwide positive recognition.|$|R
