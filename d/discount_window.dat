5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} {{financial}} regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through <b>discount</b> <b>windows,</b> standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|R
2500|$|The Term Auction Facility is {{a program}} in which the Federal Reserve auctions term funds to {{depository}} institutions. The creation of this facility was announced by the Federal Reserve on December 12, 2007, and was done {{in conjunction with the}} Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to address elevated pressures in short-term funding markets. The reason it was created is that banks were not lending funds to one another and banks in need of funds were refusing to go to the <b>discount</b> <b>window.</b> Banks were not lending money to each other because there was a fear that the loans would not be paid back. Banks refused to go to the <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> because it is usually associated with the stigma of bank failure. Under the Term Auction Facility, the identity of the banks in need of funds is protected {{in order to avoid the}} stigma of bank failure. Foreign exchange swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank were opened so the banks in Europe could have access to U.S. dollars.

2500|$|Usually, the {{short-term}} goal of {{open market operations}} is to achieve a specific short-term interest rate target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, {{in the case of}} the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate, the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) <b>Discount</b> <b>window</b> lending (as lender of last resort); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) [...] "Open mouth operations" [...] (talking monetary policy with the market).|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Reserve is self-funded. The vast {{majority}} (90%+) of Fed revenues come from open market operations, specifically {{the interest on}} the portfolio of Treasury securities as well as [...] "capital gains/losses" [...] that may arise from the buying/selling of the securities and their derivatives as part of Open Market Operations. The balance of revenues come from sales of financial services (check and electronic payment processing) and <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> loans. The Board of Governors (Federal Reserve Board) creates a budget report once per year for Congress. There are two reports with budget information. The one that lists the complete balance statements with income and expenses {{as well as the}} net profit or loss is the large report simply titled, [...] "Annual Report".

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{scheme for}} estimating and adapting distributions in real-time for non-stationary data {{has recently been}} the focus of study for several different tasks relating to time series and data mining, namely change point detection, outlier detection and online compression / sequence prediction. An appealing feature is that unlike more sophisticated procedures, it is as fast as the related stationary procedures which are simply modified through <b>discounting</b> or <b>windowing.</b> The <b>discount</b> scheme makes older observations lose their influence on new predictions. The authors of this article recently used a discount scheme for introducing an adaptive version of the Context Tree Weighting compression algorithm. The mentioned change point and outlier detection methods rely on the changing compression ratio of an online compression algorithm.

25|$|In March 2014, The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} that because Microsoft and Google had both implemented policies which effectively ban the certification of devices which dual-boot both Android and Windows, the Transformer Book Duet would be cancelled, and Asus would pull its similar all-in-one desktops from the market. Both companies had reportedly {{objected to the}} concept of dual-OS devices of this nature as early as January 2014. Prior to CES, an analyst believed that Microsoft was discouraging manufacturers from releasing such devices because they would dilute Windows 8 and Windows Phone's software ecosystem (which Microsoft was reportedly planning to unify). He also speculated that Microsoft would penalize OEMs by forfeiting <b>discounts</b> on <b>Windows</b> licenses and refusing to provide them with financing for marketing. Additionally, even though Android is an open source operating system that is freely available, Google's application suite is proprietary, and can only be licensed for devices which are approved by the company. This would prevent such devices from including access to Google Play, Android's primary application store.|$|R
50|$|Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks (Regulation A) {{establishes}} rules regarding <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> lending, {{the extension}} of credit by the Federal Reserve Bank to banks and other institutions. The Federal Reserve Board made significant amendments to Regulation A in 2003, including amendments to price certain discount-window lending at above-market rates and to restrict borrowing to banks in generally sound condition. In amending the regulation, the Federal Reserve Board noted that many banks had expressed their unwillingness to use discount-window borrowing because their use of such a funding source was interpreted as sign of the bank's financial weakness or distress. The Federal Reserve Board indicated its hope that the 2003 amendments would make <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> lending a more attractive funding option to banks.|$|E

5000|$|Whether or not {{the lender}} of last resort has a {{responsibility}} for saving individual banks {{has been a very}} controversial topic. Does the lender of last resort provide liquidity to the market as a whole (through open market operations) or should it (also) make loans to individual banks (through <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> lending)? ...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} views on this question, {{the money and the}} banking view: the money view, as argued, for example, by Goodfriend and King, and Capie, suggests, that the lender of last resort should provide {{liquidity}} to the market by open market operations only because it suffices to limit panics. What they call [...] "banking policy" [...] (<b>discount</b> <b>window</b> lending) may even be harmful because of moral hazard. The banking view finds that in reality the market does not allocate liquidity efficiently in times of crisis. Liquidity provided through open market operations is not efficiently distributed among banks in the interbank market, and there is a case for <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> lending. In a well-functioning interbank market only solvent banks can borrow. However, if the market is not functioning, even solvent banks may be unable to borrow, most likely because of asymmetric information.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the subprime mortgage crisis and {{to the collapse of}} Bear Stearns, on March 19, 2008, the Federal Reserve set up the Primary Dealers Credit Facility (PDCF), whereby primary dealers could borrow at the Fed's <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> using several forms of collateral including mortgage-backed loans.

50|$|However, a {{potential}} bank run had begun on certain money market funds. If this situation had worsened, {{the ability of}} major corporations to secure needed short-term financing through ABCP issuance would have been significantly affected. To assist with liquidity throughout the system, the Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank announced that banks could obtain funds via the Federal Reserve's <b>Discount</b> <b>Window</b> using ABCP as collateral.|$|E
50|$|The <b>discount</b> <b>window</b> is an {{instrument}} of monetary policy (usually controlled by central banks) that allows eligible institutions to borrow money from the central bank, usually on a short-term basis, to meet temporary shortages of liquidity caused by internal or external disruptions. The term originated with the practice of sending a bank representative to a reserve bank teller window when a bank needed to borrow money.|$|E
5000|$|On June 21, 1970, Penn Central {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and defaulted on approximately $77.1 million of commercial paper.

5000|$|Other {{monetary}} policy tools {{to expand the}} money supply include decreasing interest rates by fiat; increasing the monetary base; and decreasing reserve requirements.
