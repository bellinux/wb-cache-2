5|$|The CFM56 fan {{features}} dovetailed <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> {{which allows}} them to be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/SNECMA claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> The lower speed allows the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E

A portion of each <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> of the second <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> row extends through a flowpath of the counterrotatable booster compressor so as {{to function as a}} compressor blade in the second compressor blade row. The counterrotatable booster compressor further includes a first platform member integral with each <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> of the second <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> row at a first location so as to form an inner flowpath for the counterrotatable booster compressor and a second platform member integral with each <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> of the second <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> row at a second location so as to form an outer flowpath for the counterrotatable booster compressor...|$|R
40|$|Blade-like {{specimens}} {{were subjected}} to static ballistic impact testing to determine their relative FOD impact resistance levels. It was determined that a plus or minus 15 deg layup exhibited good impact resistance. The design of a large solid boron/aluminum <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> was conducted based on the FOD test results. The CF 6 <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> {{was used as a}} baseline for these design studies. The solid boron/aluminum <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> design was used to fabricate two blades. This effort enabled the assessment of the scale up of existing blade manufacturing details for the fabrication of a large B/Al <b>fan</b> <b>blade.</b> Existing CF 6 <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> tooling was modified for use in fabricating these blades...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} realize {{lightweight}} {{design of a}} high-bypass turbofan engine, topology optimization of vacuum structure on a wide-chord <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> was carried out regarding mixed loading conditions as static strength, vibration and bird-strike. Without changing the leaf shape, relationship of performance indices on vacuum structure was analyzed with simplified mechanical model of loading conditions. Topology optimization designs were carried out according to the highly sensitive conditions. Vacuum structure layout of <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> was constructed integrating the major load transfer paths in each design proposal. Performance indices of different <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> structures were compared. Result shown that optimized <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> can realize lightweight as well as meeting the strength design requirement...|$|R
5|$|Improvements {{are due to}} its 61-inch {{titanium}} wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new {{core and}} low-pressure turbine with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). <b>Fan</b> <b>blades</b> are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular combustor as an option.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E

In this paper, a digital resonant control technique emulating passive shunt circuits {{is used to}} demonstrate vibration reduction of FAN 1 Ti real <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> at the several target modes. Single-mode control and multi-mode control using one piezoelectric material are demonstrated. Also a conceptual study of how to implement this digital control system into the rotating <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> is discussed...|$|R

25|$|Noise — Sound energy {{emitted by}} a cooling tower and heard (recorded) {{at a given}} {{distance}} and direction. The sound is generated by the impact of falling water, by the movement of air by fans, the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> moving in the structure, vibration of the structure, and the motors, gearboxes or drive belts.|$|E
25|$|The F/A-18E/F's radar {{cross-section}} was reduced greatly from some aspects, mainly {{the front and}} rear. The design of the engine inlets reduces the aircraft's frontal {{radar cross-section}}. The alignment of the leading edges of the engine inlets is designed to scatter radiation to the sides. Fixed fanlike reflecting structures in the inlet tunnel divert radar energy away from the rotating <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{unstable}} operation {{results from}} the development of pressure gradients {{in the opposite direction}} of the flow. Maximum pressure is observed at the discharge of the impeller blade and minimum pressure on the side opposite to the discharge side. When the impeller blades are not rotating these adverse pressure gradients pump the flow in the direction opposite to the direction of the fan. The result is the oscillation of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> creating vibrations and hence noise.|$|E

25|$|Periodic {{vibration}} of a {{cyclone separator}} would indicate vortex instability. Large centrifugal fans sometimes use radial inlet blades {{that can be}} rotated to control the flow into the fan; they create a swirling flow. At near shutoff, where the swirl is very high, rotating blade stall of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> occurs. Although not researched, it is highly likely that swirl instability is the cause. The feedback is clearly hydrodynamic (Class I) {{and there is no}} indication that more than one stage occurs.|$|E
25|$|After another {{incident}} of desecration of the Koran, Kurnaz said that Afghan prisoners tore down a ceiling fan, honed blades, and attacked their captors using the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> as swords. No soldiers were killed, though some were badly bloodied. Three more prisoners subsequently died. Kurnaz {{said that people}} from the cellblock of these prisoners {{talked to him about}} events. They described the metal shutters being closed. They said that night, soldiers carried three of the prisoners out of their cells dead, with pieces of torn sheet in their mouths and other torn sheets binding their arms and legs. US authorities said these three prisoners had committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|By {{designing}} the <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> with proper hub-to-tip ratio and analyzing {{performance on the}} number of blades so that the flow doesn't separate on the blade surface these effects can be reduced. Some of the methods to overcome these effects are re-circulation of excess air through the fan, axial fans are high specific speed devices operating them at high efficiency and to minimize the effects they have to be operated at low speeds. For controlling and directing the flow use of guide vanes is suggested. Turbulent flows at the inlet and outlet of the fans cause stalling so the flow should be made laminar by the introduction of a stator to prevent the effect.|$|E

25|$|Using a {{captured}} spider, the Doctor {{determines that}} the Meme are responsible. The Meme {{turn out to}} be empty shells, and the real controller is revealed to be Lady Cassandra. Cassandra admits to being the saboteur, her original plan was to hold the assembled elite for ransom, but now intends to use their deaths to generate profit from their companies to finance her operations. Cassandra teleports to her ship as the spiders bring down the shielding on the entire station and the gravity satellites are turned off. The direct radiation causes the solar filters to strain and crack, killing several of the guests from the intense radiation exposure and once again threatening Rose. The Doctor and Jabe travel to the bowels of Platform One to restore the automated shields, but it requires one of them to travel through several spinning fans. Jabe recognises the Doctor as the last Time Lord and sacrifices herself to hold down a switch to slow down the <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> This allows the Doctor to reactivate the system just before the expanding Sun hits the station and destroys Earth.|$|E
500|$|The CFM56 {{features}} a single-stage fan, and most variants have a three-stage booster on the low-pressure shaft, with four {{stages in the}} -5B and -5C variants. The booster is also commonly called the [...] "low-pressure compressor" [...] (LPC) as it sits on the low-pressure shaft and compresses the flow initially before it reaches the high-pressure compressor. The original CFM56-2 variant featured 44 tip-shrouded <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> {{although the number of}} <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> was reduced in later variants as wide-chord blade technology developed, down to 22 blades in the latest variant, the CFM56-7.|$|E
2500|$|Surging {{should not}} be {{confused}} with stalling.

40|$|This work {{develops}} a methodology for full engine FEA simulation of the <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> off containment test {{for a jet engine}} using LS-Dyna. The <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> off containment test is a safety requirement involving the intentional {{release of a}} <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> when the engine is running at full power. The released blade must not pierce or fracture the engine cases during the impact or rotating unbalance. The novel feature of the LS-Dyna simulation is the extensive full engine geometry as well as the widespread use of nonlinearities (mainly plasticity and friction) to absorb the large kinetic energies of the engine rotors. The methodology is simple to use, runs quickly and is being recognized by industry as a contender for widespread implementation. Future applications look promising enough that the methodology warrants further development and refinement...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a {{finite element method}} in 2 D and 3 D to simulate the super plastic forming of a demonstrator jet engine <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> made from Titanium alloy sheet. The <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> is an assembly of three sheets in which a single inner (core) sheet is diffusion bonded to the two outer (skin) sheets at prescribed zones, which is then super-plastically formed to a desired fan profile. In the model, the diffusion bonded zones between the core and skin sheets are simulated using tied interfaces. The thickness of each skin sheet is not uniform and significant change in thickness can occur over a short distance as well as gradually over the entire skin sheet. The thickness of the core sheet which is smaller than the thickness of each skin sheet remains uniform.
