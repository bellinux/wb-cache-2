40|$|This text {{deals with}} the {{geochemistry}} of <b>iron</b> <b>ores.</b> By means of spectrochemical analyses some significant minor constituents have been determined in samples mainly from the pre-Cambrian iron-ore regions of Sweden. For the sake of comparison some samples of <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> of different age from non-Swedish regions have been analysed. On {{the basis of the}} analytical data available some significant statistical quantities have been computed in <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> {{as well as in the}} main igneous rock series. Special regard has been paid to the relationship between the distribution principles governing some major constituents in the <b>iron</b> <b>ores,</b> on the one hand, and in the igneous rocks on the other. A method is proposed for geochemical investigations of igneous rocks by means of statistical data. With the aid of geochemical premises the endogene relationship between <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> and their associated igneous rocks has been discussed.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{is focused on}} the <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> {{granulation}} process in a laboratory-scale batch drum granulator using water as a binder, and on the investigation of the influence of raw material properties (morphology and wettability of the primary particles) on its kinetics. Nowadays processing of <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> often requires a modification of particle size by means of granulation in order to improve further processability. A comparison of the granulation behaviour of three types of <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> (magnetite, hematite and goethite) has been carried out. The wettability of the powders has been characterised by contact angle measurement. The results confirm the hydrophobic and hydrophilic characters of magnetite and goethite respectively.

5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{impending}} cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> mining and exporting. The Port of Port Hedland, a highly important <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> shipping terminal, was forced to close for about 52 hours, contributing to inflated <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> prices and delayed shipments. Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region, cutting national oil production by 25% and <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> exports by 4.7% versus the previous month. Overall, Lua is attributed to $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in lost revenue. Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land, but damage was limited {{by the lack of}} population in the storm's path. The Pardoo Roadhouse bore the brunt of the storm, and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads; at these sites, the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees. Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather. The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas, and Lua was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

40|$|The absence, until now, of {{evidence}} for the smelting of nickel‐rich <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> has led to much speculation about the respective nature and properties of smelted nickel‐rich iron compared to iron meteorites.

Experimental smelting of similar <b>iron</b> <b>ores</b> has shown that there are large variations in the nickel distribution in the bloom, but only those sections thereof with a low nickel content could be worked in a smithy.

Also direct reduction iron (DRI) process use natural gases instead of coals which can greatly reduce the environmental pollution and lower the processes cost.
