Overview of Literature: The tear drop fracture of the lower cervical spine is generally associated with {{a high incidence of}} neurological deficits and surgery is needed to treat this injury. Tear drop fracture of C 2 is usually a stable fracture that is amendable to conservative treatment. Methods: We reviewed the outcomes of 25 patients. Cervical tear drop fracture was classified as the <b>extension</b> and flexion <b>types</b> according to the mechanism of injury. The neurologic symptoms were evaluated by the Frankel classification system, and the loss of lordosis and disc height, and the duration of bony union were analyzed. Results: Twenty one patients had the flexion type injury and 4 patients had the <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> injury. All the patients with the flexion type were treated by anterior decompression and plate stabilization. All the patients with the <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> were treated conservatively. Ten patients with the flexion type had neurologic deficits. The nerve root injuries recovered fully and the incomplete injuries had an average 1. 5 grade recovery. Radiologically, the <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> fracture showed bony union at an average of 12. 8 weeks. For the patients with the flexion type fracture, the loss of lordosis was 2. 6 �and the loss of disc height was 2. 1 mm. The period of bony union in 20 cases was 13. 0 weeks. Conclusions: Anterior plate stabilization was an effective treatment for the flexion type tear drop fracture. Conservative treatment is thought {{to be one of the}} good clinical methods for treating the <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> tear drop fracture.

Three <b>types</b> of <b>bell</b> {{mouth with the}} inward bell mouths whose exit diameter are larger than the impeller inner diameter of multi-blade centrifugal fan used in floor standing air-conditioner are investigated by using the numerical simulation method. Three bell mouths are as follows: The first <b>type</b> of <b>bell</b> mouth is the inward inlet used in the original air-conditioner. The second type is the inward inlet whose axial height {{is larger than the}} first type. The third type is the new mold line inward inlet with smaller slope angle than the first type.

In this paper, we consider the extension problem when the codomains are general spaces.

We extend the notion of <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> which has been defined for the class of CW complexes and introduce the notion of approximate <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> which is defined for general spaces. We define approximate extension dimension analogously to extension dimension, replacing the class of CW complexes by the class of finitistic separable metrizable spaces.

An academic tertiary referral centre at Mumbai, India. Retrospective case review. 35 patients of vestibular schwannomas having size greater than 3  cm in extrameatal diameter with extension anterior to the internal auditory canal who underwent the enlarged translabyrinthine or transapical <b>extension</b> <b>type</b> I approach and with a minimum follow up of 1  year are considered. Other subjects who underwent translabyrinthine approach but did not fulfill the above criteria were excluded. Tumor was removed completely in 34 subjects (97. 1 %). Anatomic interruption of facial nerve occured in 4 cases (11. 4 %); 3 subjects underwent end to end anastomosis and 1 subject required a cable graft, these were done during the primary procedure itself. At 1 year follow up 28 subjects (80 %) had good facial function (Grade I and II, House Brackmann Grading). Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak was encountered in 1 subject (2. 9 %). 34 subjects (97. 1 %) had a normal albeit slow gait by the sixth post-operative day.
