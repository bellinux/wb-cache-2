5000|$|The soup is {{the more}} common version, in which rice {{vermicelli}} is mixed with a thin soup made of daggertooth pike conger,called thinbaw htoe (...) in Arakanese, nga shwe (...) in Burmese), Rakhine ngapi and lemongrass. Dry roasted pike conger <b>eel</b> flakes, <b>fried</b> onion and garlic, fresh coriander, red and green chili paste are added. It is also called arpu sharpu (...) which roughly means 'hot throat, hot tongue', due to the green chili paste. Some add fried pulverised nga phe and pork rind.|$|R
50|$|Soda {{bread is}} one of Northern Ireland’s unique griddle breads, it can be eaten straightaway, or cooked until golden in an Ulster fry. They are {{sometimes}} eaten with butter and homemade jam, or with savoury food such as smoked salmon, fresh <b>fried</b> <b>eel,</b> or thick dry-cured bacon.|$|R
50|$|Christmas Eve {{dinner is}} usually the time when all family membersjoin. It is {{typically}} done with spaghetti alle vongole followed by capitone fritto and baccalà fritto (deep <b>fried</b> <b>eel</b> and stockfish); as a side-dish there is the , a salad made with steamed cauliflower, giardiniera, spicy and sweet peppers (pupaccelle), olives and anchovies, all dressed with oil and vinegar.|$|R
40|$|In several {{countries}} such as the Netherlands, consumption of eel from polluted waters is not allowed because the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exceed official tolerance limits. Few experiments {{have been carried out}} to assess if pre-treatment, such as cooking and frying would alter the PCB concentrations and maybe bring them under the tolerance limits. We have carried out a frying and cooking experiment, which has shown that the concentrations of PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) increase in <b>eel</b> after <b>frying.</b> The effect of boiling is negligible. This shows that preparation methods for eel as food product do not help in bringing PCB and OCP concentrations down to safe values. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|In the Golden Girls episode [...] "Have Yourself a Very Little Christmas" [...] Sophia {{mentions}} that <b>fried</b> <b>eel</b> is a customary Christmas tradition in many Italian (Sicilian) households. She {{goes on to}} say [...] "In Sicily it wouldn't be Christmas without eels and larks." [...] Fried, steamed or dried eel is usually one of the fish included in the [...] "Seven Fishes" [...] tradition, though many Italians and Sicilians in particular simply refer to it as the vigil or Christmas dinner; a meal typically free of red meat and consisting entirely of seafood.|$|R
500|$|The largest {{hotel in}} Esbjerg is Hotel Britannica. Other hotels include Danhostel Esbjerg {{in a former}} high school about [...] to the {{northwest}} of the city, and Hotel Ansgar on Skolegade. Most of the restaurants in Esbjerg are {{to the east of}} Torvet. Of particular note are Sand's Restaurant which serves Danish cuisine such as smørrebrød, meatballs, smoked <b>eels</b> and the <b>fried</b> beef patty pariserbof, and the Paddy Go Easy Irish pub near the main square. Housed in a listed building on the main square, Dronning Louise serves everything from full meals to sandwiches and occasionally offers live music.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cause of}} Juba's {{death is a}} matter of speculation. Winter cited his [...] "almost superhuman schedule" [...] and the [...] "burning up his {{energies}} and health" [...] as the culprits. Assuming all of the Jubas are the same person, the record suggests that Juba worked day and night for 11 years—from 1839 to 1850. Especially in his early days, Juba worked for food, and would have been served the typical tavern meal of the time, <b>fried</b> <b>eels</b> and ale. Such a demanding schedule, coupled with poor food and little sleep, likely doomed Juba to his early death.|$|R
60|$|A {{simpler and}} less ambitious sort of cook-shop abounds {{in the region}} of Rialto, where on market mornings I have seen it driving a prodigious {{business}} with peasants, gondoliers, and laborers. Its more limited resources consist chiefly of <b>fried</b> <b>eels,</b> fish, polenta, and sguassetto. The latter is a true roba veneziana, and is a loud-flavored broth, made of those desperate scraps of meat which are found impracticable even by the sausage-makers. Another, but more delicate dish, peculiar to the place, is the clotted blood of poultry, fried in slices with onions. A great number of the families of the poor breakfast at these shops very abundantly, for three soldi each person.|$|R
40|$|This is the River Avon (including Glazebrook) {{fisheries}} survey 1978 report {{produced by}} South West Water Authority in 1978. This report aims {{to determine the}} penetration of Salmon into the River Avon system {{and to a lesser}} degree estimate the population of resident salmonids and other indigenous species. Six sections were electro fished at accessible points as detailed below. All fish were identified and measured. Each section was fished through three times to take the majority of the resident species. Small specimens of salmonid <b>fry,</b> <b>eels</b> and lamprey were common in almost all River Avon sections with the exception of Shipley bridge and Avon Dam but due to the mesh size of the standard dip nets used, many slipped through making accurate number estimation impossible...|$|R
