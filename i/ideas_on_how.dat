5|$|The 1950s and 1960s saw two {{developments}} {{that would affect}} stellar convection theory in red supergiants: the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure and Evolution of the Stars, principally the work of Martin Schwarzschild and his colleague at Princeton University, Richard Härm. This book disseminated <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to apply computer technologies to create stellar models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced {{some of the finest}} images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|As {{the head}} of research, Kaspersky {{authored}} papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats. Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which {{is believed to be}} the first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E

5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|The pair of {{interchanges}} connecting NY390 to I-490 and NY31 {{have two}} major movements that cause weaving. The first is on NY390 northbound, where traffic entering NY390 from I-490 west must immediately merge into traffic to avoid taking the NY31 exit while motorists already on NY390 must cross traffic coming from I-490 {{to reach the}} ramp for NY31. The other is on NY390 southbound, where commuters entering NY390 south from NY31 must cross several lanes of traffic to access I-490 east. Additionally, the junction between NY390/ I-390 and I-490 serves over 200,000 cars daily and is often heavily congested during the morning and evening rush hours. In July 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation began soliciting <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to improve the junction. Roughly $32million has been earmarked for a future project to improve the interchange, which is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably infeasible, and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E

5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, in his office, in dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{hints of}} the practice of inoculation for smallpox in China come during the 10th century. A Song dynasty (960–1279) chancellor of China, Wang Dan (957–1017), lost his eldest son to smallpox and sought a means to spare the rest of his family from the disease, so he summoned physicians, wise men, and magicians from all across the empire to convene at the capital in Kaifeng and share <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> to cure patients of it until a divine man from Mount Emei carried out inoculation.
