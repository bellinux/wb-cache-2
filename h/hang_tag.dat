5000|$|April Fool was {{introduced}} on February 26, 2007, {{as the first}} beanie to represent April Fool's Day. It was retired July 14 of the same year. Occasionally, the words [...] "April Fool" [...] on the <b>hang</b> <b>tag</b> appeared upside-down, but this was reported only to be a production error.|$|E
5000|$|All of {{the words}} {{on the inside of the}} <b>hang</b> <b>tag</b> are printed in black ink except for the words [...] "BEANIE BABY," [...] which are in red ink. The front of the tag has the yellow star with type that reads [...] "BEANIE ORIGINAL BUDDY." [...] The tush (or sewn-in) tags are of the same type (white with red heart and black letters) used on the Pillow Pals and the Ty Plush collectibles. The {{copyright}} year is 1998, for Beanie Buddies.|$|E
5000|$|One {{of the ten}} final beanies of 1999 was a {{black bear}} called [...] "The End." [...] It was this one in {{particular}} that gave the impression that beanies would be permanently discontinued. As the poem in the <b>hang</b> <b>tag</b> read [...] "All good things come to an end, it's been fun for everyone, peace and hope are never gone, love you all and say, so long," [...] this served to reinforce the belief that Beanie Babies may permanently cease to be produced.|$|E
30|$|As a {{response}} to increasing demand from environmentally and socially conscious consumers, leaders in the textile and apparel industry have begun to apply sustainable business strategies, such as presenting sustainability labels or marketing claims {{at the point of}} sale (Etsy and Winston 2009; Marquardt 2010). Clothing <b>hang</b> <b>tags</b> and product packages are common places to display sustainability messages to communicate with consumers (Phau and Ong 2007). Studies examining the general effectiveness of sustainability labels and marketing claims on apparel products, recommend continued use of such labels. Hyllegard et al. (2012) examined the use of <b>hang</b> <b>tags</b> in advertising companies’ sustainable practices and found that the use of <b>hang</b> <b>tags</b> containing detailed information and a third party logo increased participants’ positive attitudes toward apparel brand and also influenced their patronage intentions. Similarly, work by Kim et al. (2012) advised that critical factors for marketers to include in sustainability messages were related to environmental concerns and knowledge, as well as social influences. The team employed environmental marketing claims (intrinsic versus extrinsic claims) as the moderating variables in their study that explored how norms and environmental concerns influence purchase intentions. While the extrinsic marketing claims involving social norms were more effective in influencing consumers’ purchase intention, the intrinsic claims were more effective when personal environmental concerns were presented in the claims.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{growing trend}} {{to live a}} {{healthier}} lifestyle and increase {{quality of life is}} important for sportswear marketers worldwide. This study applied generational cohort theory to compare the consumer purchase behaviour of Generation Y and Baby Boomer cohorts with regard to sports compression garments. In this research, a simulation study was carried out in Germany, using eye-tracking technology. The study focused on understanding of consumer behaviour with respect to factors such as comfort, quality, technical attributes and methods of product promotion. It was found that Baby Boomers gave more attention to factors of quality and garment comfort, while Generation Y subjects were more interested in the aesthetic appeal of the garments as well as the technical information provided on the packaging and <b>hang</b> <b>tags...</b>|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{teamed up}} with Marnlen RFiD, a {{manufacturer}} of RFID labels, and Printronix, a maker of RFID printers, to demonstrate prototypes of the Clipped Tag, Wired News, May 1, 2006. The tag {{took the form of}} a garment <b>hang</b> <b>tag</b> with v-shaped notches in the edges and perforations to direct the tearing of the tag. Reactions by RFID privacy experts were favorable to the invention. According to Wired, Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said [...] "The Clipped Tag shows that IBM is addressing privacy concerns, even those that are unreasonable." [...] Subsequently, IBM and Marnlen RFiD announced that Marnlen had licensed the technology from IBM and was shipping samples to select users, RFID Update, November, 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Ty Girlz (2007-2013): a {{collection}} of plush dolls similar to Beanie Boppers. Each has a scratch-off code inside the <b>hang</b> <b>tag</b> that allowed access to a special interactive website at TyGirlz.com. Users could create their own rooms, explore the site's world, purchase clothing, and interact with the Ty Girlz characters. In January 2009, Ty released two new Ty Girlz, Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia. Media reports linked the names to Sasha and Malia Obama, daughters of United States President Barack Obama. Ty's Senior Vice President of Sales said that the dolls were not made to physically resemble either of the Obama daughters and that the names chosen [...] "worked very well with the dolls". The dolls were later retired and re-released as Marvelous Mariah and Sweet Sydney.|$|E

Island Avenue is now a residential parking zone, and you must buy a permit for Zone 14. The Miami Beach parking department office at 11th and Washington is temporarily closed during renovation of the city hall building, so the department is handling many permits by mail. Belle Isle residents can purchase a one-year residential decal or one visitor permit <b>hang</b> <b>tag</b> per household for $46.00 or a six-month pass for $23.00.

50|$|With Bo the Portuguese Water Dog {{being the}} last {{official}} Beanie Baby 2.0 announced in April 2009, {{and the introduction}} of a new offshoot line of Beanie Babies called Beanie Boos, it was unclear as to whether Ty had discontinued production of Beanie Babies 2.0 or whether future releases would be announced. In January 2010 in the new Ty spring catalog, the Beanie Babies 2.0 styles were shown to have been merged with the regular Beanie Babies, thus confirming that the line had been discontinued. For some time the online site still maintained its functionality and many Beanie Baby 2.0 styles still remain current. However, many styles such as Ming the panda bear and Topper the giraffe now sport original Beanie Baby <b>hang</b> <b>tags</b> without codes.|$|R

3000|$|According to the TRA, {{the more}} {{favorable}} a person’s attitudes and subjective norms are toward a particular behavior, the stronger {{their intention to}} perform that behavior (Ajzen 1991). Numerous studies focusing of socially responsible business practices have examined consumers’ patronage intentions (Kim et al. 2012; Hustvedt and Dickson 2009; Yan et al. 2010). Hyllegard et al.

In some cases, the dinosaurs were packaged in cardboard display boxes, in which case a small booklet featuring information on each dinosaur featured in the collection was included {{in lieu of the}} hang tags. In some instances, two or three models would be packaged together in a box. Examples include Dimetrodon and Deinonychus, Protoceratops and Euoplocephalus, Apatosaurus and Apatosaurus Baby, Elasmosaurus and Mosasaurus, and Australopithecus Male/Female pair and Smilodon. The boxes are not often seen today, {{and most of the time}} the dinosaurs are found free of packaging. Also produced for the collection was a specially-designed display [...] "mountain". The display featured multiple tiers upon which the pieces in the collection could be placed in a variety of creative ways. This display was touted primarily to retailers in order to encourage sales of the replicas, but the display has also become popular with collectors. A second display set was made in gray plastic that featured a volcano, but this design was short-lived.|$|E

Cataloging and storage methods used by museums and universities were examined. A cataloging system including an item registration number, a curator work sheet, and catalog file cards was established. A registration number based on the date of acquisition of a particular item was used. A two-part curator work sheet was filled out for each item in the collection. The curator work sheets were then used to fill out catalog file cards. Each costume item was labeled and stored in a clean, acid-free environment. The storage system provided for costume items to be stored hanging, in acid-free boxes, or on storage shelves.

30|$|All the six T-shirt {{products}} {{were evaluated by}} the SAC Higg Index tool that provides a value that represents how environmentally responsible an apparel item {{is in terms of}} sustainability. For this study, the tool Higg Index was used to obtain product scores for the abovementioned T-shirts. The final score was obtained by answering questions relating to the product materials and manufacturing environmental sustainability issues. The data used during this process include information readily available to the manufacturers, suppliers, merchandisers including <b>hang</b> <b>tags,</b> care labels, and product technical package descriptions, and throughout the LCA phase of the T-shirt. The product technical package detail information was the important source for various Higg Index-required information towards eco-sustainability evaluation. Higg Index requires that all materials present be entered into a material input table along with eco-manufacturing issues. This includes a description of all materials used in addition to information obtained from follow-up questions. By utilizing practice-based, qualitative binary yes/no questions, assessments were made as the sustainability performance of the product and drive behavior for improvement. Higg Index is a Microsoft Office Excel and web-based tool that has predetermined standard values based on a global survey for specific materials that are used in determining a score. Various links between inputs and outputs considered were based on Higg Index tools as the tool has predetermined standard values based on global survey and mathematical model for specific materials and manufacturing process issues. The higher the Higg Index score, the better the environmental performance of an apparel products.|$|R
40|$|The {{marketplace}} {{orientation in}} which consumer decisions toward product purchase, use, and disposal {{are shaped by}} a desire to preserve and protect the environment is growing. As such, environmental attitudes of consumers have influenced clothing purchase decisions. The concern over the interdependencies among human societies and the environment has brought environmentalism to the forefront of business marketing strategies. The textiles and apparel industry has been challenged by such ecological concerns as pollution of air and water in the textile manufacturing process, waste disposal problems with textile fibers, and potential shortage of raw materials from production of synthetic fibers. Many apparel companies have embraced the 2 ̆ 2 green marketing 2 ̆ 2 concept in an effort to capture the new environmentally responsible market. However, environmental claims in ads can be confusing to consumers and may not lead to favorable consumer response;Borrowing theoretical frameworks from advertising, a process model of consumer response toward apparel products in environmental ads was developed. A path model was hypothesized in accordance with several ad processing theories. The path model explains consumer environmental attitude and behavior in relation to apparel products and advertisements;A convenience sample of undergraduate students (N = 274) at a midwestern university was randomly distributed an advertisement portfolio (an experimental ad and three filler ads) and a questionnaire. The experimental ad promoted a fictitious brand t-shirt; one of three different types of environmental claims for 2 ̆ 2 organic cotton 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 recycled <b>hang</b> <b>tags,</b> 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 donation of profits 2 ̆ 2 or a control statement was included in the ad. Apparel-related and other measures were adapted from advertising, environmental, and textiles and clothing studies;Some differences among paths for environmental claim types were found. Overall, the influential role of perceived environmental claim credibility on the evaluation of the ad as well as the product can be noted. However, components of the model that explain consumer response to the advertisement and product showed stronger relationships. Linkages of environmental and apparel product attitudinal variables with consumer response variables (e. g., involvement with the visual and verbal aspects of the ad) were less significant...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Household energy use accounts for nearly one-fourth of all energy consumed in the United States, amounting to more than $ 200 billion per year spent by consumers. Recent increases in energy prices have heightened consumers' interest in making their households more energy efficient. To this end, the federal government manages two key efforts [...] EnergyGuide and Energy Star [...] to inform consumers about the energy consumed by certain household products. EnergyGuide is a mandatory labeling program created under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA) and administered by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with assistance from the Department of Energy (DOE). It requires manufacturers to label and prominently display information about the energy consumption and annual energy costs of 11 categories of household products. In recent years, manufacturers have used adhesive backed labels adhered to appliances and so-called "hang tags" loosely attached to the interior or exterior of appliances. In its August 2007 revisions to the rule, FTC, among other things, prohibited the use of <b>hang</b> <b>tags</b> on the exterior of appliances, but continues to allow them on the inside. The law requires retailers to provide this information in catalogs offering products for sale. In 2000, FTC interpreted its authority over catalogs to encompass Web sites and required retailers to provide the same information on Web sites where consumers may purchase such products. The law prohibits retailers from removing labels placed by manufacturers or making them illegible. Also, EPCA requires DOE, in consultation with FTC, to study new product categories {{to determine whether they}} should be added to the EnergyGuide program and to report annually on the energy savings of the program. Energy Star is a voluntary labeling program created in response to the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and jointly administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DOE. In general, it is designed to identify models for 26 categories of household products that, without sacrificing performance, are the most energy efficient (the top 25 percent). Manufacturers are permitted to apply the Energy Star logo to products that the manufacturers identify are qualified, based on EPA or DOE criteria. Standards for internal control in the federal government require federal agencies, including FTC, EPA, and DOE, to establish goals, measure performance, and report program costs and accomplishments in order to improve management and program effectiveness. In this context, Congress asked us to analyze the EnergyGuide and Energy Star programs to determine (1) how these programs have changed over time, (2) how federal agencies verify the accuracy of the energy consumption estimates for household products covered by these programs, (3) the actions federal agencies take to ensure that the EnergyGuide is available to consumers and that the Energy Star logo is not misused, and (4) how federal agencies measure the effectiveness and cost of these programs. ...|$|R
60|$|SCENE--Three weeks later. A {{corner of}} Fifth Avenue in the Fifties on a fine, Sunday morning. A general {{atmosphere}} of clean, well-tidied, wide street; {{a flood of}} mellow, tempered sunshine; gentle, genteel breezes.

The jeweler's window is gaudy with glittering diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls, etc., fashioned in ornate tiaras, crowns, necklaces, collars, etc. From each piece <b>hangs</b> an enormous <b>tag</b> from which a dollar sign and numerals in intermittent electric lights wink out the incredible prices.

40|$|The {{wheelchair}} {{has become}} a stereotypical symbol of physical disability. The image may appear as a picture, as on parking signs with a blue background and a white figure sitting in a wheelchair, or in reality when one sees an actual person sitting in one. Both images are useful in characterising the governance of the handicapped parking space, a field that presents a unique case study in the interpretation and enforcement of law. The parking space is legally reserved for vehicles marked by the Blue Wheelchair which <b>hangs</b> as a <b>tag</b> from the rearview mirror or on the licence plate; {{but at the same}} time it is socially reserved for vehicles driven by a person who is dependent upon an actual wheelchair. Law enforces this space formally by ticketing and/or towing violating vehicles. Society enforces this space informally through the disciplining gaze of onlookers. Legal enforcement is based upon the presence of the Blue Wheelchair symbol as it matches the sign that towers above the reserved spot. Social enforcement judges and disciplines through the qualifying observation of visible disability in the form of a wheelchair. However, what happens when a Blue Wheelchair symbol is present, but an actual wheelchair is absent? Which source of legitimacy is treated as the more authoritative...|$|R
