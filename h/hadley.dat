5|$|Hemingway's {{marriage}} to <b>Hadley</b> deteriorated {{as he was}} working on The Sun Also Rises. In early 1926, <b>Hadley</b> became aware of his affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July. On their return to Paris, <b>Hadley</b> asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while <b>Hadley</b> accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.|$|E
5|$|Kerson <b>Hadley</b> {{represented}} the Federated States of Micronesia as its only male swimmer {{competing in the}} Beijing Olympics. <b>Hadley</b> {{took part in the}} men's 50meters freestyle race. He was born in May 1989, and was 19 years old when he appeared in Beijing for his races. <b>Hadley</b> had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The preliminary round for the men's 50meters freestyle took place on August 14, with <b>Hadley</b> in the eight-person fifth heat. With a time of 25.34seconds, <b>Hadley</b> finished fifth, displacing John Kamyuka of Botswana (25.54seconds) but falling behind Andrey Molchanov of Turkmenistan (25.02seconds). The heat was led by Cameroon's Alain Brigion Tobe (24.53seconds) and Sidni Hoxha of Albania (24.56seconds). Of the 97 people who competed in the event's preliminary round, <b>Hadley</b> ranked 70th. He did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|The American Apollo 15 mission, {{the first}} of the J-series {{missions}} that featured both increased scientific capability {{and the use of the}} Lunar Roving Vehicle, landed in an area of the Hadley-Apennine region to the west of the Apennine Front situated between the mountains Mons <b>Hadley</b> and Mons <b>Hadley</b> Delta to the northeast and south, respectively. This landing site was selected with the objectives of exploring the Apennine Front, <b>Hadley</b> Rille, and other geologic features in the area.|$|E
500|$|The British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane also {{questions the}} extension of property rights to animals. Though describing <b>Hadley's</b> proposal as [...] "ingenious", he criticises it on two grounds. First, he questions <b>Hadley's</b> claim of a relationship between property and basic needs, and, second, denies that animal property rights would appease environmentalists, given that they would allow the destruction of environments which do not contain sentient animals. In a book review, Milburn stresses the significance of <b>Hadley's</b> theory, but questions {{the extent to which}} the implementation of animal property rights would be desirable without the achievement of other animal rights and the extent to which <b>Hadley's</b> account is genuinely about property rights.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hadley's</b> {{cancer surgery}} was {{initially}} successful, {{and he continued}} {{his career as a}} composer and guest conductor. However, his popularity as a composer began to wane, as popular and especially critical opinion turned against the robust romanticism which <b>Hadley's</b> music embodied. The quick success of the Berkshire Philharmonic Festival's first three seasons was a dream fulfilled {{at the end of his}} life. <b>Hadley's</b> cancer recurred, and he died in New York City on September 6, 1937.|$|R

It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it—from Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of <b>Hadley</b> Common, site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. The house had been registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949, previously known as Gladsmuir House, with an address in <b>Hadley</b> Wood Road. As of 2014 the address was listed as <b>Hadley</b> Common.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hadley</b> {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. <b>Hadley</b> has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hadley</b> {{is known}} for his theory of animal {{property}} rights, according to which animals should be afforded property rights over their territory. <b>Hadley</b> has developed his theory of animal property rights through his doctoral research, his 2015 monograph, and other academic works. In addition, he has authored popular articles on the subject for The Guardian, The Conversation and The Ethics Centre. He also discussed the topic on Knowing Animals, a podcast series produced by Siobhan O'Sullivan. His proposal has received attention in the popular press, with strong criticism from farmers' groups and journalists writing on rural affairs.|$|E
5|$|Jet streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and <b>Hadley</b> circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their jet streams. The Polar jet stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical jet forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and <b>Hadley</b> circulation cells.|$|E
50|$|After <b>Hadley’s</b> Park was created, Shelley Kramm {{was invited}} to help create new, similar parks.

Three more playgrounds were created at schools in Maryland and in Talbot County, Maryland.|$|R

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical <b>Hadley</b> cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the <b>Hadley</b> cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E

5|$|All winds on Venus are {{ultimately}} driven by convection. Hot air {{rises in the}} equatorial zone, where solar heating is concentrated, and flows to the poles. Such an almost-planetwide overturning of the troposphere is called <b>Hadley</b> circulation. However, the meridional air motions are much slower than zonal winds. The poleward limit of the planet wide <b>Hadley</b> cell on Venus is near ±60° latitudes. Here air starts to descend {{and returns to the}} equator below the clouds. This interpretation is supported by the distribution of the carbon monoxide, which is also concentrated in the vicinity of ±60° latitudes. Poleward of the <b>Hadley</b> cell a different pattern of circulation is observed. In the latitude range 60°–70° cold polar collars exist. They are characterised by temperatures about 30–40K lower than in the upper troposphere at nearby latitudes. The lower temperature is probably caused by the upwelling of the air in them and by the resulting adiabatic cooling. Such an interpretation is supported by the denser and higher clouds in the collars. The clouds lie at 70–72km altitude in the collars—about 5km higher than at the poles and low latitudes. A connection may exist between the cold collars and high speed midlatitude jets in which winds blow as fast as 140m/s. Such jets are a natural consequence of the Hadley–type circulation and should exist on Venus between 55–60° latitude.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 15 was {{the first}} mission in which landing sites were not {{restricted}} to equatorial areas. The Hadley-Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon than had been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating <b>Hadley</b> Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Following the Local Government Act 1888, the {{remaining}} county {{came under the}} control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of Monken <b>Hadley,</b> which became part of Hertfordshire. The area of responsibility of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex was reduced accordingly. Middlesex did not contain any county boroughs, so the county and administrative county (the area of county council control) were identical.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Andy overhears {{the captain}} of the guards, Byron <b>Hadley,</b> {{complaining}} about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, <b>Hadley</b> beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the warden begins using him to handle matters for himself and variety of people, including guards from other prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.|$|E
5|$|In June 1923, Hemingway took <b>Hadley,</b> with Robert McAlmon and Bird, to Spain {{where he}} found a new passion with his first visits to the bullfights. During the summer he wrote five new vignettes (chapters 12–16), all about bullfighting, {{finishing}} the last two on his return to Paris in August. That summer he also honed new narrative techniques in chapters 7–11. In August he reported to Pound {{that he was about}} to begin the last two pieces (chapters 17 and 18), implemented revisions that Pound suggested, and sent the manuscript to Bill Bird. Then he left Paris with <b>Hadley</b> (who was pregnant with their first child) for Toronto, where he was living when Bird finished producing the book.|$|E
