25|$|Though simply cast, promotional {{models were}} exquisitely {{detailed}} and proportioned, and by 1960, AMT became the main supplier of the pre-assembled model to American car companies. AMT worked most closely with Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation, but promo contracts among the model manufacturers seemed to alternate {{year to year}} (See Doty 2009a <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> history of AMT's Ford Galaxie). Shapes of the vehicles were near perfect, though in the 1950s, cellulose acetate, the plastic of choice, was prone to serious warping. In 1960, AMT and some other manufacturers switched to styrene (the brand name being Cycolac) and by 1964, {{all of the major}} model car manufacturers had changed over to the new plastic. This solved the problem and styrene models 50 years later still maintain their form. 1961 was a key year for the switchover. For example some early 1961 Mercury Monterey two door promos were done in acetate while most for that year were done in the new non-warping Cycolac (Doty 2000b, p89).|$|E
500|$|In Germany, [...] "Schönen Tag noch!", the German {{phrase for}} [...] "have a nice day", {{is being used}} more {{frequently}} by its vendors and waiters. German author Hyde Flippo wrote that many Germans deem [...] "have a nice day" [...] to be affected and shallow. Flippo further opined that the phrase is an appropriate example of culturally improper language. He compared it to smiling arbitrarily at a German person which would {{give the impression that}} the smiler is a [...] "little simple-minded or not quite 'all there'". Writing that Germans prefer [...] "Auf Wiedersehen!" [...] or [...] "Tschüss!" [...] (both meaning [...] "goodbye")—which German shopkeepers frequently use—to [...] "dubious wishes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> day" [...] he opined that that is why Germans generally favor visiting a small shop instead of a large department store.|$|E

500|$|David Bleiler is more {{positive}} about the film, writing in his TLA Video & DVD Guide that it [...] "isn't some third-rate, quick-paycheck hack job mystery which the advertising suggests." [...] He calls it [...] "an unusual, rewarding drama [...] Well-written by Jeanette Winterson and directed {{with just the right}} amount of sensitivity and humor by Kidron". Bleiler states that the cast are [...] "stellar", Ayola is [...] "radiant", and the revelatory scene between Angela and Gwendolyne is [...] "wonderful", asserting: [...] "Although slight, this is a perfect film <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> quiet evening at home". Alison Darren in her Lesbian Film Guide is also positive, asserting that: [...] "Great Moments in Aviation is a little gem of a British film". She describes the resolution of the lesbian storyline as [...] "a golden scene, beautifully photographed and exceptionally well paced", and asserts that [...] "For women of a certain age, this may be the most heart-rending (not to say, inspirational) depiction of a coming-out moment ever seen on screen. Whimsical, comic, dramatic and gentle." ...|$|E
500|$|The record also {{received}} some mixed reviews. The Arts Desk disliked the heavier {{material on the}} album, although they praised its glam rock-influenced songs. Stephen Dalton of The National complimented its more aggressive and humorous tracks, but said the album was [...] "not quite the knockout blow needed to regain his title as the world heavyweight champion of shock rock." [...] British magazine Rock Sound complained that the record contained too many long introductions, which they said disrupted its fluidity. Writing for NME, Hamish MacBain defined the album as being better than average, saying there was [...] "just a lack of magic, a lack of something special going on. It's not bad. It's not good." [...] Tom Bryant from Kerrang! was also unimpressed, although he praised [...] "Breaking the Same Old Ground" [...] as an emotional climax for the record, writing: [...] "For a man who's spent so long appearing not to be human, the deliverance of naked soul makes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> twist. Perhaps this should be where his future lies?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homer Defined" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as an excellent episode that added new depth to the show in the scene with Marge trying to convince Luann to let Milhouse play with Bart again. They added that Lisa's [...] "faith in her heroic father makes a nice change", {{and said that the}} episode's ending, in which Homer enters the dictionary, [...] "is most satisfying." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that after the episode [...] "Bart the Murderer", this episode marks a regression, saying it was almost inevitable that it would not match up to the previous episode. He {{went on to say that}} the subplot with Bart and Milhouse was more entertaining. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4/5 rating, writing that he enjoyed the Homer story but found the Bart and Milhouse subplot more interesting. He added that [...] "Milhouse's mom won't allow him to play with Bart because she thinks Bart is a bad influence. It's rare for the show to allow Bart to feel genuine emotion, but there is plenty of it in this episode that makes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> character oriented story." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Crusade's {{agenda was}} debated among Jewish Romanian intellectuals. Fellow writer Mihail Sebastian {{described}} Istrati as politically [...] "illiterate" [...] and [...] "addled". In his words, [...] "Mr. Istrati fights nowadays for the Crusade of Romanianism, {{searching for the}} formula of reasonable antisemitism (neither here nor there), for the way into a more gentle chauvinism, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> agreement between his anarchic vocation and a methodical process of bashing heads in." [...] Other Jewish literary figures, including Josué Jéhouda, issued statements in support of Istrati's stance.|$|E

2500|$|Guiteau went {{on trial}} in November. Represented by his brother-in-law, George Scolville, Guiteau became {{something}} of a media darling during his trial for his bizarre behavior, including constantly insulting his defense team, formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He claimed {{that he was not}} guilty because Garfield's murder was the will of God and he was only an instrument of God's will. He sang [...] "John Brown's Body" [...] to the court. He dictated an autobiography to the New York Herald, ending it with a personal ad <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> Christian lady under 30. He was blissfully oblivious to the American public's outrage and hatred of him, even after he was almost assassinated twice himself. At one point, he argued that Garfield was killed not by him but by medical malpractice ("I deny the killing, if your honor please. We admit the shooting"), which was essentially true, if one discounts the fact that Guiteau was the reason the President required medical attention in the first place. Throughout the trial and up until his execution, Guiteau was housed at St. Elizabeths Hospital in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} 6 premiere, it is {{discovered}} that the person whom Lucas called is Peyton. She goes {{to the airport and}} they hop on a plane to Vegas to get married. Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead. Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little more about him each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... I mean they, had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book. Peyton closes herself off emotionally with regard to Mick and is angry with him for not being upfront with her about who he is. She tells him to leave. Not long afterward, during a visit to Brooke's, Brooke tells Peyton the truth about how she got all the bruises on her body. Peyton is later seen on the phone with Larry, her adoptive father. She tells him how much she loves him. Though initially concerned about moving in together, Lucas and Peyton eventually decide to accept their differences and reside in the same house. Peyton reconnects with her biological brother Derek, who has returned from the war. Later, she goes to TRIC to meet up with Lucas and a guy named Julian, who is interested in making a movie out based on Lucas's first novel. Julian was asking Lucas {{a lot of questions about}} Peyton before she got there. She runs into Julian near the bathroom, and it is soon revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. Three weeks go by and Peyton still has not told Lucas the truth about her romantic history with Julian. Lucas is left to discover their past on his own, and is initially angry about it. Peyton throws a USO concert in which Angels and Airwaves, Mia, and Haley play. She continues to connect with her brother, Derek, and clash with Julian over Lucas and his film.|$|E
