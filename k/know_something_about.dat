25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access}} to the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf readers can employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E
25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> my trip and the {{condition}} of the country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have had my first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
500|$|Lu said of {{his role}} as {{legislative}} director, [...] "It's {{one of the most}} fun jobs in the Senate (but) it's also an incredibly difficult job because you have to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> any given thing going on in the Senate at the time ... It takes a couple years off your life." [...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E

500|$|Along with tarot divination, astrology {{is one of}} {{the core}} studies of Western esotericism, and as such has {{influenced}} systems of magical belief not only among Western esotericists and Hermeticists, but also belief systems such as Wicca that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. Tanya Luhrmann has said that [...] "all magicians <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> astrology," [...] and refers to a table of correspondences in Starhawk's The Spiral Dance, organised by planet, {{as an example of the}} astrological lore studied by magicians.|$|E
500|$|Film {{scholars}} and historians view Citizen Kane as Welles's {{attempt to create}} a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Record Plant, RCA Studios, and Capitol Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1975. Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl speak for itself, I really had fun making this record, and I thought it might interest you to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> each song. After all, I wouldn't {{want to be a}} chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E

500|$|T. R. Knight {{signed on}} for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, because he liked that the {{character}} was multi-faceted. In October 2006, news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an argument with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd). Shortly after, {{the details of the}} argument became public, and Knight later disclosed that the slur made him come out as gay. [...] "I was under no delusions," [...] Knight said at the time. [...] "My friends on the set knew. We talked about it. Publicly it's not my thing to call up People magazine and be like, 'Hey, you want to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> me?'...I could've just let it slide and not said anything, but it became important. It became important to make the statement." [...] The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement, apologizing for his [...] "unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on-set".|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> politics, too!" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{change in}} Popular Science Monthly was dramatic. The old version was a {{scholarly}} journal that had {{eight to ten}} articles in a 100-page issue. There would be ten to twenty photographs or illustrations. The new version had hundreds of short, easy to read articles with hundreds of illustrations. Editor Kaempffert was writing for [...] "the home craftsman and hobbyist who wanted to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the world of science."

[...] When he visited the artist's studio, McCaughey writes, he made a point to say that he was interested in the return of the painting, not a conviction for the crime: [...] "I said deliberately, at least twice, that the people who had taken the work could deposit it in a luggage locker at Spencer Street railway station or at Tullamarine Airport." ...|$|E

However, most know little about the day-to-day battles fought by Americans of all backgrounds that {{paved the way for the}} high ideals of our founders to be put into practice." [...] He also writes, [...] "Today we are facing a threat to the very foundation our founders laid. That threat does not come from an alien force but from those who are willing and determined to abandon the concept of God-given rights. Like the royalty during the Revolution, today's elites wish to return to the pre-Revolutionary paradigm in which they, through governmental force, allocate rights and responsibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} these reactions, {{in addition to the}} reactants, the products, and the energy released, one needs to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the cross section. Any given fusion device has a maximum plasma pressure it can sustain, and an economical device would always operate near this maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is chosen so that /T2 is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ required for ignition is a minimum, since that required value is inversely proportional to /T2 (see Lawson criterion). (A plasma is [...] "ignited" [...] if the fusion reactions produce enough power to maintain the temperature without external heating.) This optimum temperature and the value of /T2 at that temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.|$|E
2500|$|The proposal, {{originally}} {{known as}} “Project Cauldron”, was devised by geologist Manley L. Natland at Los Angeles-based Richfield Oil Corporation. Natland believed that an underground blast {{was the most}} efficient way to generate the heat needed to liquefy the viscous bitumen so that it could be pumped to the surface by conventional wells. The project was conceived of as part of Operation Plowshare, a United States project to harness the nuclear explosions for peaceful applications. However, some experts had doubts. In 1959, oil sands pioneer Robert Fitzsimmons of the International Bitumen Company wrote a letter to the Edmonton Journal, saying [...] "While the writer does not know anything about nuclear energy and is therefore not qualified to make any definite statement as to it’s [...] results he does <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the effect dry heat has on those sands and ventures a guess that if it does not turn the whole deposit into a burning inferno it is almost sure to fuse it into a solid mass of semi glass or coke." ...|$|E

2500|$|Paul advocates {{substantially}} {{reducing the}} government's role in individual lives {{and in the}} functions of foreign and domestic states; he says Republicans have lost their commitment to limited government and have become the party of big government. In the 2012 Republican Presidential Primary, Paul cited President Dwight Eisenhower's farewell address warnings about the growing presence and strength of the [...] "military-industrial complex". His 2012 [...] "Plan to Restore America" [...] would eliminate five Cabinet-level departments: Energy, HUD, Commerce, Interior, and Education. [...] He has called for elimination of other federal {{agencies such as the}} U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service, calling them [...] "unnecessary bureaucracies". Paul would severely reduce the role of the Central Intelligence Agency; reducing its functions to intelligence-gathering. He would eliminate operations like overthrowing foreign governments and assassinations. He says this activity is kept secret even from Congress and [...] "leads to trouble". He also commented, [...] "We have every right in the world to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> intelligence gathering, but we have to have intelligent people interpreting this information." ...|$|E
2500|$|The team, led by Ella, defies Shade's {{orders and}} infiltrates the Meat Factory, {{successfully}} rescuing Drum. They then leave cautiously, using the Deceptors to mask their trail. While resting among {{the branches of}} a large tree, Ninde telepathically detects an Overlord. The detection proves not only to be hard mentally on her since the Overlord is of human or greater intelligence, but also emotionally hard: Ninde discovers that the Overlords are essentially human. Despite the difficulty, she discovers that the Overlord may <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> [...] "a mind in a machine" [...] -a dangerous thing for them, since Shade - a machine intelligence- is their leader and benefactor. They continue, to discover on reaching the Submarine that it has been invaded by an Overlord, Red Diamond, and that all of the people inside have been killed or captured. Fortunately, Shade had realized long before that the Sub was not a permanent base, and established multiple supply caches throughout the city in case a team was stranded in the field or the Sub was taken. True to their training, the team heads immediately to the nearest cache - to discover Shade, who escaped, apparently by chance, while testing a mobile robotic body for himself based around the Thinker. Shade's escape is doubly fortuitous in that the Overlord used an electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the Submarine; had he been within range of the weapon, he would have been incapacitated.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for Manga Life, Ryan Lewis {{described}} Kaze Hikaru as [...] "a unique title", praising its [...] "engaging" [...] story, {{plot and}} characters. Comics Village's Lori Henderson described the manga as [...] "an enjoyable read", {{and said it}} is interesting because it shows the history and culture during the Shogunate. It was elected one of the [...] "Most Underrated" [...] manga along with [...] and Saturn Apartments; Eva Volin stated that despite the necessity for the reader to <b>know</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that period of Japanese history, the reader will [...] "fall in love" [...] with the characters [...] "as they deal {{with the fall of}} the samurai way and the rise of modern warfare". Pop Culture Shock's reviewer Katherine Dacey described Kaze Hikaru as [...] "an action-filled drama in the vein of The Rose of Versailles or They Were Eleven", and she praised the political nature of the series because Watanabe discusses the gender constraints in Japan. Reviewing the ninth volume, Isaac Hale, also from Pop Culture Shock, commended the series for keeping the same humor that it had at the beginning. Hale said the art was a [...] "high point" [...] of the manga; he described the character designs as [...] "attractive and unique" [...] but he criticized the main character's gender indecision. Matthew Alexander from Mania.com appreciated the story's historical setting and the theme of [...] "a woman in a man's world." ...|$|E
