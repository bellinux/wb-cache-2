40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{reliability}} and the learning effect of an isokinetic trunk flexion–extension protocol designed to simultaneously assess trunk muscle strength and endurance. In addition, the effect of the participants' sex on the reliability data was examined. MethodsFifty-seven healthy and physically active young men (n[*]=[*] 28) and women (n[*]=[*] 29) performed the isokinetic protocol 5 times, separated by a week between each of the first 4 sessions and by a month between the last 2 sessions. The protocol consisted of performing 4 trials of 15 maximum flexion–extension concentric exertions at 120 °/s (range of trunk motion[*]=[*] 50 °). The absolute and relative peak torque and total work were calculated to assess trunk flexion and extension strength. In addition, <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio,</b> modified <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio,</b> fatigue final ratio, recovery ratio, and modified recovery ratio variables were used for the assessment of trunk muscle endurance in both directions. ResultsRegarding the absolute reliability, no relevant changes were found between paired-comparison sessions for most strength and endurance variables, except for total work and relative total work variables in the flexion movement in both sexes. In addition, the typical error of the isokinetic variables was lower than 10 % in both males and females, and minimum detectable changes ranged from 7 %– 20 %, with a tendency to be higher in females and in endurance variables. The strength variables showed high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC; > 0. 74); however, for the endurance variables only the <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> and the modified <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> obtained moderate to high ICC values (0. 57 < ICC < 0. 82). In addition, the analysis of the variance reported no significant differences between consecutive pairs of sessions for most variables in both sexes. ConclusionOverall, these findings provide clinicians, trainers, and researchers with a 10 -min single-session protocol to perform a reliable muscle strength and endurance evaluation of trunk flexor and extensor muscles, all within the same protocol...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that a post-solution {{treatment}} stretch gives a finer, more uniformly distributed S-phase when ageing Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys. Fatigue S - N curves have been determined, and tensile tests {{have been carried out}} on stretched (P) and unstretched (N) samples of 8090 alloy in the peak-aged condition at temperatures of 288 K, 358 K and 425 K. A fractographic comparison has been made of the fatigued samples in the two conditions. It is found that magnitude of the <b>Endurance</b> <b>Ratio</b> (of Endurance Limit to UTS) is relatively high, due to the homogenisation of slip by the S-phase, and is higher in the P than in the N material. A decline in <b>Endurance</b> <b>Ratio</b> with increase in temperature is observed in P material, but not in the N material. The results are discussed in terms of the dislocation interactions in the two microstructures, and is supported by previously observed differences in dynamic recovery characteristics between N and P material...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The cachexia-anorexia {{syndrome}} {{impacts on}} patients' physical independence {{and quality of}} life. New treatments are required {{and need to be}} evaluated using acceptable and reliable outcome measures, e. g. the assessment of muscle function. The aims of this study were to: (i) examine the acceptability and reliability of the Cybex NORM dynamometer to assess muscle function in people with non-small cell lung cancer or mesothelioma; (ii) compare muscle function in this group with healthy volunteers and; (iii) explore changes in muscle function over one month. Methods The test consisted of 25 repetitions of isokinetic knee flexion and extension at maximal effort while seated on a Cybex NORM dynamometer. Strength and endurance for the quadriceps and hamstrings were assessed as peak torque and total work and an <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> respectively. Thirteen patients and 26 volunteers completed the test on three separate visits. Acceptability was assessed by questionnaire, reliability by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and tests of difference compared outcomes between and within groups. Results All subjects found the test acceptable. Peak torque and work done were reliable measures (ICC > 0. 80), but the <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> was not. Muscle function did not differ significantly between the patient and a matched volunteer group or in either group when repeated after one month. Conclusion For patients with non-small cell lung cancer or mesothelioma, the Cybex NORM dynamometer provides an acceptable and reliable method of assessing muscle strength and work done. Muscle function appears to be relatively well preserved in this group and it appears feasible to explore interventions which aim to maintain or even improve this. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse the effects of a {{competitive}} swim season on the strength, balance and endurance of shoulder rotator cuff muscles in young swimmers. A repeated-measures design was used with three measurements performed during the swim season. A swimmers group (n = 20) of young males with no dry-land training and a sedentary group (n= 16) of male students with the same characteristics (age, body mass, height and maturational state) were evaluated. In both groups, the peak torque of shoulder internal (IR) and external (ER) rotators was assessed during preseason, midseason (16 weeks), and postseason (32 weeks). Concentric action at 60 º∙s- 1 and 180 º∙s- 1 was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. The ER/IR strength <b>ratios</b> and <b>endurance</b> <b>ratios</b> were also obtained. At 60 º∙s- 1, there were significant training effects in the IR strength and ER/IR ratio on both shoulders. This trend was the same throughout the competitive season. The same trend was present at 180 º∙s- 1 since the training effects are seen primarily in IR and ER/IR ratios. With respect to <b>endurance</b> <b>ratios,</b> within-group data were similar in ER and IR for both shoulders, with no significant differences between moments. However, between-group differences occurred mostly in the IR. Results suggest that a competitive swim season favours the increase of muscular imbalances in the shoulder rotators of young competitive swimmers, mainly due to increased levels of IR strength and endurance that are proportionally larger than those of their antagonists. A compensatory strength training program should be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} functional strength and endocrine responses to varying ratios {{of strength and}} endurance training in a concurrent training regimen. 30 resistance-trained men completed 6 weeks of 3 d·wk- 1 of i) strength training (ST), ii) concurrent strength and <b>endurance</b> training <b>ratio</b> 3 : 1 (CT 3), iii) concurrent strength and <b>endurance</b> training <b>ratio</b> 1 : 1 (CT 1) or iv) no training (CON). Strength training was conducted using whole-body, multi-joint exercises, while endurance training consisted of treadmill running. Assessments of maximal strength, lower body power, and endocrine factors were conducted pre-training and following 3 and 6 weeks. Following the intervention ST and CT 3 elicited similar increases in lower body strength; furthermore, ST resulted in greater increases than CT 1 and CON (all p < 0. 05). All training conditions resulted in similar increases in upper body strength following training. ST group observed greater increases in lower body power than all other conditions (all p < 0. 05). Following the final training session, CT 1 elicited greater increases in cortisol than ST (p = 0. 008). When implemented {{as part of a}} concurrent training regimen, higher volumes of endurance training result in the inhibition of lower body strength, whereas low volumes do not. Lower body power was attenuated by high and low frequencies of endurance training. Higher frequencies of endurance training resulted in increased cortisol responses to training. These data suggest that if strength development is the primary focus of a training intervention, frequency of endurance training should remain low...|$|R
40|$|The {{interference}} effect attenuates strength and hypertrophic responses when {{strength and endurance}} training are conducted concurrently; however, the influence of training frequency on these responses remain unclear when varying ratios of concurrent strength and endurance training are performed. Therefore, {{the purpose of the}} study was to examine the strength, limb girth, and neuromuscular adaptations to varying ratios of concurrent strength and endurance training. Twenty-four men with > 2 years resistance training experience completed 6 weeks of 3 days per week of (a) strength training (ST), (b) concurrent strength and <b>endurance</b> training <b>ratio</b> 3 : 1 (CT 3), (c) concurrent strength and <b>endurance</b> training <b>ratio</b> 1 : 1 (CT 1), or (d) no training (CON) in an isolated limb model. Assessments of maximal voluntary contraction by means of isokinetic dynamometry leg extensions (maximum voluntary suppression [MVC]), limb girth, and neuromuscular responses through electromyography (EMG) were conducted at baseline, mid-intervention, and postintervention. After training, ST and CT 3 conditions elicited greater MVC increases than CT 1 and CON conditions (p ≤ 0. 05). Strength training resulted in significantly greater increases in limb girth than both CT 1 and CON conditions (p = 0. 05 and 0. 004, respectively). The CT 3 induced significantly greater limb girth adaptations than CON condition (p = 0. 04). No effect of time or intervention was observed for EMG (p > 0. 05). In conclusion, greater frequencies of endurance training performed increased the magnitude of the interference response on strength and limb girth responses after 6 weeks of 3 days a week of training. Therefore, the frequency of endurance training should remain low if the primary focus of the training intervention is strength and hypertrophy...|$|R

40|$|Seventy-two {{workers were}} {{recruited}} from two heavy industries, 26 of who had lost time at work due to low back troubles. These workers were tested using measures of spine three-dimensional range of motion, strength, endurance, spine kinematics during lifting, the ability to maintain spine stability during static steady state tasks, surprise loading tasks, anticipatory tasks and challenged breathing. Having a history of low back troubles {{is not related to}} reduced strength, but is related to a non-typical flexion to extension strength ratio. Having a history of low back troubles appears to be associated with a different flexion to extension <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio,</b> with the extensors being particularly less endurable.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made of}} the isokinetic characteristics of the ankle (plantar-flexion and dorsiflexion) in young men. Six cyclists, seven gymnasts, 10 soccer players and 25 non-athletic young men were tested on the Cybex II+ dynamometer. Peak torque, torque acceleration energy (TAE), total work and average power were measured. Cyclists had slightly higher (5 %) mean plantar flexion than the others, but this was not significant. The situation was reversed for dorsiflexion. Moreover, the average dorsiflexion per unit of plantar flexion was significantly higher in the gymnasts {{than it was in the}} cyclists for both torque and work. This suggests that at a specific level of plantar flexion, the gymnasts had stronger dorsiflexion compared with the cyclists and that in sports involving jumping and running, increased attention should be given to strengthening the antagonist muscle groups (dorsiflexors) in order to achieve greater agonist-to-antagonist muscle balance thus preventing injury. The non-athletic subjects had substantially lower endurance capability in both flexors as measured by the <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio.</b> This implies that identifiable specialization in particular muscles results from training or participating in specialized sports...|$|E

In this letter, we report for the first time another type of IR-RS that is related to the built-in homojunction. The IR-RS study was usually limited to macroscopic samples with micron-order pad-type electrodes, while this work is on NiO nanodots fabricated with ultrathin anodic-aluminum-oxide templates and acting as nanoscaled analogs of real devices. The NiO nanodots show high storage density and high uniformity, and the IR-RS behaviors are of good device performances in terms of retention, <b>endurance,</b> switching <b>ratio</b> and rectification ratio.

40|$|Electronic {{memory cells}} are of {{critical}} importance in modern-day computing devices, including emerging technology sectors such as large-area printed electronics. One technology that has being receiving significant interest {{in recent years is}} resistive switching primarily due to its low dimensionality and nonvolatility. Here, we describe the development of resistive switching memory device arrays based on empty aluminum nanogap electrodes. By employing adhesion lithography, a low-temperature and large-area compatible nanogap fabrication technique, dense arrays of memory devices are demonstrated on both rigid and flexible plastic substrates. As-prepared devices exhibit nonvolatile memory operation with stable <b>endurance,</b> resistance <b>ratios</b> > 10 ⁴ and retention times of several months. An intermittent analysis of the electrode microstructure reveals that controlled resistive switching is due to migration of metal from the electrodes into the nanogap under the application of an external electric field. This alternative form of resistive random access memory is promising for use in emerging sectors such as large-area electronics as well as in electronics for harsh environments, e. g., space, high/low temperature, magnetic influences, radiation, vibration, and pressure...|$|R
40|$|Background: The most {{important}} trunk stabilizers are the trunk flexors and extensors. The isometric endurance {{of the trunk}} muscles is an essential element for mechanical support of the spine in all positions. The study objectives were {{to find out the}} trunk flexors and extensors endurance, its relationship with normal BMI and to find out the ratio of trunk flexors to extensors endurance. Methods: In this correlation study, 50 subjects were selected by convenience sampling method on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria from Asia metropolitan university, Malaysia. The trunk flexors and extensors endurance were assessed by Kraus- Weber and Sorenson test respectively. Paired 't' test and Spearman correlation test were used for data analysis. Results: There was a significant difference (p 0. 01 and TEE, rs (50) = - 0. 162, p > 0. 01 but there was a significant strong positive relationship between TFE and TEE, rs (50) = 0. 68, p < 0. 01. The ratio of trunk flexors to extensors was 0. 61.

40|$|Anisotropic {{conductive}} films (ACFs) {{received a}} great deal of attention in recent years for interconnection applications in electronic packaging. This paper reports the behaviour of ACF joints under various mechanical loading, i. e., die shear and cyclic fatigue in shear. The mechanical behaviour of ACF joints that have been exposed to environmental effects, i. e., high moisture and elevated temperature (autoclave test conditions) has been examined using die shear test. The maximum shear force prior to fracture was determined as 465. 0 N, at which the contact resistance is found extremely high and can be considered as open circuits. Epoxy based ACF exhibits insignificant plastic deformation, especially for samples that have undergone autoclave test. Reduction trend was observed in the shear moduli over autoclave test time for ACF joints. Fracture surface of ACF that failed in shear test shows spalling and less plastic deformation after exposed to autoclave test. For cyclic fatigue test, the endurance limit is determined at about 143. 5 N and the corresponding calculated <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> is around 32. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if consistent participation in bench stepping leads to a decreased hamstrings to quadriceps ratio. Thirty-two healthy volunteers without pathological conditions of the knee joint participated in three, one-hour bench stepping classes each week for eight weeks. Each subject 2 ̆ 7 s strength and endurance of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles were measured before and after the eight week stepping program using a Cybex 340 Isokinetic Dynamometer (Lumex, Ronkankoma, New York). Thigh girth was also measured before and after the exercise program. T-tests were used to evaluate the data. Significant increases were found in hamstring strength and endurance, quadriceps strength and endurance, and in the hamstrings to quadriceps strength ratio. Thigh girth and the hamstrings to quadriceps <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> did not significantly change. The results of this study suggest that bench stepping does not lead to a muscle imbalance in the knee. In fact, more equivalent coactivation in the hamstrings and quadriceps occurs during bench stepping. It is therefore not anticipated that bench stepping with cause muscle imbalances which will produce knee injury or dysfunction...|$|E

The intron 7 G/C polymorphism (rs 4253778) {{has been associated}} with athletic performance. The rare C-allele was predominant in power athletes, whereas the G-allele was more frequent in endurance athletes. In the present study, we investigated the association between this polymorphism and strength characteristics in nonathletic, healthy young adults (n[*]=[*] 500; age 24. 2 [*]±[*] 4. 4 years). Knee torque was measured during concentric knee flexion and extension movements at 60 °/s, 120 °/s, and 240 °/s during 3, 25, and 5 repetitions, respectively. Also, resistance to muscle fatigue (i. e. work last 20 % repetitions/work first 20 % repetitions * 100) was calculated. Differences in knee strength phenotypes between GG homozygous individuals and C-allele carriers were analyzed. The polymorphism did not influence the ability to produce isometric or dynamic knee flexor or extensor peak torque during static or dynamic conditions in this population (0. 23 [*]<[*]P[*]<[*] 0. 95).

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} Newton–Krylov aerodynamic shape {{optimization algorithm}} {{is applied to}} several optimization problems in which the location of laminar-turbulent transition is free. The coupled Euler and boundary-layer solver MSES is used to obtain transition locations through the eN method, which are then used in Optima 2 D, a Newton–Krylov discrete-adjoint optimization algorithm based on the compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier– Stokes equations. The algorithm {{is applied to the}} design of airfoils with maximum lift-to-drag <b>ratio,</b> <b>endurance</b> factor, and lift coefficient. The design examples demonstrate that the optimizer is able to control the transitionpoint locations to provide optimum performance, often producing pressure distributions with laminar rooftops followed by concave pressure recovery.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that increasing the hamstrings and quadriceps (H:Q) isokinetic strength ratio will, in the short term, improve the functional ability of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficient knee. METHODS: The isokinetic muscular characteristics at a speed of 60 degrees s- 1 and 180 degrees s- 1 of 46 recreational athletes with an arthroscopically confirmed ACL tear were determined using the Cybex II+ isokinetic dynamometer. The variables tested included peak torque, <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio,</b> total work output, and explosive power. Functional ability was scored with the Cincinnati rating system, measuring the severity of pain and swelling, the degree of giving way, and the overall ability to walk, run, ascent and descent stairs, jump and twist. RESULTS: Among all muscular characteristics, the H:Q ratio at 180 degrees s- 1 at 30 degrees of knee flexion was shown to have the highest correlation to the functional score (r = 0. 6249, P < 0. 001). All variables involving hamstring strength were shown to be significantly correlated to the functional ability score (P < 0. 01), while none of the variables involving quadriceps strength showed significant correlation with the functional ability of the injured knee.

An isokinetic dynamometer {{was used to test}} the shoulder horizontal abductors and adductors at 60 and 180 degrees/ s. Absolute and relative peak torque (PT and PT/BW), total work (TW), <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> (ER), and the ratio of the peak torque between horizontal abductors and adductors (HAB/HAD ratio) were recorded. Data were compared for the dominant and non-dominant shoulders, horizontal abductor and adductor muscles, and between players grouped according to age. Results: the dominant shoulder was significantly (p< 0. 05) stronger than the non-dominant shoulder in all variables except ER and HAB/HAD ratio. the abductors were significantly (p< 0. 05) weaker than the adductors in all subjects. the type of backhand (one handed or two handed) did not influence the strength of the shoulder horizontal abductors on the dominant side. the number of years of tennis practice had an effect on muscle strength as evaluated by absolute data (PT and TW) but not relative measurements (PT/ BW and TW/BW). Conclusion: the findings confirm that horizontal abduction and adduction are stronger in the dominant shoulder of junior tennis players. the clinical relevance of these findings is not established, and more studies are needed to compare tennis players with athletes from other sports and non-athletes.

In a third part, the specific thermodynamics and kinetics of nanosized electrochemical cells are described. The overlapping of the space charge layers {{is found to be}} most relevant for the cell properties at rest. The major factors determining the functionality of the ECM cells are the electrode reaction and the transport kinetics. Depending on electrode and/or electrolyte material electron transfer, electro-crystallization or slow diffusion under strong electric fields can be rate determining.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to show the {{distribution}} of individual myosin light chain (MyLC) isoforms in fast-twitch (FT) and slow-twitch (ST) muscles and between FT muscles in order to find differences between MyLC isoforms in these muscles, to identify similarities with the distribution of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms and to investigate changes in these relations during adaptation to endurance and resistance training. Male Wistar strain rats were used in this study. One-dimensional electrophoresis was used for separation of MyHC and MyLC isoforms and two-dimensional electrophoresis was used for identification of MyLC different isoforms. A difference in the relative content of MyLC isoforms between FT muscles exists only in the case of MyLC 1 slow and 2 slow isoforms. Differences in the relative content of MyHC between FT muscles are considerably larger than differences in the MyLC isoforms. MyHC and MyLC isoforms both participate in the remodelling of contractile proteins during exercise training. In conclusion: The present study shows some discrepancy between the modulation of MyHC and MyLC isoforms in muscles with different oxidative potential during adaptation to endurance and resistance training. In ST muscles, there is full agreement between the increase in the relative content of MyHC IIa isoform and MyLC 2 fast and 3 fast isoforms during resistance training without significant changes during <b>endurance</b> training.

Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} examine the ratio between "pulling" and "pushing" strength in sedentary individuals. 212 healthy participants, of both genders (139 male and 73 female; age 32 ± 13. 3 years, weight 70. 2 ± 14. 1 kg, height 173 ± 9 cm) were retained for investigation. Strength was assessed through a new methodology: Pulling through a lat-pulldown test while pushing strength through a chest-press test. Both tests were performed to exhaustion with an overload of 30 % of each participants bodyweight. Such method aims to prevent excessive overloads in sedentary individuals. Pearson's correlations and a t test to assess differences were analyzed. Subsequently, the ratio for both genders of pulling and pushing local endurance strength was assessed by means. A mean number of 57 repetitions was shown with the lat-pulldown while 34 repetition with the chest press. A correlation of 0. 42 has been found between the number of repetitions of the two tests. A significant difference (p < 0. 001) was found between such performances. No correlation was found between the strength measures and the anthropometric parameters of the participants. The lat machine to chest press ratio was 1. 36 : 1 for male while 2. 69 : 1 for female. The results indicate that sedentary participants have higher pulling rather than pushing local <b>endurance</b> strength.

Muscle function was assessed by measurements of maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC in ft-Ibs). work during 25 knee extensions (WORK in ft-Ibs), and <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio</b> (ER, the ratio of average peak torque during final 3 to initial 3 repetitions) using an isokinetic dynamometer at baseline and after 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 3 hr and 24 hr. Distance walked in 9 min (DIS in m) was measured at baseline and after 30 min, 1 hr, 3 hr and 24 hr. At baseline, CHF patients walked less far (367 ± 32 vs 667 ± 27 m, p< 0. 001) and performed less knee extensor work (1075 ± 116 vs 1390 ± 110 ft-Ibs, P< 0. 05) than controls. MVC and ER also trended lower in CHF patients (80 ± 4 vs 90 ± 6 ft-Ibs, p= 0. 15, and 0. 51 ± 0, 03 vs 0. 58 ± 0. 02, P= 0. 11, respectively. Although DIS and WORK remained significantly lower in CHF patients at each subsequent time point, there was complete recovery to baseline values in both groups by the first repeat measurement. As compared to baseline, the DIS walked on subsequent tests ranged from 99 – 108 % and 100 – 102 % of baseline in CHF patients and controls, respectively. Similarly, WORK ranged from 93 – 103 %, and 99 – 105 % of baseline, MVCfrom 97 – 106 % and 95 – 104 %, and ER from 98 – 119 % and 108 – 117 %, in patients and controls, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the fatigue experienced during daily activities by CHF patients is not due to impaired recovery of muscle function and is not manifested as a delay in the recovery of submaximal exercise capacity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of the Work This 12 -month {{prospective}} study describes {{the characteristics of}} a group of elite cross-country skiers using subject demographics; intake physical measurements (Movement Competency Screen—MCS, hamstring length, and trunk muscle endurance); and monthly injury, training, and racing reports. The primary hypothesis is that new injury is associated with poor movement competency. Secondary hypotheses are that new injury is associated with (a) a history of injury, (b) a long career in cross-country skiing, (c) high training hours, (d) high running training hours, (e) high roller ski training hours, (f) poor trunk muscle endurance, and (g) reduced active straight leg raise (ASLR). Mean injury incidence will be used to examine differences between the injury incidence rates of (a) the ski season and off-season, (b) traumatic and nontraumatic injuries, and (c) injuries by anatomic location. Introduction Cross-country ski injury incidence studies have employed variable methodologies, using retrospective injury and training surveillance. Standardised injury incidence measures will improve the understanding of cross-country ski injury incidence. Studying the relationship between movement patterns and new injury may identify risk factors for future injury, and eventually reduce injury rates with appropriate intervention strategies. Methods At enrolment, 71 professional or collegiate cross-country skiers (35 men, 36 women) provided demographics and injury history, then performed the Movement Competency Screen (MCS), hamstring length, and trunk muscle endurance tests. Self-report electronic injury and training surveillance occurred monthly for 12 months. Spearman’s correlation determined the relationship between new injury and MCS score, past injury, total training time, and run training time. A t-test compared injury incidence (the mean number of injuries per subject per 1, 000 training/exposure hours) between anatomic regions, type of injuries, and seasons. Results/Main Points The study was completed by 58 % of subjects (18 men, 23 women). There were 3. 18 injuries per subject per 1, 000 training/exposure hours. New injury was not correlated with MCS score, but was correlated with previous injury (p <. 05). New injury did increase as the time spent running increased, although not significantly (p =. 08). New injury was not correlated with any other variable. Risk factor analysis found previous injury {{was a significant predictor of}} new injury when accounting for overall training time, run time, and MCS score. Lower-extremity injury incidence (2. 13) was significantly higher than upper extremity (0. 46) or trunk injury incidence (0. 22). Nontraumatic/overuse injury incidence (2. 76) was significantly higher than acute injury incidence (1. 05) (p <. 05). Off-season injury incidence (5. 25) was higher than ski season (2. 27), although not significantly (p =. 07). Conclusion This is the first examination of the relationship between MCS score and new injury in cross-country skiers. New injury positively correlated with previous injury, but not with MCS score, hamstring length, trunk <b>endurance</b> <b>ratio,</b> or training/exposure hours. Lower-extremity and nontraumatic/overuse injuries had the highest incidence rates. Previously injured skiers are at greater risk for further injury. The results lay the foundation for further movement and injury studies and future injury prevention strategies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endurance {{exercise}} {{is associated with}} adverse outcomes in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C). Exercise recommendations for family members remain undetermined. OBJECTIVE: The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine if (1) endurance exercise (Bethesda class C) and exercise intensity (metabolic equivalent hours per year [MET-Hr/year]) increase the likelihood of fulfilling 2010 Task Force Criteria and ventricular arrhythmias/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock (ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation [VT/VF]), and (2) exercise restriction to the American Heart Association (AHA) -recommended minimum for healthy adults is associated with favorable outcomes of at-risk family members. METHODS: Twenty-eight family members of 10 probands inheriting a PKP 2 mutation were interviewed about exercise from age 10. Exercise threshold to maintain overall health was based on the 2007 AHA guidelines of a minimum 390 to 650 MET-Hr/year. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, and family membership, both participation in <b>endurance</b> athletics (odds <b>ratio</b> [OR] 7. 4, P =. 03) and higher-intensity exercise (OR = 4. 2, P =. 004) were associated with diagnosis (n = 13). Endurance athletes were also significantly more likely to develop VT/VF (n = 6, P =. 02). Family members who restricted exercise at or below the upper bound of the AHA goal (≤ 650 MET-Hr/year) were significantly less likely to be diagnosed (OR = 0. 07, P =. 002) and had no VT/VF. At diagnosis and first VT/VF, family members had accumulated 2. 8 -fold (P =. 002) and 3. 5 -fold (P =. 03), respectively, greater MET-Hr exercise than the AHA-recommended minimum. Those who developed VT/VF had performed particularly high-intensity exercise in adolescence compared to unaffected family members (age 10 - 14 : P =. 04; age 14 - 19 : P =. 02). CONCLUSION: The {{results of this study suggest}} restricting unaffected desmosomal mutation carriers from endurance and high-intensity athletics but potentially not from AHA-recommended minimum levels of exercise for healthy adults...|$|R
30|$|A {{range of}} balance between flexor and {{extensor}} muscles is fundamental {{in order to}} prevent pathologies caused by bad postures or to ensure health of the joint as a measure of prevention of overtraining in specific muscle groups. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} examine the ratio between “pulling” and “pushing” strength in sedentary individuals. 212 healthy participants, of both genders (139 male and 73 female; age 32  ±  13.3  years, weight 70.2  ±  14.1  kg, height 173  ±  9  cm) were retained for investigation. Strength was assessed through a new methodology: Pulling through a lat-pulldown test while pushing strength through a chest-press test. Both tests were performed to exhaustion with an overload of 30  % of each participants bodyweight. Such method aims to prevent excessive overloads in sedentary individuals. Pearson’s correlations and a t test to assess differences were analyzed. Subsequently, the ratio for both genders of pulling and pushing local endurance strength was assessed by means. A mean number of 57 repetitions was shown with the lat-pulldown while 34 repetition with the chest press. A correlation of 0.42 has been found between the number of repetitions of the two tests. A significant difference (p <  0.001) was found between such performances. No correlation was found between the strength measures and the anthropometric parameters of the participants. The lat machine to chest press ratio was 1.36 : 1 for male while 2.69 : 1 for female. The results indicate that sedentary participants have higher pulling rather than pushing local <b>endurance</b> strength. Such <b>ratio</b> should be considered as a normative value when starting to perform exercise protocols. Resistance training should be performed in order to improve strength measures of the weaker muscles and reduce such ratio.|$|R
40|$|Background Forward head postures (FHP) are {{proposed}} to adversely load cervical spine structures. Neck muscles {{provide support for}} the neck, and thus an imbalance in neck muscle performance could potentially {{contribute to the development}} of FHP. Previous studies have not considered the interaction of multiple muscle groups with regard to postural orientation. Given the interdependence of muscles along the cervical spine for optimal orientation and physical support of the vertebral column, the performance of a single muscle group may not accurately reflect the coordinated ability of the muscles to maintain a neutral neck posture. Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between FHP and the balance between the cervical extensor and flexor muscle groups in healthy individuals. We hypothesised that the magnitude of FHP would be associated with the strength and <b>endurance</b> performance <b>ratios</b> between the cervical extensor and flexor muscle groups. Methods Twenty male and 24 female volunteers were photographed in the sagittal plane wearing surface markers. The FHP of each participant was measured via the tragus-sternum marker distance over two conditions: (1) in relaxed standing and (2) during a sustained sitting task. Maximal strength (Nm) and endurance (s) performance of the extensor and flexor muscle groups were recorded at the upper (craniocervical flexion/extension (CCF/CCE)) and lower (cervicothoracic flexion/extension (CTF/CTE)) cervical regions. Muscle performance measures were expressed as extension:flexion ratios and their relation to FHP evaluated. A stepwise multiple regression analysis using backward elimination was utilised to examine the relationship between the postural measures and the muscle performance ratio measures. Separate models were used for the two different postural conditions (standing, sustained sitting). Gender was included as a constant correction factor in all regression models. Where gender was a significant variable in the model, analyses were repeated separately for males and females. Results Greater FHP in standing was significantly associated with reduced proportional CTE to CCF strength in females (R 2  =  0. 21, P =  0. 03) and greater proportional CTE to CTF strength in males (R 2  =  0. 23, P =  0. 03). A greater drift into FHP during sustained sitting was associated with a relative reduction in CCE endurance proportional to CTF endurance in females only (R 2  =  0. 27, P =  0. 017). Conclusion(s) This initial study indicates that the balance in performance between the cervical flexor and extensor muscle groups may impact FHP in healthy individuals. However, the findings were inconsistent across different muscle performance ratios and gender. Larger scale studies are therefore now needed to further clarify the relationship between FHP and muscle performance. Implications The findings suggest that relative performance of the various cervical muscle groups needs to be accounted for when considering postural correction strategies in the clinical setting, as is often recommended...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} central activation in muscle length-dependent <b>endurance.</b> Central activation <b>ratio</b> (CAR) and rectified surface electromyogram (EMG) were studied during fatigue of isometric contractions of the knee extensors at 30 and 90 ° knee angles (full extension = 0 °). Subjects (n = 8) were tested on a custom-built ergometer. Maximal voluntary isometric knee extension with supramaximal superimposed burst stimulation (three 100 -μs pulses; 300 Hz) was performed to assess CAR and maximal torque capacity (MTC). Surface EMG signals were obtained from vastus lateralis and rectus femoris muscles. At each angle, intermittent (15 s on 6 s off) isometric exercise at 50 % MTC with superimposed stimulation was performed to exhaustion. During the fatigue task, a sphygmomanometer cuff around the upper thigh ensured full occlusion (400 mmHg) of the blood supply to the knee extensors. At least 2 days separated fatigue tests. MTC was not different between knee angles (30 °: 229. 6 ± 39. 3 N·m vs. 90 °: 215. 7 ± 13. 2 N·m). Endurance times, however, were significantly longer (P < 0. 05) at 30 vs. 90 ° (87. 8 ± 18. 7 vs. 54. 9 ± 12. 1 s, respectively) despite the CAR not differing between angles at torque failure (30 °: 0. 95 ± 0. 05 vs. 90 °: 0. 96 ± 0. 03) and full occlusion of blood supply to the knee extensors. Furthermore, rectified surface EMG values of the vastus lateralis (normalized to prefatigue maximum) were also similar at torque failure (30 °: 56. 5 ± 12. 5 % vs. 90 °: 58. 3 ± 15. 2 %), whereas rectus femoris EMG activity was lower at 30 ° (44. 3 ± 12. 4 %) vs. 90 ° (69. 5 ± 25. 3 %). We conclude that differences in endurance at different knee angles do not find their origin in differences in central activation and blood flow but may be a consequence of muscle length-related differences in metabolic cost...|$|R
40|$|Gas turbine {{technology}} for aerospace applications are approaching limits in efficiency gains as increases in efficiency today occurs in very small increments. One limitation in conventional gas turbine {{technology is the}} combustion process, which destroys most of the exergy in the cycle. To address this limitation in a traditional Brayton power cycle, a hybrid system which is integrated with Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and gas turbine is developed. Hybrid systems involving fuel cells have better efficiencies than conventional power generation systems. Power generation systems with improved performance from low fuel utilizations and low maintenance costs are possible. The combination of a SOFC fuel cell with a gas turbine has shown higher efficiencies than conventional gas turbine systems due to the reduction of exergy destruction in the heat addition process. A one-dimensional dynamic model of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) integrated with a gas turbine model to develop an efficient electrical power generation system for aviation applications is investigated. The SOFC - Combustor concept model was developed based on first principles with detailed modeling of the internal steam reformer, electrochemical and thermodynamics analysis is included. Initially, a detailed investigation of internal steam reformer kinetics is presented. The overall purpose of this thesis is to analyze {{the performance of the}} hybrid SOFC-GT system for both on-design and off-design operation in an aerospace application. Transient analysis is performed to understand the uncertainties in the SOFC temperatures and hybrid system; control and stability with sudden transient iii changes of the system (rapid throttle changes, environment changes like climb). Finally, SOFC model integrated with a compressor and turbine model and investigation on the overall performance of the innovative hybrid thermodynamic cycle is presented. The SOFC hybrid system has a lower power density at sea level compared to a turbo-generator, but in a typical commercial flight the SOFC hybrid system outperforms the turbo-generator in both <b>endurance</b> and power-to-weight <b>ratio</b> at cruising altitude...|$|R
40|$|Memristors {{are ideal}} devices able to switch among {{different}} resistive {{states and to}} retain the most recent one even if the input voltage is removed. With such a characteristic memristors {{would be able to}} mimic the brain functions or to behave as universal memory device. The existence of the memristor was theorized by Leon Chua in 1971 but only in 2008 a first prototype device based on the use of an oxide layer was realized, later addressed as a redox-based resistance (switching) random access memory (RRAM). Since its discovery, scientists have been working to understand the mechanism behind the device switching and to eliminate the intrinsic device failures and poor reproducibility, that differentiate the real RRAM from the ideal memristor and that prevent its application in circuitry. There exist two main memristor designs, the valence change memory cell (VCM) and the electrochemical metallization memory cell (ECM). These devices rely both on the switching between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS) through the application of a high voltage. Along the same two electric terminals that led to the switching, the resistance state is measured by means of a low voltage. Aim of thesis is to study the yet unclear RRAM physical processes and switching mechanisms in order {{to pave the way for}} overcoming existing device weak points. In particular, in the first part we focused on understanding the mechanism of the most basic realization of a VCM memristor, i. e. the thin-film based one. Afterwards, we explained some controversial experimental results on more advanced ECM memristors, namely nanowire-based devices, revising the applicability of currently established conventional theories and proposing an alternative operational mechanism. Finally, we presented the stability and the electrical properties of a new two-dimensional material, i. e. MoS 2, which could be applied in the memristive field. In thin-film based VCM devices, it is argued that the resistance switching occurs due to the motion of crystallographic defects under the effect of an electric field. These defects locally dope the insulating oxide increasing its conductivity. Once a filament of stacked defects connects the two electrodes an abrupt change in current is measured externally. Nevertheless, not much it is known about the atomistic nature of the switching, even less about its link with measurable external quantities such as total current. In this thesis work, we proposed a mixed continuum and Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation to take into account both atomic-level properties, like defect diffusivity, and macroscopic quantities like internal temperature and overall device current. Thanks to this combination of computational methods, temperature can dynamically change during the course of the simulation. Results show how the height of defect diffusion barrier influences the switching mechanism. When the barriers are low (≈ 0. 4 eV) the defects move as soon as the voltage is applied and correspondingly the device switching is fast, however at room temperature the resistance state is volatile. By contrast, if the barriers are relatively high (≈ 1. 1 eV) the oxide has first to heat up in order for the defects to have enough energy to overcome the barriers. Therefore the temperature, although not generally controlled or explicitly considered in the experiments, plays a fundamental role in the switching. Such a heating stage provides the required state retention for practical applications. ECM devices are asymmetric structures composed by an electrochemically active electrode like Cu, a thin film that functions as an electrolyte, either a transition metal oxide or a germanium chalcogenide, and an inactive electrode, such as Pt. The switching from HRS to LRS is thought to take place when, due to the high electric field established by the external bias, atoms of the electrochemically active contact dissolve into the insulating oxide or chalcogenide thin film to form a conductive filament with the opposite contact. Recently, nanomaterials, particularly micrometer-long nanowires, have been applied as an insulating layer between the metallic electrodes thanks to the improved <b>endurance</b> and LRS/HRS <b>ratio</b> that they ensure. Surprisingly, in these devices the LRS is achieved even if no continuous filament was detected. By means of Density Functional Theory simulations, we proposed a mechanism valid for Cu/ZnO-NW/Pt devices in which atoms belonging to the electrochemically active electrode (Cu), rather than aggregating into a filament, spread on the surface. Particularly when in form of adatom, the adsorbed Cu dope the NW surface creating a conductive channel. Copper adatoms are easily dragged by electric field once the diffusion barrier is overcome thanks to the polarizing effect of the surface. In absence of an external voltage clustering is hindered by the same barrier. As opposed to this, the atoms from the inactive electrode (Pt), although they are as mobile as the Cu atoms on the NW surface, are extremely hard to extract from the contact therefore they do not participate in the switching process. Finally, in collaboration with Prof. Jeffrey Grossman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we focused our attention on one of the materials that lately has been applied in numerous fields including resistive switching memories: MoS 2. Due to its phase-dependent conductivity MoS 2 could be applied to RRAM once the control on its phases is achieved. To this aim we proposed a new technique for the stabilization of the metastable metallic MoS 2 T-phase over the stable semiconducting MoS 2 H-phase by alloying with another metal dichalcogenide, SnS 2, existing in the T-phase only. A combined Cluster Expansion and DFT approach was exploited to theoretically predict the phase diagram of MoxSn 1 -xS 2 compounds. Our results show that the addition of impurities efficiently lowers the energetic cost of the MoS 2 T-phase, and that alloying is an effective way to tune the TMD electronic properties. In a RRAM made with a MoxSn 1 -xS 2 sheet the electric field may alter the local distribution of substitutional atoms so to induce a phase change only in a small portion of the material and alter the overall resistance state. Additionally, the reported intra-phase metal-semiconductor transition occurring for a slightly doped material could be useful for memristive applications...|$|R
