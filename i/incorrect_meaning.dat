If learners further assume that no two words share a common meaning, we find a phase transition between a maximally-efficient learning regime, where the learning time is reduced to the shortest it can possibly be, and a partially-efficient regime where <b>incorrect</b> candidate <b>meanings</b> for words persist at late times.

50|$|Theories are {{distinct}} from theorems. Theorems are derived deductively from objections {{according to a}} formal system of rules, sometimes {{as an end in}} itself and sometimes as a first step in testing or applying a theory in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the objections. Theories are abstract and conceptual, and to this end they are always considered true. They are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are 'rigorously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are <b>incorrect,</b> <b>meaning</b> that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made.

40|$|Bachman and Bachman and Palmer's {{model of}} {{communicative}} language ability from {{the domain of}} second language acquisition framed this exploratory mixed-methods developmental case study. The study examined the acquisition of both pragmatic language and language processes as they {{are related to the}} reading of authentic literary texts by non-native English speaking teachers (non-NESTs), a cohort recent research has shown desires more access, in both understanding and use, to the kind of pragmatic language use that marks native-speaker usage, and which can be found in literary language. The participants were three non-native English speaking teachers in Sri Lanka who participated in a seven-week intervention involving the study and use of literary language. These are the summarized findings about the participants' pragmatic language use in the post-test conducted after the intervention: literal-level questions elicited less pragmatic language use than inferential-level questions; post-intervention responses elicited greater pragmatic function use, especially for a story with greater cultural resonance for participants; decreases in certain pragmatic functions often indicated the engagement of a wider variety of pragmatic functions in the post-tests; and variety of pragmatic function use appears to be an indicator of language ability. These are the general conclusions about the processes that need to be engaged in the successful reading of literary language by L 2 users: a capacity to recognise inferential details in literary texts is key to interpretive understanding; ultimate comprehension and interpretation of inferential meaning is compromised when respondents assign <b>incorrect</b> <b>meanings</b> to lexical and semantic elements; texts from the participants' native culture elicited more interpretive understanding; and composition of"correct" and"incorrect" answers to inferential-level questions contain nuances that are of interest to researchers in SLA and applied linguistics, as they appear to suggest {{at least some of the}} processes that need to be involved, and so engaged, in reading and understanding texts with high inferential content...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, the meaning-inferred {{method and}} the meaning-given method in {{teaching}} vocabulary {{has been widely}} explored among Second Language Acquisition (SLA). Researchers are still debating which instructional approach is most effective, with varied results from different experiments. A third method, the sentence translation method, tries to reconcile these two contrasting approaches on second language vocabulary learning: (a) inferring word meanings produces greater retention because it cultivates deeper processing, and (b) <b>incorrect</b> <b>meanings</b> may be retained (if the meaning is not given) when wrong inferences are made. Some {{research in the field}} of Second Language Acquisition has been conducted to explore how the teaching approach influences the instant uptake of language features and structures in English. However, few empirical studies have been carried out to examine the short-term and long-term effects on the perception and production of target form in the area of Chinese acquisition as a foreign language. In this paper, the short-term and long-term effects of these three methods: meaning-inferred method, meaning-given method, and sentence translation method in the context are examined. The main objective {{of this study was to}} figure out which of the three methods is the most efficient regarding teaching Chinese vocabulary in context between elementary and intermediate levels. This study employed an immediate-test and posttest design. The participants were 78 college students in the elementary and intermediate level Chinese class. They were enrolled in three different class sections randomly to generate three experimental groups. Three treatment sessions were conducted between the immediate-test and posttest (see Table 3. 1 : when learning new vocabularies, Group 1 received meaning- given method; Group 2 received meaning-inferred method; Group 3 received sentence translation method). Analysis of collected data yielded three main findings. Firstly, meaning-inferred method was shown to be more efficient on Chinese students of higher level in both the short run and long run. Secondly, as for the elementary level, meaning-given method is still the most efficient method in both the short term and long term, a conclusion consistent with Mondria (2003). Last, the sentence translation method was not proven to be the most efficient method among either elementary or intermediate levels...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} dual representation came about through research DeLoache was conducting on infants. Babies were shown pictures and were observed to manually explore {{them as if}} they were real objects, indicating that their perception is accurate but their representation is <b>incorrect</b> - <b>meaning</b> they did not understand the pictures were not real objects. As children get older, they acquire what DeLoache calls Dual Representation, in which they understand the symbolic meaning in an object. The first experiment conducted under Dual Representation began as a memory study in young children. DeLoache was studying toddler memory and was beginning a new experiment with two-and-a-half and three-year-old children using a model of a room in her lab. This real room was furnished like a standard living room and the model contained miniature versions of the items in the room. These items were the same shape and material and arranged in the same manner as they were in the real room. The children would watch an experimenter hide a toy in a model room and were asked to find a larger version of the toy in a larger room set up in the same way as the model- the scale model study. The results were very surprising - the children did very poorly which changed DeLoache's thinking, shifting her research from memory to what she calls dual representation.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the didactic value of the Attic Nights from the {{linguistic}} point of view, and precisely, from the point of view of Gellius’ teachings on the meanings of words. In this context it has been stated that the author makes his readers aware of new meanings gained by certain words when used in contemporary colloquial idiom, describes and interprets the mechanism which had generated those meanings, evaluates the results of the process of semantic change, and, finally, comments on the way some grammarians assess the usage of certain words in ancient literary texts. In effect, the paper concentrates on the passages where A. Gellius, referring to ancient (archaic and classical) literature, describes the semantic differences occurring in various words, depending on their usage, whether in literary or colloquial language, defines the linguistic mechanism giving rise to colloquial variants of different linguistic items, and presents in a critical light the influence of colloquial language on the way in which interpretation is made of particular words as they occur in literary texts. The {{aim of this}} paper is to examine the didactic value of the Attic Nights from the linguistic point of view, and precisely, from the point of view of Gellius’ teachings on the meanings of words. In this context it has been stated that the author makes his readers aware of new meanings gained by certain words when used in contemporary vulgar language and gives testimony to the process of dissemination and perpetuation of particular semantic variants appearing in colloquial idiom for given words. What is more, he also describes the mechanism which had generated those meanings, and evaluates the results of the process of the semantic changes; in his opinion, the mechanism responsible for the generation of changes in meaning within lexical items, leading up to the establishment of new, colloquial meanings for particular words, is the protracted misuse of language in the mouths of simple and uneducated people. So, he sees consuetudo et inscitia temere dicentium or ignoratio et inscitia improbe dicentium quae non intellegant as a factor giving rise to new, colloquial, and in the same time <b>incorrect</b> <b>meanings</b> of words. And finally, commenting on the way some grammarians assess the usage of certain words, especially in ancient literary texts, he gives some methodological, metalinguistic remarks. In particular, when defending Virgil against the accusation levied be the grammarian L. A. Cornutus that the verb vexare is too weak to be used with reference to Scylla tossing Ulysses’ ship since it is commonly used of the annoyance of smoke or wind or dust, Gellius, referring to the argument of etymology and analogy, stresses that the meaning of a given word as perpetuated in colloquial idiom cannot be treated as a sufficient criterion for the assessment of the correctness of a given usage, especially if that usage appears in literature. Thereby he presents in a critical light the influence of colloquial language on the way in which interpretations are made of particular words as they occur in literary texts. Contemporary speech is shown as a dangerous factor which gives rise to inappropriate approaches to question of value...|$|R

It is further observed that, given an NQ, sentences where only appears to be vacuous become ungrammatical when the NQ is replaced with its positive counterpart. I argue for a view that relates the two phenomena: the ungrammaticality of the only-positive cases explains the unavailability of the predicted meanings in only-negative cases.

50|$|In {{the eighth}} {{year of the}} quest, the Evil Forces began to shift into power. Teams again {{gathered}} at Bahamas Lounge despite a forecast of thunderstorms throughout the weekend. At the start, Bear gathered the Questers to warn about the Sorceress opening a portal on the Alpha-Bistro. Suddenly, the Alpha-Bistro loomed near with the Sorceress screaming out for Bear to give up. The Wizard, corrupted by the Sorceress, was very vocal, condemning the backwaters and the Kingdom of Bear. White Lightning, also on board, leapt off the ship after the crowd chanted for {{him to return to}} the side of good. The King of the backwaters had set up camp at Lakeside Bar where he now worked as a bartender. The Bog Demon and the Dark Damsel lived there as well, challenging teams to a variety of challenges. The Evil Sorceress had taken control of the Alpha-Bistro and was attempting to open a portal to another dimension. This portal would bring an ancient evil into the backwaters. In order to do so, she had to create a circle of evil that would open this gateway. To stop her efforts, questing teams had to gather different animal spirits from around the backwaters that would ultimately summon the Great Spirit, who would help stop the Sorceress in her tracks. The teams had to gather: Eyes of the Hawk, Tail of the Squirrel, Bracelet of the Frog, Band of the Deer, Foil of the Musky, Medallion of the Bear, and Feather of the Turkey. On day 2, Kekoa, Bear and the King were reconciled and joined the Bog Demon on the Bravo Station barge- uniting in revelry. The Sorceress and the Pirates had also formed large armies and in the final battle, the portal was incomplete. To determine the winner in the stalemate, a race back to The Bahamas was initiated, and the teams paddled fiercely back to the bar. Team Bath Time Fun was nearly at the dock to win, but capsized with about 20 feet to go. Second place was a team that was disqualified for false registration and <b>incorrect</b> pairing, <b>meaning</b> they were not co-ed. In third place was JLA, who were sided with the Evil Forces.

This allowed the Evil Sorcress to then open her portal unchallenged. The Chicago group Snuckafoo played at Paddle Quest 2009 with songwriter and performer, Jonathan Kirsch.|$|R

One group received the texts in their L 1 (Slovak) and the other group in their L 2 (English). Afterwards the participants were tested on their knowledge of twelve technical words that appeared in the texts. The responses were examined in terms of the completeness of word meaning and the presence of errors. The results showed that compared to the L 1 -instructed students, the L 2 -instructed participants provided word meanings that were less complete and less precise. Word meanings from both groups contained errors involving omission of correct meaning components and inclusion of <b>incorrect</b> <b>meaning</b> components.

40|$|Sentences {{can contain}} {{sequences}} {{of words that}} – in isolation – have an interpretation deviating from {{the interpretation of the}} global sentence context they are embedded in (see (1)). These local syntactic coherent (LSC) sequences influence both reading times (Tabor, Galantucci, & Richardson, 2004) and fixation patterns in visual-world experiments (Konieczny, Müller, Hachmann, Schwarzkopf, & Wolfer, 2009). The latter showed that in sentences like (1) participants ’ fixations are drawn to scenes depicting the (globally <b>incorrect)</b> <b>meaning</b> of the embedded sequence ‘die Astronautin überrascht den Außerirdischen ’ (the astronaut surprises the alien). These effects provide strong evidence against self-consistent parsing models and are in favor of self-organized dynamical system approaches of language processing (Tabor et al., 2004), where local transitions influence processing regardless of global consistency. We provide a connectionist (SRN) model that can account for the patterns found in the visual-world experiment. In addition, the model predicts a graded influence of part-of-speech bias of the ambiguous elements (überrascht) on the effects. A reanalysis of the visual-world data revealed similar bias effects in the fixation patterns.

40|$|One of the {{significant}} contributions of structural semanlics is a discovery of dependence between {{the meaning of the}} verb and its government properties. This dependence finds expression, among other things, in the tendency lowards uniformization of the governmenl of verbs belonging to the same semantic class. Errors within the verbal government are extremely freąuent, which testifies to the strength and vitality of the process of uniformization. A given semantic class usually has one type of government. If a verb belonging to this class governs a different case form, there usually follows a uniformization of its government properties, which, {{from the point of view}} of the binding language norm, is considered to be an error. In time the use of such uniformized form can become a language norm, e. g. rządzić kim, czym (to govern smb) in the Old Polish had the form of rządzić kogo, co. In certain cases the verb may be used in an <b>incorrect</b> <b>meaning</b> - it then enters a new semantic class and takes over its type of govermnent, e. g. koordynować kim, czym (to coordinate smb) in the sense of kierować kim, czym (to direct smb); ingerować na co (to interfere in smth) in the sense of wywierać wpływ na co (to exert influence on smth). The vitality of the uniformizations within semantic classes of the verb is additionally underscored by the fact such structures appear in the language of TV commentators, in the press, as well as in the language of schoolchildren. The process of government uniformization is by no means limited to a particular stage of language development. It exists sińce the beginning of the formation of the Polish language, making uniform syntactic properties of verbs within particular semantic classes.

40|$|Background: The limited transaxial field-of-view (FOV) of a {{very small}} cardiac SPECT camera system causes view-dependent {{truncation}} of the projection of structures exterior to, but near the heart. Basic tomographic principles suggest that the reconstruction of non-attenuated truncated data gives a distortion-free image {{in the interior of}} the truncated region, but the DC term of the Fourier spectrum of the reconstructed image is <b>incorrect,</b> <b>meaning</b> that the intensity scale of the reconstruction is inaccurate. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the reconstructed image artifacts from truncated data, and to quantify their effects on the measurement of tracer uptake in the myocardial. Particular attention was given to instances where the heart wall is close to hot structures (structures of high activity uptake). Methods: The MCAT phantom was used to simulate a 2 D slice of the heart region. Truncated and non-truncated projections were formed both with and without attenuation. The reconstructions were analyzed for artifacts in the myocardium caused by truncation, and for the effect that attenuation has relative to increasing those artifacts. Results: The inaccuracy due to truncation is primarily caused by an incorrect DC component. For visualizing the left ventricular wall, this error is not worse than the effect of attenuation. The addition of a small hot bowel-like structure near the left ventricle causes few changes in counts on the wall. Larger artifacts due to the truncation are located at the boundary of the truncation and can be eliminated by sinogram interpolation. Finally, algebraic reconstruction methods are shown to give better reconstruction results than an analytical filtered back-projection reconstruction algorithm. Conclusion: Small inaccuracies in reconstructed images from small FOV camera systems should have little effect on clinical interpretation. However, changes in the degree of inaccuracy in counts from slice toslice are due to changes in the truncated structures. These can result in a visual 3 -dimensional distortion. As with conventional large FOV systems attenuation effects have a much more significant effect on image accuracy...|$|E
