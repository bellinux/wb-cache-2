5|$|Boruto's {{character}} has received mixed critical responses. His {{relationship with his}} father has been criticized due to reviewers finding the concept overused in the Naruto manga. In Boruto: Naruto the Movie, his development was praised due to <b>his</b> <b>action</b> scenes and how he understood his father's actions.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{notified}} Congress of Stanton's {{suspension and}} Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of <b>his</b> <b>action,</b> and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him.|$|E
5|$|After Boys, Shankar {{began work}} on his next feature {{starring}} Vikram, which was initially reported by Rediff.com to be Robot revived, but was later revealed as Anniyan (2005). One month post the release of <b>his</b> <b>action</b> film Sivaji in June2007, he approached Shah Rukh Khan for the lead in Robot. Khan was about to produce it under his own banner, Red Chillies Entertainment, but in October the same year the project was officially aborted due to creative differences between the two.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Bahadur Shah came to {{know about}} his brother's death, he sent men to {{retrieve}} the corpse. They were attacked by Wala-Jah, but Wala-Jah fainted and died. Around 8 o'clock in the evening, Bahadur Shah's aide, Rustam Dil Khan, mounted the dead prince's elephant, beheaded the prince, {{and made his way}} to Bahadur Shah. However, instead of praises, he received reproaches for <b>his</b> <b>action.</b> His elephant was followed by two other elephants; the first one contained the dead body of Ali Tabar, the other one carried the dead princes' women, who were assured protection by Bahadur Shah.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} run-scoring, Barnes, who {{was well known}} for being eccentric, gained fame {{throughout}} the season for his fielding at short leg—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 catches for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing {{one foot on the}} edge of the pitch. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of <b>his</b> <b>action</b> and English captain Norman Yardley later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{continued}} on to Philadelphia, {{where he met}} with members of Congress about his rank. <b>His</b> <b>action</b> at Ridgefield, coupled {{with the death of}} Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action, resulted in Arnold's promotion to major general, although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him. Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British. Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there.|$|E

5|$|Berkman {{stayed in}} jail for two months {{awaiting}} his trial. He had one hour per day of exercise with other prisoners. They could not understand his motive for the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with <b>his</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 192728 season, Halcombe was {{selected}} {{in only one}} match, taking 1/119 as South Australia were defeated by Victoria by an innings and 310 runs. He scored three not out and a duck in the match. After playing only one match in the previous season, Halcombe transferred to Western Australia. During his time in South Australia, Halcombe had played in matches officiated by Test umpire George Hele without <b>his</b> <b>action</b> being called into question. Of short stature for a fast bowler, Halcombe generated high pace from a short run-up.|$|E
5|$|Frederick rewarded {{him with}} Order of the Black Eagle {{on the field}} after the Battle of Rossbach; he had already {{received}} the Pour le Mérite for <b>his</b> <b>action</b> at the Battle of Kolin.

Seydlitz died in 1773, and Frederick's heirs included {{his name on the}} Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great in Berlin, in a place of honor.|$|E

5|$|If Echmarcach was {{a member}} of the Waterford dynasty, <b>his</b> <b>action</b> against Sitriuc may have been {{undertaken}} in the context of continuous dynastic strife between Dublin and Waterford in the tenth- and eleventh centuries. This could mean that Echmarcach's expulsion of Sitriuc was a direct act of vengeance for the latter's slaying of Ragnall ua Ímair (then King of Waterford) the year before.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, a {{diplomatic}} crisis emerged in Chile, {{otherwise known as}} the Baltimore Crisis. The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., was motivated by a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile; <b>his</b> <b>action</b> increased tensions between Chile and the United States, {{which began in the}} early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the War of the Pacific.|$|E

When Nagaraju blames Krishnadevaraya for sending a palanquin to her house for Rani Vasam, Krishnadevaraya defends <b>his</b> <b>action</b> and reminds Nagaraju that {{it was he who}} had asked him to send Malliswari to Rani Vasam. Krishnadevaraya forgives both Nagaraju and Malliswari, and their {{marriage}} is conducted in a grand manner at the palace.|$|E

5|$|On January 5, 2012, it was {{announced}} that Phaneuf would compete in his third All-Star Game, having finished second amongst all defencemen on the fan ballot, gaining 614,933 votes, behind the Ottawa Senators' Erik Karlsson. On April 21, 2013, Phaneuf and the Leafs clinched a Stanley Cup playoff spot, the first time for Phaneuf since the 2008–09 season with the Calgary Flames. On December 10, 2013, Phaneuf received a two-game suspension on a boarding hit on Boston Bruins defenceman Kevan Miller, which occurred on December 8, 2013, in Toronto. Phaneuf forfeited the amount of US$66,666.66 for <b>his</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of players have been called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers. Often the player {{has been able to}} modify <b>his</b> <b>action</b> to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended.|$|E

5|$|The prince {{began to}} be {{perceived}} as a unifier towards the middle of the 19th century. Such an interpretation is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and even in that of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for <b>his</b> <b>action,</b> occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>his</b> <b>action,</b> O'Leary was a nine-year veteran of the British armed forces {{and by the time}} he retired from the British Army in 1921, he had reached the rank of lieutenant. He served in the army again during the Second World War, {{although}} his later service was blighted by periods of ill-health. At his final retirement from the military in 1945, O'Leary was an Army major in command of a prisoner of war camp. Between the wars, O'Leary spent many years employed as a police officer in Canada and is sometimes considered to be a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross. Following the Second World War he worked as a building contractor in London, where he died in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and <b>his</b> <b>action</b> quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of <b>his</b> <b>action</b> by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E
50|$|He {{was acquitted}} however, {{on the theory}} that <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> did not tend either {{directly}} or immediately towards the death of the victim. In reality <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> were not attempted murder; they amounted to attempted conspiracy to commit murder. No matter what, Lacour would never have been a murderer, just an accomplice. Without having acted immediately and directly to commit the crime, {{he did not have a}} punishable attempt under the law of intent (although <b>his</b> <b>actions</b> could nonetheless be sanctioned under other criteria).|$|R
