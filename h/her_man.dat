5|$|Admiral Hipper hove to {{in order}} to rescue <b>her</b> <b>man</b> {{overboard}} and Glowworms survivors. The German sailor was not found, but 40 British sailors were recovered, although at least six later died of their wounds. Lieutenant Ramsay, the senior surviving officer, told his rescuers that neither the helm nor the emergency rudder were manned when the ships collided so the destroyer's turn towards Hipper was probably accidental. German accounts only mention four torpedoes fired by Glowworm, but British accounts say all ten were fired. This was confirmed by photographic evidence taken after the collision showing all of her torpedo tubes empty.|$|E
5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for <b>her</b> <b>man</b> finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the video was meant to {{illustrate}} the lyrics of the song. It depicts the sexual fantasies of a rich and bored housewife played by Beyoncé who tries to seduce <b>her</b> <b>man</b> while having breakfast at her house wearing a white robe. The video opens with various shots of a big mansion in which the singer is seen {{in one of the}} rooms. She tries to get her man's attention while he reads a newspaper. As he does not notice her, she throws a napkin on the floor and her female servant comes to lift it. The clip transitions to scenes of Beyoncé dressed in a Victorian jeweled outfit with a mask in her hands, lip-syncing the lyrics and dancing to the rhythm of the song. Afterwards, she is seen entering a limousine in which Jay-Z is already inside. Scenes of Beyoncé with a black coat and lingerie walking in front of the car are also intertwined throughout.|$|E

Then she had <b>her</b> <b>men</b> remove the tent, and she threw the rope over a bough. Then she told <b>her</b> <b>men</b> to pull the rope and they hanged Agne avenging Skjalf's father. Skjalf and <b>her</b> <b>men</b> ran to the ships and escaped to Finland, leaving her sons behind.|$|R

5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and <b>her</b> <b>man,</b> Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

They rise for breakfast, and Sam, their son, {{tries to get}} Jill to sign a {{permission}} form for an after-school drama group without Mal knowing, but Mal finds the form and rips it up. It is unclear what Mal does not like about it, other than claiming acting is men prancing around in tights. Sam is openly contemptuous of his father, whilst Mal is openly disappointed with his son, unlike his daughter, Chrissie, who worked hard at school, found <b>her</b> <b>man,</b> got pregnant and got married (in that order). Mal's prized son-in-law, Dean, arrives at the house, and prior to setting off for work together, Dean speaks of how successful his marriage is (his proudest example being his wife making him cooked breakfast every day apart from Sunday when he makes her breakfast).|$|E

25|$|In the video, Norwood {{plays an}} all-seeing, all-knowing narrator, who gives the central male {{character}} pause with her wicked glances that {{let him know}} she's watching his every move. The pursuit starts with the singer performing the first lines of her song {{in the back of}} a cruising bus, while observing her boarding man next to a female, both discussing vehemently with each other. She's constantly moving and dancing, before the scene shifts to a scaffolding in front of a fenced building, where she performs the chorus in dusty backgrounds. The next scene shows her standing under a traffic light at a plied crossing, wearing a grey outfit and big glasses, wherefrom she enters a near barber shop and performs afresh in a hairdresser chair. At the same time the camera shows <b>her</b> <b>man</b> flirting with two girls. The video ends with a backflash on all locations Norwood was seen at, also catching the daytime in front of the sinking sun.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Dance for You", Beyoncé, as {{the female}} protagonist, expresses her {{feelings}} to <b>her</b> <b>man</b> {{and tells him}} how devoted she is to him. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "about keeping things hot with her man". Echoing Vena's sentiments, Marc Hogan of Spin magazine described the lyrics as detailing a [...] "triumphantly monogamous relationship". In the first verse, Beyoncé sings about how understanding, loyal, and patient <b>her</b> <b>man</b> is. She further states that she really cares about his heart, {{she has a lot}} of valuable things to say, and that for all these reasons, she is going to dance for him.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé {{opens the}} song listing {{the things she}} would do for <b>her</b> <b>man</b> during her verses: brush his hair, take his shoes off, give him a manicure, rub his feet, help him put his do-rag on, undo his cufflinks. She also sings the lines [...] "Let me feed you, let me run your bath water, {{whatever}} you desire" [...] after the thins she had previously listed. Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep my hair fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if <b>her</b> <b>man</b> comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'" [...] Williams sings her solo verses during the song's bridge.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are a metaphor for fashion and sex. Madonna sings about clothes {{she would like to}} drape over <b>her</b> <b>man,</b> so that she can caress his body with her hands, and cover him with [...] "Velvet Kisses". According to Rikky Rooksby, author of Madonna: The Complete Guide To Her Music, the line [...] "I'll create a look that's made for you", later became synonymous with Madonna's re-invention of her image {{throughout}} her career.|$|E
500|$|Pharrell Williams and Shawn Carter. [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] is a mid-tempo R song whose lyrics {{detail a}} {{situation}} where a woman feels that <b>her</b> <b>man</b> has underestimated her.

However, some music critics felt that the production does not live up to those of other songs featured on B'Day.|$|E

500|$|The nearly eight-minute [...] "Victim of Changes" [...] {{displays}} a {{wide dynamic range}} in rhythm, texture, and mood, with heavy riffing, a melodic ballad section, and extended guitar leads. [...] An almost classical-sounding twin-guitar introduction leads to the violent main riff. [...] The lyrics tell of a woman whose hard-drinking results in losing <b>her</b> <b>man</b> to another woman. [...] Inspired by Led Zeppelin's [...] "Black Dog", the heavy riff alternates with a cappella passages, Halford breaking into screaming falsettos during the slow break and dramatic conclusion of the song.|$|E
500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{is a song}} which [...] "tells {{the story}} of a woman stuck in a {{dead-end}} relationship with a man who clearly does not deserve her, and with her journey to realizing that and eventually walking out on him", and her frustration that <b>her</b> <b>man</b> is not 100% committed. The introduction was said to be similar to [...] "4 Minutes" [...] by Madonna and Justin Timberlake, though the melody is [...] "backed with trumpets and synth beats". A reviewer from Prefix said that the record didn't sound like a typical Tricky Stewart and The-Dream production.|$|E
500|$|... "Dance for You" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Beyoncé for the deluxe {{edition of}} her fourth studio album, 4 (2011).

500|$|... "Upgrade U" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics, some praising Knowles' assertiveness while singing about {{her desire to}} give luxuries to <b>her</b> <b>man.</b> Many also praised the natural chemistry that Knowles and Jay-Z have in the song. After the release of B'Day, [...] "Upgrade U" [...] started to gain popularity on R and hip hop radio stations in the United States. This prompted its pre-release debut on the US Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart and later on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart; after its promotional release, the song peaked at number 11 and at number 59 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs and the Hot 100 charts respectively.|$|E
500|$|... "Resentment" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Walter W. Millsap III, Candice Nelson and Curtis Mayfield and {{originally}} performed by Victoria Beckham.

[...] "Resentment" [...] along with several other songs {{were meant to be}} on Beckham's solo-album, Come Together, which was later shelved, leading the song to be included on the documentary DVD titled The Real Beckhams (2004). As the album release shelved, the song went for sale. American recording artist Jazmine Sullivan had re-recorded the song for her unreleased original debut Break My Little Heart but her album shelved too and the song went for sale again.|$|E
