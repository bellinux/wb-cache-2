5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont {{to take the lead in}} André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> in the front row.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks into}} the season, guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers, and died a few hours later, {{becoming}} the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field. New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed, and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players. Several players had to play both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross-river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant the Titans had to play their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed to have lost $150,000 on the trip. The Titans finished their first season 7–7; according to attendance figures released by the team, the Titans drew an average of 16,375fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as <b>empty</b> <b>seats.</b> The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $450,000 for the season; in his autobiography, Wismer set the figure at $1.2million.|$|E

50|$|Now imagine {{someone else}} {{comes along and}} wants to sit down. The empty row has a poor view; so {{he does not want}} to sit there. Instead, a person in the crowded row moves into the <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> the first person left behind. The <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> moves one spot closer to the edge and the person waiting to sit down. The next person follows, and the next, et cetera. One could say that the <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> moves towards the edge of the row. Once the <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> reaches the edge, the new person can sit down.|$|R
50|$|Teams then {{alternate}} seats (i.e., no two {{team members}} are {{sitting next to}} each other) so that two people from each team are {{on the couch and}} there is one <b>empty</b> <b>seat.</b> Play begins with the player left (or clockwise) of the <b>empty</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R

25|$|Prior to the Games, {{there were}} several controversies over finances, lack of public interest, {{transportation}} shortages for journalists, and several administrative decisions regarding the opening ceremony and gala show. Organizers were able to generate more interest {{but there were a}} few hundred <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> in the 61,000-capacity stadium {{at the start of the}} opening ceremony. Organizers also supplied more shuttle buses for the late-night shifts at the request of various international media organizations.|$|E
25|$|During the lead-up to the Games, {{there were}} controversies over sponsorship, the athletes' use of social media, and several {{political}} issues. After a complicated lottery process, {{thousands of people}} failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but {{a large number of}} <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> were observed throughout the games, even at {{some of the most popular}} events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.|$|E

25|$|In April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas {{announced}} that they proposed {{to enter into a}} codeshare agreement, arguing that it would be necessary in order to reduce <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> and financial losses on trans-Tasman routes. The airport counter-argued that the codeshare would stifle competition and passenger growth on Wellington's international flights, pointing to what it saw as a market duopoly dominated by Air New Zealand and Qantas. The codeshare was abandoned by the two airlines after it was rejected in a draft ruling by the ACCC in November 2006.|$|E

The ministers promised to meet frequently outside Tehran and held their first meeting on 25 August in Mashhad, with four <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> for the unapproved nominees.|$|E
25|$|November 21, 2006 – Lebanon's Industry Minister Pierre Amine Gemayel {{was assassinated}} in his car by gunmen in Jdeideh, a Christian {{neighborhood}} {{on the outskirts of}} Beirut, bringing the Cabinet one seat closer to the nine <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> that would force it to collapse. He was a young, outspoken opponent of Syria's occupation of Lebanon and its influence in the country. Analysts said Gemayel's death was likely to worsen tensions in the already divided country. Hours after the assassination, the Security Council approved the draft accord for the creation of the Hariri tribunal, sending it to the Lebanese government for final approval.|$|E

25|$|But as the Phillies {{improved}} {{the quality of}} baseball life in Philadelphia, there was a simultaneous decline in {{the fortunes of the}} A's – in the team, in the owner, and in the ballpark. Mack had alienated many fans in 1915 and again in 1932 when he sold off his pennant-winning teams for cash, and his clashes with his neighbors over the spite fence, the night games and the 20th Street overhang sparked ill-will between the team and its most important asset: its fan base. The Phillies began to outdraw the A's, whose bottom-feeder status in the American League contributed to the vicious circle of bad teams and <b>empty</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} domestic ticket allocation had fully {{sold out}} and the organising committee completed sales of tickets returned from the international allocation {{by the end of}} April. However, it was obvious at the opening matches that there were a significant number of <b>empty</b> <b>seats.</b> It was gradually revealed that the World Cup Ticketing Bureau (WCTB) still had unsold tickets in its possession. After FIFA agreed to sell this inventory, JAWOC undertook sales over telephone and WCTB handled the internet sales. For the second round Japan vs. Turkey match in Miyagi in particular, although it was reported by both parties that all tickets had been sold, some 700 seats remained empty.|$|E

After the show the ring announcers Miguel Linares, Leonardo Magadan and Jesus Zuniga taped various introduction segments to be used when the Anniversary show would be broadcast on television at a later date. Fans were still entering the building during the first match as there were large areas of <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> during this match, something that would change over time as Arena México looking to be at more or less full capacity by the time the third match started.|$|E

25|$|On 12 April 2006, Air New Zealand and Qantas {{announced}} that they had signed a code-share agreement for their trans-Tasman routes and would file for authorisation from the New Zealand Ministry of Transport and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The airlines maintained that they were making losses on Tasman routes due to too many <b>empty</b> <b>seats,</b> and that a codeshare would return the routes to profitability. Critics, particularly Wellington International Airport, Christchurch Airport and Melbourne Airport, argued that the codeshare would lead to reduced passenger choice and higher airfares, and that cities such as Auckland and Sydney would benefit immensely through economic activity services would bring.|$|E
25|$|NBC {{chose to}} {{continue}} the Late Night franchise, and {{at the suggestion of}} Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels, hired Conan O'Brien, a relatively unknown writer for The Simpsons, to take over the time slot beginning in late 1993. Late Night with Conan O'Brien was constantly at risk for cancellation in its early years; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30am., but Kinnear left to pursue a career in acting later on. Interns filled <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. Things improved for the show slowly (mostly revolving around O'Brien's performance) and by 1996, O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fifteenth}} day {{the realms of}} Heaven and Hell and {{the realm of the}} living are open and Chinese would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is {{ancestor}} worship, where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-mache form of material items such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals would be served with <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former includes only older generations. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.|$|E
