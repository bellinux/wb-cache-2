2500|$|The vessel had an {{increased}} baking and a midship deckhouse with underlying engine room. The longitudinal-framed hull was ice-reinforced. Built as a closed shelter-decker, Adele had a grain capacity of [...] and an internal volume of [...] ball steerage. Two {{of the four}} cargo holds were arranged {{in front of the}} bridge structure, two were behind it. The two front rooms were accessible by three hatches, the aft rooms had one hatch each. The cargo consisted of 12 normal light derricks on all hatches and a 25-ton heavy lift on hold 2. The 12 AEG-type winches, manufactured under license by Kampnagel Schaerffe, Hamburg, were designed to lift 3 tons at /min in single gear, or 5 tons at that speed in <b>double</b> <b>gear.</b> Each was driven by an 18.4-kW electric motor. The derricks between the two forward hatches were attached to double post, which served simultaneously as a cargo space ventilation of 20 changes of air per hour, the second front and aft cargo gear was on conventional central derricks. The hatches were fitted with a sliding steel hatch cover, and the main deck was lined with [...] thick Oregon pine to prevent heat radiation, assumably to carry fruits. However, no refrigeration plant was fitted, hence the carriage of any fruit had been restricted to short sea trade, such as from Spain or Canary Islands to North Europe. Besides the shaft tunnel there were cargo tanks.|$|E

The innovative design characteristic is represented by adaptive dimensioning with minimum gauge, depending on requirements, the type of drive, the fixing method, the connections for the hydraulic circuit and intermediary sealing between stages which allows the operation with different liquid mediums. The innovative technological characteristic is on integrated adaptive system (lean production) using computer assisted manufacturing on CNC machines with minimal production time and high quality.

50|$|<b>Double</b> helical <b>gears</b> and {{herringbone}} gears are similar, but {{the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like <b>double</b> helical <b>gears</b> do. <b>Double</b> helical <b>gears</b> overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A <b>double</b> helical <b>gear</b> {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, <b>double</b> helical <b>gears</b> are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{improving}} {{the design of}} torque sensor used in the EPS system. Such design not only integrates the torque and the corner signal, but also saves space. By using Matlab interior point method, the gear system parameters are optimized andthe weight {{and the size of}} the sensor are reduced. Bench test results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of this self-designed sensor is able to meet the demands of EPS. 1. Design of the torque and angle sensor gear set The structural design of sensor gear is shown in fig 1 [1]. We define gear 1 and gear 2 to have the same number of gear teeth; the duplex gears 3, 4, and 5 to have the same number of gear teeth; gear 6, 7 with the same amount of gear teeth. Gear 1, 6, 8 and <b>double</b> <b>gear</b> 3 hence become the main concerns in parameter design. The transmission ratio is respectively: Z 1 =Z 2 = 84 ；Z' 3 =Z’ 4 =Z’ 5 = 15 ；Z 3 =Z 4 =Z 5 = 45 ；Z 6 =Z 7 = 35 ；Z 8 = 36 (1) In Eqs. 1, Z’ 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-small-sized duplex gear. Z 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-large-sized duplex gear. Fig 1 Sensor gear arrangement To set the steering wheel atthe initial position for angle 0 °, then the angle difference between pinion 6 and pinion 8 is 0 ° too. If the steering wheel’s rotation angle is, then the angle difference between gear 6 and gear 8 is, thus the steering wheel’s rotation angle corresponds with the angle difference of the pinions. Therefore, the measurement of the steering wheel’s rotation angle can be converted into the measurement of the angle difference between the two pinions. According to the transmission ratio, when the rotation angle is, the turning angle of gear 6 is and the turning angle of gear 8 is 3 7...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The two <b>gears</b> of the <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} {{is close to}} each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line of the <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded planetary gear reducer, it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority. This paper also used certain winch’s speed reducer as example to explain that the change of the pressure angle can reduce contact stress by 3 %~ 40 % and also enhances the torque ability by 3 %~ 40 %...|$|R
