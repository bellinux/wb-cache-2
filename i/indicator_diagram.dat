50|$|Nicholas Procter (N.P.) Burgh (c. 1835 - 1900) was a British {{consulting}} marine engineer, {{known for}} his work on marine engines, marine engineering, screw propulsion, boilers and boiler-making and the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E

The need to implement effective diagnostic methods is justified by presenting statistical data of marine diesel engines failure and the cost of their operation. Based on the own research has been proven, for the chosen example, that <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams</b> and analysis of indicated parameters have limited utility in the diagnosis of damages of marine engine, although this is a method commonly used in operational practice. To achieve greater diagnostic effectiveness, when, based on <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams,</b> are calculated and then the characteristics of heat release is analyzed - net of heat release characteristics and the intensity of the heat release, it was demonstrated.

The temperature corresponding to each curve in the figure increases from the lower left to the upper right.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the later}} books Burgh {{published}} was on the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram,</b> since the early 20th century named pressure volume diagram or PV diagram. This was the first (and only) book solely devoted to the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram,</b> its theoretical background, and its applications. This type of diagram was developed late 18th century in the workshop of Boulton and Watt by James Watt and his employee John Southern (1758-1815). It was used to improve the efficiency of engines, and kept a trade secret until the 1830s. In the 1850s William John Macquorn Rankine in 1859/1866 {{was one of the}} first to give a detailed description of the device. According to Miller (2011): A detailed and influential treatment of the indicator within the framework of a newly developing ‘engineering science’ was given by W. J. Macquorn Rankine, in his A Manual of the Steam Engine (1859). Rankine not only reconceptualized the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram</b> as what he called the ‘diagram of energy’, but also offered a substantial scientific account of how departures of real indicator diagrams from the ideal could be linked to operating characteristics of engines and of the indicator itself.|$|E

Clapeyron’s analysis of Carnot was more broadly disseminated in 1843 when Johann Poggendorff translated it into German.|$|E
50|$|John Southern (c.1758-1815) was an English engineer, son of Thomas Southern of Derbyshire. He co-invented the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram</b> {{with his}} employer, James Watt, in 1796.

40|$|Twin-shaft screw-type {{expanders}} offer a {{high potential}} for energy conversion {{in the lower}} and medium power range, for instance as expansion engines in Rankine cycles for exhaust heat recovery. With regard to minimizing internal leakages and lubricating moving machine parts, an auxiliary liquid or liquid working fluid can be fed to the screw expander. In this paper, <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams</b> of a twin-shaft screw-type expander prototype designed at the Chair of Fluidics at TU Dortmund University are presented and analyzed in detail. The experimental investigations are carried out at a hot-air test rig with expander inlet manifold water injection. The time-dependant working chamber pressure is recorded by means of high-resolution absolute pressure transmittters. Hereby, specific aspects of working chamber pressure measurements are mentioned. Based on the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams,</b> relevant influence mechanisms on the expander 2 ̆ 7 s operational behavior resulting from water injection are determined.

5000|$|The engine's {{cycle of}} {{operations}} including sectional drawings and <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams</b> for both gas and petroleum fueled versions. Details {{of the way}} the liquid fuel was introduced are described over 11 pages of Dugald Clerk's book Gas and Oil Engines. The petroleum engine in these tests was made by the [...] "New York and New Jersey Ready Motor Company". This is followed by a similar analysis of Simon's engine which was an adaptation of the Brayton engine made by Louis Simon & Sons, in Nottingham, UK and marketed as The Eclipse Silent Gas Engine. The Simon engine had an added complexity in that it injected some of the water/steam heated by the engine/exhaust into the engine. The <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams</b> for this engine are also reported by Dugald Clerk and show that the addition of the water has little merit in terms of power production, the cooling of the gases and expansion of the steam compensating for each other.|$|R
50|$|NACA Report 107 {{describes}} a pressure-measuring device that was adapted {{for use in}} mapping <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams</b> of high-speed internal combustion engines. The cards are obtained by a point-to-point method giving the average {{of a large number}} of engine cycles. The principle involved is the balancing of the engine cylinder pressure against a measured pressure on opposite sides of a metal diaphragm of negligible stiffness. In its application as an engine indicator the phase of the engine cycle to which a pressure measurement corresponds is selected by a filming device. Thereport discusses errors to be avoided in the development of an indicator for light high-speed engines, where vibration is serious, and outlines the principles underlying the design of this instrument in order to be free of such errors. A description of the instrument and accessories follows, together with operating directions. Specimen <b>indicator</b> <b>diagrams</b> are appended. The indicator has been used successfully at speeds up to 2,600 rpm, the highest speed available for trial. Its sensitivity is approximately that of a standard 6-inch dial gauge of the Bourdon tube type.|$|R
5000|$|The PV diagram, {{then called}} an <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram,</b> was {{developed}} by James Watt and his employee John Southern (1758-1815) to improve the efficiency of engines. In 1796, Southern developed the simple, but critical, technique to generate the diagram by fixing a board so as to move with the piston, thereby tracing the [...] "volume" [...] axis, while a pencil, attached to a pressure gauge, moved {{at right angles to}} the piston, tracing [...] "pressure".|$|E
50|$|In thermodynamics, {{heat engines}} are often modeled using a {{standard}} engineering model {{such as the}} Otto cycle. The theoretical model can be refined and augmented with actual data from an operating engine, using tools such as an <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram.</b> Since very few actual implementations of heat engines exactly match their underlying thermodynamic cycles, {{one could say that}} a thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of a mechanical engine. In any case, fully understanding an engine and its efficiency requires gaining a good understanding of the (possibly simplified or idealized) theoretical model, the practical nuances of an actual mechanical engine, and the discrepancies between the two.|$|E
50|$|The {{most useful}} {{instrument}} for analyzing {{the performance of}} steam engines is the steam engine indicator. Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, {{which can be used}} to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely used by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. The engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines.

5000|$|More {{works in}} those days {{described}} the diagram and its origin, {{such as in the}} 1865 Handbook of the steam-engine by the British engineer John Bourne. In the chapter on [...] "The power and performance of engines" [...] he introduced the device and made extensive use of indicator diagrams. In the first chapter of his 1869 work Burgh gave a general description {{of the state of the}} art on this subject {{in those days}}: A VERY large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession look at an <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram</b> as a mysterious production; and even supposing that they comprehend how it is formed, they do not understand the causes for the various forms of figures. There is, therefore undoubtedly, room for a practical work on the subject which shall deal with the matter just as a learner requires : leading him on step by step without slipping, and impressing on his mind all the realities of the case... The best course of instruction for the young engineer then is, that the truth of each minute portion of the subject before him be laid bare, so that he can comprehend it. When he understands thus far, obviously his knowledge will enable him to put the same into practice boldly : for by being acquainted with the ground-work of the subject, he is master also to a great extent of the result of his labours.In the preface Burgh explained, that the book describes all inns and outs of the PV diagram in the following ten steps:* Chapter I. contains the description and use of the indicator, illustrating, at a working scale, Messrs. Maudslays' and Mr. Richards' Indicators (see image). * Chapter II. is under the heading, [...] "How to take an <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram</b> correctly:" [...] which treats of the action of the steam in the cylinder the definition of the diagram correct indicator gear for horizontal, vertical, and oscillating engines, and indicating notes. * Chapter III. deals with the proof of atmospheric pressure and particulars of steam pressures, and includes rules and tables bearing on the subject, with practical examples and illustrations. * Chapter IV. is a complete description and illustration of the theoretical geometry of the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram</b> in a more practical manner than hitherto published. * Chapter V. is the practical geometry of the <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram,</b> which fully explains the frontispiece plate and other figures in connection with it. * Chapter VI. commences the illustrations of indicator diagrams and gear constructed by the firms I have mentioned, and others whose names are noted under the figures : this chapter contains twenty-one diagrams from ordinary modern screw engines of all classes; three from compound engines three of steam-launch engines and two illustrations of indicator gear for return acting engines. * Chapter VII. is devoted to diagrams taken from the most modem paddle-engines, and contains eighteen illustrations of them; also the most improved indicator gear by Messrs. Penn and Napier, for oscillating engines. * Chapter VIII. treats of land-engine indicator diagrams, showing eleven examples taken from various classes, including locomotive engines. * Chapter IX. fully explains and illustrates air and water pump diagrams. * Chapter X. closes this work, with the explanation of the indicated horse-power in connection with the diagram.This work was republished several times in Burgh's days. The fourth edition of this work was published in 1876, and the fifth edition in 1879.|$|E
50|$|Both {{slide and}} piston valves have the {{limitation}} that {{intake and exhaust}} events are fixed in relation {{to each other and}} cannot be independently optimised. Lap is provided on steam edges of the valve, so that although the valve stroke reduces as cutoff is advanced, the valve is always fully opened to exhaust. However, as cutoff is shortened, the exhaust events also advance. The exhaust release point occurs earlier in the power stroke and compression earlier in the exhaust stroke. Early release wastes some energy in the steam, and early closure also wastes energy in compressing an otherwise unnecessarily large quantity of steam. Another effect of early cutoff is that the valve is moving quite slowly at the cutoff point, and this causes 'wire drawing' of the steam, another wasteful thermodynamic effect visible on an <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the true}} diesel engine, only air is {{initially}} {{introduced into the}} combustion chamber. The air is then compressed with a compression ratio typically between 15:1 and 23:1. This high compression causes {{the temperature of the}} air to rise. At about the top of the compression stroke, fuel is injected directly into the compressed air in the combustion chamber. This may be into a (typically toroidal) void {{in the top of the}} piston or a pre-chamber depending upon the design of the engine. The fuel injector ensures that the fuel is broken down into small droplets, and that the fuel is distributed evenly. The heat of the compressed air vaporizes fuel from the surface of the droplets. The vapour is then ignited by the heat from the compressed air in the combustion chamber, the droplets continue to vaporise from their surfaces and burn, getting smaller, until all the fuel in the droplets has been burnt. Combustion occurs at a substantially constant pressure during the initial part of the power stroke. The start of vaporisation causes a delay before ignition and the characteristic diesel knocking sound as the vapour reaches ignition temperature and causes an abrupt increase in pressure above the piston (not shown on the P-V <b>indicator</b> <b>diagram).</b> When combustion is complete the combustion gases expand as the piston descends further; the high pressure in the cylinder drives the piston downward, supplying power to the crankshaft.|$|E
