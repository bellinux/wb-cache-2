25|$|Oxytocin {{helps the}} uterus to {{contract}} quickly and the contractions {{to last for}} longer. It is the first line treatment for PPH when its cause is the uterus not contracting well. A combination of syntocinon and <b>ergometrine</b> is commonly used as part of active management of the third stage of labour. This is called syntometrine. Syntocinon alone lowers the risk of PPH. Based on limited research available {{it is unclear whether}} syntocinon or syntometrine is most effective in preventing PPH but adverse effects are worse with syntometrine making syntocinon a more attractive option. <b>Ergometrine</b> also has to be kept cool and in a dark place so that it is safe to use. It does reduce the risk of PPH by improving the tone of the uterus when compared with no treatment however it has to be used with caution due to its effect raising blood pressure and causing worse after pains.|$|E
25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} oxytocin {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the Oxytocin Challenge Test (OCT) fail. It is unclear whether a high dose {{is better than a}} standard dose for labor induction. It has largely replaced <b>ergometrine</b> as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, salbutamol, and terbutaline).|$|E

2500|$|Romalis again {{encountered}} {{the results of}} illegal abortions in 1962, during his internship at Cook County Hospital in Illinois, when he spent a month on the septic obstetrics ward. He recalls that in those days hospitals had entire wards {{for the victims of}} complications of pregnancy, and ninety percent of them had complications of septic abortion. [...] The ward had about 40 beds plus extra beds lining the halls for the overflow. Each day, the hospital admitted 10-30 patients with septic abortion. Each morning, the interns prepared 40 - 60 litres of intravenous fluid containing tetracycline, oxytocin and <b>ergometrine</b> for inocoming patients. Thanks to the discovery of antibiotics, only about one woman died each month. The cause was usually septic shock associated with hemorrhage. In the mid-1970s, a US report revealed a large drop in maternal mortality since abortion was legalized. David Boyes, a founder of BC’s Pap test program, told Romalis that the numbers were straightforward and “it suggests that politicians, with a few strokes of a pen, have saved more lives than we have with twenty-five years of effort screening for cervical cancer.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{intravenous}} LD50 {{of the new}} alkaloid {{was approximately}} 150mg/kg for mice and 0.75 mg/kg for rabbits/ Before death, the mice showed periodic convulsions of a clonic type, erection of the hairs and excitability. At doses of 50-100mg/kg it produced only this peculiar symptomatology: the mice stood upright and pressed on each other's noses and chattered their teeth. In rabbits, and injection into the ear vein in doses of 0.1-1mg/kg produced dilatation of the pupil, excitability or convulsions of a clinic type. The ears became pale and cold with intense vasoconstriction. The toxicity of the alkaloid to rabbits seemed to depend on its power of raising the body-temperature in this species. In rabbits the similarity between {{the effects of the}} new alkaloid and <b>ergometrine</b> were particularly striking, but <b>ergometrine</b> was less toxic to rabbits (the approximate intravenous LD50 of <b>ergometrine</b> was 3.5mg/kg).D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide induced, in low concentrations (minimum active concentration 0.1-1µg/ml), a contracture in the isolated uterus of the virgen guinea pig. There was a satisfactory dose/response relationship. This contracture was very similar to that produced by ergmetrine maleate, which, however, was 1-2 times more potent.On the rabbit uterus in situ both alkaloids produced a prompt contraction and increased rhythmic activity of the uterus. For <b>ergometrine</b> the minimum active dose by intravenous route was 0.1-0.3 mg/kg and for the new alkaloid 0.2-0.5mg/kgm. The actions of both alkaloids lasted some minutes, and owing to the favourable circumstance that the interference between the effects of the two alkaloids was negligible, it was possible to test them on the same preparation. <b>Ergometrine</b> was 1-2 times more potent than the new alkaloid. On the isolated seminal vesicles of the guinea pig, the new alkaloid was approximately 200 times less potent than ergotamine tartrate as an adrenergic blocking drug. Rabbits anaethetized with urethane supported doses of D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide which would have killed unanaesthetized animals. Rapid intravenous injections of small doses (0.1-0.2mg/kg) of the new alkaloid caused an evanescent decrease or a small increase of blood pressure; with higher doses (0.3/0.5mg/kg and more) the blood pressure increased moderately without showing any dose/response relationship. <b>Ergometrine</b> maleate seemed to be less active on bloodpressure, and there was no significant change of blood pressure with 0.3-0.5 mg/kg.The new alkaloid was without effect, when given in small doses, on the blood pressure of cats anaethetized with chloralose. Higher intravenous doses (0.1-0.3mg/kg) caused a sustained hypotension of long duration and a moderate decrease of heart-rate. The respiration of rabbits and cats was depressed by small doses of the new alkaloid; cats seemed to be less resistant than rabbits. In cats, 0.01mg/kg of the new alkaloid caused broncho-constriction and contractions of the nictitating membrane of long duration. The new alkaloid have no action on isolated rabbit auricles at doses up to 100µg/ml. In summing up, the new naturally occurring alkaloid D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide has powerful ergometrine-like oxytocic action and weak ergotamine-like adrenergic blocking actions. It must be included, on the basis of pharmacological evidence, in the <b>ergometrine</b> group of ergot alkaloids. <b>Ergometrine,</b> however, is less toxic and more active than the new alkaloid. Results suggest that it could have a lysergic acid diethylamide-like activity, but this hypothesis must be checked by experiments on humans.|$|E
50|$|Ergotamine {{produces}} vasoconstriction peripherally {{as well as}} {{damages the}} peripheral epithelium. In high doses, ergotamine is conducive to vascular stasis, thrombosis, and gangrene. It can increase uterine contractivity and occasionally is used therapeutically immediately post-partum to decrease uterine bleeding. See also <b>ergometrine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some inhaled {{anaesthetics}} {{used for}} general anesthesia, such as cyclopropane and halothane, {{may reduce the}} effect of oxytocin and <b>ergometrine.</b> There may also be {{an increased risk of}} a drop in blood pressure and abnormal heart beats if oxytocin is given with these general anesthetics.|$|E
50|$|Ergolines, such as lysergic acid, include {{structural}} {{elements of both}} tryptamine and phenylethylamine and thus act on the whole group of the 5-HT receptors, adrenoceptors (mostly of type α) and dopamine receptors (mostly type D2). So ergotamine is a partial agonist of α-adrenergic and 5-HT2 receptors, and thus narrows blood vessels and stimulates constriction of the uterus. Dihydroergotamine is more selective to α-adrenergic receptors and has a weaker effect on serotonin receptors. <b>Ergometrine</b> is an agonist of α-adrenergic, 5-HT2 and partly D2 receptors. Compared with other ergot alkaloids, <b>ergometrine</b> has a greater selectivity in stimulating the uterus. LSD, a semi-synthetic psychedelic ergoline, is an agonist of 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A {{and to a lesser}} extent D2 receptors and has a powerful psychedelic effect.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effect}} include high blood pressure, vomiting, seizures, headache, and low blood pressure. Other {{serious side effects}} include ergotism. It was {{originally}} made from the rye ergot fungus but can also be made from lysergic acid.

50|$|<b>Ergometrine</b> {{also known}} as ergonovine, is a {{medication}} used to cause contractions of the uterus to treat heavy vaginal bleeding after childbirth. It can be used either by mouth, by injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. It begins working within 15 min when taken by mouth and is faster in onset when used by injection. Effects last between 45 and 180 minutes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ergometrine</b> was {{discovered}} in 1932. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 0.12 and 0.41 USD for an injectable dose and 0.01 USD for a pill as of 2014. In the United States it is about 1.75 USD per dose.|$|E
50|$|Other {{drugs that}} affect the {{cardiovascular}} system include ajmaline, which is a Class I antiarrhythmic agents, and ajmalicine, which is used in Europe as an antihypertensive drug. Physostigmine - an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase - and its synthetic analogs {{are used in the}} treatment of glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease (rivastigmine) and myasthenia (neostigmine, pyridostigmine, distigmine). Ergot alkaloids <b>ergometrine</b> (ergobazin, ergonovine), ergotamine and their synthetic derivatives (methylergometrine) are applied against uterine bleeding, and bisindole alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine are antitumor agents.|$|E
50|$|Methylergometrine (also called methylergonovine, methylergobasin, and D-lysergic acid 1-butanolamide) is a {{synthetic}} analogue of ergonovine, a psychedelic alkaloid found in ergot, and {{many species of}} morning glory. It {{is a member of}} the ergoline family and chemically similar to LSD, ergine, <b>ergometrine,</b> and lysergic acid. Due to its oxytocic properties, it has a medical use in obstetrics. According to Jonathan Ott, methylergonovine has LSD-like actions above 2 milligrams, due to its agonistic action at the 5HT2A-mGlu2 receptor protomers. Clinical efficacy occurs around 200 µg, ten times lower than the hallucinogenic threshold.|$|E

50|$|The {{neurotropic}} {{activities of}} the ergot alkaloids may also cause hallucinations and attendant irrational behaviour, convulsions, and even death. Other symptoms include strong uterine contractions, nausea, seizures, high fever, vomiting, loss of muscle strength and unconsciousness. Since the Middle Ages, controlled doses of ergot were used to induce abortions and to stop maternal bleeding after childbirth. Ergot extract {{has been used in}} pharmaceutical preparations, including ergot alkaloids in products such as Cafergot (containing caffeine and ergotamine or ergoline) to treat migraine headaches, and <b>ergometrine,</b> used to induce uterine contractions and to control bleeding after childbirth.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{effective}} pharmacological treatment for retained placenta. It is useful ensuring the bladder is empty. However, <b>ergometrine</b> {{should not be}} given as it causes tonic uterine contractions which may delay placental expulsion. Controlled cord traction has been recommended as a second alternative after more than 30 minutes have passed after stimulation of uterine contractions, provided the uterus is contracted. Manual extraction may be required if cord traction also fails, or if heavy ongoing bleeding occurs. Very rarely a curettage is necessary {{to ensure that no}} remnants of the placenta remain (in rare conditions with very adherent placenta such as a placenta accreta).|$|E
50|$|More {{research}} {{would be useful}} in determining the best doses of <b>ergometrine,</b> and syntocinon.

Misoprostol {{does not need to be}} kept at a certain temperature and research into its effectiveness in reducing blood loss appears promising when compared with a placebo in a setting where it is not appropriate to use oxytocin. Misoprostol can cause unpleasant side effects such as very high body temperatures and shivering. Lower doses of misoprostol appear to be safer and cause less side effects.|$|E
