After noting Judah's prowess as a charioteer, the sheik asks him to drive his {{quadriga}} {{in a race}} before the new Judean governor Pontius Pilate (Frank Thring). Judah declines, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> learns that Messala will also compete.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{expiration}} {{of his previous}} contract, Niedermayer was again a restricted free agent, and he again endured a difficult negotiation with the Devils, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> changed agents. Initially demanding a five-year, $45 million contract, Niedermayer chose to go to arbitration. He was awarded a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season, and the $7 million salary he was given tied John LeClair's award in 2000 as the highest ever given in arbitration. However, the contract was wiped out when the entire season was cancelled {{as a result of}} the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United manager Craig Levein was {{appointed}} in December 2009. Levein was heavily criticised {{by the media}} for his decision to play without any strikers in a Euro 2012 qualifier against the Czech Republic, which Scotland lost 1–0. Levein continued to defend this tactical approach, <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> had left the position. Scotland failed to qualify for Euro 2012, but Levein argued that the team was improving. For 2014 World Cup qualification, Levein and the SFA successfully pushed for Scotland to have their first two fixtures at home. This policy backfired, however, as Scotland could only draw those two matches. Defeats in following away matches against Wales and Belgium resulted in Levein being sacked by the SFA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> {{became a}} bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours {{circulated}} that she bore him four sons, {{and that he}} had a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. He kept a magnificent household, sufficient for him to be able to host a parliament at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of young female relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice's family, and a Joan Burnell {{was the subject of a}} guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was dean of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop's executors. Robert Burnell's eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift for the English language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, Hand {{was viewed as a}} liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty, sold well and won him new admirers. <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> criticized the civil-rights activism of the 1950s Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.|$|E
5|$|Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was {{his final}} major {{compositional}} project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, {{though he never}} published it. During this time Sibelius was {{at the peak of}} his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease these girls, deep down he is nice to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E
5|$|Nao is {{a first-year}} student at Hoshinoumi Academy {{and is also}} its student council president. She is a hardworking, intelligent, and shrewd girl, but is also narcissistic, self-righteous, and short-tempered. She {{has the ability to}} make herself invisible, but this is limited to one person of her {{choosing}} at a time. She uses this ability to her advantage to attack others she believes deserve to be kicked, but this causes her to be shunned and bullied by her peers. Although she initially shows no attraction towards Yuu, she eventually falls in love with him and stays by his side <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> loses all of his memories of her. She is a fan of Zhiend, influenced by her older brother , who once had the ability to control air movements and vibrations, which he used when playing the guitar.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E

5|$|Although Elgar {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> achieved recognition. He nevertheless married {{the daughter of a}} senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
5|$|Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' {{mentor and}} ally {{throughout}} the Greek {{era in the}} series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as {{in the absence of}} light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War, she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second quest for the Ambrosia of Asclepius in the God of War comic series and lied to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new level of understanding in God of War III. With ulterior motives, Athena became Kratos' ally once more and guided him to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{came to the}} Kingdom of Hungary {{upon the}} {{invitation}} of an influential Croatian lord, Paul Šubić, in August 1300. AndrewIII died on 14January 1301, and within four months Charles was crowned king, but with a provisional crown instead of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Most Hungarian noblemen refused to yield to him and elected Wenceslaus of Bohemia king. Charles withdrew to the southern regions of the kingdom. Pope Boniface VIII acknowledged Charles as the lawful king in 1303, but Charles was unable to strengthen his position against his opponent. Wenceslaus abdicated in favor of Otto of Bavaria in 1305. Because it had no central government, the Kingdom of Hungary had disintegrated into a dozen provinces, each headed by a powerful nobleman, or oligarch. One of those oligarchs, Ladislaus Kán, captured and imprisoned Otto of Bavaria in 1307. Charles was elected king in Pest on 27November 1308, but his rule remained nominal {{in most parts of}} his kingdom <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> was crowned with the Holy Crown on 27August 1310.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), <b>even</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool. When she continues to misbehave, her parents send her to boarding school in Switzerland. The following year, Victoria returns as a moody teenager who is working in the mailroom at her father’s company, Newman Enterprises, and becoming smitten with the Ryan McNeilwho is older than her. Victor offers Ryan money to leave town but he and Victoria elope. Their marriage ends when Ryan leaves her for Nina Webster in 1993. Victoria then {{falls in love with}} Cole Howard and they marry the following year, but their marriage is quickly annulled when it is believed by their parents that they are siblings. When this is proved untrue they wed again; this marriage breaks down four years later when in 1998 Cole has sex with Ashley Abbott. Victoria becomes pregnant with Cole’s child and chooses to raise it with Neil Winters. Her baby girl, Eve Howard, dies a few days after birth and Victoria ends her union with Neil. Victoria briefly tries and fails to win Cole back from Ashley. In 1999, Victoria meets Gary Dawson (Ricky Paull Goldin) and they begin dating, though she soon discovers that he is stalking her and ends the relationship. Enraged, Gary kidnaps Victoria in a tree house and she takes months to recover. She and Ryan then reunite and plan to remarry, but on their wedding day in November 2001 Ryan's ex-wife Tricia Dennison shoots and kills him, leaving Victoria devastated. She then has a brief relationship with Diego Guittierez in 2002, and afterward dates Michael Baldwin. The following year, some of Victor's crimes come to light and Victoria leaves town when these and other family problems overwhelm her. She moves to Florence, Italy, where she studies Art History.|$|E
