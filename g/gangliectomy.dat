50|$|A ganglionectomy, {{also called}} a <b>gangliectomy,</b> is the {{surgical}} {{removal of a}} ganglion. The removal of a ganglion cyst usually requires a ganglionectomy. Such cysts usually form on the hand, foot or wrist and may cause pain or impair body function. Aspiration of the cyst and steroid injections are typically performed first. If they fail, the cyst is excised under local, regional or even general anesthetic. Ganglionectomies are also performed for other reasons, such as the treatment of chronic pain.|$|E

Indications for video-assisted thoracic surgery (Vats) have included management of pneumothorax, (91), pleural effusion (59), lung nodules (41), mediastinal biopsy (8), need for lung biopsy (10), small endothoracic masses (6), haemothorax (4), <b>gangliectomy</b> in Raynaud syndrome (1), the removal of jugular vein catheter (1), and middle lobectomy for A-V fistula (1). Fifteen procedures were converted to thoracotomy; nine conversions were made for more extensive resection after a diagnosis of primary lung malignancy. Other reasons for conversion were adhesions (6). There was one complication (haemothorax). There were no intraoperative deaths. Mean operative time was 60 min. (median line); the median chest tube duration was three days and hospital stay five days. The video-assisted thoracic surgery procedures were safe, and for patients the advantages included less pain and earlier post-operative mobilization...|$|E
