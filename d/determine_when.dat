5|$|Airway {{management}} can {{be classified}} into closed or open techniques depending on the system of ventilation used. Tracheal intubation is a typical example of a closed technique as ventilation occurs using a closed circuit. Several open techniques exist, such as spontaneous ventilation, apnoeic ventilation or jet ventilation. Each has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> it should be used.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the complex}} began in 2002, with {{construction}} beginning in 2003. After completion in 2005, the building was awarded the LEED Gold certification for sustainability, the second city hall in the United States to earn that distinction. Environmentally friendly technologies used include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, and solar panels to generate electricity.|$|E

5|$|The massive thrust {{through the}} Allied centre was {{conducted}} by 16,000 troops of Soult's IV Corps. IV Corps' position was cloaked by dense mist during the early stage of the battle; in fact how long the mist lasted was vital to Napoleon's plan: Soult's troops would become uncovered if the mist dissipated too soon, but if it lingered too long, Napoleon {{would be unable to}} <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> the Allied troops had evacuated Pratzen Heights, preventing him from timing his attack properly.|$|E
5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the vertical height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> and where warm advection (coincident with upward vertical motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward vertical motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced vertical wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E
5|$|Contributing factors {{leading to}} this award {{included}} that during construction, 92% of construction waste was recycled, and non-wood wheat board {{was used in}} some of the walls. Additionally, 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building, with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources, funded in part by Portland General Electric and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, while the building is 42% more energy efficient than comparable buildings. Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E

5|$|The {{right to}} privacy is not {{explicitly}} identified in the U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right to abortion as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} factors {{that make it}} {{difficult}} to <b>determine</b> <b>when</b> exactly Hispanics began to serve in the Corps; one is that statistics on Hispanics were not kept by the military until the 1970s when the United States Census Bureau coined the phrase. Before then only unreliable estimates were made. For example, during World War II Hispanic Americans were estimated to comprise 2.3% to 4.7% of the Armed Forces. However, the exact number is unknown, as at the time Hispanics were integrated into the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans. Another factor is that the estimates which have been made only take into account individuals whose surname is of Hispanic origin, when there are many Hispanics with non-Hispanic surnames who have served.|$|E
