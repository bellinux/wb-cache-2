40|$|Following {{the repeal}} in 1962 of a long-standing ban on trawling, yields of {{demersal}} {{fish from the}} Firth of Clyde, southwest Scotland, increased to a maximum in 1973 and then declined until the <b>directed</b> <b>fishery</b> effectively ceased in the early 2000 s. Since then, the only landings of demersal fish from the Firth have been by-catch in the Norway lobster fishery. We analysed changes in biomass density, species diversity and length structure of the demersal fish community between 1927 and 2009 from scientific trawl surveys, and related these to the fishery harvesting rate. As yields collapsed, the community transformed from a state in which biomass was distributed across numerous species (high species evenness) and large maximum length taxa were common, to one in which 90 per cent of the biomass was vested in one species (whiting), and both large individuals and large maximum length species were rare. Species evenness recovered quickly once the <b>directed</b> <b>fishery</b> ceased, but 10 years later, the community was still deficient in large individuals.

40|$|Executive Summary Major {{findings}} for TOR 1 – Characterize the commercial catch including landings, effort and discards by gear type. Describe {{the magnitude of}} uncertainty in these sources of data. Landings were largest in the 1970 s, when catch was dominated by foreign fleets targeting longfin squid (Doryteuthis pealeii) in offshore areas. Foreign landings were completely phased out by 1987. Landings during 1988 - 2001 averaged 2, 797 mt (6. 2 million lb). From 2002 - 2012 there was no <b>directed</b> <b>fishery,</b> and landings, primarily as bycatch in the small mesh (< 4 in = 10. 2 cm) bottom trawl longfin squid fishery, have been below 900 mt (2. 0 million lb). A <b>directed</b> <b>fishery</b> was re-established in January 2013, and preliminary landings have been 1, 070 mt (2. 4 million lb) to date. Discards were estimated for the period 1989 - 2012 using the Standardized Bycatch Reporting Methodology (Wigley et al., 2007). Discards comprised {{a majority of the}} total butterfish catch, averaging 58 % during 1989 - 2001 and 67 % during 2002 - 2012.

40|$|The {{domestic}} butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) fishery off the Northeast USA {{has increased}} in importance in recent years, {{to the extent that}} the quantity allocated to foreign countries fishing within USA waters has been decreased to by-catch levels. This restriction resulted in closure of a portion of the foreign squid fishery in 1985, when the by-catch quota for butterfish was exceeded. This analysis is designed to determine co-occurrence between long-finned squid (Loligo pea/ei) and butterfish particularly in <b>directed</b> <b>fisheries</b> for each species with a view that areal, diel, and/or seasonal regulations of these fisheries may be feasible to reduce the potential adverse effects of high by-catch rates. Squid and butterfish exhibited high degrees of overlap in temperature and depth preferences as indicated by seasonal and spatial distribution data from research and fishery sources. Commer-cial fishery data, however, suggested that by-catch of butterfish in the <b>directed</b> squid <b>fishery</b> can be maintained at relatively low levels (~ 6 %), when the fishery was prosecuted offshore during the winter. The domestic USA fishery, operating with effort directed at either species at various times of the year, has not been limited as to by-catch of either species.

Increased growth of a cohort over its lifetime, increased growth in the year prior to maturation, increased mortality in adults and increased bottom temperatures all appear to exert some effect on maturation of one or both sexes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} analysis {{is the development of}} a methodological approach that would permit a more complete evaluation of the physical and economic consequences of prohibited species by-catch (PSC) losses, such as occur in the harvest of groundfish. To achieve efficient management of the several marine species involved in the groundfish and associated PSC controversy, U. S. regulatory authorities sought to obtain estimates of the probable economic and physical impacts attributable to these harvesting activities. Early efforts were based upon the assumption that all PSC losses would have accrued to <b>directed</b> <b>fisheries</b> in the year subsequent to that in which the by-caught specimen would have been legally harvestable. The present analysis hypothesizes that substantial latent economic costs, associated with foregone reproductive potential, are also attributable to PSC losses and incorrectly ignored by previous assessment methodologies. To test this assertion an alternative methodology was developed and empirically applied to the case of Pacific salmon PSCs in the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries. The empirical results demonstrate the presence of substantial latent losses associated with salmon PSC reproductive potential foregone. Although preliminary, these results confirm the presence of the hypothesized long run adverse economic impacts on <b>directed</b> salmon <b>fisheries</b> associated with a single season's PSC interception. Similar results would be expected in the case of Pacific halibut, king crab, and Tanner crab, although substantial research on the biological impacts of PSC losses on these species remains to be done.
