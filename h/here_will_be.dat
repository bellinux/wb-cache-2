Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy <b>here</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the turbine}} exit, the working fluid enters the {{condenser}} where it rejects heat, -Q, {{to the cold}} sea water. The condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle, requiring condensate pump work, W. Thus, the Anderson closed cycle is a Rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the Anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated {{more than a few}} degrees Fahrenheit. Owing to viscous effects, working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser. This pressure drop, which depends on the types of heat exchangers used, must be considered in final design calculations but is ignored here to simplify the analysis. Thus, the parasitic condensate pump work, W, computed <b>here</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included. The major additional parasitic energy requirements in the OTEC plant are the cold water pump work, W, and the warm water pump work, W.

2500|$|The Occupy Central with Love and Peace {{movement}} who {{had vowed}} to launched a massive civil obedience occupation {{at the city}} centre of Central, Hong Kong if the constitutional reform proposals did not reach the international standard of free and fair election slammed Beijing's decision as a move that stifles democracy and blocks people with different political views from running for office. [...] "Genuine universal suffrage includes both the rights to elect and to be elected," [...] its statement said. [...] "The decision of the NPC Standing Committee has deprived people with different political views {{of the right to}} run for election and be elected by imposing unreasonable restrictions, thereby perpetuating 'handpicked politics.'"

2500|$|During {{his visit}} to Chile, John Paul II {{supported}} the Vicariate of Solidarity, the Church-led pro-democracy, anti-Pinochet organisation. John Paul II visited the Vicariate of Solidarity's offices, spoke with its workers, and [...] "called upon them to continue their work, emphasizing that the Gospel consistently urges respect for human rights". While in Chile, Pope John Paul II made gestures of public support of Chile's anti-Pinochet democratic opposition. For instance, he hugged and kissed Carmen Gloria Quintana, a young student burned alive by Chilean police {{and told her that}} [...] "We must pray for peace and justice in Chile." [...] Later, he met with several opposition groups, including those that had been declared illegal by Pinochet's government. The opposition praised John Paul II for denouncing Pinochet as a [...] "dictator", for many members of Chile's opposition were persecuted for much milder statements. Bishop Carlos Camus, one of the harshest critics of Pinochet's dictatorship within the Chilean Church, praised John Paul II's stance during the papal visit: [...] "I am quite moved, because our pastor supports us totally. Never again will anyone {{be able to say that}} we are interfering in politics when we defend human dignity." [...] He added: [...] "No country the Pope has visited has remained the same after his departure. The Pope's visit is a mission, an extraordinary social catechism, and his stay <b>here</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a watershed in Chilean history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tree also pursued four Shakespeare film {{projects}} {{during his}} career at Her Majesty's. Of great historical interest is the filming, in 1899, of three brief segments from his production of King John, in which he starred and directed. [...] This is the first film record of a Shakespeare play. [...] Charles Urban filmed the opening shipwreck from the 1904 revival of The Tempest at the theatre in 1905; Tree, whose role in the production was Caliban, did not appear in this scene. Tree played Cardinal Wolsey in a 1911 studio film by William Barker of a five-scene version of Henry VIII, based on the theatre's 1910 production. Tree was paid the unprecedented sum of £1000 lest the film prove unsatisfactory, or damage ticket sales of the theatre presentation. [...] Filming took place at studios in Ealing, west London and took only one day, thanks to careful preparation beforehand. The film {{was presented to the}} public on 27 February 1911 in various theatres in London and in the provinces, and was a huge success. The Moving Picture World wrote, [...] "The picture is without doubt the greatest that has even been attempted in this country, and I am almost tempted to say in any other ... the acting passes anything ever seen in moving pictures before.... The effect on the moving picture industry <b>here</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> enormous." [...] In California in 1916, Tree played the title role in a film of Macbeth, by D. W.

Starting in 1933, the Lomaxes, father and son, traveled tens of thousands of miles, endured many hardships, exercised great patience and tact to win the confidence and friendship of hundreds of singers in order to bring to the Library of Congress records of the voices of countless interesting people they met on the way. Very much remains to be done to make our Archive truly representative of all the people, but the country owes a debt of gratitude to these two men for the excellent foundation laid for future work in this field.... The Lomaxes received much help in their expeditions from many interested folklorists, some of whom have made important contributions to the Archive as a result of independent expeditions of their own. To these the Library wishes to take this opportunity to express its deep gratitude. They include Gordon Barnes, Mary E. Barnicle, E. C.
