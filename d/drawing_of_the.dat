5|$|While Amsterdam does {{feature in}} his work, {{it does so}} {{relatively}} rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years. It does feature in his only known architectural subject, a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior of the Old Church, {{as well as in}} views of the Dam, and the Panoramic view of the Amstel looking toward Amsterdam, one of Ruisdael's last paintings.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1763 {{descriptions}} of the giant appeared in contemporary magazines. The earliest known survey {{was published in the}} Royal Magazine in September 1763. Derivative versions subsequently appeared in the October 1763 St James Chronicle, the July 1764 Gentleman's Magazine, and the 1764 edition of The Annual Register. The Gentleman's Magazine account in particular was prominent, and contained the oldest known <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> figure. In 1774, the antiquarian John Hutchins reviewed various previous accounts in his book The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset. In it, he wrote that the carving had only been done the previous century.|$|E

5|$|Confusion arose when {{an issue}} of the French daily {{newspaper}} Le Petit Journal, published on 24 July 1904 {{on the occasion of}} the bey of Tunis's visit to France, reproduced an illustration showing the flag used while was visiting the Hôtel de Ville, Paris. Ivan Sache of Flags of the World claimed that this flag design, which hadn't been seen earlier, may have been inaccurate, suggesting that the journalist might not have been at the affair or he had reproduced a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrong flag.|$|E
5|$|First, the {{assigned}} herald develops a written description based on {{consultation with the}} petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents {{must be approved by}} both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E
5|$|In the 1989 {{specifications}} {{issued to}} the Ecuadorian Military, the {{coat of arms}} has only eight colors that are used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold. There is also a nine piece instruction on how to draw the coat of arms, followed by a full color drawing and {{a black and white}} <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms. No size specifications have been laid out for the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, there were rumours about {{surviving}} mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his {{killing of a}} mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist Charles Haskins Townsend travelled in Alaska, saw Eskimos trading mammoth tusks, asked if there were still living mammoths in Alaska, and provided them with a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple dress with a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|The {{current law}} {{regulating}} {{the design and}} use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5, 2004. Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301-3 begins by describing the official <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belarusian arms and regulates on its proper design. Officially, the arms can be drawn in full colour, monochrome or using two colors. Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations on a continual basis, such as the residences of the Belarusian leader, the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels. The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government, including money, passports and official letterheads.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} {{extensively}} {{documented in the}} colonial era. Francisco Ximénez, who first revealed the K'iche' epic Popul Vuh to the world, visited Q'umarkaj in {{the final years of}} the 17th century. Miguel Rivera y Maestre wrote a report of the site for the government of Guatemala in 1834. In 1840 John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood paid a brief visit to the site after reading Rivera y Maestre's report, and Catherwood mapped the site and produced a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple of Tohil. In 1865, the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Q'umarkaj, although the maps have since been lost. A more detailed survey of the site was made by Alfred P. Maudslay in 1887, being published between 1889 and 1902. Archeological excavations were carried out in the 1950s and the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Three Witches of Macbeth have {{inspired}} several painters {{over the years}} who have sought to capture the supernatural darkness surrounding Macbeth's encounters with them. For example, by the eighteenth century, belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom. Such things {{were thought to be}} the simple stories of foreigners, farmers, and superstitious Catholics. However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular. John Runciman, {{as one of the first}} artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work, created an ink-on-paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767–68. In it, three ancient figures are shown in close consultation, their heads together and their bodies unshown. Runciman's brother created another <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witches called The Witches show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771–1772, portraying Macbeth's reaction to the power of the witches' conjured vision. Both brothers' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story.|$|E
