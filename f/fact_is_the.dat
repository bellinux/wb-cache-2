25|$|Some {{doubt this}} biographical {{interpretation}} of Nemean 7 {{since it is}} largely based on marginal comments by scholiasts and Pindaric scholiasts are often unreliable.

Some studies show association of schizophrenia with the CHRNA7 and CHRFAM7A genes, which code for alpha7 subunit of nicotinic receptors, but other studies are negative. Contrary to the predictions, nicotine receptor alpha7 subunit knockout mice do not show disruptions in PPI.|$|E
25|$|An {{isosceles}} triangle has {{two sides of}} equal length. An {{isosceles triangle}} also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to {{the two sides of}} the same length; this <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> content of the isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45–45–90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.|$|E

25|$|Thus, maximal ideals {{reflect the}} {{geometric}} properties of solution sets of polynomials, {{which is an}} initial motivation {{for the study of}} commutative rings. However, the consideration of non-maximal ideals as part of the geometric properties of a ring is useful for several reasons. For example, the minimal prime ideals (i.e., the ones not strictly containing smaller ones) correspond to the irreducible components of Spec R. For a Noetherian ring R, Spec R has only finitely many irreducible components. This is a geometric restatement of primary decomposition, according to which any ideal can be decomposed as a product of finitely many primary ideals. This <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ultimate generalization of the decomposition into prime ideals in Dedekind rings.|$|E
25|$|A {{culmination}} {{of use of}} official resources for private gain may lead to further pressures on incoming officials from other kinsmen. However, the <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> importation of modern rules on inter-ethnic political relationships is a recent colonial and western initiative that may take time to become the norm, deep allegiance to other ethnic groups for administrative decisions early on was sometimes viewed suspiciously, and an early institutionalization of a unitary system in the country, may also {{have led to a}} further familiar groupings induced corruption. Nevertheless, a modern practical approach to leadership and relationships has gradually taken a prominent role in the political process. The necessity for practical inter-depedence and cooperation is at the forefront of yearnings for good governance in the country.|$|E
25|$|For Metzinger, {{along with}} {{to some extent}} both Gleizes and Malevich, the {{classical}} vision had been an incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. It represented, quite simply, the belief that space {{is the only thing}} that separates two points. It was the belief in the geocentric reality of the observable world, unchanging and immobile. The Cubists had been delighted to discover that the world was in reality dynamic, changing in time, it appeared different depending on the point of view of the observer. And yet each one of these viewpoints were equally valid, there was no preferred reference frame, all reference frames were equal. This underlying symmetry inherent in nature, in <b>fact,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> essence of Einstein's relativity.|$|E

Throughout his teenage years, Superboy travels to the future under his own power to join the Legion in fighting threats to Earth and the United Planets, to which Earth belongs. Superboy becomes a core member of the Legion during two extended, full membership stints in the Legion, including two terms as Deputy Leader. Through the Legion, Superboy also regularly meets with his cousin Kara, Supergirl, but because of telepathic hypnotism employed by Saturn Girl, Superboy never remembers Kara, or any other information relating to his future career as Superman or the future of his family and friends, when he returns to his normal, 20th-century era.|$|E
25|$|Nothing in the {{principle}} {{of any of the}} motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made {{in the form of a}} cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} The Washington Post {{released}} their report, Julia Pierson, {{who took over}} {{as director of the}} Secret Service from Sullivan in March 2013, testified at a United States House of Representatives hearing regarding security breaches at the White House. Pierson was criticised by Committee Chairman Darrell Issa regarding several security breaches. Issa stated, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> system broke down... when Oscar Ortega-Hernandez successfully shot at the White House on November 2011." [...] Upon hearing that an agent was unwilling to doubt her superior's assertion, Representative Elijah Cummings stated to Pierson that it was [...] "very disturbing to know that Secret Service agents in the most protective agency in the world feel more comfortable... coming to members of this committee and telling things than coming to you and members in the agency." [...] Pierson acknowledged that the incident was [...] "extremely" [...] troubling. As a result of the 2011 shooting and other controversies, Pierson resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E

500|$|In a pre-release comment, {{popular culture}} expert Robert Thompson said: [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> story has {{developed}} {{in so many}} odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something {{they did not know}} before. Now we're getting into the details, which is never that thrilling." [...] The LRA researcher Craig Valters of the LSE's department of International Development said that the second video [...] "overwhelmingly" [...] failed to answer criticisms raised by the first film. On the other hand, Mike Pflanz, East Africa correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, said that the sequel was [...] "a more solid, moving and, finally, accurate presentation of the ongoing battle to capture Joseph Kony" [...] and that, in comparison to the original video, the [...] "new video is couched in nuance and deploys dialogue more commonly heard in a United Nations workshop – displacement, rehabilitation, post-conflict—than in a YouTube smash." ...|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Good Vibrations", the Beach Boys ended 1966 as {{the only}} band besides the Beatles {{to have had a}} high-charting {{psychedelic}} rock song, {{at a time when the}} genre was still in its formative stages. Writing in 2009, Barney Hoskyns deemed it to be the era's [...] "ultimate psychedelic pop record" [...] from Los Angeles. Interrante adds: [...] "Its influence on the ensuing psychedelic and progressive rock movements can’t be overstated, but its legacy as a pop hit is impressive as well." [...] Former Atlantic Records executive Phillip Rauls recalled: [...] "I was in the music business at the time, and my very first recognition of acid rock—we didn't call it progressive rock then—was, of all people, the Beach Boys and the song 'Good Vibrations' ... That [...] sent so many musicians back to the studio to create this music on acid." [...] Author Bill Martin suggested that the Beach Boys were clearing a pathway toward the development of progressive rock, writing: [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> same reasons why much progressive rock is difficult to dance to apply just as much to 'Good Vibrations' and 'A Day in the Life.'" ...|$|E
500|$|However, in 1978 Ronald Lightbown, Keeper of Metalwork at the V Museum, {{rejected}} {{this theory}} on stylistic grounds, {{considering that the}} cup must have been created only shortly before it appeared in Charles VI's inventory in 1391. He says that [...] "in 1380 figure-style was a softly undulating, flowing style, with slender elongated figures and much use of serpentine or curving folds in the drapery, and with trailing dresses ending in sinuous Gothic hem-lines"—a style {{that can be seen}} in the miniature of the coronation of CharlesVI in 1380 illustrated above. In contrast, Lightbown says [...] "the figures on the cup are broad, some might even be called stocky, with soft drapery of cylindrical form, or of smooth, tight outlines. The folds are tubular and the hems of the robes are straight with no waving, trailing outlines. The style in <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> 'Italianate' manner which developed in France as a result of contact with 'trecento' art, and not the purely Northern Gothic International manner." [...] This view was rejected in 1981 by Neil Stratford, former Keeper of Medieval and Later Antiquities at the British Museum, who pointed to a number of manuscript illuminations in a similar style that date from earlier than 1390. John Cherry, another former Keeper of the medieval collections at the British Museum, still presents the older dating in a work of 2010, and the British Museum website dates the cup to [...] "about 1370–1380".|$|E
