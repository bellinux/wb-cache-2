The RAP material was produced in the laboratory to control its properties and to reduce the effects of variability associated with these materials. Four FAM mixtures were analysed, including a virgin hot mix asphalt, a 100 %RAP, and two mixtures containing 50 % RAP in combination with virgin materials using different penetration grade virgin binders. The analysis of the deterioration properties was based on the application of a fracture model that incorporates the viscoelastic properties of the material, the quality of the adhesive bonds developed between the aggregates and the corresponding bitumen present in each mixture, and {{the rate at which the}} material dissipates energy when subjected to cycling loading. The input parameters for this model include the results obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis and surface free energy tests.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} environmental toxins {{is generally not}} uniform, with certain northern regions showing a particularly high concentration of pesticides, heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. For instance, Northern Canadians are exposed {{to high levels of}} persistent organic pollutants like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides (OCs) and methylmercury (MeHg), primarily through country foods. Previous studies have reported associations between neuronal pathology and exposure to such toxins. The present investigation assessed whether perinatal exposure (gestation and lactation) of rats to a chemical mixture (27 constituents comprised of PCBs, OCs and MeHg) based on Arctic maternal exposure profiles at concentrations near human exposure levels, would affect brain levels of several inflammatory cytokines Methods Rats were dosed during gestation and lactation and cytokine levels were measured in the brains of offspring at five months of age. Hypothalamic cytokine protein levels were measured with a suspension-based array system and differences were determined using ANOVA and post hoc statistical tests. Results The early life PCB treatment alone significantly elevated hypothalamic interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) levels in rats at five months of age to a degree comparable to that of the entire chemical mixture. Similarly, the <b>full</b> <b>mixture</b> (and to a lesser degree PCBs alone) elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 1 b, as well as the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10. The <b>full</b> <b>mixture</b> of chemicals also moderately increased (in an additive fashion) hypothalamic levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL- 12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Challenge with bacterial endotoxin at adulthood generally increased hypothalamic levels {{to such a degree that}} differences between the perinatally treated chemical groups were no longer detectable. Conclusions These data suggest that exposure at critical neurodevelopmental times to environmental chemicals at concentrations and combinations reflective of those observed in vulnerable population can have enduring consequences upon cytokines that are thought to contribute to a range of pathological states. In particular, such protracted alterations in the cytokine balance within the hypothalamus would be expected to favor marked changes in neuro-immune and hormonal communication that could have profound behavioral consequences. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{almost all}} speaker-independent (SI) speech {{recognition}} systems use CDHMM with multivariate mixture Gaussian as observation density to cover speaker variabilities.

However, acoustic HMM with more Gaussian densities is more complex and slows down recognition speed. Another efficient way to handle speaker variation is to use speaker adaptation (SA). Yet, even though speaker adaptation of full multivariate mixture Gaussian densities can increase recognition accuracy, it does not improve recognition speed. In this paper, we introduce a principal mixture speaker adaptation method which reduces HMM complexity by choosing only the principle mixtures corresponding to a particular speaker's characteristics.

40|$|Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) {{are widely}} {{prescribed}} {{for the treatment}} of depression and anxiety disorders. Consequently, these compounds are frequently identified in global waterways where they may pose a hazard to aquatic biota. Evidence demonstrates these compounds to be capable of influencing the behaviour of fish, but the relevance of many reported behavioural endpoints is unclear and the value of some findings has been questioned. Since these compounds act on neuroendocrine-mediated pathways in vertebrates, the present study explored how exposure to two representative SSRIs (fluoxetine and sertraline) and an SNRI (venlafaxine) affect circadian rhythms in fish. Male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) were exposed to 1, 10 and 100 μg/L concentrations of these compounds individually and when present as a <b>full</b> <b>mixture,</b> for a period of one week. Neither fluoxetine nor sertraline had an impact on diurnal activity patterns when fish were exposed to these compounds alone at any concentration, whereas venlafaxine significantly disrupted normal circadian rhythmicity but only at 100 μg/L. When fish were exposed to the <b>full</b> <b>mixture,</b> significantly altered diurnal activity patterns were rapidly observed at nominal concentrations of 1 and 100 μg/L, but there was no effect at 10 μg/L. This sort of non-monotonic dose relationship is not altogether unusual for fish exposed to antidepressants, but it poses a problem when attempting to evaluate potential risks to the aquatic environment. To evaluate the possibility for misinterpretation when collecting behavioural data over short temporal scales, the data for each day of the experiment was analysed separately. The outcomes demonstrate the importance of longer periods of data collection, which may be necessary to capture the full range of natural behavioural variability that exists both amongst and within individual fish. More importantly, these findings may help reveal why discrepancies are commonly being reported in the literature with regards behavioural effects in fish exposed to antidepressants. It is thus suggested that research be aimed at documenting behavioural variability in fish species used in toxicity testing, to establish guidelines for quality control and where possible inform the development of standardised methodologies so that behavioural analysis can be more appropriately applied to the broad field of aquatic toxicology.

40|$|Asphalt {{mixtures}} undergo {{chemical and}} mechanical changes with environmental weathering, most specifically due to moisture damage and oxidative aging. Degradation through weathering compromises asphalt mixture integrity {{and leads to}} early failure. It {{has been reported that}} potential for moisture damage is related to physicochemical properties of binder, aggregate, and resulting interface. Oxidative aging literature suggests that the aggregate could be a catalyst to the oxidation process and/or that the aggregate could selectively absorb softer functional groups from within the asphalt binder, resulting in an additional age-hardening effect of the asphalt mixture. This study characterized mechanical and physicochemical properties of asphalt binders and aggregates and resulting mechanical responses of corresponding asphalt mixtures subjected to moisture and aging effects. The experimental plan involved 20 binder-aggregate combinations including warm-mix asphalt technologies, neat and polymer-modified binders, and two aggregates with different mineralogies and morphologies. Experiments were conducted at various length scales: <b>full</b> <b>mixtures,</b> fine aggregate mixtures, asphalt binder, and aggregates. Additionally, this study proposes a modified microcalorimetry experiment to evaluate binder-aggregate interaction over the range of in-service temperatures and with moisture present at the interface. This study concludes that physicochemical characteristics of the binder-aggregate interface and aggregate microtextural features affect moisture damage. It was found that increasing temperature reduces binder-aggregate bond strength and that a uniform layer of moisture prevents binder-aggregate interfacial bonding. Inclusion of warm-mix asphalt additives with adhesion promoters can improve mixture performance in terms of moisture resistance, and additive dosage should be optimized. In terms of age-hardening, it was found that warm-mix asphalt can exhibit greater age-hardening in the first 3 months of laboratory aging, but longer-term aging is comparable to that of hot-mix asphalt. Additional findings conclude that aggregate type can significantly alter the age-hardening process of asphalt mixtures. Gabbro aggregate catalyzes the oxidation process of the asphalt binder, while inclusion of limestone aggregate produces increased stiffening of the asphalt mixture, possibly due to selective absorption. Based on these findings, it is recommended to pursue a deeper understanding of an interphase region formed due to binder interlocking with the aggregate surface and with diffusion of binder into the aggregate...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and validate a framework for microstructural modeling of asphalt composite materials using a coupled thermo-viscoelastic, thermo-viscoplastic, and thermo-viscodamage constitutive model. In addition, the dissertation presents methods that can be used to capture and represent the two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) microstructure of asphalt concrete. The 2 D representative volume elements (RVEs) of asphalt concrete were generated based on planar X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) images. The 2 D RVE consists of three phases: aggregate, matrix, and interfacial transmission zone (ITZ). The 3 D microstructures of stone matrix asphalt (SMA) and dense-graded asphalt (DGA) concrete were reconstructed from slices of 2 D X-ray CT images; each image consists of the matrix and aggregate phases. The matrix and ITZ were considered thermo-viscoelastic, thermo-viscoplastic, and thermo-viscodamaged materials, while the aggregate is considered to be a linear, isotropic elastic material. The 2 D RVEs were used to study the effects of variation in aggregate shape, distribution, volume fraction, ITZ strength, strain rate, and temperature on the degradation and micro-damage patterns in asphalt concrete. Moreover, the effects of loading rate, temperature, and loading type on the thermo-mechanical response of the 2 D and 3 D microstructures of asphalt concrete were investigated. Finally, the model parameters for Fine Aggregate <b>Mixture</b> (FAM) and <b>full</b> asphalt <b>mixture</b> were determined based on the analysis of repeated creep recovery tests and constant strain rate tests. These material parameters in the model were used to simulate the response of FAM and <b>full</b> asphalt <b>mixture,</b> and the results were compared with the responses of the corresponding experimental tests. The microstructural modeling presented in this dissertation provides the ability to link the microstructure properties with the macroscopic response. This modeling combines nonlinear constitutive model, finite element analysis, and the unique capabilities of X-ray CT in capturing the material microstructure. The modeling results can be used to provide guidelines for designing microstructures of asphalt concrete that can achieve the desired macroscopic behavior. Additionally, it can be helpful to perform 'virtual testing' of asphalt concrete, saving numerous resources used in conducting real experimental tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rock avalanches, debris flows, {{and related}} {{phenomena}} consist of grain-fluid mixtures that move across three-dimensional terrain. In all these phenomena {{the same basic}} forces govern motion, but differing mixture compositions, initial conditions, and boundary conditions yield varied dynamics and deposits. To predict motion of diverse grain-fluid masses from initiation to deposition, we develop a depth-averaged, three-dimensional mathematical model that accounts explicitly for solid- and fluid-phase forces and interactions. Model input consists of initial conditions, path topography, basal and internal friction angles of solid grains, viscosity of pore fluid, mixture density, and a mixture diffusivity that controls pore pressure dissipation. Because these properties are constrained by independent measurements, the model requires little or no calibration and yields readily testable predictions. In the limit of vanishing Coulomb friction due to persistent high fluid pressure the model equations describe motion of viscous floods, and {{in the limit of}} vanishing fluid stress they describe one-phase granular avalanches.
