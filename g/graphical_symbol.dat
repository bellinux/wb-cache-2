Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode. The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need. By comparison, the older [...] "×" [...] rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The <b>graphical</b> <b>symbol</b> for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).|$|E

A vectorial signature is defined to describe <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols.</b> It is formulated in terms of accumulated length and angular information computed from polygonal approximation of contours. The proposed method aims to locate and recognize <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols</b> in cluttered environments at the same time, without needing a segmentation step. The symbol signature is tolerant to rotation, scale, translation, blurring effect and illumination changes usually present when working with scenes acquired with low resolution cameras in open environments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany present {{recognition}} systems {{take advantage}} of ground-truthed datasets for training, evaluating and testing. But the creation of ground-truthed datasets is a tedious task. This paper proposes an iterative unsupervised handwritten <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols</b> learning framework {{which can be used}} for assisting such a labeling task. Initializing each stroke as a segment, we construct a relational graph between the segments where the nodes are the segments and the edges are the spatial relations between them. To extract the relevant patterns, a quantization of segments and spatial relations is implemented. Discovering <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols</b> becomes then the problem of finding the sub-graphs according to the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The discovered <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols</b> will become the new segments for the next iteration. In each iteration, the quantization of segments yields the codebook in which the user can label <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols.</b> This original method has been first applied on a dataset of simple mathematical expressions. The results reported in this work show that only 58. 2 % of the strokes have to be manually labeled...|$|R

50|$|An arrow is a <b>graphical</b> <b>symbol</b> such as ← or →, used {{to point}} or {{indicate}} direction, being in its simplest form a line segment with a triangle affixed to one end, and in more complex forms {{a representation of}} an actual arrow (e.g. ➵ U+27B5). The direction indicated by an arrow is the one {{along the length of}} the line towards the end capped by a triangle.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{of special}} key {{inscriptions}} are often changed from an abbreviation to a <b>graphical</b> <b>symbol</b> (for example caps lock becomes a hollow arrow pointing down, backspace becomes a left-pointing arrow).

40|$|Sketch-based {{interfaces}} {{are increasingly}} used for interaction with desktops or mobile devices, favouring natural interaction through {{the expression of}} commands and concepts with <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols.</b> However, developing this kind of human-oriented interfaces is still challenging, due to: the limited number and type of <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols</b> definable and recognizable in a device-independent way, the computational cost incurred for recognizing complex symbols, and the different users’ styles in tracing symbols. FcBD’s agent based architecture supports the definition and real-time recognition of sets of 2 D <b>graphical</b> <b>symbols,</b> independently of the input style. FcBD’s layered organisation favours abstraction from the concretely employed device, and proposes an approach to symbol recognition based on associating with each recognition agent disjoint sets of primary and secondary features...|$|R

He will settle in Bonn in 1918.
