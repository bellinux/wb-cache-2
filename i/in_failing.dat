5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1857, Smetana {{came home}} to Prague and found Kateřina <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> health. In June, Smetana's father František died. That autumn Smetana {{returned}} to Gothenburg, with Kateřina and their surviving daughter Žofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in Weimar. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's Faust Symphony and the symphonic poem Die Ideale, which invigorated and inspired him. Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of Gothenburg.|$|E
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} {{failure was}} produced in dogs by inducing mitral insufficiency and the cardiac muscle was examined for ultrastructural changes <b>in</b> thsese <b>failing</b> hearts after 5 - 10 months of mitral insufficiency. The left ventricular failure was established by haemodynamic measurements, chest X-ray and examination of the heart. <b>In</b> the <b>failing</b> heart, the increased number of mitochondria showed close approximation with the sarcolemmal membrane in the T-tubules {{as well as in}} the intercalated discs (ID); this is in contrast to what is seen in normal hearts, where T-tubules were mostly coupled with sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is possible that <b>in</b> the heart <b>failing</b> on account of mitral insufficiency mitochondria may be taking over the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although ID were jumbled up <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> heart, the intercellular gap and specialized membrane junctions (gap and tight junctions, desmosomes) were quite comparable to normal, indicating that intercellular communication at ID in this type of heart failure is probably maintained. Nuclear chromatin <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> heart was condensed and lined the inner nuclear membrane. Microbodies with a single limiting membrane were frequent and so were lipofuscin granules. The latter could be an end product of degenerative mitochondria. Golgi bodies <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> heart were also present in locations away from the nucleus...|$|R

5|$|As {{promised by}} Fillmore, treaty commissioners arrived in La Pointe in 1854 to {{conclude}} a final treaty. Recalling {{the experiences of}} 1837 and 1842, the Ojibwa leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854. Ambiguity in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems, so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong, whom he referred to as his adopted son. The Ojibwa insisted on a guarantee {{of the right to}} hunt, fish, and gather on all the ceded territory, and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan, northern Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota. In his mid-nineties and <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> health, Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs.

5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{a rabbit}} {{coronary}} artery ligation model {{was used to}} study the cardiac mechanical performance, Ca 2 + handling and ventricular activation/repolarisation in heart failure. Significant cardiac dilatation and contractile dysfunction were demonstrated in vivo on echocardiography 7 weeks after the initial myocardial infarct resulting from the coronary artery ligation procedure. In addition, liver, lung and heart weights were increased indicating significant organ congestion, cardiac remodelling and hypertrophy {{as seen in the}} human clinical syndrome of heart failure. Impaired mechanical performance was also demonstrated in vitro <b>in</b> the isolated <b>failing</b> hearts both <b>in</b> the working heart configuration and during Langendorff perfusion, with significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction. The Frank-Starling relationship was attenuated <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> hearts and there was also a blunted slow response to step increase in pre-load, which may partly explain the findings of the Frank-Starling relationship <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> hearts. Epicardial Ca 2 + transients measured from the isolated failing hearts were found to have a prolonged time course. Impaired relaxation was shown {{to be associated with the}} prolonged Ca 2 + transient durations <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> hearts and there was an increased variation of Ca 2 + transient durations over the left ventricular epicardial surface <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> hearts. Monophasic Action Potentials (MAPs) measured from the left ventricular epicardial surface of failing hearts also had a prolonged time course and there was also an increased variation of MAP durations. The prolonged Ca 2 + transient durations appeared to be associated with prolonged MAP durations <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> hearts. Finally, delayed ventricular activation with impaired intraventricular conduction was demonstrated <b>in</b> the <b>failing</b> hearts, which may be an additional contributory factor in the mechanical dysfunction in heart failure...|$|R

William was probably <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, {{there was a new}} chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186.

5|$|Initially {{interested}} in the ministers of the Empire, Phipps was diverted to a deeper interest in Napoleon's marshals, primarily by the difficulty of obtaining facts about them. He capitalized on the growing interest of both Britons and the French in the Napoleonic period by purchasing, as they came out, the many personal memoirs published by {{the descendants of the}} participants. Indeed, by 1920, he had acquired over 2,000 volumes, plus sundry maps and letters. That year, <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> health, he moved to the house of his son, Charles, in Carlyle Square (21), Chelsea, London. There was no room for the books at his son's house, so Phipps gave them to All Souls College, Oxford; the majority of them were placed in the Codrington Library. He selected All Souls for its established reputation in military history, and for the Codrington's collection left to it by Sir Foster Cunliffe, who had been killed in action in 1916. The collection, called the Phipps Collection, numbered more than 2,000 volumes, and includes Napoleon's published correspondence, that of the marshals, and has been kept up to date with modern works issued by the Historical Department of the French General Staff.|$|E
5|$|Keidai Saeki is a {{high school}} student with {{memories}} of his past life as Sirix Lucretius Fronto, a gladiator in Pompeii who lost his wife Serena in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

Keidai has to deal with the feelings he has for Mii and his past love for Serena. As the series progresses, Keidai meets other people who retain memories of Pompeii and discovers that Sirix's guilt <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> to save his friends is the reason why he retains his memories. When Keidai falls into a coma, he is able to relive the last moments of Pompeii where his actions put Sirix's suffering to rest, allowing him to move on with his life and confess his love to Mii.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{would still}} be {{vulnerable}} to civil lawsuits from passengers' families. Compensation awarded (or settlements reached out-of-court) during civil trials will likely vary widely among passengers based on country of the court.

Despite the announcement that Flight 370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean, it was not until 29 January 2015 that the Malaysian government officially declared Flight 370 an accident with no survivors, a move that would allow compensation claims to be made. The first lawsuit related to the disappearance was filed in October 2014–before Flight 370 was declared an accident–on behalf of two Malaysian boys whose father was a passenger, for negligence <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> to contact the aircraft soon after it was lost and for breach of contract for failing to bring the passenger to his destination.

5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E
5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery.

Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics <b>in</b> <b>failing</b> to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object.
