40|$|Abstract—By {{incorporating}} a lumped-element impedance-matching network on the laser diode carrier/submount, the signal injection efficiency of electro-absorption modulator <b>integrated</b> <b>lasers</b> is significantly improved through {{the reduction of}} input return loss. Over a frequency range spanning from 5. 8 to 10 GHz, an improvement of approximately 12 % to 37 % in signal injection efficiency is observed. To avoid increasing the component-count, a unique implementation of the lumped element impedance matching network is proposed.

40|$|The term “integration ” can {{be defined}} as the fusion of two {{separate}} entities, resulting in a new entity. <b>Integrating</b> <b>laser</b> scanning with photogrammetry allows us to compensate for the individual weaknesses of each method alone, thus providing more accurate modelling, interpretation and classification of the surroundings. Laser scanners produce data that can vary in terms of point density, field of view, amount of noise, incident angle, and distribution method. Similarly, the accuracy requirements or level of automation may also vary. Therefore, no single registration method overcomes others. The most suitable method is usually case-specific. This paper presents a short overview of current registration approaches and proposes four levels of integration: object-level integration, photogrammetry aided by laser scanning, laser scanning aided by photogrammetry, and tightly <b>integrated</b> <b>laser</b> scanning and optical images. In addition, some examples are presented of <b>integrated</b> <b>laser</b> scanning and photogrammetric data. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The signal {{injection}} efficiency of electroabsorption modulator <b>integrated</b> <b>lasers</b> (EMLs) is improved to suit 10 -Gb/s applications. For a typical EML module design with a conven-tionally designed 50 -Ω signal feeder {{to meet the}} input return loss requirement for 10 -Gb/s applications, a reduction in device capacitance of the electroabsorption modulator (EAM) section by 65 % from its typical value is necessary. By optimizing the characteristic impedance of the signal feeder, the required 65 % reduction in device capacitance of the EAM section is reduced to 45 %, which would naturally lead to enhanced extinction ratio and optical output power. With {{the addition of a}} series 5 -Ω thin-film resistor along the signal feeder, the device capacitance reduction of the EAM section is further reduced to approximately 33 % of the typical value.

In the simulation, a Johnson-Cook type material model was applied and specifically modified for very high strain rates and system temperature.
