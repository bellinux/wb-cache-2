In addition, the possibility and costs for utilizing the solid Scandinavian bedrock for intermediate storage of CO 2 is preliminarily assessed. The preliminary results indicate that an underground storage unit of 50 000 m 3 or larger would have a significantly smaller investment cost than a similarly-sized steel tank storage complex. The cost for transporting CO 2 from Finland to <b>final</b> <b>geological</b> CO 2 <b>storage</b> sites abroad is higher compared to that from the coastal regions in countries around the North Sea. However, by joint transport infrastructure projects the industry and power production around the presented regions can reach significant cost reductions for CO 2 transport. The ship transport infrastructure benefits from a model where nearby capture plants are connected by pipelines to exporting terminal hubs. Trunklines towards <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> sites are especially cost efficient in the CO 2 emission intensive regions close to the North Sea. The on-shore storage potential in western Latvia would also provide a promising opportunity for CO 2 trunklines from other Baltics and from Finland. In the heavily CO 2 emitting regions of northern Germany, the local on-shore storage accessed by trunklines from the surrounding areas would provide very competitive CO 2 transport infrastructure for the local industry and power production. The results indicate that shared CO 2 transportation infrastructure by ships would often be the best transport option from the Baltic Sea region to final storage sites at the North Sea.

This comprehensive state wide regional assessment {{is based on the}} technical (geological) suitability for <b>geological</b> <b>storage,</b> and does not consider factors such as potential interference with other resources, distance from emissions nodes or absolute storage volumes. Basins were assessed by evaluating the potential reservoir-seal intervals for their effectiveness for injection, storage and containment of CO 2. Methodologies have been developed that allow the estimation of storage capacity volumes within highly prospective reservoir-seal fairways at a regional scale. These estimates reflect conservative values that are more reliable than previous theoretical estimates, which relied upon access to pore space at the physical limit of the pore rock volume to accept fluids. Results show that the greatest potential to store the large quantities of CO 2 required to make deep cuts in Queensland’s stationary emissions is to use deep, regional reservoir-seal intervals using structural traps or migration assisted storage (MAS) mechanisms. The Bowen, Cooper, Eromanga, Galilee and Surat basins contain Paleozoic–Mesozoic age fluvial reservoirs that have either produced hydrocarbons, and/or are major aquifers, and are evaluated as having the highest prospectivity for CO 2 <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> in Queensland.

Currently, there are about 116 large stationary CO 2 point emission sources which emit 85. 57 MtCO 2 /yr totally. These stationary sources are mainly belonged to four industries: cement, power plant, iron & steel and synthetic ammonia industries. In the three kinds of <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> formations, namely, deep saline formations (DSFs), unmineable coalbeds and depleted gas fields, the total basin-scale theoretical storage capacities of CO 2 reach 24. 36 Gt, equivalent to about 285 times of the annual total CO 2 emissions in Chongqing. The DSFs have the largest potential storage capacity accounting for 98 % of the total storage capacities. The matching results between CO 2 point emission sources and candidate <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> formations show that 94. 8 % of the point emission sources (accounting for 97. 1 % of annual total emissions) can find at least one candidate <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> formation in its adjacent areas. This means that, for Chongqing, the CO 2 transport cost is likely very low. The research findings indicate that there is great potential for CO 2 <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> technology to deploy in Chongqing and for this technology to deliver profound and sustaining impacts on reducing CO 2 emissions and developing low-carbon economy in Chongqing.

Thus, in the last decade, studies characterising the behaviour of potential CO 2 deep <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> sites along with thorough safety assessments have been considered essential in order to minimise the risks associated with these sites. The study of natural analogues represents the best source of reliable information about the expected hydrogeochemical processes involved in the CO 2 storage in such deep saline aquifers. In this work, a comprehensive study of the hydrogeochemical features and processes taking place at the natural analogue of the Alicún de las Torres thermal system (Betic Cordillera) has been conducted. Thus, the main water/CO 2 /rock interaction processes occurring at the thermal system have been identified, quantified and modelled, and a principle conclusion is that the hydrogeochemical evolution of the thermal system is controlled by a global dedolomitization process triggered by gypsum dissolution. This geochemical process generates a different geochemical environment to that which would result from the exclusive dissolution of carbonates from the deep aquifer, which is generally considered as the direct result of CO 2 injection in a deep carbonate aquifer. Therefore, discounting of the dedolomitization process in any CO 2 deep <b>geological</b> <b>storage</b> may lead to erroneous conclusions. This process will also influence the porosity evolution of the CO 2 storage formation, which is a very relevant parameter when evaluating a reservoir for CO 2 storage.
