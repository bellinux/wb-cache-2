5|$|Chapman {{played the}} lead role in two Python films, Holy Grail and Life of Brian. He was chosen to play the lead in Holy Grail because of the group's respect towards his {{straight}} acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters. Chapman <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> being filmed fully nude {{in front of a}} crowd in Life of Brian, but the scene, filmed in Tunisia, caused problems with the female Muslim extras.|$|E
5|$|The creators likened {{themes of}} the episode to the Star Wars trilogy, {{referring}} to the revelations about Fox Mulder's father, and Sophie's Choice, referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken. Carter included the motif of the white buffalo after reading a news story about {{the birth of a}} white buffalo calf, feeling that the image was so potent he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> that it did not entirely fit with the Navajo beliefs used elsewhere in the episode.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the first}} Miss World contest (originally the Festival Bikini Contest), was {{organized}} by Eric Morley. When the winner, Kiki Håkansson from Sweden, was crowned in a bikini, countries with religious traditions threatened to withdraw delegates. Håkansson remains {{the first and last}} Miss World to be crowned in her bikini, a crowning that was condemned by Pope Pius XII who declared the swimsuit to be sinful. Bikinis were banned from beauty pageants around the world after the controversy. In 1949 the Los Angeles Times reported that Miss America Bebe Shopp on her visit to Paris said she did not approve the bikini for American girls, though she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> French girls wearing them. Actresses in movies like My Favorite Brunette (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of LIFE were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini.|$|E
6000|$|A spring trickles out of {{the rock}} in the gloomy {{recesses}} of the cavern, and we were thirsty. The citizens of Endor objected to our going in there. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> dirt; they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> rags; they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> vermin; they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> barbarous ignorance and savagery; they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> a reasonable degree of starvation, but they do like to be pure and holy before their god, whoever he may be, and therefore they shudder and grow almost pale {{at the idea of}} Christian lips polluting a spring whose waters must descend into their sanctified gullets. We had no wanton desire to wound even their feelings or trample upon their prejudices, but we were out of water, thus early in the day, and were burning up with thirst. It was at this time, and under these circumstances, that I framed an aphorism which has already become celebrated. I said: [...] "Necessity knows no law." [...] We went in and drank.|$|R

5|$|The next day's {{stage was}} preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a {{procession}} in Weylandt's memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took {{to the front of}} the peloton for about 15 minutes, and the remaining Leopard Trek squad, along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining Leopard Trek squad all decided to leave the race. Feillu did not want to leave the Giro, feeling that continuing to race would have been the best way to honor Weylandt, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> acquiescing to his teammates' will. For most of them, the decision was based on a desire to attend Weylandt's funeral, which took place nine days after his death. Members of the Giro squad served as pallbearers. Other teammates, as well as Farrar, members of Weylandt's former team , and Giro director Angelo Zomegnan were all in attendance, along with hundreds of cycling fans assembled outside the chapel.|$|E

25|$|The next evening, Zack is {{preparing}} to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, {{that was supposed to}} have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.|$|E

25|$|During the {{de facto}} reign of Johann Friedrich Struensee between 1770 and 1772 {{the power of the}} nobility in Denmark and Norway was challenged. Whilst he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> {{creating}} himself and his friend Brandt feudal counts, Struensee was an enemy of the hereditary aristocracy, which he sought to replace with a merit-based system of government. A part of his reforms Struensee abolished noble privileges and decided that state employments should be based on a person's qualifications only.|$|E
25|$|According to Gesta Danorum (book 7), by Saxo Grammaticus, Hring {{was the son}} of the Danish king Randver and the {{maternal}} nephew of the Danish king Harald Wartooth. His father Ingjald had raped the sister of Harald, but the latter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> in order preserve the friendship with Ingjald. Ring fought with Harald Wartooth in the Battle of the Brávellir and became the king of Denmark as well. Saxo then describes the different subkings and their adventures. In book 9, he returns to Sigurd Hring as Siward, surnamed Hring, the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.|$|E
25|$|There was anxiety {{at first}} that the viewing public would not accept a new soap set {{in the south of}} England, though {{research}} commissioned by lead figures in the BBC revealed that southerners would accept a northern soap, northerners would accept a southern soap and those from the Midlands, as Julia Smith herself pointed out, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> where it was set {{as long as it was}} somewhere else. This was the beginning of a close and continuing association between EastEnders and audience research, which, though commonplace today, was something of a revolution in practice.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the years}} this became almost a {{mandatory}} exercise {{and although it}} may seem to many to be a gross act of indecency, it was generally well received by the sometimes up to hundreds of tourists and locals. The Kai Tais or Beanie Boys, as the trans women were referred to by Anglophone white visitors, certainly <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> either. By the mid-70s Singapore started a crackdown on this type of lewd behaviour and sailors were arrested at gunpoint by the local authorities for upholding the tradition. By this time those sailors brave enough to try it were dealt with severely and even shipped home in disgrace. Though many locals accepted this part of Singaporean culture, many conservative Singaporeans {{felt that it was}} a disgrace and it defaced Singapore's image.|$|E
25|$|Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo later {{asked the}} POC to reconsider their decision, {{requesting}} instead that popular Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao {{be given the}} honor of carrying the flag. Pacquiao was not a competitor at the games, but had recently won the World Boxing Council lightweight title in a highly publicized fight against David Diaz. POC president Jose Cojuangco agreed with the president's decision, saying having Pacquiao as flag bearer would be a morale booster to the athletes. Though the deadline for changing of the national contingent's composition in the Olympiad has already elapsed, special arrangements were made for Pacquiao to be given accreditation. On July 9, 2008, POC announced that everything had been cleared for Pacquiao to be official flag bearer. Miguel Molina, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> yielding the honor to Pacquiao, was instead given the role of flag bearer at the closing ceremony.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} to use Torp as an air station dwindled during the 1950s. Norway {{did not need}} the station for regular stationing of aircraft, and the United States did not need {{it as long as}} Norway did not allow permanent stationing of foreign troops. In October 1956, the military stated that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> if Torp also inaugurated a civilian sector. The municipalities established committee, and on 2 October 1957 the Ministry of Transport and Communications granted permission to establish a municipal civilian sector at Torp. At the time, Jarlsberg was still being used for scheduled services to Vestfold, and the plans to open Torp as a civilian airport met political resistance from Tønsberg. The civilian sector would cost NOK900,000, including a terminal building, a control tower, small maintenance facilities and a tarmac. A limited company, Andelslaget Torp flyplass, was established on 24 October 1958. In addition to the municipalities of Stokke and Sandar, several local companies and private individuals bought shares. The company changed its name to AS Torp Flyplass in 1959.|$|E

25|$|By {{design the}} trireme {{was meant for}} day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} to stay at sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> the extra business, but those in charge of the fleet and/or mission had {{to be careful not to}} completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E
25|$|Trotsky led the Soviet {{delegation}} {{during the}} peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918. At {{that time the}} Soviet government was split on the issue. Left Communists, led by Nikolai Bukharin, continued {{to believe that there}} could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist country and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace. They cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary Red Army against Polish forces of Gen. Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki in Belarus, White forces in the Don region, and newly independent Ukrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used. They <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> holding talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped−for Soviet revolution in the West, but they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany in order to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.|$|E
25|$|As an NBC affiliate, WCKT/WSVN aired a local {{newscast}} {{in place}} of programs that NBC had aired at noon on weekdays. It also occasionally preempted network shows that aired during the 10 or 11 a.m. timeslot (but ran {{at least one of}} these hours) and preempted an occasional primetime program. While NBC was traditionally far less tolerant of program preemptions than the other major broadcast networks, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> this at first provided that the network was able to get Miami area independent stations to air whatever programs that WSVN chose not to air. In addition, NBC programs that were not broadcast by WSVN were cleared by WPTV, whose signal provides city-grade coverage of Fort Lauderdale and was available on nearly every cable provider in the area. However, in the early 1980s, WPTV was removed from some Miami area cable systems to make room for new channels due to limited headend channel capacity. Largely due to those preemptions, WCKT/WSVN was one of NBC's weaker affiliates. Though NBC continued to arrange for independent stations to air network programs that were not shown on WSVN, the network grew increasingly annoyed at having to resort to such an arrangement in what had grown into a major market. NBC eventually decided that it needed to acquire its own station in the growing South Florida market.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
500|$|In other words, Bellman was a [...] "tavern rhymester", admittedly with a {{wonderful}} gift of improvisation, who wildly ignored the rules of literary genres. For example, within the classical tradition odes and satires {{were supposed to have}} different metres and different use of language. Kellgren <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>mind</b> the amoral attitude: [...] "indeed he shared it".
