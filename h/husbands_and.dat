5|$|In Heian-era Japan, <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives kept {{separate}} households; {{children were}} raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because {{she lived in}} her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E

5|$|From the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 CE) {{until the}} modern period (1840–1919), {{scholars}} and rulers developed a male-dominated patriarchal society in China. Confucianism {{was at the}} root of the development of the patriarchal society in China, and emphasized the distinctions between the sexes and the roles they have within the family. These ideologies continued through the Tang dynasty (618-907), and girls were taught from a very young age to be submissive to their fathers, then to their <b>husbands,</b> <b>and</b> later to their sons. During the Song Dynasty (960-1297), Confucian scholars further developed the patriarchal tradition with more restrictions for females, including foot binding for girls at a very young age.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} with their <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the writers}} who most enchanted Hańska was the French novelist Honoré de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac {{published}} Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829. A tale of star-crossed love amidst a royalist uprising in Brittany, {{it was the first}} work to which he signed his own name. Hańska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> celebrates the virtue of married women.|$|E
5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, <b>husbands,</b> <b>and</b> brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than black male suffrage.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in <b>Husbands</b> <b>and</b> Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes foreshadow developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E

5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church and}} state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. <b>Husbands</b> <b>and</b> fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of the husband also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of the husband as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

5|$|Marriages {{were often}} {{the subject of}} careful negotiations, {{particularly}} higher in society. Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period. Women managed the household and might work beside their <b>husbands</b> <b>and,</b> although obedience to husbands was stressed, {{this may have been}} limited in practice. Divorce developed after the Reformation and was available for a wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in England. Because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state, and some women acquired independence and status, but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common. The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted. Burial inside the church was discouraged. As a result separate aisles for the rich and graveyards with stone markers for the majority became common.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1846, Brunner began {{what became}} his longest and most arduous expedition. He planned {{to follow the}} Buller River to the sea and then trek down the West Coast {{as far south as}} Milford Sound. During his {{previous}} expedition, he had been told of the existence of a route through the Southern Alps by the Māori at the Arahura River. He hoped to discover this route and use it to cross the Southern Alps and reach Canterbury. He was accompanied once again by Kehu, who brought along his wife. Another Māori, Pitewate, a friend of Kehu's, also joined the venture, accompanied by his wife. Brunner provided clothing and shoes for his companions. The wives proved problematic during the journey as they quarrelled, sometimes supported by their <b>husbands,</b> <b>and</b> Brunner would have to mediate.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

5|$|The sexual {{freedoms of}} Liao also stood in stark {{contrast}} {{from those of the}} Han Chinese. Women from the upper Liao classes, like those of the Han Chinese upper classes, had arranged marriages, in some cases for political purposes. However women from the lower classes of the Liao did not have arranged marriages, and would attract suitors by singing and dancing in the streets. The songs served as self-advertisements, with the women telling of their beauty, familial status, and domestic skills. Virginity was not a requirement for marriage among the Liao, and many Liao women were sexually promiscuous before marriage, which stood in sharp contrast from the beliefs of the Han Chinese. Khitan women had the right to divorce their <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> were able to remarry after being divorced.|$|E
5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
5|$|The subject came {{up again}} in 1930, during the Conference on Codification of International Law, held in The Hague. A strong {{contingent}} of women from America joined international women's groups to change the existing nationality laws, but the women were unable to agree on wording. Intense lobbying by women, and a massive parade demonstration, failed to influence the conferees, and the international law continued to hold that a woman's nationality followed her husband's. In response, Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year. Six {{of the most influential}} international women's groups sought a broad base of support from working women. Macmillan's stated goal was to delay ratification of the Hague Convention, and to make certain that a woman's nationality would not change without her consent, and that the nationality of a couple's children would not be more influenced by the father's nationality. The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem, but when the League constituted a study group, that group was split between two intractable factions. On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality, based on that of the husband, {{and on the other side}} were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses, with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their <b>husbands,</b> <b>and</b> children to be allowed dual citizenship. In 1932, the women's group, at an impasse, were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations, who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention. The women's group disbanded, and the Hague convention was ratified in 1937.|$|E
