40|$|A list of 100 books {{recommended}} <b>for</b> <b>kindergarten</b> <b>use</b> {{were reviewed}} and evaluated for elements of sexism and sex role-. stereotyping. Each book was carefully scanned and notations made on survey sheets. The story was checked {{to see if}} it was a boy or girl centered story, had an adult-male or adult female character, male or female animal or inanimate object, and whether males and females were presented in stereotyped roles (females in aprons and in the house, males outside in traditional roles). Theillustrations were very carefully scanned to see if there were more sales, more feiales, or equal representation. The books were also evaluated to see if females or sales were presented in unusual roles and whether the book gave equal treatment to both sexes and could be classified as truly nonsexist. A second collection of 25 selections from several children's book clubs were also evaluated in the same way. Th...|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, the {{coverage}} of kindergarten education has improved dramatically in recent times, although many kindergartens are located in buildings that were not originally designed for that purpose. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) {{is considered to be}} one of the most important factors affecting the physical development of children. Hence, it is essential to evaluate the indoor conditions of those kindergartens which are based in buildings that have been refurbished and adapted from their original purpose. It is posited that such refurbished environments provide sub-optimal IEQ <b>for</b> <b>kindergarten</b> <b>use,</b> which is reflected in user perception and satisfaction. This study presents the results of the IEQ investigations conducted in refurbished kindergarten buildings in Malaysia with the focus on identifying occupants' satisfaction with the various IEQ factors. The researchers aim to utilize the results of this work to develop a benchmark for analogous studies. 240 refurbished kindergarten buildings in Malaysia were studied to evaluate occupants' perceptions and levels of satisfaction. The results indicate that the occupants found Air Movement, Ventilation, and Freshness to be of a poor quality due to the high occupancy density. Noise was the least satisfactory IEQ factor due to the closeness of the kindergartens to main roads (external noise), as well as the small size of classrooms (internal noise). It was found that Colour and Attractiveness are the most important IEQ factors from the occupants' viewpoint. This study provides a practical benchmark for the conversion of buildings' usage.

In 1938 the Ouzounian National School (Ուզունեան Ազգային Վարժարան) was added to it, after the donation of successful businessman Dickran Ouzounian (1870-1957); subsequently, the school operated under the name Melikian-Ouzounian National School (Մելիգեան-Ուզունեան Ազգային Վարժարան).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 44 - 46) Even with {{a dramatic}} increase in class size, fewer students attending preschool, and a higher academic achievement demand in Kindergarten, Kindergarten teachers are still expected to have all their students master the state standards. One of the easiest and most efficient ways to ensure that this mastery is met is {{through the use of a}} peer tutoring program. The peer tutoring program provides students with the opportunity to teach, model, practice, and learn with constant support from a peer thereby scaffolding an increase in understanding and skill level. 	The goal of this graduate project is to address the lack of a Kindergarten peer tutoring program using a peer tutoring teacher guide. This guide, FUNdamentals First: A Guide <b>for</b> <b>Kindergarten</b> Teachers <b>using</b> Peer Tutoring in the Classroom! provides teachers with step-by-step directions on how to start, train, monitor, and assess a peer tutoring program with their own Kindergarten students. Resources are also available for teachers to use during tutoring sessions.

Vygotsky 2 ̆ 7 s sociocultural theory, which states that a child 2 ̆ 7 s environment, culture, and language are related to academic and social development, was the theoretical framework for this study. Many ECE centers have been rated using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS). Additionally, some children in those centers have been rated <b>for</b> <b>kindergarten</b> readiness <b>using</b> the Florida <b>Kindergarten</b> Readiness Screener (FLKRS) developed by the Florida Department of Education (FLDOE). The sample included 55 ECE centers that had an ECERS rating with students who had FLKRS scores. This study addressed whether FLKRS scores were positively correlated with ECERS ratings. Data were analyzed using the Pearson product moment correlation. Results indicated a positive and significant correlation between ECERS ratings and FLKRS scores. A white paper was prepared to raise awareness regarding the availability of quality ECE centers to young learners. Implications for social change include an increased number of quality ECE programs in local neighborhoods as well as increased awareness of the importance of an environmental rating scale to monitor program quality...|$|R

A presentation {{on a study}} {{of whether or not}} the e-quiz platform “i-Fun” motivates kindergarteners to read and helps develop their reading ability; and (2). A hands-on session on trying out “i-Fun”. “i-Fun” is an online e-quiz platform covering about 60 children stories (available print or online) <b>for</b> <b>kindergarten</b> students currently <b>used</b> by eleven <b>kindergartens</b> in Hong Kong. The aims of the study are to identify whether or not “i-Fun” overall helps students improve their read ability or reading habits, whether or not students and parents enjoy using “i-Fun,” and which parts of “i-Fun” in particular help or hinder their use or enjoyment. This pilot study surveyed and interviewed the top performing participants from three <b>kindergartens</b> (those who <b>used</b> “i-Fun actively and scored well in answering the questions). The participants included two teachers, ten students and ten parents from each school, with a total of 30 student-parent pairs and six teachers.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of an action {{research}} project designed to model a district-wide early identification and intervention program for Kindergartners at risk for reading failure. The project was designed to model quality professional development in the area of early literacy <b>for</b> <b>Kindergarten</b> teachers, the <b>use</b> of a multi-gating procedure for identifying those children most likely to benefit from extra support, training for paraprofessionals to provide support to identified low performing students, and the use of a “response to intervention” approach for determining level of intensity of intervention. This study evaluates the relative effectiveness of the two research-validated curricula chosen as strategic interventions for improving outcomes on early literacy indicators of at-risk Kindergarten students. Both curricula were delivered in small groups by classroom aides who received brief training. A second part of the study evaluates the effectiveness of individually designed, intensified interventions for those children whose achievement did not improve sufficiently under conditions of small group instruction. A third section examined factors affecting teacher motivation to participate in the project and to embrace new teaching and assessment methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstraction Work is {{focuses on}} {{dramatic}} education more precisely {{on one of}} its forms called a Forum theatre. The first chapter is dedicated to its history, its founder Augusto Boal and to a story concerning {{the creation of the}} Forum theatre. Another point treated here is who and what is needed to establish such a Theatre i. e. good actors, socially and men-tally balanced group and an elaborated scenario. Second chapter describes the dramatic education in general then passes to de-tailed dramatic education in kindergartens. Which methods and techniques are the most appropriate <b>for</b> <b>kindergartens,</b> how to <b>use</b> them while working with preschool children, what is the correlation between a dramatic education and free and dramatic play and to what extent is desired their participation in kindergartens. The whole chapter is focused on dramatic education as such. The third chapter deals with a mental and social maturity of a child. Maturity in both segments is very important precondition for performing the Forum theatre. Mental and social maturity is for each child individual but the anticipated age where the child should be able to reflect answers of Joker and to understand the plot on the stage of the Theatre forum is around five years. Five years is the lowest age level. In the practical part is issued a qualitative [...] ...|$|R
