50|$|The {{provisions}} of the <b>habendum</b> <b>clause</b> must agree with those stated in the granting clause. For example, if the grantor conveys a time share interest or an interest less than fee simple absolute, the <b>habendum</b> <b>clause</b> would specify the owner's rights {{as well as how}} those rights are limited (a specific time frame or certain prohibited activities, for instance). Many states, such as Pennsylvania, require a deed to have a <b>habendum</b> <b>clause</b> in order for the deed to be officially recorded and recognized by the Recorder of Deeds.|$|E

Put differently, the habendum deals with the relationship between the possessor and the land—how the land is to be had—while the tenendum deals with the relationship between the possessor and his immediately superior lord—how the land is to be held.
