Problems often arise in the building associated with {{the condition of the}} land, namely the decrease in building foundations. Based on existing problems, hence the research study came to utilize bamboo raft foundation on clay media. Methodology conducted in this research starts from sample preparation, testing of soil and bamboo characteristics, bamboo assembly, testing of flexural strength split bamboo raft with clay media and then analyze the data obtained in the laboratory tests. From the test results, it concluded that bamboo rafts, if the soil is being loaded then it will induce vertical deformation. For subgrade on unidirectional bamboo raft were able to <b>hold</b> <b>load</b> of 62 000 N, with stress which happen in bearing is 0. 992 N/mm 2, whereas stress that happened on bamboo 0. 150 N/mm 2 with a deformation 35. 26 mm. For subgrade on cross directional bamboo raft were able to <b>hold</b> <b>load</b> of 86 000 N, with stress which happen is bearing 1. 3760 N/mm 2, whereas stress that happened on bamboo is 0. 2079 N/mm 2 with deformation of 45. 26 mm subgrade.

40|$|Nanoindentation is {{a widely}} used method for {{determining}} mechanical properties, such as hardness, and elastic modulus. Nevertheless, {{in the case of}} viscous materials, the time dependent response of the material generates a bulge on the unloading curve that leads to incorrect values of the contact stiffness and thus of the mechanical properties. This paper presents methods developed on two viscoplastic materials (indium and indium-tin eutectic) to measure the elastic modulus and the creep exponent. To fix the bulge problem, we propose to realise cyclic indentations in order to obtain unloading and reloading curves. Results show that the lower parts of these two curves are similar because creep behaviour becomes negligible. Thus, the values of the modulus calculated from the initial slope of the reloading curve are constant and in good agreement with the values obtained from standard tensile tests. Furthermore, a method has been developed to measure the creep exponent. It consists of measuring the contact pressure {{as a function of the}} strain rate during <b>hold</b> <b>load</b> plateaux. Experiments show that the average value of the creep exponent (3. 7 for the indium-tin eutectic and 7. 6 for indium) does not depend on the loading conditions and are in good agreement with values obtained from tensile and torsion tests (3. 7 and 7. 6 respectively) ...|$|E

Finite element analysis has suggested that spherical indentation is indeed Hertzian for visco-elastic materials. Direct observations of the contact area of visco-elastic materials under load were made simultaneously with depth measurements by indenting transparent polymers at a macro-scale. This novel approach suggested that for some polymers spherical indentation can be non-Hertzian. It appears that the ramp load times as well as surface properties contribute to the non-Hertzian contact. Consequently, moduli obtained from nanoindentation tests may not always be directly comparable to moduli obtained from tensile tests.

40|$|Single-crystal {{germanium}} is a {{semiconductor material}} which shows complicated phase transformation under high pressure. In this study, new {{insight into the}} phase transformation of diamond-cubic germanium (dc-Ge) was attempted by controlled cyclic nanoindentation combined with Raman spectroscopic analysis. Phase transformation from dc-Ge to rhombohedral phase (r 8 -Ge) was experimentally confirmed for both single and cyclic nanoindentation under high loading/unloading rates. However, compared to single indentation, double cyclic indentation with a low <b>holding</b> <b>load</b> between the cycles caused more frequent phase transformation events. Double cyclic indentation caused more stress in Ge than single indentation and increased the possibility of phase transformation. With increase in the <b>holding</b> <b>load,</b> the number of phase transformation events decreased and finally became less than that under single indentation. This phenomenon was possibly caused by defect nucleation and shear accumulation during the holding process, which were promoted by a high <b>holding</b> <b>load.</b> The defect nucleation suppressed the phase transformation from dc-Ge to r 8 -Ge, and shear accumulation led to another phase transformation pathway, respectively. A high <b>holding</b> <b>load</b> promoted these two phenomena, and thus decreased the possibility of phase transformation from dc-Ge to r 8 -Ge...|$|R

30|$|To {{understand}} the time-dependent plastic deformation (creep) of the indium film and wire, a hold time of 10 s kept at a peak load of 100 μN. Indium wire crept significantly during <b>hold</b> <b>load</b> than indium film. It {{can be seen}} from Fig. 2 a that the displacement was also creeping during the hold time, even though no strain burst had taken place. The inset of the Fig. 2 shows the ln(strain rate) vs ln(stress) plot for the nanowires sample. The stress exponent obtained for the nanowires sample was 5.5 calculated from the slope of the curve. According to Feng et al. [35], the creep behaviour of indium is distinctively different from other metals. For example in aluminium, pop-in is a pre-requisite for an indentation creep. However, for indium, creep can happen before or after pop-in. The stress exponent before and after the pop-in was also remarkably different—it changes from ~ 1.5 before pop-in ~ 6 after pop-in. Lucas and Oliver [36] have reported the value of stress exponent was 5 – 7 for indium films after pop-in. The value of ~ 1.5 before displacement burst is rather low compared with the usual range expected for dislocation creep, which is 3 – 8. They have concluded that before strain burst, it was diffusional creep, and after displacement burst, it was dislocation creep. Diffusional creep can happen at the test temperature because room temperature is 0.7 Tm for indium. Our results on stress exponent are also matching with the reported values. From the above analysis, it is understood that the onset of dislocation creep phenomena occurs in indium nano/microwire kind of structures at much lower loads (30 – 40 μN) compared to bulk/thin indium films (80 – 120 μN). This could be attributed to the better crystalline quality and low dislocation density of the indium wire kind of structures.|$|E

40|$|Depth-sensing nanoindentation {{was used}} to trace the {{transition}} from elasticity to plasticity in single crystal Ni 3 Al. We found, as others have reported, that the incipient plasticity occurs spontaneously on increasing the load over a narrow load range. However, when the load is held at a value smaller than the spontaneous excursion value, excursion will also occur, albeit after a certain holding time. The holding time {{is found to be}} longer at lower <b>holding</b> <b>loads.</b> The magnitude of the displacement excursion is also found to increase with the <b>holding</b> <b>load.</b> After the excursion, all the tests showed similar elastoplastic deformation behavior in the load-displacement plot. A passive layer following electropolishing was found to be responsible for the pre-excursion plasticity observed in some samples. This passive layer, however, has no significant effect on the critical load for incipient plasticity. A model based on the homogeneous nucleation of a dislocation loop was proposed to explain the observations. The time-delay effect of the pop-in is thought to be due to the slow growth of an initially stable dislocation loop at the most highly stressed point under the indenter to an unstable loop by absorption of vacancies from the matrix. © 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Dwell {{sensitivity}} in {{titanium alloys}} is generally {{attributed to the}} phenomenon of load shedding, which is a time dependent redistribution of stress from weak grains, with their c-axis perpendicular to the loading direction, to strong grains, with their c-axis approximately parallel to the loading direction. This leads {{to the formation of}} internal quasi-cleavage facets on the basal planes of strong grains. In this paper, the effect of <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> on the fatigue behaviour of drawn Ti- 6 Al- 4 V wires is investigated, because these wires do not contain strong α grains. It has been found that this leads to a different dwell fatigue behaviour compared to what has been described in literature. In the case of drawn wires, introducing <b>load</b> <b>holds</b> promoted crack initiation at the surface, through the formation of a facet on a prismatic plane of a surface grain that was oriented for very easy prismatic slip. This was confirmed by sectioning facets, using focused ion beam milling, and electron backscatter diffraction measurements. Because of the specific crystallographic texture of drawn wires, the phenomenon of load shedding is less pronounced, and there is no formation of internal facets. The amount of cycles to failure was reduced by two to three orders of magnitude compared to fatigue tests without <b>load</b> <b>holds.</b> The time to failure remained similar, and was even higher for some dwell fatigue tests. There was a significant amount of strain accumulation during dwell fatigue tests.
