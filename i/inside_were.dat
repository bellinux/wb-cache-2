The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators <b>inside</b> <b>were</b> replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
5|$|The last fort to be {{built in}} Malta was Fort Campbell, which was built near Mellieħa between late 1937 and 1938. The design of the fort is {{completely}} different from the earlier fortifications in Malta as it was designed to counter the new threat of aerial bombardment. It had an irregular plan and its perimeter was guarded by machine gun posts and a few rifle loopholes. The buildings <b>inside</b> <b>were</b> scattered so as not to create a concentration of buildings. The fort still exists, although it is largely in ruins.|$|E

5|$|In December 1831 Yagan and {{his father}} led the first {{significant}} Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's family group. A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began {{to break through the}} mud-brick walls. <b>Inside</b> <b>were</b> Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees {{to be part of the}} settlers' groups. Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law. Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Prometheus was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a Fazioli piano. The ship's garage {{was built on the}} backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles <b>inside</b> <b>were</b> built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the {{interior of}} a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.|$|E

At least 1,900 communities were left without power as high winds knocked down numerous power lines. A total of 14 {{people were killed in}} China in direct relation to Wipha. One man was electrocuted and died after stepping into floodwaters with live power lines submerged in the water. A landslide triggered by the heavy rains killed five people. At least 11million people were affected by the storm in Fujian and Zhejiang. Once floodwaters receded, a car was found turned over, the five passengers <b>inside</b> <b>were</b> declared dead on scene. Damages in China amounted to ¥7.45billion ($1billion USD).|$|E

5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that the militants must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered the labyrinth of the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants <b>inside</b> <b>were</b> armed with guns and rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and explosion-proof vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of the militants detonated a suicide jacket, killing everyone in the room.. It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E

In 1418, the future Charles VII passed through Azay-le-Rideau as he fled from Burgundian occupied Paris to the loyal Armagnac stronghold of Bourges. Angered by the insults of the Burgundian troops occupying the town, the dauphin ordered his own army to storm the castle. The 350 soldiers <b>inside</b> <b>were</b> all executed and the castle itself burnt to the ground.
