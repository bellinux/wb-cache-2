For this purpose, serumsamples were collected from native pure-bred Kangal (n = 11), and Akbash dogs (n = 17) and Turkish Greyhounds (n= 15) in Eskisehir and Konya provinces. None ofthe dogs were previously vaccinated against CAV types. Indirect ELISA detected 88. 2 %, 93. 3 % and 100 % prevalences in Akbash, Greyhound and Kangal dogs, respectively.

The two viruses were found to be composed of soluble components similar to, and carrying biological activities corresponding to, those of the human adenoviruses after fractionation by rate zonal centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography. The following soluble components were identified: hexons (carrying a common group-specific complement-fixing antigen), penton oligomers (complete soluble hemagglutinin), and penton and fiber monomers (incomplete soluble hemagglutinins). The latter were indicated by hemagglutination enhancement with selected antisera directed against human adenovirus soluble components. Elution characteristics of corresponding components of the two viruses in anion-exchange chromatography experiments were distinctly different.

40|$|Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) is an {{important}} pathogen that causes respiratory diseases and reproductive failure in various avian species. The disease was first reported in South Africa in the late 1970 s. Later, the disease has been reported from all countries around the world, except for Australia, and has caused economic losses in poultry industry worldwide due to the transient drop in eggs and meat production. In 1998 there was an outbreak in Sweden but due to good biosecurity and effective vaccine control program the disease has been under control since then. In South America the industry of egg-laying hens struggles with many respiratory diseases, such as aMPV, <b>Infectious</b> bronchitis, <b>Laryngotracheitis</b> and Newcastle disease. This study is a field project on the Avian metapnuemovirus and {{took place in the}} state of São Paulo, Brazil. The study contributed to a bigger research project at the University of Sao Paulo under the department of Preventive Veterinary and Animal Health where the veterinarians are trying to control the problems with respiratory diseases in Brazilian poultry production. The scope {{of this study was to}} detect aMPV in egg-laying hens with respiratory disease and reproductive failure and further sequence the viral RNA and compare it to previously found viral strains. This information is important to obtain accurate vaccination-programs for control of the virus. Organ-samples and blood-samples were collected from five different farms in Bastos, a town in the state of São Paulo with extensive egg-production. Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed to detect RNA of aMPV in the organs of the sampled birds. One out of 66 pools of samples was positive. The sequencing of the RNA was unsuccessful and no phylogenetic tree comparing this strain to other known viral strains of aMPV could be designed. The blood-samples were tested with two types of ELISAs, one indirect ELISA and one blocking ELISA, for antibodies against aMPV. Antibodies could be detected in 85 % of the birds with the SVANOVIR-kit; and in 87 % of the birds using the IDEXX-kit. A majority of the birds had antibody-titers corresponding to previous infection. At the farm where the PCR-positive sample was collected, the birds had not seroconverted in spite of reported vaccination against aMPV one month earlier. The result of this study is consistent with previous conclusions from other studies; that RNA of aMPV is difficult to detect and that vaccine prevention of the disease is sometimes unsuccessful...|$|R

The avian <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus is phylogenetically distant from these two viruses and serves to underline similarity and diversity within the Alphaherpesvirinae.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{attenuated}} vaccine, live virus or bacteria {{with very}} low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce {{and continue to}} present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian <b>infectious</b> <b>laryngotracheitis</b> virus http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf, avian metapneumovirus http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.15_TURKEY_RHINO.pdf) ...|$|E

Recently, full genome sequences of wild-type and vaccine strains have been analysed, but none was from Europe. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine and analyse the complete genome sequences of five Italian ILTV strains. Sequences were also compared to reveal the similarity of strains across time and to discriminate between wild-type and vaccine strains. METHODS Genomes of 3 ILTV field isolates from outbreaks occurred in Italy in 1980, 2007 and 2011, and 2 commercial chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccines were sequenced using the 454 Life Sciences technology.

The virus itself is classified as an alpha herpesvirus (Gallid herpesvirus 1), with a genome approximately 150, 000 nucleotides in length (49). By using next-generation sequencing (Illumina) technology we have sequenced two field isolates of ILTV. The first isolate (1874 C 5) is a 2005 field isolate from Georgia. The second isolate (632) is a 1985 Delaware field isolate. The sequences of these two isolates were compared to show how similar the strains remain across time and geographical location. The results of sequencing for the 1874 C 5 strain yielded a total of 6, 122, 687 ILTV bases that aligned to the published reference sequence (49).
