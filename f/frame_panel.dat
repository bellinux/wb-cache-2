This improved constitutive equation, which is a consistent formulation of column global bending, is applicable to a complete class of frameworks including the ideal shear <b>frame</b> <b>panel,</b> for which the beams are assumed to be rigid, and the associated column system, for which the rigidity of beams is negligible. Global buckling and second-order effects of the frame structure are discussed. The main results can be extended to other types of lateral stiffening elements as built-up columns. A worked example is presented in order to compare the main results with those obtained by the classic matrix method. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The Light Steel Framing {{building}} technology {{was introduced in}} Brazil in the late 1990 s {{for the construction of}} residential houses. Because the design system was imported from the United States and is optimised to work well in that temperate climate, some modi fi cations must be made to adapt it for the Brazilian climate. The objective of this paper was {{to assess the impact of}} thermal bridging across enclosure elements on the thermal performance of buildings designed with Light Steel Framing in Brazil. The numerical simulation program EnergyPlus and a speci fi c method that considered the effects of metallic structures in the hourly simulations were used for the analysis. Two air-conditioned commercial buildings were used as case studies. The peak thermal load increased approximately 10 % when an interior metal frame was included in the numerical simulations compared to non-metallic structures. Even when a metal <b>frame</b> <b>panel</b> was used only for vertical elements in the facade of a building with a conventional concrete structure, the simulations showed a 5 % increase in annual energy use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Viral {{contamination}} of surfaces {{is thought to}} be important in transmission. Chemical disinfection can be an effective means of intervention, but {{little is known about the}} virucidal efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) against enteric and respiratory viruses. Aim: To measure the virucidal efficacy of HPV against respiratory and enteric viruses on materials representing those found in institutions and homes. Methods: Poliovirus, human norovirus genogroup II. 4 (GII. 4), murine norovirus 1, rotavirus, adenovirus and influenza A (H 1 N 1) virus dried on to stainless steel, <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> and gauze carriers were exposed to HPV 127 ppm for 1 h at room temperature in an isolator. Poliovirus was also exposed to HPV at different locations in a room. The virucidal effect was measured by comparing recoverable viral titres against unexposed controls. Polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the effect of HPV on viral genome reduction. Findings: HPV disinfection resulted in complete inactivation of all viruses tested, characterized by > 4 log(10) reduction in infectious particles for poliovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus and murine norovirus on stainless steel and <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> carriers, and > 2 log(10) reduction for influenza A virus on stainless steel and <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> carriers, and for all viruses on gauze carriers. Complete inactivation of poliovirus was demonstrated at several locations in the room. Reductions in viral genomes were minimal on <b>framing</b> <b>panel</b> and gauze carriers but significant on stainless steel carriers; human norovirus GII. 4 genome was most resistant to HPV treatment. Conclusion: HPV could be an effective virucidal against enteric and respiratory viruses contaminating in-house environments. (C) 2011 The Healthcare Infection Society...|$|R

40|$|Windows are {{important}} part of a building’s history; they tell us {{not only of the}} changing architectural taste and style but also of social hierarchy, building economics, craft ingenuity and technical advances, and {{of the ways in which}} houses and certain building materials were taxed. They are the single element which most serves to establish the character of a building and a whole district. The traditional Turkish house had partitioned glass windows rather than large one-piece types. Windows composed of small square glass partitions are the characteristic types of windows in traditional Turkish homes. This is a convenient architectural style both for privacy and external perspective related concerns. In Turkish architecture, due to the indispensability of timber frame construction, specific dimensions had to be used depending on the structure of the material utilized. The first floor had block stone walls and floors above were of timber <b>frame</b> <b>panel</b> walls. The narrow, vertical spaces between the posts and braces constitute the timber skeletal system, and covered with filler. Thus, a modular plan of construction is established for window organization and for the overall façade of the structure.

40|$|With the aim {{to reduce}} the number of the unskilled foreign labor, {{government}} had encouraged our local contractor to use the Industrialized Building System (IBS). They are few type of IBS system in Malaysia and this included precast concrete <b>frame,</b> <b>panel</b> and box systems, steel formwork systems, steel frame systems, prefabricated timber systems and block work systems. But at the same time, when a building was built by the IBS system, the building also needed a system of technique maintenance of the building to prolong the building life. Hence, this paper will focus on the maintenance management system use for the building built by IBS. The objective of this paper is to identify building maintenance problems in IBS, to explain the development of maintenance management system for IBS. As such, the building need to be identified before the research start. The defect and the problem face by the owner of the IBS building will be collect and note down in a check list. This will be done by questionnaire and distributed to all Malaysia’s government IBS’s building management office. Interview session and site visit also will be done with the contractor and the building owner to understand the problem that facing by the IBS building that has been chosen.

5000|$|Frames. In the U.S. {{solid wood}} <b>frame</b> and <b>panel</b> construction, using either {{mortise and tenon}} or cope and stick jointed frames, is traditional, with maple, cherry, oak, birch, and hickory among the most {{commonly}} used species. Mortise-and-tenon frames, with their greater strength and permanence, are more costly to produce and less commonly used as compared to cope-and-stick frames. As an alternative, miter joint frames, which may be identifiable by face-surface relief that follows continuously around the frame, have become popular. Miter-jointed frames typically employ embedded metal fasteners to secure frames elements (stiles and rails) cut at a 45° angle. Captured within <b>frames,</b> <b>panels</b> may be either solid or veneered engineered wood (either particle board or medium density fiberboard). Laminates, including those designed to resemble hardwood, can typically be identified by a more rounded appearance associated with the minimum bending radii necessarily entailed by the manufacturing process of applying laminate to an underlying substrate. By comparison, solid surfaces, and solid hardwoods in particular, can be milled with more sharply defined corners, edges, or grooves on either a <b>panel</b> or <b>frame.</b>|$|R
