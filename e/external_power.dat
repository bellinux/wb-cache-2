5|$|It was mid-September before {{news of the}} {{declaration}} of independence spread to the outer islands, and many Indonesians far from the capital Jakarta did not believe it. As the news spread, most Indonesians came to regard themselves as pro-Republican, and a mood of revolution swept across the country. <b>External</b> <b>power</b> had shifted; it would be weeks before Allied Forces entered Indonesia, and the Dutch were too weakened by World War II. The Japanese, on the other hand, were required by the terms of the surrender to both lay down their arms and maintain order; a contradiction that some resolved by handing weapons to Japanese-trained Indonesians.|$|E

5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an <b>external</b> <b>power</b> supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the three key failures by the leading <b>external</b> <b>powers</b> {{in their efforts}} in 1992 - 1995 to manage the crisis in Bosnia and impose a settlement.

These powers successively failed to prevent {{the outbreak of the}} fighting, then to properly contain it, and finally to achieve a stable and enduring settlement when the chance presented itself in 1995. The thesis concludes that the failures stemmed from incorrect assessments, a lack of political will, and organizational shortcomings. Because of these failures, the Bosnian conflict remains unsettled, and the current stalemate hinges on continuing political-military commitments by the <b>external</b> <b>powers.</b> NANARomanian Ministry of National Defense author...|$|R
