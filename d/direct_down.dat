50|$|BVI {{occurs when}} a rotor blade passes within a close {{proximity}} of the shed tip vortices from a previous blade. This causes a rapid, impulsive change in the loading on the blade resulting in the generation of highly directional impulsive loading noise.

In general, advancing side BVI noise is <b>directed</b> <b>down</b> and forward while retreating-side BVIs cause noise that is <b>directed</b> <b>down</b> and rearward. It has been shown that the main parameters governing the strength of a BVI are the distance between the blade and the vortex, the vortex strength {{at the time of the}} interaction, and how parallel or oblique the interaction is (Hardin 1987, Malovrh 2005).|$|R

50|$|Boundary throw-in - the {{boundary}} throw-in was reintroduced to the game. Under the new rules, {{the boundary}} umpire would {{throw the ball}} back into play to a neutral ruck contest after the ball went out of bounds, unless: the field umpire deemed that the ball had been forced out deliberately; or, if the ball went out of bounds from a kick-in after a behind without another player touching it - in which cases a free kick would be awarded. Players contesting boundary throw-ins were made to initially stand apart {{from each other and}} were not permitted to interfere with each other. Re-introducing the boundary throw-in was a return to a set of rules which had prevailed prior to 1925. Since 1925, ANFC rules had dictated that a free kick be awarded against the last team to play the ball before it went out of bounds under any circumstances; the VFL had voted in favour of the change, but it had quickly come to be unpopular among players and spectators, and Victoria had since unsuccessfully agitated for it to be repealed. Since the ANFC rules never gained wide popularity in Victoria, many were glad to see a return to the old rules. The change opened the wings and flanks up to more play: under the ANFC rules, play had in general been much more <b>direct</b> <b>down</b> the centre of the field to avoid the risk of turning over possession by putting the ball out of bounds, but the return of the boundary throw-in lowered the risk of playing down the boundary lines. It also simplified the umpire's job, as he no longer needed to determine which player was the last to play the ball before it went out of bounds, which was often difficult if the ball was being contested at the time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: – In a {{world of}} fast {{evolving}} standards in wireless communication systems it is desirable to build flexible radio front–ends {{that have to be}} reconfigured rather then redesigned if a standard is changing or a new standard is introduced. This is the driving idea behind software defined radio (SDR). SDR systems today usually employ several parallel ADC sampling channels for <b>direct</b> <b>down</b> conversion to be able to process various radio channels at once (see e. g. [1]). Although greatly benefiting from the use of dedicated ASICs and FPGAs these systems are still very complex. An alternative approach to such architectures is offered by using a single (or at most dual) ADC <b>direct</b> <b>down</b> conversion system exploiting nonuniform sampling instead of uniform sampling. This enables alias–free signal processing in a frequency range determined by the systems time quantum. We briefly explain the motivation behind nonuniform sampling in our introduction. The challenge when sampling radio signals nonuniformly lies in the generation of precise, predictable (i. e. pseudo random) sampling instances. These instances have to be produced with picosecond precision like required in uniform undersampling applications mentioned above. Deliberate nonuniform sampling requires a sampling driver (SD) conveniently implemented in FPGAs. The FPGA has to be clocked by a low jitter clock generator (exposing 3 ps RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter or less). Such clock sources are not available for all frequency ranges and are often very expensive. Therefore it is inevitable to use a delay locked loop (DLL) or phase locked loo...|$|E

However, streams based in more resistant sandstone flysch and/or influenced by small debris­flows indicated much less dependence between these parameters. Significant differences in bankfull widths were found when channels of the same watershed areas, but located on leeward and windward hillslopes were compared...|$|E

40|$|In this work, an {{improved}} {{method of obtaining}} high image suppressions in receivers using integrated <b>direct</b> <b>down</b> converters is presented. The considerations {{are based on a}} receiver structure that is developed for the simultaneous down conversion of up to four neighbouring carriers in UMTS base stations.

These requirements are not fulfilled by the analogue part and hence, an error estimation and compensation in the digital domain is done. In ADS simulations, the functionality of the method could be proved. In preliminary measurements, the image suppression was increased by more than 30 dB.
