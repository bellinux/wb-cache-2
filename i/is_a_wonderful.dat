5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E

All the ministers {{and many of the}} members have helped in the building of this SRF Lake Shrine. That is the secret. We must work for God and commune with Him. I believe that America <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> country in which to try out brotherhood colonies, wherein mankind can learn that the first principle of life is happiness.|$|E

25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E
25|$|The {{general rule}} {{that in every}} country {{designers}} use much the same means whereby a pattern is obtained holds good in China. There are forms of band decoration here which closely resemble those of Gothic Europe, and a chair from Turkestan (3rd century) might almost be Elizabethan, so like are the details. Screens of grill form, often found in the historically Islamic countries, are common, and the deeply grounded, closely arranged patterns of Bombay also have their counterparts. The imperial dais in the Chien-Ching Hall, Pekin, is a masterpiece of intricate design. The back consists of one central panel of considerable height, with two of lesser degree on either side luxuriously carved. The whole is crowned with a very heavy crest of dragons and scroll work; the throne also <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> example of carved treatment, and the doors of a cabinet {{in the same building}} show how rich an effect of foliage can be produced without the employment of stalk or scroll. One might almost say, he wastes his talent on such an ungrateful material as wood. In this material fans and other trifles are carved with a delicacy that courts disaster.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{the birthplace}} of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very {{important}} school of design was promoted by Raphael, whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. The shutters of Raphaels Stanze in the Vatican, and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a picture frame with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so much alike is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord.|$|E

500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the love triangle was [...] "very important" [...] to Weingartner, who was once part of such a relationship.

Peter loves Jule – he doesn't own her. He can tell that when she {{falls in love with}} Jan, their love <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> thing, coloured by a joint rebellion – a shared rejection of social constraint." ...|$|E
