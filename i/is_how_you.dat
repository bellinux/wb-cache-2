Kelly Bryant of OK! magazine called the advertisement [...] "sexy". In an in-depth {{review of the}} commercial, Caitlin Morton from MTV heavily praised Beyoncé's look, style, movements and poses for the camera and concluded, [...] "THAT ... <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> sell a perfume". Maeve Keirans writing for the same publication wrote the clip was [...] "heavy on the glitter and hair-flips" [...] and added, [...] "We would've bought Rise anyway, but now [...] we're definitely going to buy it." [...] Carl Williott from the website Idolator interpreted Beyoncé's character in the video as a [...] "gold dust woman imploring you to embrace the elements and rise".

500|$|In 1931 RKO Pictures offered Olivier a two-film {{contract}} at $1,000 a week; {{he discussed}} the possibility with Coward, who, irked, told Olivier [...] "You've no artistic integrity, that's your trouble; this <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> cheapen yourself." [...] He accepted {{and moved to}} Hollywood, despite some misgivings. His first film was the drama Friends and Lovers, in a supporting role, before RKO loaned him to Fox Studios for his first film lead, a British journalist in a Russia under martial law in The Yellow Passport, alongside Elissa Landi and Lionel Barrymore. The cultural historian Jeffrey Richards describes Olivier's look as an attempt by Fox Studios to produce a likeness of Ronald Colman, and Colman's moustache, voice and manner are [...] "perfectly reproduced". Olivier returned to RKO to complete his contract with the 1932 drama Westward Passage, which was a commercial failure. Olivier's initial foray into American films had not provided the breakthrough he hoped for; disillusioned with Hollywood, he returned to London, where he appeared in two British films, Perfect Understanding with Gloria Swanson and No Funny Business—in which Esmond also appeared. He was tempted back to Hollywood in 1933 to appear opposite Greta Garbo in Queen Christina, but was replaced {{after two weeks of}} filming {{because of a lack of}} chemistry between the two.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{commonly}} reported {{statement that the}} action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. [...] Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to [...] "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to [...] "create {{the illusion of a}} continuous camera move." [...] Once the team was able to create a [...] "seamless blend", they would {{move on to the next}} shot. [...] These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. [...] The coffee shop scene was composed of [...] "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in [...] "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene [...] "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. [...] In an interview with Variety, Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the [...] "single-shot" [...] action sequences: [...] "Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} for IGN, Matt Fowler {{wrote of the}} episode, [...] ""Book of the Stranger" [...] handed us two very lovely, {{satisfying}} moments with the Stark/Snow reunion at Castle Black (and the subsequent vow to defeat Ramsay and rescue Rickon) and Daenerys's conquering of Vaes Dothrak. Both were huge, forward-moving story elements that harkened back to Season 1 and gave viewers something to root for and grab onto as the show itself heads into its final arcs." [...] Fowler also noted, [...] "As a reader of the books with no more books to read, Season 6 {{has been a very}} interesting experience," [...] giving the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the scenes at Castle Black and in Vaes Dothrak, writing [...] "Game of Thrones lived up to its billing as A Song of Ice and Fire on Sunday, as there was plenty of action in both of the signature halves of the story." [...] Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Now that <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> set the table. [...] "Book Of The Stranger" [...] doesn't just check off plot points. In fact, there aren't a lot of plot points to check off. It's an episode of introductions, reunions, and wall-to-wall scheming," [...] giving the episode an A. Eliana Dockterman of Time wrote about the strong female storylines in the episode, stating [...] "The creators of Game of Thrones have been touting the sixth season of the show as the year when women finally wreak vengeance. The fourth episode, [...] "Book of the Stranger," [...] suggests that they will hold true to their word." ...|$|E
