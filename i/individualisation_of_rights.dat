40|$|Existing {{political}} economy models of pensions focus on age and productivity. In this paper we incorporate two additional individual characteristics: sex and marital status. We ignore {{the role of}} age, by assuming that people vote {{at the start of}} their life, and characterize the preferred rate of taxation that finances a Beveridgean pension scheme when individuals differ in wage, sex and marital status. We allow for two types of couples: one-breadwinner and two-breadwinner couples. Marriage pools both wage and longevity differences between men and women. Hence singles tend to have more extreme preferred tax rates than couples. We show that the majority voting outcome depends on the relative number of one-breadwinner couples and on the size <b>of</b> derived pension <b>rights.</b> Social security Majority voting Derived <b>rights</b> <b>Individualisation</b> <b>of</b> pension <b>rights...</b>|$|R

It analyses the micro-dynamics <b>of</b> the Forest <b>Rights</b> Act using three dimensions: individual tenure rights, citizenship, and conflict to discuss the contested nature <b>of</b> household-level tenure <b>rights</b> to forest land. The arguments are based on data collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews from six Bhil tribal villages in Banswara district, Rajasthan. The findings indicate that the forest tenure reform promoted the <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> forest <b>right</b> claims – thereby increasing Bhil tribal inter-household-level conflicts – and that households' forest land tenure claims relate primarily to the formal recognition <b>of</b> their citizenship <b>rights.</b> The paper suggests {{that one of the}} priorities for a way forward is to work towards harmonising the government's own contradictory policies, and avoid competition between line departments...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{importance}} of water, when given a choice, households in the Nyagatare area tend to settle {{on the top of}} hills, some distance from water points, rather than occupying the lower levels closer to the water. This is because although the differences in height are not great (usually not more than meters or tens of meters), and the hills and lowlands largely share the same agricultural characteristics, the lower-lying areas close to water have commonly been prone to malaria and livestock diseases. Those households that have settled close to water are often relative latecomers to the District, and have been forced to settle in former common land areas. Such common land areas were previously located around water points, but are now disappearing due to the <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> and increased overall pressure on the land. The water points themselves remain communal, with access open to all, but the land surrounding them is, thus, increasingly being privatised.|$|R
40|$|MASTER OF SCIENCE IN RANGE MANAGEMENT (ECONOMICS OPTION), 2004 The East African {{governments have}} {{initiated}} land reform programmes {{with the objective}} <b>of</b> creating <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> where rules <b>of</b> access, use and transfer are reformulated in order to adapt to rising population densities, land scarcity and agricultural commercialisation. This study assessed the effects of land tenure on land use and food security in Loitokitok Division, Kajiado District, Kenya. Purposive sampling {{was carried out by}} grouping locations within Loitokitok Division into two: those practising transhumance and the ones practising agropastoralism. Transhumance refers to seasonal movement with livestock for pastures and water while leaving the bulk of the households in permanent settlements. Agropastoralism refers to mixed farming in permanent settlements but sometimes includes transhumance. One location was randomly selected from each of the groupings and systematic sampling was carried out. Samples of 35 transhumant and agropastoral households respectively were then selected for the administration of a questionnaire. Also, village elders, chiefs and extension officers were interviewed, and more data were collected from annual reports and previous research studies. Data were analysed using both descriptives and regressions. Stratification of households showed that land tenure had influence on pastoral household size, herd size, milk yield, income from milk, total income, employment and remittance. In addition, agropastoral households were more food secure with a food poverty incidence of 0. 2 while that of transhumant households was 0. 6. The linear regression model showed that household size, diversification, total income, gender and land tenure had influence on both transhumant and agropastoral household food security at 5 per cent level of significance. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the government and other stakeholders create awareness on issues of land tenure by gradually introducing the concept <b>of</b> <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> in pastoral areas. Also, for improved income in these areas, there is need to increase the livelihood sources through micro industries such as milk processing plants, and hides and skins. This will provide job <opportunities and ready markets for their products. Further, family planning programmes should be provided to ensure household dependency ratio is reduced.

40|$|The Swedish Joint Facilities {{create a}} common {{resource}} system for externalities {{of the individual}} property, such as common roads, bridges, residential services (waste disposal, car park, community places), irrigation and drainage schemes, and hunting ground. In a historical perspective, such facilities belonged to the village community, and remained as externalities when the society forced an internalisation into individual plots. The <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> property <b>rights</b> could not include such common resource systems. Today, the society demands a well-defined number of appropriators of common facilities. The Swedish Joint Facilities Act operates efficiently with the landowners as legal appropriators. The Governmental Cadastral Officer creates an association as legal owner of the joint facilities, and hands it over to their own management. Only landowners with positive total outcome of cost and benefits are included, defined by the cadastral officer. The individual expectation value might occasionally reach negative values, but the cadastral officer estimates the general {{market value of the}} benefits of facility for each property. The estimation is done only once – when the joint facility is created. A study of 9 aged associations in Southern Sweden has shown that the concept of benefit an...|$|R

General rules for calculating {{pensions}} and {{the incidence of}} work behaviour and wage levels on the benefit? level are described. Entitlements aimed at mitigating gender inequalities caused by child care and work behaviour are presented, {{as well as the}} main provisions of survivor? pensions. Although pension systems are based in the three countries on pay-as-you-go models in the Bismarkian tradition and contain some Beveridge components, a precise understanding of the systems is helpful to understand the role played by the gaps inherited from the labour market and by pension systems in explaining the gender gap in old age benefits level.

40|$|Substantial {{theoretical}} and policy {{debate in the}} early 1990 s led to an excessive focus on de-collectivisation and <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> land <b>rights</b> through privatisation across the former communist bloc. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine “individualised” production systems more closely in order to understand better how certain specific organisational approaches to production differ with respect to a set of indicators of technical efficiency. In this paper we provide quantitative analysis of these new types of farming units and provide a rationale for a deeper exploration into the nature of these groups. Overall we find that the total factor productivity of small groups formed on familial and social ties is higher than that of individual farms, given the uncertain rural environment in Kyrgyzstan and the resource constraints facing landholders at this point in time. The explanation for this hinges primarily on understanding the assetpooling, risk-sharing and labour specialisation functions of groups. In-depth qualitative fieldwork performed in conjunction with this study confirms these explanations (see Sabates-Wheeler 2004). As transition agriculture continues to adapt to land reform choices that were made ten years ago, a major policy question facing the Kyrgyz government must be, what kind of agrarian structure should be facilitated in order to promote agricultural growth? Despite the push for de-collectivisation there remains a place for encouraging group farming, on grounds of both poverty alleviation and agricultural growth.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} social and legal change among the Kuria people of Tanzania. It {{examines}} {{the transformation of the}} Kuria ideas and practices concerning marriage, children and property rights. The study covers a period following the colonial rule in Tanzania beginning about the turn of this century to the present. The aim of the study is to show the relationship between the integration of the Kuria economy into a world economic system and the transformation of extant social relations. Although we recognise that social change is an unceasing process in any society, this study argues that forces associated with capitalist penetration accelerated this process. Thus, for example, the authority and power of the elders who had for many generations dominated the Kuria society was undermined. There was radical transformation of kinship and property relations and elders were no longer influential in matters relating to production. There was progressive <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> property <b>rights</b> as sUbsistence production was transformed to serve the needs of the capitalist sector. The role of the law and state is also discussed. We argue that both the colonial and the post-colonial states were instrumental in this process of change even if some of their policies appear to have been aimed at conserving certain forms of traditional relations. Within this context of change the responses of the Kuria people to economic change is examined. The study argues that rather than being passive objects of capitalist penetration the Kuria tried to influence events even though their options were highly circumscribed. For the elders change represented an opportunity to utilise their traditional positions to secure resources from the non-traditional economic sector while for the younger generation and the women, change· opened up the means for them to extricate themselves from relations of subordination...|$|R

40|$|The push {{towards the}} <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> funding for support {{services}} {{for people with}} disability has been seen by many governments and disability rights advocacy groups as the obvious next step in recognition <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> for people with disability. Such individualisation, however, may be indicative of neoliberal changes to popular conceptions {{of the welfare state}} in general. This thesis explores different groups' understanding of, and reasons for supporting, such policies. Such an exploration is based on a view that such support would necessitate a different understanding of the social model of disability, which has formed the basis for the disability rights movements and disability support service provision. Respondents from government agencies and disability advocacy groups, as well as people with disability, were interviewed. An analysis of the discursive elements they employed in discussing their views of the policy was then undertaken, aimed at uncovering contemporary understandings of the social model of disability and the issues surrounding <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> funding. Through such an analysis, {{it was found that the}} majority of respondents presented a mixed understanding of the issues explored, albeit one that leans to side of social-democatic principles and social responsibility.

The aim of this qualitative study is to explore the relationship between the public and the private in social media {{on the internet}}, specifically with emphasis on the identities which are shaped in this relationship.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com??? Copyright Springer [Full text {{of this paper is}} not available in the UHRA]In this paper, I present an informational approach to the nature of personal identity. In "Plato and the problem of the chariot", I use Plato's famous metaphor of the chariot to introduce a specific problem regarding the nature of the self as an informational multiagent system: what keeps the self together as a whole and coherent unity? In "Egology and its two branches" and "Egology as synchronic individualisation", I outline two branches of the theory of the self: one concerning the <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> the self as an entity, the other concerning the identification of such entity. I argue that both presuppose an informational approach, defend the view that the <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> the self is logically prior to its identification, and suggest that such individualisation can be provided in informational terms. Hence, in "A reconciling hypothesis: the three membranes model", I offer an informational <b>individualisation</b> <b>of</b> the self, based on a tripartite model, which can help {{to solve the problem of}} the chariot. Once this model of the self is outlined, in "ICTs as technologies of the self" I use it to show how ICTs may be interpreted as technologies of the self. In "The logic of realisation", I introduce the concept of "realization" (Aristotle's anagnorisis) and support the rather Spinozian view according to which, from the perspective of informational structural realism, selves are the final stage in the development of informational structures. The final "Conclusion: from the egology to the ecology of the self" briefly concludes the article with a reference to the purposeful shaping of the self, in a shift from egology to ecology...|$|R
