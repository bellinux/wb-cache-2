25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No <b>Doubt.</b> <b>I</b> have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's <b>doubt.</b> <b>I</b> just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... I stood the whole time, holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the whole time, & I kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|E

500|$|Specter {{was up for}} {{re-election}} to the Senate in 2010, and expressed his plans to run again. On March 18, 2009, Specter {{said that he was}} not considering running as an independent. He said, [...] "To eliminate any <b>doubt,</b> <b>I</b> am a Republican, and I am running for reelection in 2010 as a Republican on the Republican ticket." [...] Subsequently, Specter's 2004 conservative GOP primary challenger, Pat Toomey, announced he would again run for the Republican nomination in the Republican senatorial primary.|$|E
500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I hope that I can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{arraignment}} {{was spent}} on Durkin's disclosure of his connections with Hastert. Durkin contributed $500 in 2002 and $1000 in 2004 to the Hastert for Congress campaign; the contributions were made while Durkin was a partner {{at the law firm}} Mayer Brown, before he was appointed to the federal bench in 2012, and Hastert's son Ethan is a partner at Mayer Brown. At the arraignment, Durkin stated he had never met Hastert and that [...] "I have no <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> can be impartial in this matter," [...] but also said that [...] "I am not naive enough to think that a reasonable person would not question my impartiality" [...] and gave the parties time to decide whether to object and thus trigger the reassignment of the case to a different judge. On June 11, federal prosecutors and Hastert's lawyers filed notices waiving any objection to Durkin presiding over the case.|$|E

500|$|A hadith records that, {{when the}} second Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (580–644) came to kiss the stone, he said {{in front of all}} assembled: [...] "No <b>doubt,</b> <b>I</b> know that you are a stone and can neither harm anyone nor benefit anyone. Had I not seen Allah's Messenger [...] kissing you, I would not have kissed you." [...] However, in the hadith {{collection}} Kanz al-Ummal, it is recorded that Ali responded to Umar, saying, [...] "This stone (Hajar Aswad) can indeed benefit and harm. ... Allah says in Quran that he created human beings from the progeny of Adam and made them witness over themselves and asked them, 'Am I not your creator?' Upon this, all of them confirmed it. Thus Allah wrote this confirmation. And this stone has a pair of eyes, ears and a tongue and it opened its mouth upon the order of Allah, who put that confirmation in it and ordered to witness it to all those worshippers who come for Hajj." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{same month}} as the March poll, {{an article in}} The Hill quoted Specter as stating he was {{considering}} leaving the Republican party to run for re-election as an Independent candidate. Specter later denied the validity of those claims, announcing on March 18, [...] "To eliminate any <b>doubt,</b> <b>I</b> am a Republican, and I am running for reelection in 2010 as a Republican on the Republican ticket." [...] However, on April 28, 2009, Specter announced he was leaving the Republican Party and becoming a Democrat because he disagreed with the increasingly conservative direction the Republican Party was heading in and found his personal philosophy was now better aligned with the Democrats. Although Specter said that he primarily based his decision on principle, he also admitted it was partially due to his poor chances at winning the Republican primary: [...] "I have traveled the state and surveyed the sentiments of the Republican Party in Pennsylvania and public opinion polls, observed other public opinion polls and {{have found that the}} prospects for winning a Republican primary are bleak." ...|$|E
500|$|Ponsford {{broke into}} {{international}} cricket in the 1924–25 season. After scoring 166 for Victoria against South Australia, and 81 for an Australian XI against the touring English team, {{he was selected}} for the first Test against England at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Batting at number three, Ponsford joined his captain Herbie Collins at the wicket after the dismissal of opening batsman Warren Bardsley. Although Ponsford initially struggled against the [...] "baffling" [...] swing bowling of Maurice Tate, the experienced Collins was confident enough to farm the strike during Tate's initial spell [...] and Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on his Test debut. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] until I was settled in. I <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] He scored 128 in the second Test at Melbourne; thereby becoming the first batsman to score centuries {{in his first two}} Tests. Ponsford played in all five Tests of the series, scoring 468runs at an average of 46.80.|$|E

500|$|The next {{international}} {{visitors to}} Australia were the English team of 1924–1925, under the captaincy of Arthur Gilligan. In the First Test at Sydney, Collins opened the batting and scored 114. Batting {{with a young}} Victorian in his début Test, Bill Ponsford, Collins was confident enough to shelter him from the brilliant swing bowling of Maurice Tate. Ponsford went on to make a century (110) on début. Ponsford later said [...] "I was most grateful for Herbie taking [...] until I was settled in. I <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> would have scored a century but for his selfless approach." [...] In the Second Test at Melbourne, chasing 600, the English pair of Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day for an unbroken partnership of 283. Before play commenced the next day, Collins said to his profligate leg spinner, [...] "You're going straight on to get Hobbs if we're to have a chance". The first ball of the day, Mailey bowled a full toss. Collins moved the field, leaving {{a gap in the}} offside field. The next ball was another full toss and Hobbs, looking to hit it into the gap, missed it all ends up and was bowled for 154.|$|E
500|$|In Chapter 1 Hitchens {{describes}} abandoning {{religion in}} his youth, and promoting [...] "cruel revolutionary rubbish" [...] as a Trotskyist activist. He claims his generation had become intellectually aloof from religion, rebellious and disillusioned and in Chapter 2 explores further {{reasons for this}} disillusion, including the Suez Crisis and the Profumo Affair. In Chapter 3, Hitchens recounts how he embraced scientific inquiry and adopted liberal positions {{on issues such as}} marriage, abortion, homosexuality, and patriotism. Chapter 4 is a lament for the [...] "noble austerity" [...] of his childhood in Britain. Chapter 5 explores what Hitchens views as the pseudo-religion surrounding Churchill and World War II heroes – a [...] "great cult of noble, patriotic death" [...] whose only equivalent, he claims, was in the Soviet Union. Hitchens then asserts that, [...] "The Christian Church has been powerfully damaged by letting itself be confused with love of country and the making of great wars". In Chapter 6 Hitchens recalls being a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union and a trip to Mogadishu, and how these experiences convinced him that, [...] "his own civilisation was infinitely precious and utterly vulnerable". In Chapter 7 Hitchens charts his return to Christianity, and makes particular reference to the experience of seeing the Rogier van der Weyden painting The Last Judgement: [...] "I gaped, my mouth actually hanging open. These people did not appear remote or from the ancient past; they were my own generation ... I had absolutely no <b>doubt</b> <b>I</b> was among the damned". In Chapter 8 Hitchens examines the diminishing of Christianity in Britain and its potential causes.|$|E
