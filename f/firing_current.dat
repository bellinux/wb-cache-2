5000|$|Commercial {{electric}} match manufacturers often specify 3 key {{parameters of}} an electric match: the resistance (often around 2 Ohm), a recommended <b>firing</b> <b>current</b> (often around 1 A), and a maximum no-fire current. The [...] "test" [...] button on a firing systems typically tests a setup by sending a current limited to well below the no-fire current (often 0.2 A) to detect common problems (short circuits and disconnected open circuits).|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{detonator}} {{was invented}} in the 1940s {{as part of the}} Manhattan project to develop nuclear weapons. The design goal was to produce a detonator which acted very rapidly and predictably. Both Match and Solid Pack type electric caps take a few milliseconds to fire, as the bridgewire heats up and heats the explosive to the point of detonation. Explosive bridgewire or EBW detonators use a higher voltage electric charge and a very thin bridgewire, [...]04 inch long, [...]0016 diameter, (1 mm long, 0.04 mm diameter). Instead of heating up the explosive, the EBW detonator wire is heated so quickly by the high <b>firing</b> <b>current</b> that the wire actually vaporizes and explodes due to electric resistance heating. That electrical driven explosion then fires the detonator's initiator explosive (usually PETN).|$|E
5000|$|The mortar {{could be}} fired {{in one of}} two ways: either {{electrically}} or manually (by the pull of a lanyard). And each method had its own type of detonator (electrical or friction). Electrical firing required first that the crew attach a wire to the electrical detonator, which protruded from the breech block. Second, the crew had to connect the firing cable coming out of the pit floor to the carriage of the individual mortar, out in the pit. Third, the circuit switch (usually located {{on the wall of the}} pit near the data booth) leading to the individual mortar had to be thrown into the closed (firing) position. Finally, the firing magneto, which was mounted on a special [...] "shoe", often on the wall of the pit near the data booth, had to be cranked up and then released, sending the <b>firing</b> <b>current</b> out to the pit. Depending on the switch settings, the mortars in a given pit could be fired one at a time or all together. Lanyard firing had fewer fail-safe features, and was accomplished by a crewman who stood well behind the breech and pulled smartly on the lanyard to fire the individual mortar.|$|E

50|$|Intracellularly, the {{electrodes}} directly record {{the firing of}} action, resting and postsynaptic potentials. When a neuron <b>fires,</b> <b>current</b> flows in and out through excitable regions in the axons and cell body of the neuron. This creates potential fields around the neuron. An electrode near a neuron can detect these extracellular potential fields, creating a spike.|$|R
40|$|Homeostatic {{synaptic}} scaling {{is a form}} of {{synaptic plasticity}} that adjusts the strength of all of a neuron's excitatory synapses up or down to stabilize <b>firing.</b> <b>Current</b> evidence suggests that neurons detect changes in their own firing rates through a set of calcium-dependent sensors that then regulate receptor trafficking to increase or decrease the accumulation of glutamate receptors at synaptic sites. Additional mechanisms may allow local or network-wide changes in activity to be sensed through parallel pathways, generating a nested set of homeostatic mechanisms that operate over different temporal and spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} coal-mine-type short-delay {{electric detonators}} marketed by three domestic manufacturers {{to determine the}} accuracy of delays and the probability of overlap between adjacent de- lay periods. The Winzer index was computed and compared with the probability of overlap. A close agreement between the Winzer criterion and overlap probability was demonstrated. A permissible blasting unit capable of delivering a maximum firing energy of 4. 0 J and a digital oscilloscope were {{used to measure the}} delay time with an accuracy of 20. 25 ms. Another oscilloscope and a pulse transformer were used to record <b>firing</b> <b>current.</b> Experimental data indicated negligible overlap probability in detonators of shorter delay periods: periods 1 to 4, which correspond to 25 to 250 ms. However, a significant probability of overlap was detected in some detonators of longer delay periods: periods 5 to 9, which cor- respond to 300 to 500 ms...|$|E
40|$|An {{optically}} powered fireset {{has been}} developed for the Procyon high explosive pulsed-power generator at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The fireset was located inside this flux compression experiment where large magnetic fields are generated. No energy sources were allowed inside the experiment and no wire connections can penetrate through the wall, of the experiment {{because of the high}} magnetic fields. The flux compression was achieved with high explosives in the experiment. The fireset was used to remotely charge a 1. 2 {micro}f capacitor to 6, 500 V and to provide a readout of the voltage on the capacitor at the control room. The capacitor was charged by using two 7 W fiber coupled GaAlAs laser diodes to illuminate two fiber coupled 12 V solar cells. The solar cell outputs were connected in parallel to the input of a DC-DC converter which step up a 12 V to 6, 500 V. A voltmeter, powered by illuminating a third 12 V solar cell with 1 W laser diode, was used to monitor the charge on the capacitor. The voltage was measured with a divider circuit, then converted to frequency in a V-F converter and transmitted to the control room over a fiber optic link. A fiducial circuit measured the capacitor <b>firing</b> <b>current</b> and provided an optical output timing pulse...|$|E
