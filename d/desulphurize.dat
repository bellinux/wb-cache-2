In the previous studies (Pysh’yev et al. 2011; Gunka and Pyshyev 2014, 2015), the best values limits of the factors of the oxidative desulphurization process were defined: the oxidant linear rate— 0.0125 – 0.01875  m/s, coal grain size—up to 0.75  mm, temperature— 425 to 450  °C, ratio between oxidant volumetric flow rate and coal mass—nearly 0.6  m 3 /(h kg), process duration— 5 to 10  min. Additionally, it has been determined that lignite desulphurization for the purpose of its further utilization in TPPs (the energy sector) can be performed only with the use of air. However, to increase the content of H 2 S in desulphurized gases (an area of power-generation and technology), using as an oxidant air–steam mixture is preferable compared to air is a good practice.|$|E

Combined desulphurization technologies are being studied, including bioprocessing to upgrade fossil fuels. Using biodesulphurization (BDS), which is a biochemical process mediated by specific microorganisms, {{it is possible to}} <b>desulphurize</b> most of the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) recalcitrant sulphur compounds under mild operating conditions, making it a simple and eco-friendly process. In this study, two BDS process designs are compared, in terms of energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and operational costs by following a life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) based methodology. The industrial HDS process is used as the reference technology for sulphur removal from fossil fuels. Different theoretical scenarios were considered and the best BDS results are scaled-up to evaluate a case study of providing ultra low sulphur diesel to an urban taxi fleet. This study exploits the potential of BDS as a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative or complementary technology to the commonly HDS towards ultra low sulphur fuels...|$|E

40|$|Nickel boride, a novel <b>desulphurizing</b> agent, was {{investigated}} for the desulphurization of sulphur-rich geomacromolecules in polar and asphaltene fractions.

The distributions of the compounds released with Raney nickel or nickel boride were, however, very similar. A further advantage of this method is that deuterium labelling of released hydrocarbons is easily achieved. Furthermore, problems of decreasing activity with storage time (as with Raney nickel) do not exist because the <b>desulphurizing</b> agent is made in situ.

40|$|Out of 17 samples {{collected}} from diverse environments, 110 bacterial isolates of varied characteristics were screened for their dibenzothiophene-desulphurizing activity. A single isolate, Eu- 32, originating from a soil sample {{taken from the}} roots of a eucalyptus tree, displayed dibenzothiophene-desulphurizing activity. This isolate metabolized dibenzothiophene to 2 -hydroxybiphenyl (2 -HBP), as detected by HPLC, and was also able to use other organic sulphur compounds as a sole sulphur source. Based on morphological, biochemical and molecular studies, {{it was found that}} the organism belongs to the genus Rhodococcus, with a maximum of 95 % identity to species in this genus for the partial sequence of the 16 S rRNA gene. Isolate Eu- 32 could <b>desulphurize</b> 0. 2 mM dibenzothiophene to 2 -HBP in 72 h at a temperature of 30 1 C and pH 7. 0. The structure and molecular mass of metabolites produced from dibenzothiophene desulphurization were identified by GC-MS, and two sulphur-free products, 2 -HBP and biphenyl, were detected in ethyl acetate extract.

40|$|Sulphate esters {{make up a}} large {{proportion}} of the available sulphur in agricultural soils, and many pseudomonads can <b>desulphurize</b> a range of aryl- and alkylsulphate esters to provide sulphur for growth. After miniTn 5 transposon mutagenesis of Pseudomonas putida S- 313, we isolated 19 mutants that were defective in cleavage of the chromogenic sulphate ester 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indoxylsulphate (X-sulphate). Analysis of these strains revealed that they carried independent insertions in a gene cluster that comprised genes for a sulphate ester/sulphonate transporter (atsRBC) a LysR-type regulator (sftR), an oxygenolytic alkylsulphatase (atsK), an arylsulphotransferase (astA) and a putative TonB-dependent receptor (sftP). The SftP protein was localized in the outer membrane, and the arylsulfphotransferase was identified as an intracellular enzyme. Expression of sftR was repressed in the presence of inorganic sulphate, and the sftR gene was required for the expression of atsBC, atsRK and sftP-astA. An sftR mutant was unable to grow with aryl- or alkylsulphate esters in laboratory media and showed significantly reduced survival compared with the parent strain during incubation in Danish agricultural and grassland soils. This effect suggests that sulphate esters are an important sulphur source for microbes in aerobic soils and highlights the importance of the microbial population in the soil sulphur cycle...|$|E

40|$|Cover {{technology}} has {{developed over the}} last decade as a remediation option to reduce acid rock drainage from mine tailings. <b>Desulphurized</b> tailings have been investigated as a cover material due to their potential to consume oxygen, hydraulic properties and relative abundance at mine sites. A <b>desulphurized</b> tailings cover was installed at the Detour Lake Mine to cover a portion of the tailings impoundment. The <b>desulphurized</b> tailings cover was intended to reduce oxygen penetration into the sulphidic tailings by maintaining saturation to reduce oxygen diffusion and by consuming oxygen by oxidation of the remaining sulphide minerals. A research study was initiated {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this cover at reducing oxygen penetration into the sulphidic tailings. The scope of the research involved a field investigation, laboratory analysis and numerical modeling. The field investigation involved instrumenting the tailings impoundment to measure weather data, water levels and water content. Tailings samples were evaluated in the laboratory investigation for geotechnical and geochemical characteristics. The purpose of the field and laboratory investigation was to satisfy two objectives: to yield qualitative conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the <b>desulphurized</b> tailings cover and to establish representative profiles for the numerical modeling. The purpose of the numerical modeling was to evaluate the oxygen concentration through various tailings profiles to determine the relative effect of weather, vegetation and water table depth. The program SoilCover and a finite difference program were used for this evaluation. The general conclusion from this research was that the <b>desulphurized</b> tailings cover is likely not reducing oxygen penetration into the sulphidic tailings to very low levels over the entire tailings surface. The factors acting to reduce the oxygen penetration are the ability of the sulphidic tailings to remain saturated well above the water table, the consumption of a portion of the oxygen by kinetic oxidation and the potential, based on field observations, for fine tailings layers within the tailings profiles to act as oxygen barriers...|$|R
30|$|Coal is {{the largest}} fossil fuel abundantly {{distributed}} {{in many parts of}} the world. The demand of energy and the depletion of high-quality coal, so more attention is focused on utilization of the low- grade coal. The low-grade coal has a serious deficiency to utilization because it associated with high mineral matter content and moisture content. The origin of Indian coal is heterogeneous in nature and consists of the complex mixture of organic (carbon) and inorganic (minerals) constituents (Georgakopoulos et al. 2003). The use of low-grade coal in large-scale unit leads to environmental pollution due to generation of the solid wastes and gaseous pollutants. It causes the increase cost of the power plants, reduce the efficiency and produces technical difficulties during processes and production steps (Meshram et al. 2015). It is necessary to demineralize and <b>desulphurize</b> such coal before using in thermal power station, steel plants, or cement industries, etc. The major minerals commonly found in coal are quartz and other forms of silica, clay mineral, pyrites and carbonates such as siderites and ankerites (Mukherjee and Borthakur 2001). The coal ash formed from mineral matter is both organic and inorganic in nature. High ash (>[*] 20 % weight) coal is rich with mineral content such as quartz, illite, calcite, pyrite, gypsum, and elements like H, N, S and oxygen. The high ash coal is always enriched with oxides of SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, and K 2 O (Ciu et al. 2015). The cleaning of coal can be achieved by both physical and chemical method (Gulen et al. 2005). The degree of demineralization of coal by various method mostly depends on the percentage and composition of mineral matter, their types, and association within the raw coal. The physical methods are based on the difference in their physical properties (specific gravity and surface properties) of the minerals and the carbonaceous part of the coal (Behera et al. 2017 a, b). The chemical method involve treatment with different chemical solvent are used for removing mineral matter, like the finely distributed mineral and those bound strongly to the coal matrix (Ma et al. 2014). The purpose of beneficiation of a low-grade coal is to reduce inert content for easy transportation, minimize abrasive materials and to improve the combustion qualities. The combustion properties of coal like heating value, volatile matter content that govern the performance of coal have a clear dependence on ash, maceral composition. Therefore, more emphasis is given for the cleaning method of coal so that it may minimize the mineral matter and improve the quality of coal. However, chemical cleaning processes are more expensive than physical cleaning steps in terms of total cost (Dash et al. 2015 a, b). The chemical beneficiation methods are include acid leaching, alkali leaching, acid leaching followed by alkali leaching or alkali leaching followed by acid leaching and leaching by molten caustic treatment. The coal cleaning by the chemical method is a simple process when it is operates under mild condition. Chemical leaching process usually achieved remove all types of minerals from the coal compared to physical treatment method. Although, chemical cleaning method has not been widely employed on a commercial scale due to huge cost related to the requirement of chemical and need for dewatering and regeneration of reagents from spent solution (Wu and Steel 2007; Waugh and Bowling 1984; Ryberg et al. 2015; Sriramoju et al. 2017).|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{desulphurisation}} is {{an attractive}} alternative {{for the management of}} acid generating tailings. Non selective froth flotation is the most commonly used method to produce <b>desulphurized</b> tailings, as shown from many previous works (McLaughlin and Stuparyk, 1994; Bussière et al., 1995; 1998; Benzaazoua et al., 2000 a,b; 2002). This process can reduce the volume of problematic tailings to manage, by making a sulphide fraction concentrate. The <b>desulphurized</b> tailings can then be used as a moisture retention layer in a cover with capillary barrier effects to prevent acid mine drainage. In this paper, the authors present the results from different laboratory and pilot scale flotation tests which confirm that low sulphide, non-acid generating tailings can be produced by froth flotation. It is also demonstrated that the sulphide concentrates obtained from desulphurisation, when mixed with binders gave good long term results in terms of mechanical behaviour, thus demonstrating that the sulphide fraction can be used for paste backfill material.

30|$|The data {{available}} shows {{that during the}} desulphurization of lignite the total sulphur content can be reduced, on average, only by 3.0  wt% (Table  7). Accordingly, the degrees of total sulphur removal are 29.4 %– 31.8 % (Table  8). This {{is due to the}} abnormally high content of organic sulphur in feed coal, which remained virtually unchanged throughout the process. Furthermore, the low yield of <b>desulphurized</b> coal was caused by the high moisture content in the feedstock and high reactivity typical of lignite organic matter. However, if assuming that all the hydrogen sulphide contained in <b>desulphurized</b> gases will be removed or converted to sulphur, the degree of conversion of total sulphur will be equal to the level of reducing environmental pollution.

The untreated and 'desulphurized' (CrCl 2 and Li/EtNH 2) kerogens were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed by flash pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Typically, significant variations in the relative contributions and abundances of n-alk- 1 -enes/n-alkanes, alkylated pyrroles, thiophenes and supposedly S-bound moieties released as phytenes and sterenes were observed. The first series of products (n-hydrocarbons) contributed relatively more to the pyrolyzates of the <b>desulphurized</b> kerogens, suggesting an enrichment of microalgal-derived aliphatic macromolecules.

Upon the oxidative desulphurization of lignite, the calorific value increases by 5.0 % (from 22165 to 23284  kJ/kg per analytical sample) and by 7.6 % (from 26769 to 28817  kJ/kg per organic matter) which is due to the decreasing moisture and increasing carbon content in the organic matter. This altogether and a significant reduction in the sulphur content upon the oxydesulphurization (Gunka and Pyshyev 2014, 2015) makes it possible to anticipate the successful utilization of <b>desulphurized</b> coal in the power industry.|$|R
40|$|Fluidized bed {{combustion}} (FBC) processes enable in situ SO 2 removal, but generate {{large amounts}} of wastes difficult to reuse and landfill. The steam hydration/reactivation of the <b>desulphurizing</b> ability of these ashes is considered a viable recycling pathway. In order to give {{a contribution to the}} understanding of the role played by the characteristics of steam-reactivated FBC ashes in the SO 2 capture, a lab-scale investigation has been performed to correlate their chemical and physical properties with hydration operating conditions such as temperatures and times. It has been found that the reactivation process, particularly when carried out for 60 minutes at 200 °C, was able to give products with an improved overall accessible porosity, induced by both the extent of the reactions and the nature of the hydrated phases (calcium hydroxide and, secondarily, ettringite) ...|$|R
40|$|During {{studies on}} a <b>desulphurizing,</b> denitrifying effluent-treatment system, an {{organism}} which {{is able to}} grow aerobically and anaerobically on reduced sulphur compounds and hydrogen, while fixing carbon dioxide, was isolated. The new isolate is also capable of mixotrophic and heterotrophic growth {{on a wide range}} of substrates, and is therefore a facultatively aerobic, facultative autotroph. Comparisons with two similar species, Thiobacillus A 2 and Paracoccus denitrijicans, showed that the new isolate is significantly different from the other two, and merits separate classification. In view of its ability to oxidize reduced sulphur compounds, and because it is a chain-forming coccus rather than a rod, the new isolate has been given the generic name of Thiosphaera, and the species name pantotropha in recognition of its wide range of possible substrates...|$|R
