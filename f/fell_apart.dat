5|$|With {{the death}} of Montgomery, his attack <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> Colonel Donald Campbell, the {{surviving}} officer, ordered a somewhat panicked retreat. Without Montgomery's assistance, Arnold's attack, after initial success, <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> Arnold {{was wounded in the}} leg, and a large number of his troops were captured, including Daniel Morgan.|$|E
5|$|After the 1963 season, {{the team}} <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> A roster filled with mostly older {{veterans}} plus some bad personnel moves (e.g. the dispatching of Rosey Grier, Sam Huff, and Don Chandler) {{lead to a}} quick exit {{from the top of}} the standings. The Giants finished 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought.|$|E
5|$|Prussia became anxious at Austrian {{advances}} on the Rhine frontier, and Frederick again invaded Bohemia, {{beginning a}} Second Silesian War; Prussian troops sacked Prague in August 1744. The French plans <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> when Charles Albert died in January 1745. The French overran the Austrian Netherlands in May.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson continued to team after the Alliance <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton and Anderson worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> as Bagration was evacuated {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24. It slowly strengthened {{into the first}} tropical storm of the season two days later. Alma then turned north, moving {{near the edge of}} a subtropical ridge over Mexico. Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter under the influence of wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> and degenerated into a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E
5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first night <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell. However, according to Campbell, the film's production and development <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> due to financial issues hence its delay, but as of October 2017, it is back in the pipeline for which he's hopeful to begin working on, soon. Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of The Maze Prison Escape, titled H-Block which is to be directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Groening and Brooks pitched a live-action spin-off series centered in Krusty the Clown (expected to be portrayed by Dan Castellaneta) entitled Krusty (although they began planning the series since 1992). Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot episode where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> and Groening decided to stop work on the project.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} ran {{afoul of}} the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned {{by the presence of}} communists in the Guatemalan government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971. In October 2011, the Guatemalan government issued an official apology for Árbenz's overthrow.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Matt Groening and James L. Brooks began {{planning}} a live-action spin-off from The Simpsons that revolved around Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta as Krusty. They pitched the series in 1994. Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles {{and got his}} own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty {{lived in a house}} on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> and Groening decided to stop work on the project.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, it was {{reported}} that Nu Image/Millennium Films was in negotiations with an unnamed Chinese distributor. The distributor would produce the film, in exchange for a Chinese actor (Donnie Yen) being cast and filming in China. The partnership was considered to make a Chinese release of the film easier, and would have granted Millennium Films a larger share of its Chinese revenue. However, the partnership <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> before production began. However, another Chinese studio, Le Vision Pictures, invested in the film. Lionsgate Films purchased the North American and United Kingdom distribution rights to the film for $35million.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, Gordon {{partnered with}} Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios, hiring David Hayter {{to write and}} direct. Hayter and the {{producers}} left Universal due to creative differences, and Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios. The project did not hold together at Revolution Studios and subsequently <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> In July 2004, it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they attached Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Producers Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain {{and was replaced by}} Paul Greengrass. Ultimately, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround.|$|E
5|$|Minimum {{processing}} requirements {{also became}} {{an issue in the}} Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). Dunderdale announced {{in a speech to the}} St. John's Board of Trade in May 2013, that the loan guarantee for the Muskrat Falls project nearly <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> because of MPRs. She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the loan guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 17, a drummer {{appeared}} followed by an officer waving a white handkerchief. The bombardment ceased, and the officer was blindfolded and led behind the French and American lines. Negotiations began at the Moore House on October 18 between Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross (who represented the British) and Lieutenant Colonel Laurens (who represented the Americans) and the Marquis de Noailles (who represented the French). To make sure that nothing <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> between the French and Americans at the last minute, Washington ordered that the French be given an equal share in {{every step of the}} surrender process.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the show, the staff have {{considered}} producing several spin-off television series and films, based on The Simpsons. In 1994, Matt Groening pitched a live action spin-off from The Simpsons that centered on Krusty and would star Dan Castellaneta. He and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot script where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> and Groening decided to stop work on the project.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the same}} {{tropical}} wave that formed Tropical Depression Seven in the Atlantic basin organized into Tropical Depression Twelve-E on September 15. It strengthened further into Tropical Storm Iselle the next day. The storm headed northwest and paralleled the coast of Mexico, nearly strengthening into a hurricane late on September 17. While near its peak intensity, a trough abruptly recurved the system to the northeast. Wind shear also increased, and Iselle consequently <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> on satellite imagery. It weakened to a depression on September 19. Iselle then degenerated into a remnant low {{the next day and}} rapidly degenerated, dissipating on September 20. Iselle never made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Though the Binnewater rail {{station was}} {{once part of}} the {{historic}} district, it was located too close to Binnewater Road and was hit repeatedly by trucks until it <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> in May 1989. The station was subsequently demolished by the county highway department. Another historic district, the Snyder Estate, runs along the Rosendale section. The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers. The Rosendale trestle has been the site of numerous picnics, barbecues, {{and at least one}} wedding. One person has tried bungee jumping off the bridge without a restraining cord.|$|E
5|$|After World War II ended, the U.S. Navy {{entered the}} 45 year long Cold War {{and participated in}} the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Persian Gulf War, and the Second Persian Gulf War / Iraq War. Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1990-91, the Soviet Red Navy <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> which made the United States the world's undisputed naval superpower. Nuclear power and ballistic missile technology led to new ship propulsion and weapon systems, which were used in the s and s. By 1978, the number of ships had dwindled to less than 400, many of which were from World War II, which prompted Ronald Reagan to institute a program for a modern, 600-ship Navy. Today, the United States is the world's undisputed naval superpower, with the ability to engage and project power in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|At the Boels Rental Hills Classic Van Dijk {{was part}} of front group that {{consisted}} of six riders which <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> into {{a group of three}} riders. With an uphill finish, Van Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, Van Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek van Vleuten (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk was disappointed and responded that she was not that good as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, {{the display}} of unity by white farmers against {{chartered}} rule at the 1920 elections <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> The majority of them, mostly ranchers and tobacco planters, who relied on the southern market, voted for Union. On the other hand, Mashonaland maize growers, wanting to retain full share of the local produce markets, wanted responsible government. The 1922 referendum results were 8,774 for responsible government and 5,989 for joining South Africa. The {{role of women in}} the defeat of the Unionists was substantial, with approximately 75% of them voting for responsible government, even when their husbands voted for Union. In a letter to the South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts, the Company Administrator Sir Francis Drummond Chaplin cited anti-Afrikaner sentiments, particularly amongst women, as {{a major factor in the}} result.|$|E
5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not respond {{for a long period}} of time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that was outside the City.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Navy <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> without sufficient personnel to man many of its ships or the money to maintain them—indeed, many of them were sold to foreign nations. This left the United States as the world's undisputed naval superpower. U.S. naval forces did undergo a decline in absolute terms but relative {{to the rest of the}} world, however, United States dwarfs other nations' naval power as evinced by its 11 aircraft supercarriers and their supporting battle groups. During the 1990s, the United States naval strategy was based on the overall military strategy of the United States which emphasized the ability of the United States to engage in two simultaneous limited wars along separate fronts.|$|E
5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused {{to transfer the}} parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
5|$|In 1640, {{masses of}} Chinese peasants who were starving, {{unable to pay}} their taxes, and no longer in fear of the {{frequently}} defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders {{from the north and}} huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b> Unpaid and unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng – now self-styled as the Prince of Shun – and deserted the capital without much of a fight. On 26 May 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were opened by rebel allies from within. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Jean Cocteau, who greatly {{admired the}} film, insisted on Tiefland being {{shown at the}} Cannes Film Festival, which he was running that year. In 1960, Riefenstahl {{attempted}} to prevent filmmaker Erwin Leiser from juxtaposing scenes from Triumph des Willens with footage from concentration camps in his film Mein Kampf. Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called Friedrich und Voltaire ("Friedrich and Voltaire"), wherein Cocteau was to play two roles. They thought the film might symbolize the love-hate relationship between Germany and France. Cocteau's illness and 1963 death {{put an end to}} the project. A musical remake of Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") with an English production company also <b>fell</b> <b>apart.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1595, Kepler was {{introduced}} to Barbara Müller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. Müller, heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also {{the daughter of a}} successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage despite Kepler's nobility; though he had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on Mysterium, but the engagement nearly <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials—who had helped set up the match—pressured the Müllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.|$|E
5|$|In March 1999, Dick Clark Productions {{announced}} their teaming with Dodd Darin on a biopic, with collaboration from producer Arthur Friedman, {{who had been}} developing both The Bobby Darin Story and Dreamer with Levinson at Warner Bros. since 1986. Shortly afterwards, Spacey was in discussions with Dodd Darin to star in the lead role. Spacey was able to acquire the film rights from Warner Bros. in early 2000. With the help of Dodd Darin, the actor also received exclusive music rights for no charge. With his Academy Award-winning performance in American Beauty (1999), Paramount Pictures became interested in distributing/financing Beyond the Sea. The deal <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> when Paramount told Spacey {{was that he was}} too old for the role and instead wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Beginning in October 2000, Spacey took vocal training lessons from Darin collaborator Roger Kellaway to give an accurate portrayal of the singer.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, Gordon {{partnered with}} Lloyd Levin and Universal Studios, hiring David Hayter {{to write and}} direct.

Paul Greengrass replaced Aronofsky when he left to focus on The Fountain. Ultimately, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} the Knights were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary to buy Neumark for 500,000 guldens. Negotiations <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> {{as the title}} to the land was contested by several dukes. The Neumark purchase was closed with Jobst of Moravia only in 1402. During July 1392, the Knights agreed to pay Władysław Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the Dobrzyń Land, which had been contested among Piast dukes since 1377. Opolczyk, the ruler of Opole in Silesia, {{had little interest in}} the volatile regions to his north. In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Roman Empire, Silesia, and Hungary, but it was rejected. These purchases by the Knights threatened Poland's northern borders.|$|E
5|$|Izetbegović, who {{had hoped}} to prevent Bosnia Herzegovina from falling under the {{influence}} of Croatia or Serbia, signed the agreement after Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ) branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was replaced by Tuđman with Mate Boban, who blocked the delivery of supplies to Sarajevo where a siege was under way and had proclaimed an independent Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (HR-HB). The agreement <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> in October after a number of events including the assassination of Blaž Kraljević, leader of Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the fall of the areas of Posavina, Bosanski Brod, and Jajce {{into the hands of the}} Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), and after a major battle broke out between the HVO and the ARBiH in Prozor.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{returned}} to Dublin in mid-1909 with George, {{to visit his}} father and work on getting Dubliners published. He visited Nora's family in Galway and liked Nora's mother very much. While preparing to return to Trieste {{he decided to take}} one of his sisters, Eva, back with him to help Nora run the home. He spent a month in Trieste before returning to Dublin, this time as a representative of some cinema owners and businessmen from Trieste. With their backing he launched Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph, which was well-received, but <b>fell</b> <b>apart</b> after Joyce left. He {{returned to}} Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen, in tow. Eva became homesick for Dublin and returned there a few years later, but Eileen spent {{the rest of her life}} on the continent, eventually marrying Czech bank cashier Frantisek Schaurek.|$|E
5|$|KKR's largest {{investment}} of the 1990s {{would be one}} of its least successful. In January 1998, KKR and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst agreed to the $1.5 billion buyout of Regal Entertainment Group. KKR and Hicks Muse had initially intended to combine Regal with Act III Cinemas, which KKR had acquired in 1997 for $706 million and United Artists Theaters, which Hicks Muse had agreed to acquire for $840 million in November 1997. Shortly after agreeing to the Regal takeover, the deal with United Artists <b>fell</b> <b>apart,</b> destroying the strategy to eliminate costs by building a larger combined company. Two years later, in 2000, Regal encountered significant financial issues and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection; the company passed to billionaire investor Philip Anschutz.|$|E
