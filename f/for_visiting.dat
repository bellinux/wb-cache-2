40|$|Vitamin D is {{important}} to the health of college students. The objective of our study was to measure sun exposure, skin pigmentation, vitamin D intake, and serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH]D) in a subset of participants from The Following the Longitudinal Aspects of Student Health (FLASH) Study to determine the best predictors of 25 (OH) D status. Participants were college-aged freshman who had their blood drawn in spring (Visit 1) and fall 2010 (Visit 2) at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo, CA. (35. 3 °N). Vitamin D intake was measured using a 28 -day food frequency recall questionnaire (specific to vitamin D foods and supplements) while questions specific to the frequency of milk and fish intake were accessed from the FLASH questionnaire. Sun exposure was measured using a 28 -day recall questionnaire (time in sun and sun exposure index [SEI]) and questions (frequency of weekday/ weekend exposure) from the FLASH questionnaire. Skin pigmentation was measured using a reflectance spectrophotometer. Serum 25 (OH) D was measured at a local pathology lab as measured by an IDS-iSYS. Means (SD) were as follows (n= 40) : reflectance of the forehead was 61 (3. 5) L* (Lightness) <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 1 and 61 (4. 3) L* <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 2. Vitamin D intake was 308 (234) IU <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 1 and 316 (257) IU <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 2. Time outside was 81 (44) mins <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 1 and 76 (39) mins <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 2. Serum 25 (OH) D was 85 (24) nmol/L <b>for</b> <b>Visit</b> 1 and 113 (28) nmol/L in Visit 2 which was significantly higher (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001).

5|$|Blues harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse {{public house}} in London’s Soho, {{which served as}} {{a focal point for}} British skiffle acts. Like guitarist Alexis Korner, he had worked for Chris Barber, playing in the R segment Barber {{introduced}} to his show and as part of the supporting band <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> US artists. They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was blues, they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> artists and their own performances. The visit of Muddy Waters in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R in general. Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified electric blues, but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews. Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.|$|E

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> school groups.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, Freemasonry {{has become}} {{linked to a}} scandal {{concerning}} the Propaganda Due lodge (a.k.a. P2). This lodge was chartered by the Grande Oriente d'Italia in 1877, as a lodge <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> Masons unable to attend their own lodges. Under Licio Gelli's leadership, in the late 1970s, P2 {{became involved in the}} financial scandals that nearly bankrupted the Vatican Bank. However, by this time the lodge was operating independently and irregularly, as the Grand Orient had revoked its charter and expelled Gelli in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Lord Thomas Bulkeley {{bought the}} castle from the Crown in 1807 for £735, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence, Baron Hill. By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> painters and travellers, who considered the ivy-clad ruins romantic. Although not as popular as other sites in the region, Beaumaris formed part of this trend and was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835. Some of the castle's stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol.|$|E

5|$|The week-long holiday of Passover in {{the spring}} commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> friends and relatives, travelling, and {{on the first night}} of Passover, the {{traditional}} ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing ḥametz– leaven or yeast– may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.|$|E
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} accommodated {{in the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground <b>for</b> <b>visiting</b> supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are grown too, often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. <b>For</b> <b>visiting</b> yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E
