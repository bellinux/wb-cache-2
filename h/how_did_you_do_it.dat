5000|$|After {{completion}} of the first few documentaries, government officials and U.S. Army staff {{found them to be}} powerful messages and excellent presentations of why it was necessary for the U.S. to fight in the war. All footage came from military and government sources, whereas during earlier years, many newsreels secretly used footage from enemy sources.

40|$|Writing a good {{abstract}} is {{a sophisticated}} skill. An abstract is a stand-alone statement that briefly conveys the essential information of a paper, article, document or book; presents the objective, methods, results, and conclusions {{of a research}} project; has a brief, non-repetitive style. What purpose does an abstract serve? It forms the first "content " page of your paper/dissertation/thesis and is therefore {{the first thing to}} be read by the assessor and forms the first impression of your work. It may also share {{one or more of the}} following: Allow a reader to decide whether or not to read the full text. Include keywords essential to your topic which may be searched for in an electronic database With the addition of just a title and your name, be suitable for inclusion in a printed or electronic index where it would identify the potential value of your research to another, or stand as a summary you might submit as a proposal to a conference. How long? 200 words will be adequate provided you write concisely and are summarising, not re-writing, the contents of your report. Electronic databases automatically truncate abstracts beyond a certain length so keywords associated with your results, conclusions or recommendations may be omitted. Although an abstract appears as the first section of a paper, it should be written last. You need to have completed all other sections before you can select and summarize the essential information from those sections. An abstract should include: Purpose: Why did you undertake the study? What were you examining, or testing or investigating. A good opening is often, "The study tested [...] . ", "The book investigated [...] . ", "The article examines [...] . ". Methodology: What was done and <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> Be specific, don’t make generalised comments. Results and conclusions: What did you find? State specific outcomes and, if appropriate, draw conclusions. References An abstract should not normally contain references. Many abstracts are published without the complete paper itself in abstract journals or in online databases. Thus, an abstract might serve as the only means by which a researcher determines what information a paper contains. An abstract must convey the essential results of a paper...|$|E
