40|$|In {{a complex}} vibroacoustic system the overall noise or {{vibration}} {{in a given}} location is the sum <b>of</b> multiple <b>subsystem</b> contributions. From an experimental perspective, the total noise can be directly measured but not the contributions. Methods based in transmissivity measurements, as ATPA, allow to find these contributions experimentally and understand the system behaviour through the path concept. Two different contributions to the ATPA method are included here. On the one hand, a numerical model that simulates a simple vibroacoustic problem is shown.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study how}} {{temporal}} specifications of reconfigurable component based {{systems can be}} hierarchically organised.

The internal architecture <b>of</b> a <b>subsystem</b> can change at “run time” by means of reconfiguration operations. The notion <b>of</b> <b>subsystem</b> provides an extra coarse grained unit of modularisation, that complements that of components. Since component interaction is achieved by means of coordination, a component or subsystem can be represented by a logical theory isolated {{from the rest of}} the system.

40|$|The proper <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsystems</b> in {{gauge theory}} and gravity {{requires}} {{an extension of}} the local phase space by including edge mode fields. Their role is on the one hand to restore gauge invariance with respect to gauge transformations supported on the boundary, {{and on the other hand}} to parametrize the largest set of boundary symmetries which can arise if both the gauge parameters and the dynamical fields are unconstrained at the boundary. In this work we construct the extended phase space for three-dimensional gravity in first order connection and triad variables. There, the edge mode fields consist of a choice of coordinate frame on the boundary and a choice of Lorentz frame on the bundle, which together constitute the Lorentz-diffeomorphism edge modes. After constructing the extended symplectic structure and proving its gauge invariance, we study the boundary symmetries and the integrability of their generators. We find that the infinite-dimensional algebra of boundary symmetries with first order variables is the same as that with metric variables, and explain how this can be traced back to the expressions for the diffeomorphism Noether charge in both formulations. This concludes the study of extended phase spaces and edge modes in three-dimensional gravity, which was done previously by the author in the BF and Chern-Simons formulations.

30|$|Guestrin and Gordon [14] {{proposed}} a distributed planning algorithm in hierarchical factored MDPs that solves large decision problems by decomposing them into sub-decision problems (subsystems).

Internal variables are the variables {{that can be used}} by the value function <b>of</b> the <b>subsystem,</b> while the external variables cannot be used because their dynamics are unknown. Although the algorithm does not guarantee convergence to an optimal solution, its output plan is equivalent to the output of a centralised decision system. This proposal has some limitations.

40|$|Dixon's multipoles for {{a system}} of N {{relativistic}} positive-energy scalar particles are evaluated in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics. The Wigner hyper-planes (intrinsic rest frame of the isolated system) {{turn out to be}} the natural framework for describing multipole kinematics. Classical concepts like the barycentric tensor of inertia turn out to be extensible to special relativity only by means of the quadrupole moments of the isolated system. Two new applications of the multipole technique are worked out for systems of interacting particles and fields. In the rest-frame of the isolated system of either free or interacting positive energy particles it is possible to define a unique world-line which embodies the properties of the most relevant centroids introduced in the literature as candidates for the collective motion of the system.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{critique}} of the program of "environment-induced decoherence" as advocated by Zurek, Zeh and Joos, among others. In particular, the alleged relevance of decoherence for a solution of the "measurement problem" is subjected to a detailed philosophical analysis. In the first chapter, an attempt is made to unravel what exactly this "measurement problem" amounts to for the decoherence theorists. The second chapter reviews the standard decoherence literature. The third chapter starts with a brief discussion of the philosophical implications of the decoherence program, followed by a non-standard reconstruction of the decoherence argument that aims to uncover some (mostly hidden) assumptions underlying the approach. It is argued that different subsets of these assumptions result in different versions of the decoherence argument. Next, these assumptions are investigated in more detail, and a number of open problems for the decoherence approach is formulated, in addition to the well-known "problem of outcomes". These problems concern the interpretational relevance of the preferred basis, the role and status of the ignorance interpretation of mixed states, imperfect decoherence {{and the role of the}} environment and the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>subsystems.</b> The fourth chapter addresses the question to what extent the embedding of decoherence in an Everett-like interpretational framework, such as Zurek's "existentional interpretation" and Wallace's structural-realistic version of the many-worlds interpretation, helps to resolve these problems. The main conclusions are formulated in the fifth chapter. Namely: 1) decoherence cannot address the "preferred-basis problem" without adding new interpretational axioms to the standard formalism, 2) the the locality principle (that says that the environment is the "irrelevant" part and should therefore be ignored) is not only problematic but also interpretationally superfluous, 3) the decoherence approach, when formulated in terms of the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, is predicated on a solution of the "problem of outcomes" and thus cannot claim to account (even partially) for the latter, and 4) that the results of the decoherence program do not increase the plausibility of a realist interpretation of the quantum state...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{concerns the}} topic of urban metabolism as a method to orient policies at urban/territorial level. As suggested by other researches, a metabolic analysis of the urban environment could help planners and managers to improve resource use in cities; to reduce environmental degradation; to identify environmental impacts of energy, material, and waste flows; and to isolate problematic areas in need of attention. The metabolic framework implies a deep knowledge of the main local input and output flows of energy and matter, with detailed energy and environmental accountability. There are thus some difficulties to develop a comparative metabolic analysis of more territories. The research was developed within a wide national academic study in several Italian urban regions and focuses, in particular, a square territory of 100 × 100 km 2 around the centre of Milan, in northern Italy.
