5|$|The True Cost is a 2015 {{documentary}} film directed by Andrew Morgan {{that focuses on}} fast fashion. It discusses several aspects of the garment industry from production—mainly exploring the life of low-wage workers in developing countries—to its after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Using an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, it also examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to <b>global</b> <b>capitalism.</b> The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.|$|E

This is Simon Bromley's main question, and {{on the basis of}} a carefully balanced analysis, he seems by and large to favour the second hypothesis. Dispelling the most conspiratorial interpretations of US oil interests with a concise historical account, Bromley does a service to the academic Left and its intellectual credibility. At the same time, Bromley's broader interpretation leaves specific causal mechanisms unspecified, as it is based on a somewhat functionalist understanding of <b>global</b> <b>capitalism's</b> requirements of systemic reproduction...|$|R

25|$|The BRIC thesis {{recognizes that}} Brazil, Russia, India and China {{have changed their}} {{political}} systems to embrace <b>global</b> <b>capitalism.</b> Goldman Sachs predicts that China and India, respectively, will become the dominant global suppliers of manufactured goods and services, while Brazil and Russia will become similarly dominant as suppliers of raw materials. Of the four countries, Brazil remains the only polity that {{has the capacity to}} continue all elements, meaning manufacturing, services and resource supplying simultaneously. Cooperation is thus hypothesized to be a logical next step among the BRICs because Brazil and Russia together form the logical commodity suppliers.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{freedom in}} terms of technoliberalism {{involves}} small scale capitalism, that is capitalism for small and medium-sized businesses, rather than corporate organizations created by major interest groups. Ideally, localized systems and community ties will {{pave the way for}} a new capitalist economy, undoing the power of <b>global</b> <b>capitalism.</b> Implemented trust regulations will compliment this, meaning more rules for big companies to create better competition, whereas smaller companies will be enforced with fewer rules. Technoliberalism places an emphasis on these small and medium-sized businesses because it can help boost economic growth. Money spent by local authorities with small firms is re-spent into the local economy, compared to that spent with large businesses in the same area. Doing business this way then, is better value for money.|$|E
5000|$|Academics {{have argued}} that in the praxis of hegemony, {{imperial}} dominance is established by means of cultural imperialism, whereby the leader state (hegemon) dictates the internal politics and the societal character of the subordinate states that constitute the hegemonic sphere of influence, either by an internal, sponsored government or by an external, installed government. The imposition of the hegemon's way of life—an imperial lingua franca and bureaucracies (social, economic, educational, governing)—transforms the concrete imperialism of direct military domination into the abstract power of the status quo, indirect imperial domination. Critics have said that this view is [...] "deeply condescending" [...] and [...] "treats people … as blank slates on which <b>global</b> <b>capitalism’s</b> moving finger writes its message, leaving behind another cultural automaton as it moves on." ...|$|R

500|$|Marxists, who {{are skeptical}} of right-wing populist {{conspiracy}} theories, also accuse the global power elite {{of not having}} {{the best interests of}} all at heart, and many intergovernmental organizations of suffering from a democratic deficit, but they argue that the superclass are plutocrats only interested in brazenly imposing a neoliberal or neoconservative new world order—the implementation of <b>global</b> <b>capitalism</b> through economic and military coercion to protect the interests of transnational corporations—which systematically undermines the possibility of a socialist one-world government. Arguing that the world {{is in the middle of}} a transition from the American Empire to the rule of a global ruling class that has emerged from within the American Empire, they point out that right-wing populist conspiracy theorists, blinded by their anti-communism, fail to see is that what they demonize as the [...] "New World Order" [...] is, ironically, the highest stage of the very capitalist economic system they defend.|$|E

Interpreting youth protest as a manifestation of <b>global</b> <b>capitalism's</b> inability to provide young people with the kind of future that they need and deserve, this article concludes by offering economic democracy as an alternative project that could bring young people and ordinary workers and citizens around the world together in an effort to address the social and economic chaos produced by a generation of neoliberal economic policies. neoliberalism; capitalist crisis; youth protest; economic crisis; unemployment; Arab revolts; economic democracy; financial crisis; Arab Spring; young people; neoliberal economics; economic policy. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the emergence of indigenous art in postcolonial India as a contradictory process and phenomenon. The article traces the career of Gond art, from its discovery in the jungles of central India to its state institutionalization and its presence in the contemporary international art scene.

Using the Marxist concept of Primitive Accumulation as an analytical framework, the article makes a case for Gond art to be understood as providing allegories of <b>global</b> <b>capitalism's</b> desecration of tribal lands and culture, but also as engaging in a critique of, and providing resistance to, the ongoing accumulation through dispossession...|$|R

A fully fledged buyers' market has come into being. Chinese consumers, budding desires for music CDs, fast and frozen food, and convertibles may indeed serve to validate the ascendance of a 'counter-revolution' to socialist ideology.
