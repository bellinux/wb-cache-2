5|$|In Legacy of the Void, Daelaam' forces uncover a Purifier robot whose {{personality}} and memories was cloned from Fenix. This Purifier {{thinks he is}} Fenix in a dragoon shell. Artanis is overjoyed to meet this manifestation of his old comrade and <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> rush {{to tell him the}} truth, allowing him to discover it at a pace he is comfortable with, by studying the combat logs. Eventually, upon learning more about Fenix, he decides to have his name changed to 'Talandar'. He becomes the ambassador between the Daelaam and the Purifiers, convincing them to join force. He follows Artanis in battle to reclaim their homeworld.|$|E

5|$|It is {{announced}} {{that there will}} be an Itchy & Scratchy Movie and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit Maggie and he neglects to watch her as he is distracted by the history of Itchy & Scratchy, leaving her to take Homer's car for a joyride and crash into the wall of Springfield Prison, releasing the prisoners. Therefore, Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by banning him from ever seeing The Itchy & Scratchy Movie. He tears up Bart's ticket to prove that he means business. Bart begs to be given another punishment, but Homer refuses. After the film's release, Bart becomes angry and sad that he is the only kid in Springfield who has not seen it. Two months later, the film is still being shown in theaters as Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, with Marge claiming Bart has been punished enough. However, Homer still denies this and makes the punishment stick. Bart attempts to secretly watch the film by paying for a ticket, but learns that Homer went to the theater and instructed the employees to not sell tickets to him. Eventually, the film is removed from theaters and Bart tells Homer he won, to which Homer replies by saying they both won because by using his punishment Bart <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> doubt headed for a better life.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must {{also be able to}} sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E

After that, Kitty Pryde states that Paige <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> condition to teach and suggests removing her from the active staff. In a burst of fury, Paige decides to quit the school, considering Kitty was about to fire her. Then, Paige decides to take some time for herself, leaving the school and telling Toad she will eventually come back.

Bush Terminal was unique from other rail-marine terminals in New York due to its distance from Manhattan, the magnitude of its warehousing and manufacturing operations, and its fully integrated nature.|$|E
25|$|All processes—chemical, biological, {{measuring}} apparatus functioning, human perception involving {{the eye and}} brain, the communication of force—are constrained by the speed of light.

25|$|Title iv, Of the Sacraments.-(i) Of the baptism of converts. The ritual {{prescribed}} for their reception into the Church {{is to be}} observed. (ii) Of matrimony.

25|$|Rabbi Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon, in {{the spirit}} of his father Maimonides, Rabbi Saadiah Gaon, and other predecessors, {{explains}} at length in his Milḥamot HaShem that God <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way literally within time or space nor physically outside time or space, since time and space simply do not apply to his being whatsoever.

25|$|Cheating {{differs from}} most {{other forms of}} {{academic}} dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly telegraphed answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students {{in the same class}} but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If the student in the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.|$|E

25|$|Each {{court is}} convened by the 'moderator'—at {{the local level}} of the Kirk Session {{normally}} the parish minister who is ex officio member and Moderator of the Session.

The Moderator of the General Assembly serves for the year as the public representative of the Church—but beyond that enjoys no special powers or privileges and <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> sense the leader or official spokesperson of the Kirk.

25|$|Until recently, two {{different}} dialects of Judeo-Spanish were spoken in the Mediterranean region: Eastern Judeo-Spanish (in various distinctive regional variations) and Western or North African Judeo-Spanish (also known as Ḥakitía), once spoken, with little regional distinction, in six towns in Northern Morocco and, because of later emigration, also in Ceuta and Melilla (Spanish cities in North Africa), Gibraltar, Casablanca (Morocco), and Oran (Algeria). The Eastern Sephardic dialect is typified by its greater conservatism, its retention of numerous Old Spanish features in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and its numerous borrowings from Turkish and, {{to a lesser}} extent, also from Greek and South Slavic. Both dialects have (or had) numerous borrowings from Hebrew, especially in reference to religious matters, {{but the number of}} Hebraisms in everyday speech or writing <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> way comparable to that found in Yiddish.|$|E
25|$|Surrey County Cricket Club {{traditionally}} has relatively strong finances {{in terms of}} the county game (whose 18 counties' aggregate losses amounted to over £9million in 2010), which <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>no</b> small part due to the capability of and agreement with its principal home ground, The Oval, to stage Test cricket on a yearly basis, alongside limited overs internationals. However, despite its reputation as an aggressively commercial club, this reputation took a hit with the club announcing pre-tax losses of £502,000 for the 2010 financial year, as turnover dropped by 20% to £20.5m. The club had previously benefited from a sunnier balance sheet due to the sale of ground naming rights and the re-development of the Vauxhall End at The Oval. In the 2008 financial year, a year when the Club did not win a single match in the Second Division Championship, Surrey had achieved pre-tax profits of £583,000 with a turnover of approaching £24million, as membership swelled to 10,113. Record profit and turnover were announced for 2009 thanks to the staging of international cricket matches with the figures growing to £752,000 and £25.5million, respectively.|$|E
