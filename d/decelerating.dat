5|$|The sound modules are {{developed}} {{to give a}} realistic ICE sound impression indicating if the vehicle is idling, accelerating, <b>decelerating</b> or cruising.

5|$|Variable-speed drives {{can also}} run a motor in {{specialized}} patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an S-curve pattern {{can be applied}} to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or <b>decelerating.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{applications}} involve two-quadrant loads {{operating in}} quadrant I and II where the speed is positive but the torque changes polarity as {{in case of}} a fan <b>decelerating</b> faster than natural mechanical losses. Some sources define two-quadrant drives as loads operating in quadrants I and III where the speed and torque is same (positive or negative) polarity in both directions.|$|E

50|$|The {{explanation}} is that, although {{all parts of}} the ladder simultaneously <b>decelerate</b> to zero in the garage's frame, because simultaneity is relative, the corresponding decelerations in the frame of the ladder are not simultaneous. Instead, each part of the ladder <b>decelerates</b> sequentially, from front to back, until finally the back of the ladder <b>decelerates,</b> by which time it is already within the garage.|$|R
30|$|Deceleration control: when {{a vehicle}} {{traveling}} ahead {{at a slower}} speed is detected, the system uses the throttle to <b>decelerate</b> the driver's vehicle. If this deceleration is insufficient, the system uses the brake to <b>decelerate</b> the vehicle.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously <b>decelerating</b> the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} hurricane {{status for}} twelve hours before <b>decelerating</b> {{to the north}} and weakening to a tropical storm. The storm then turned sharply west-southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid-level circulation. Passing over progressively warmer waters and into an area with decreasing vertical shear, Kate regained hurricane status on October 1. Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south, the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30°N, and presented a well-defined eye on October 2. On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status, and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h) while located 650mi (1,050km) east of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|THSRC has {{established}} a system to respond to natural disasters and unexpected intrusion onto the right-of-way, called DWS (Disaster Warning Systems). This system consists {{of a network of}} sensors installed along the rail route to detect unexpected situations such as earthquakes, strong winds, heavy rainfall, floods, landslides, and intrusions. In case of an unexpected situation, the DWS will send signals to the OCC (Operation Control Center) immediately; it will also activate contingency measures {{to ensure the safety of}} the passengers and trains, including <b>decelerating</b> or stopping trains in the affected area.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon trough {{was noted}} {{along the coast}} of Australia's Northern Territory in late November into early December 1988. This system led to {{sporadic}} heavy rain in the region. On 12December, a tropical low consolidated from the monsoon trough over the Timor Sea, west of Darwin, Northern Territory. Moving southwest, the system skirted the Kimberley coast before turning west. Acquiring gale-force winds by 00:00UTC on 13December, the low was classified as a Category1 tropical cyclone and assigned the name Ilona by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Perth, Western Australia. At this time it was situated near Adele Island. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories, dubbing it Tropical Cyclone 03S. <b>Decelerating</b> somewhat, Ilona steadily intensified over the following days and achieved severe tropical cyclone status—having ten-minute sustained winds of at least —around 12:00UTC on 15December. Similarly, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached the equivalent of a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS) by 18:00UTC.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Jerry caused {{minor damage}} in Texas and flash {{flooding}} in Kentucky and Virginia in October1989. The fourteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm of the season, Jerry developed from a tropical wave in the Bay of Campeche on October12. Initially a tropical depression, the system moved north-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry {{early on the}} following day. Jerry continuously deepened until October14 and then maintained intensity while curving northeastward and briefly <b>decelerating.</b> Later that day, the storm re-curved north-northwestward. Jerry began to intensify on October15 and soon became a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Early on October16, Jerry made landfall on Galveston Island, Texas with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Less than six hours later, Jerry weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression shortly thereafter. Late on October16, Jerry was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over southwestern Arkansas.|$|E

5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still <b>decelerating</b> with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E
5|$|Cloud tops {{around the}} center warmed again early on September 15, and Isabel {{weakened}} to a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance. As a ridge to its northwest build southeastward, {{it resulted in}} Isabel <b>decelerating</b> as it turned to the north-northwest. Increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further, and Isabel weakened to a Category2 hurricane on September 16 while located 645miles (1035km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Convection remained minimal, though outflow retained excellent organization, and Isabel remained a Category2 hurricane for twodays, until it made landfall between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island on September 18, with winds of 105mph (165km/h). It weakened after it made landfall, though due to its fast forward motion, Isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western Virginia, early on September 19. After passing through West Virginia as a tropical storm, Isabel became extratropical over Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The system crossed Lake Erie into Canada. Early on September 20, the extratropial remnant of Isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm, over the Cochrane District of Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Steered by a mid- to {{low-level}} wind flow, {{the depression}} continued west-northwest toward Martinique, <b>decelerating</b> {{in reaction to}} the island's northern mountain range. Satellite images on the afternoon of August14 showed the development of a central dense overcast as greater atmospheric turbulence over the rugged terrain amplified the cyclone's convection; the next reconnaissance flight revealed that wind speeds near the center had increased to gale force. Based on these observations, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy around 18:00UTC, at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40mph (65km). Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable outflow, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, impeding further development. Over the course of August15, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear; the center of circulation became ill defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone. Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August16, attaining peak winds of 45mph (75km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1007mbar (hPa; 29.74inHg), roughly 85mi (140km) southeast of Santo Domingo.|$|E
