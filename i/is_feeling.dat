5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she <b>is</b> <b>feeling.</b> Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris).

Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character <b>is</b> <b>feeling.</b> Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he <b>is</b> <b>feeling.</b> During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.|$|E

25|$|Women {{look for}} certain cues {{on a first}} date: For example, it is {{important}} to a woman {{to find out if the}} man is courteous or not. Women will look for this by observing if the man comes to the door to pick her up or if he opens doors for her, or compliments her on how she looks, for example. If some of her expectations are not met, mainly the most important ones, she will not want to pursue anything more than a friendship. If the expectations are met, a second date might be in the future, but only if the man <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> the same thing.|$|E
25|$|Stoddart's {{concern is}} for Sheila Grant, {{whom he met}} at a hunt ball in the country. Sheila was at the party, is still at the flat having just woken up and <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> terrible after the high of the drugs. She {{is one of four}} daughters of a retired general and there is every sign that Sheila and her sisters are going wild, getting into a bad set where the cocaine flows freely. Stoddart lectures her about the cocaine and Poirot {{introduces}} himself. It is obvious that Sheila has heard of him and is nervous of him. Poirot compares drug-peddling to feeding on human flesh (in his mind, like the horses of Diomedes, who were fed on human flesh).|$|E

25|$|Over {{a two-week}} {{treatment}} of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency {{but did not}} affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that <b>is,</b> <b>feeling</b> that they performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance {{in a group of}} people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20measures of memory, attention and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance.|$|E

The player may talk to the Pokémon to see or check on how that Pokémon <b>is</b> <b>feeling,</b> and occasionally it may pick up items. A new minigame called the Pokéathlon (called Pokéthlon in Japan) uses the Nintendo DS touchscreen and allows Pokémon to compete in events such as hurdling. The Japanese versions retain slot machines found in previous games, while the international releases of the titles replace the slot machines with a new game called [...] "Voltorb Flip", described as a cross between Minesweeper and Picross. Another new item, the GB Sounds, changes the background music to the original 8-bit music from Pokémon Gold and Silver.|$|E

Although they remain fans of each other's work, Affleck and Smith have had little contact since the making of Clerks II.|$|E

He liked [...] "the 'cougars' storyline", saying it [...] "was a lot of fun, because Liz is best when Liz <b>is</b> <b>feeling</b> awkward." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Jenna's Amber Alert affair with the soda-drinking, Heelys-gliding teenager" [...] was [...] "priceless".
