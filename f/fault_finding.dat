25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the <b>fault.</b> <b>Finding</b> the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fault</b> {{location}} <b>finding</b> {{in power}} system {{is very important}} problem in power system monitoring. Moreover, demand for high grid availability are crucial for TSO's contracts. Many scientific papers are published on mentioned theme, along with efforts in {{transmission and distribution system}} operators about improving fault location accuracy. Recently, signal processing methods like Wavelets and Hilbert-Huang Transform are introduced in fault location procedure. In this paper, a new approach to power system fault signal processing is proposed. Three-phase fault voltages are converted to the vector of absolute values of its complex-space phasor. This vector represents fault travelling wave and it is further processed for <b>fault</b> location <b>finding</b> with Hilbert-Huang transform. The simulation results show that proposed method allows better accuracy in comparison to earlier procedures...|$|R
25|$|Most {{single mode}} / multi mode fiber systems {{actually}} use infra-red light, {{invisible to the}} human eye. In this case, there is no 'eye aversion response". A special case is systems operating at 670–1000nbsp&nm, where the beam {{may appear to be}} a dull red, even if the light beam is actually very intense.

These can create a significant hazard if viewed incorrectly, particularly if they are abnormally high power. Such visible fault finders are usually classified as Classnbsp&2 up to 1nbsp&mW, and Classnbsp&2M up to 10nbsp&mW.|$|E

The contemporary sense of critique has been largely influenced by the Enlightenment critique of prejudice and authority, which championed the emancipation and autonomy from religious and political authorities.|$|E

Vidal asserted that Current never read his book in whole, that he was <b>fault</b> <b>finding,</b> and could not separate a biography from a novel, [...] "getting all tangled up in misread or misunderstood trivia". The real reason for Current's criticism, Vidal maintained, was his portrayal of Lincoln as wanting to colonize the liberated slaves in Liberia, which would go against the political correctness of the 1980s. Famously, Vidal listed as his source for this interpretation a biography of Lincoln by Richard N. Current! ...|$|E

50|$|In some countries, AC-immune DC track {{circuits}} are used on AC electrified lines. This is the predominant method of track circuiting on overhead electrified {{parts of the}} UK rail network. One method provides 5 V DC to the rails, one of the rails being the traction return and the other being the signal rail. When a relay is energised and attached to the track, normal voltage is 5 V DC. When there is {{a break in the}} circuit and there is no train, the voltage rises to 9 V DC which provides a very good means for <b>fault</b> <b>finding.</b> This system filters out the voltage induced in the rails from the overhead lines.
