40|$|Optimum {{machining}} {{conditions were}} determined for various materials, steels, cast irons, brasseses, bronzes and an aluminium alloy. Surface finish readings were {{taken with the}} Sigmatex and the Surtronic and values of 10 micro-in and below were obtained at 0. 001 ipr feed both under dry and wet conditions. The tests were extended to higher feeds, the maximum being 0. 004 ipr; at this feed, the surface finish fell, in most cases, below 20 micro-in. it was found necessary to use high cutting speeds {{of the order of}} 800 to 1000 fpm in most cases. The most efficient tool used was a Titanium Carbide which successfully machined the whole range of test materials. The factors which were found to discourage the production of a good surface finish, given the right feed and speed, were scratching of the chip on the finished surface, bad blending of the nose radius with the two cutting edges, wrong order of grinding the <b>flank</b> <b>clearance</b> faces and the top rake face. The factors which encouraged a good surface finish were the choice of the right tool material, a suitable facet or chip deflector...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase pumping with twin-screw pumps is a {{relatively}} new technology that has been proven successful in a variety of field applications. It has three advantages such as less environment pollution, few separation equipments and more convenient operation than the conventional system. Despite many advantages of this technology, some problems have been encountered when operating under conditions with high gas volume fractions (GVF). While twin-screw multiphase pump is operating under high GVF conditions, the inner temperature of the pump increases obviously. The clearances between rotors change greatly and influence the volumetric efficiency of the twin-screw multiphase pumps. In some severe conditions, it may cause the pump damage. In this paper, the actual force and thermal boundary conditions are proposed through further investigations of pressure distributions and heat transfer. And then the screw rotor deformation and temperature field are calculated under different GVF conditions with ANSYS software. The results indicate that the main deformation of screw rotors is thermal deformation and the maximum radial deformation occurs {{on the top of the}} rotor in the discharge port. Through analyzing the influence of screw rotor deformation on the clearance, it can be realized that the greatest clearance changes are in the root of the rotor, followed by circumferential clearance, and there is no changes in <b>flank</b> <b>clearance...</b>|$|E
40|$|The scroll-type air motor, {{also named}} the scroll expander, {{has been widely}} used for {{different}} applications due to its characteristics of compact structure and high energy conversion efficiency. However, the leakage and the friction result in non-negligible energy losses. This paper presents the recent work on developing a new scroll-type air motor with mounted permanent magnetic spirals and investigates its potential in leakage reduction and efficiency improvement, especially at low-pressure air supply conditions. A method {{for the implementation of}} the magnetic scroll air motor is proposed. A prototype is manufactured and initial experimental tests are conducted to study the generalized torque distribution. A mathematical model for the magnetic scroll air motor is developed and a corresponding simulation study is presented. The study shows that the proposed magnetic scroll air motor structure is feasible in terms of manufacturing and has the potential to reduce the air leakage and thus to improve the energy efficiency by a maximum of around 15 % at a supply pressure of Pa with a <b>flank</b> leakage <b>clearance</b> reference of 0. 06 mm...|$|R
40|$|When {{establishing}} oil wells, pipe sections {{are connected}} {{by means of}} threaded couplings. In an effort to minimize the possibility of failure by jumpout, standard buttress connections were introduced. Part of their strength is directly acquired {{as a result of}} radial interference during make-up. This paper discusses the results of a numerical study evaluating the effect of make-up on the performance of a standard 4. 5 inch API buttress connection when axial tensile force is applied. In order to characterize the structural performance, the load distribution along the coupling length is evaluated, combined with a parameter defining thread separation. The latter is indicative for jumpout and the tendency of creating a leak path throughout the thread helix. From the results it is clear that relative axial displacement within the coupling occurs, even when made up, because of an initial clearance among the load and stab <b>flanks.</b> This <b>clearance</b> may cause a connection to leak through the thread helix when available thread compound cannot heal this leak path. Despite undesirable effects on the sealability and rigidness of this joint, such a clearance is required to decrease frictional forces during make-up while maintaining the desired radial interference...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of skin lymph flow was investigated using an isotope clearance technique (ICT). Multiple lymph flow determinations were {{undertaken in the}} skin of anaesthetized large white pigs to test for reproducibility, ascertain the most suitable tracer, study the influence of injection dynamics, and observe the effect of massage as a stimulus to lymph flow. Blood clearance of tracer was also investigated. Results demonstrated that lymphatic clearance is a mono-exponential function with good reproducibility under controlled laboratory conditions. 99 mTc-colloid (TCK 17 Cis) compared favorably with 131 I-human serum albumin as a tracer and both performed better than colloid gold (198 Au). Lymph flow was significantly faster in one pig than in the other. No difference existed between left and right sides or between caudal and rostral sites on each <b>flank,</b> but <b>clearance</b> was significantly slower in thigh than flank skin. Sub-epidermal injections cleared faster and more consistently than either deep or subcutaneous injections. Neither injection volume nor needle tract backflow of tracer influenced results, but local massage significantly enhanced clearance. Escape of 99 Tc-colloid by the blood was negligible. These results indicate that skin lymph flow can be reliably measured when conditions are controlled. Extrinsic factors such as massage strongly influence lymph flow. Greater sensitivity in detecting degrees of lymphatic insufficiency may be achieved if a standardized stimulus to lymph flow is administered during isotope clearance measurement...|$|R
40|$|Turning {{trials were}} {{performed}} under dry cutting conditions with constant {{depth of cut}} in order to investigate the usability of coated TiCN based cermet (KT 315) and coated carbide (KC 9110) cutting tools to turn tempered martensitic stainless tool steel with hardness in the 43 - 45 HRC range. Cutting speed, feed and the side cutting edge angle (SCEA) of the tool were the independent variables considered. Regardless of the cutting tool material, cutting speed and feed expectedly {{have an effect on}} tool wear and tool life. Additionally, the SCEA is found to influence the tool life where the tool life increases, as the SCEA was changed from 0 Â° to - 5 Â°. The longest tool life was attainable when cutting with KT 315 at low cutting speed and feed rate when using - 5 Â° SCEA. However, in all other instances, KC 9110 outperforms KT 315. This is particularly evident at medium and high cutting speeds and feed. The constant and exponent for the various Taylor tool life equations have been determined. <b>Flank</b> wear, end <b>clearance</b> wear and catastrophic failure were the main types of tool failure mode determining tool life. The wear mechanisms for the various tool failure modes were suggested. The results suggest that dry turning of hardened, stainless tool steel could be performed using coated TiCN based cermet and coated carbide cutting tools with - 5 Â° SCEA at suitably selected cutting speed and feed combination...|$|R
40|$|Twin {{screw pumps}} (TSPs) are {{commonly}} used for multiphase boosting systems to enhance oil and gas production. TSPs are a positive displacement pump that can efficiently handle fluids {{with a wide range}} of gas volume fractions (GVFs). The present study has developed a model to predict the performance of TSPs for varying GVFs, pump speeds, suction pressures, and differential pressures. A two-phase compressible flow model is used to determine the rate of leakage backflow through clearances within the pump. The model incorporates the possibility of choking due to sonic flow. Hydraulic imbalances cause rotor deflection, and the model accounts for increased leakage flowrates due to the induced eccentric rotation. The model was validated with experimental data from a Colfax MR- 200 TSP, and there is good agreement in most test cases. However, cases with low speeds and high differential pressures were not as reliable. This may be due to uncertainty of the rates of gas infiltration into the clearances at low pump speeds. The study reveals that pump performance is generally better when operating at high pump speeds, high GVF, low suction pressures, or low differential pressures. Linear pressure distributions throughout the pump?s chambers generally indicate lower volumetric efficiency compared to steep, concave pressure distributions. The effects of rotor deflection are generally small, but in a few cases they should not be ignored. Choking occurred at the circumferential, <b>flank,</b> and root <b>clearances</b> in 18 %, 13 %, and 99 % of the test cases, respectively. The presence of choked leakage flow marginally improved the pump performance...|$|R
40|$|Hardened {{steel is}} widely used in the {{manufacture}} of dies, mould and automotive components such as bearings, gears and shafts. The continuous improvements and developments in cutting tool technology coupled with the availability of suitable machine tools have made it possible to machine steel in its hardened form thereby eliminating the heat treatment step, which is required in the conventional approach. Commercially available plastic mould steel, Stavax ESR, which is a premium grade stainless tool steel, has been hardened to (43 ~ 45 HRC) and turned using two commercially available cutting tool inserts with various side cutting edge angles and at various cutting speeds and feed rates. Turning was performed dry and a constant depth of cut was set. The cutting tool inserts used were physical vapor deposition (PVD) multi coated TiCN based cermet grade with TiN inner layer, TiCN intermediate layer and a TiN outer layer (KT 315); and a cobalt enriched, multi coated carbide grade with thick moderate temperature chemical vapor deposition (MTCVD) - TiCN inner layer, an Al 2 O 3 intermediate layer and TiCN and TiN outer layers (KC 9110). Tool performance, tool failure modes and wear mechanisms of the said tools were investigated under various cutting conditions. The surface roughness of the turned part and the chip morphology were studied while the cutting forces were also measured. The performance of the cutting tools is described using response surface methodology. The cutting speed and feed are found {{have an effect on the}} various responses investigated. Additionally, the side cutting edge angle is also found to provide secondary contribution to the tool life and surface roughness. The use of - 5 o side cutting edge angle resulted in longest tool and better surface roughness. The mathematical models developed are statistically valid and sound, particularly for Fc. These are verified by the confirmation run experiments and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. KC 9110 outperformed KT 315 in terms of tool life for almost all of the cutting conditions tested. The only exception is at a low feed rate of 0. 09 mm/rev and a low cutting speed of 100 m/min where the tool life of KT 315 was more than 30 minutes and this was the longest tool life achievable. For KT 315, flank wear and catastrophic failure are the dominant failure modes whereas for KC 9110 it was end <b>clearance</b> wear and <b>flank</b> wear. <b>Flank</b> and end <b>clearance</b> wear probably occur by both abrasive and adhesive wear mechanisms with abrasive wear being the major source of material removal. Catastrophic failure could be associated with a combination of abrasion, adhesion, diffusion, fracture and plastic deformation wear mechanisms. Saw-tooth chips are produced at almost all conditions with the exception of cutting at low cutting speed and feed. White layers are also detected on the chip underside...|$|R
