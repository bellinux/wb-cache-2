The Greeks are also given credit with spreading the story of a mythological race of women warriors named Amazons. En-hedu-ana, a priestess in Ancient Iraq who dedicated <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sumerian goddess Inanna, has the distinction of signing the oldest-surviving signed poetry in history. She characterized herself as Inanna's spouse.|$|E

Meredith (Kate Flannery) disgusts the rest of the employees by wearing a very short dress without any panties or a bra, thus exposing <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of the office as she tries to adjust it to meet Toby's requests.
