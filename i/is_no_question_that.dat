5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The later {{history of}} Kent shows clear {{evidence}} {{of a system of}} joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. This evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that Æthelberht ruled as joint king with his son, Eadbald. It may be that Æthelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history. Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with Æthelberht, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Æthelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin saw that it was in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group {{had a very}} {{successful}} deployment. The talented and dedicated Sailors of this group demonstrated tremendous operational flexibility and performed {{at the highest levels}} of excellence across the warfare spectrum and core capabilities of the Maritime Strategy. They were warriors, ambassadors, partners and humanitarians. They represent all that is good in our country and I'm profoundly honored to sail with this impressive strike group.|$|E
25|$|As {{the inquiry}} unfolded, home videos of {{initiation}} rites in the CAR's French-speaking commando {{found their way}} into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995. It has been suggested that this move was as much driven by budget cuts to the Canadian Forces as by the Somalia Affair, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the affair gave the minister the public support needed to make his request for disbandment.|$|E

50|$|While there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Suydam owned property, the {{opposing}} party raised challenges {{on grounds that}} Suydam was more female-looking than male-looking, and therefore ineligible for voting and raising suspicions of fraud.|$|R

25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Pridi wanted to remove Phibun from power, and the war offered an {{opportunity}} to do so. However, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> Pridi recognised well before the war that Thailand's alignment with the Axis powers would work to Phibun's advantage and enable him to strengthen his dictatorship. Even the Japanese recognised Pridi's hostility, which is why he was forced out of the cabinet in December 1941. It was the reason every knowledgeable person on the Allied side, from Seni Pramoj and Prince Suphasawat, a chief organiser of the movement in Great Britain, to former British ambassador Josiah Crosby, anticipated that Pridi would emerge as the head of a domestic resistance movement.|$|E
25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she {{spent a good deal}} of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E

There might have been a federal Constitution without Madison but certainly no Bill of Rights." ...|$|E

500|$|Wark {{was not a}} [...] "supremely talented" [...] player, but, {{according}} to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity {{greater than the sum}} of its parts." [...] He has been described as [...] "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".|$|E

500|$|Modern {{historians have}} been {{divided on the}} issue. T. F. Tout, writing in 1914, {{rejected}} the idea. J. S. Hamilton, who wrote a biography of Gaveston in 1988, {{on the other hand}} says that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the king and his favourite were lovers". Pierre Chaplais, writing a few years later, had more reservations. Chaplais cites the fact that Edward had four children with his wife – and even an extra-marital son – as well as the relative silence of contemporary commentators on the topic. He also finds {{it hard to believe that}} Philip IV of France would have allowed the English king to marry his daughter Isabella if Edward was known to be homosexual. Mark Ormrod has pointed out the inherent anachronism of speaking of homosexuality in a medieval context. Instead Ormrod suggests the focus should be on the motivation behind the use of sexuality in contemporary attacks on the King and Gaveston.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> [...] {{is a fan}} service." [...] He called it a [...] "mixed bag"; on one hand, he noted {{that some of the}} scenes were clever, such as Darryl's opinion on portraying a black {{president}} before Obama was elected. On the other hand, however, he felt that Michael's [...] "juvenile" [...] response to Holly was uncharacteristic, and the [...] "oddly high production values and camera work" [...] were unrealistic for the show. He also felt the inclusion of some characters—such as Roy, Jan, or Karen—did not make sense {{in the context of the}} series. He concluded, however, that while the episode had issues, [...] "the actual content of Threat Level Midnight was successful in more ways than I had expected". Rick Porter of Zap2it gave the episode a more mixed review, saying that it [...] "had moments that were a huge amount of fun, both inside Michael's labor of love and in people's reaction to it. But it also felt a little bit clip-showy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{dichotomy}} {{with which}} historians view Stephens aside, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> {{the black population}} of the time revered him [...] and Sen.
