5000|$|The {{original}} <b>dusters</b> were full-length, light-colored canvas or linen coats worn by horsemen {{to protect}} their clothing from trail dust.

5|$|Unit {{prices have}} been readjusted and some units renamed, {{as well as new}} ones introduced. New land units include the Bike, a highly mobile {{infantry}} unit that can capture properties; the Flare, an armored vehicle unit that can reveal areas affected by the Fog of War; the Anti-Tank, an indirect-fire unit strong against tanks with the ability to counter-attack during direct attacks; and the War Tank (formerly the Mega Tank), the strongest ground unit in the game. New air units include the <b>Duster,</b> a weaker, lower-cost interceptor that can strike ground units; and the Seaplane, which is produced by Carriers and can attack any unit, but has limited ammo and fuel reserves. Additionally, there is a single new sea unit, the Gunboat, which is armed with a missile salvo that must be resupplied after each use, and can transport one infantry/mech unit. Also, the Battleship was given the ability to move and fire in the same turn, making it the only indirect-combat unit able to do so.|$|E

25|$|A feather <b>duster</b> is an {{implement}} used for cleaning. It consists typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire. In 1870, {{the original idea}} for the feather <b>duster</b> was conceived in a broom factory in Jones County, Iowa. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking {{if they could be}} used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather <b>duster.</b> Using a short broom stick and splitting the feathers with a pocket knife, the <b>duster</b> was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag <b>Duster</b> Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of Iowa.|$|E

50|$|In {{their first}} year in the af2, the Amarillo <b>Dusters</b> reached the playoffs with an 8-8 record, which {{was good enough for}} a wildcard. The <b>Dusters,</b> quarterbacked by Julian Reese, came from 21 points down {{at the start of the}} 4th quarter to quiet the Cox Convention Center crowd to win Round 1 over the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz. The <b>Dusters</b> fell in Round 2 to the eventual-af2 {{champion}} Memphis Xplorers.|$|R

25|$|An adult worm {{typically}} {{has about}} 40 radioles in its crown, covered by tiny, hair-like branches called cilia. This arrangement gives the crown {{the appearance of}} a small fan or feather <b>duster</b> (for which the animals are often referred to as fanworms, or feather <b>duster</b> worms). When extended, these heavily ciliated radioles trap particles of organic matter and transport them towards the mouth.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} EP was distributed, Colgrove {{departed}} the <b>Dusters</b> {{to establish his}} web design business called Threespot Media. Mark Lacrasse joined the band briefly as the <b>Dusters</b> guest bassist in order to record their debut studio album, Simplicity. It was released in October 1998 under the name the Capitol City <b>Dusters</b> to avoid confusion between groups with a similar alias. After recruiting Jesse Quitsland, the band embarked on a US tour in late 1998 and early 1999 followed by a European tour accompanied with Spanish band Aina. The two acts concluded the tour with a split single, and the Capitol City <b>Dusters</b> took a year-long hiatus to rest from their hectic scheduling.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dusters</b> {{tried to}} build on the {{moderate}} success they had in 2005. However, in 2006, the team suffered many injuries and failed {{to make it to the}} af2 playoffs. Quarterback Steve Panella was injured early in the season, forcing numerous backups to take the job. The <b>Dusters</b> also lost some lost receivers. They ended the season with a 4-12 record. Carthel left to take the head coaching job at West Texas A&M two games into the <b>Dusters</b> first af2 season.|$|R

50|$|With the af2 {{breaking}} up and its larger market teams {{moving to the}} newly reformed Arena Football League, the <b>Dusters</b> were forced {{to find a new}} league. On October 9, 2009, it was announced that, because of a 65-35 percent margin in the fan vote, the <b>Dusters</b> would be moving to the Indoor Football League for the 2010 season. Owner Randy Sanders applied for his team's spot in the Indoor Football League (IFL) and they were accepted as an expansion franchise. It was announced on January 28, 2010, that the <b>Dusters</b> would have to be renamed, because the Arena Football League owns the rights to the <b>Dusters</b> name and logo. On February 8, the new Amarillo Venom name and logo was unveiled.|$|R

25|$|The {{first group}} {{from this period}} to attain some {{prominence}} was Mortification, a Melbourne Christian metal band that had evolved out of an 1980s thrash group called Light Force. Having already established some international links from that time, Mortification was signed internationally by Nuclear Blast almost immediately, becoming the first Australian band to be carried by the German metal-specialist label. Another Melbourne act establishing a legacy was diSEMBOWELMENT, a studio bound band that was developing a unique blend of slow and heavy doom mixed with ambience and combined with death metal and grindcore. A demo found the attention of Relapse Records who released the Transcendence Into The Peripheral album in 1993. Other Melbourne groups like Damaged and Blood <b>Duster</b> were also becoming established. Damaged, who had formed in Ballarat in 1989, played violently extreme music that combined death and black metal and grindcore with a hardcore element and Blood <b>Duster</b> mixed thirty-second grind songs with larrikinism and loutish humour. The notorious Sadistik Exekution had finally released an album, The Magus, in 1991 but their levels of extremity were rivalled by Melbourne band Corpse Molestation. By 1993, as the impact of Norway's black metal movement was beginning to be felt, this band had adopted the trappings and style of that scene and become known as Bestial Warlust. After two albums, the group splintered apart but various members continued {{in a similar vein}} in other acts including Deströyer 666, Abominator and Gospel of the Horns.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could shake his <b>duster</b> and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} {{diversity of}} species exists. Since coldwater coral reefs only occur at great depths, most hobbyists are largely confined to fish, sea anemones, crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and Feather <b>duster</b> worms. A few corals {{can be found}} at low depths. Since there are very few commercially available coldwater fish and invertebrates, hobbyists usually have to physically acquire specimens, although recently more specimens have become commercially available from the west coast of the United States as well as Japan, Australia, and the UK. The most common methods of acquisition are by trolling or seining, and experienced hobbyists use the movement of tides and searching methods to find certain species. Unlike commercially available tropical fish, whose behavior patterns and tank compatibilities have been well documented in the last five or six decades, coldwater fish have been kept in public and private aquaria for over two centuries and much ichthyological knowledge has been gathered in order to maintain them.|$|E
25|$|Belle, however, is not {{oblivious}} to her peers' views of her. She voices her {{concerns about it}} to her eccentric father and inventor, Maurice who assures her that she is anything but strange ("No Matter What"). The two then put {{the finishing touches on}} his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle ("No Matter What {Reprise]"), but becomes lost in the woods and attacked by a pack of wolves. After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle where the servants, including Lumière, a maître d' turned into a candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household turned into a clock, Babette, a maid turned into a feather <b>duster</b> that still seems to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen turned into a teapot, and Chip, her son turned into a teacup. They welcome him, but the horrid Beast arrives and locks Maurice away in the dungeon for trespassing.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the {{influence}} of American and Swedish death metal bands was quickly evident. Many of the thrash bands of the 1980s had disbanded and heavier groups were beginning to fill the void, such as Necrotomy, Acheron, Disembowlment, Corpse Molestation, Damnatory, Hecatomb, Damaged, Anatomy and Blood <b>Duster</b> in Melbourne, Dreamkillers, Obfuscate Mass, Misery and Mausoleum in Brisbane, Aftermath, Apostasy and Cruciform from Sydney and Psychrist and Alchemist from Canberra. Perhaps due to magazines like Hot Metal and the occasional exposure to extreme metal on some community radio programs, bands like these were appearing at a high rate. Shock Records, the Melbourne independent label, commissioned a compilation album to highlight some of these new acts. Come to Daddy was released in 1992 and compiled by Hot Metal writer Ian McFarlane; it contained 14 tracks from bands like Necrotomy, Mausoleum, Mystic Insight, Deracination, Obfuscate Mass, Misery, Discarnated, Entasis, iNFeCTeD, Open Festering Wounds, and Persecution. When McFarlane went to Roadrunner Records' Australian office the following year, he put together another compilation, Redrum, collecting tracks from another group of completely different bands like Alchemist, Sadistik Exekution, Frozen Doberman, Allegiance and Hecatomb.|$|E
