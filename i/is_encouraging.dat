5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, trawls, dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
5|$|Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou) informs Paul {{that he has}} leukaemia and {{he starts}} him on a course of chemotherapy. Paul hires Naomi as his {{assistant}} and she helps to keep his diagnosis a secret. When Paul collapses, he calls Karl for help and tells him about his diagnosis. Nick tells Paul that his body has stopped responding to the chemotherapy. Paul wants Karl to succeed him as mayor and he asks Naomi to find his daughter Amy. While Naomi <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> Paul to be more positive, she kisses him. She apologises, but they both develop feelings for each other. Paul asks Naomi to shave his head when his hair starts falling out, and he sells Lassiter's to the Quill Group. Paul collapses from pneumonia and is hospitalised. Nick tells Paul that his cancer is in remission, but Georgia claims that Paul never had cancer and Nick is found to have doctored Paul's patient files. He is arrested soon after. Paul tries to forget about his feelings for Naomi, by pushing her and Brennan back together. However, Naomi discovers their plan and breaks up with Brennan. The Quill Group sell Lassiter's back to Paul and he and Naomi kiss. Amy (Zoe Cramond) turns up at the penthouse and is angered when Paul does not immediately recognise her, she later leaves town.|$|E
5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking others. Because of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.|$|E

25|$|Anti-fracking campaigners, {{including}} Greenpeace, {{have said}} that fracking is the Department of Energy's attempt to distract from investment in renewable energy.

25|$|Victoria Park is {{a region}} of focused {{municipal}} redevelopment. The City of Calgary has declared it a Business Revitalization Zone (BRZ) and <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> a progressive redevelopment of the much-maligned community. The 42 and 34-story residential Arriva project, the tallest condominium development west of Toronto; the Sasso and Vetro development; the Colours project; and the multi-use Hotel Arts Centre, suggest a vibrant and renewed future for Victoria Park, {{with a great deal}} of investment and interest.|$|E
25|$|While many kitchens {{belonging}} to poor families {{continue to use}} clay stoves and the older forms of fuel, the urban middle and upper classes usually have gas stoves with cylinders or piped gas attached. Electric cooktops are rarer since they consume {{a great deal of}} electricity, but microwave ovens are gaining popularity in urban households and commercial enterprises. Indian kitchens are also supported by biogas and solar energy as fuel. World's largest solar energy kitchen is built in India. In association with government bodies, India <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> domestic biogas plants to support the kitchen system.|$|E

25|$|A {{privatisation}} {{drive that}} stalled last June resumed in April, {{when the government}} sold its stake in HBL Pakistan for $1billion. Three-quarters of bids came from foreign investors. Pakistan's stock market has doubled in dollar terms {{since the start of}} 2012, {{thanks in large part to}} such foreign interest. The Economist said that the progress in providing economic stability <b>is</b> <b>encouraging.</b> But Pakistan needs sustained growth of 5–7% a year if it is markedly to cut poverty-at the last count, nearly a quarter of Pakistanis were below the poverty line.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also argued}} that this {{augmented}} understanding of etiology will lead to better remediation and rehabilitation strategies through {{an understanding of the}} different levels in the causal process where one can intervene. It may be that non-organic interventions, like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), better attenuate disorders alone or in conjunction with drugs. Linden's (2006) demonstration of how psychotherapy has neurobiological commonalities with pharmacotherapy is a pertinent example of this and <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> from a patient perspective as the potentiality for pernicious side effects is decreased while self-efficacy is increased.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 2010, the EC adopted {{guidelines}} {{explaining how}} the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) should be implemented, as the Directive came {{into effect in}} December 2010. Three measures focus on the criteria for sustainability of biofuels and how to control that only sustainable biofuels {{are used in the}} EU. First, the Commission <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> E.U. nations, industry and NGOs to set up voluntary schemes to certify biofuel sustainability. Second, the EC laid down the rules to protect untouched nature, such as forests, wetlands and protected areas, and third, a set of rules to guarantee that biofuels deliver substantial reduction in well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

25|$|The two World Wars curbed the {{continuous}} expansion that Wallonia had enjoyed up till that time. Towards {{the end of}} the 1950s, things began to change dramatically. The factories of Wallonia were by then antiquated, the coal was running out and the cost of extracting coal was constantly rising. It was the end of an era, and Wallonia has been making efforts to redefine itself. The restoration of economical development is high on the political agenda, and the government <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> development of industries, notably in cutting edge technology and in business parks. The economy is improving, but Wallonia is not yet at the level of Flanders and is still suffering from difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by her {{assistant}} 's compassion, Twilight realizes {{that if she}} shows her friends their true destinies and reminds them of what they mean to each other, she {{may be able to}} reverse the spell. One by one, she shows each of her friends what their true calling <b>is,</b> <b>encouraging</b> them to help each other fix things. Each friend becomes aware of her original life and regains her original cutie mark with help of her respective Element, and Ponyville is quickly restored to normal. Twilight realizes that her friendship with the other ponies is a factor that Star Swirl had not accounted for, and is able to complete the spell. Upon doing so, the Elements worn by her friends activate on their own, engulfing Twilight in a bright light and causing her to disappear.|$|E
25|$|The Somali {{diaspora}} is inter-connected via {{information exchange}} and informal money transfer systems. Somalis in the UK operates various business networks, with the Somaliland Chamber of Commerce having an office locally. Another Somali business network, the Midlands Somali Business Association, a non-profit organisation centered in Birmingham, offers commercial advice to Somali businesses {{based in the}} city. It also publishes a quarterly newsletter and runs workshops and conferences for the local Somali business community. Additionally, the number of Somali businesses in the UK is increasing, ranging from restaurants, remittance companies, hairdressing salons and travel agencies to, especially, internet cafés. Although some of these businesses cater to mainstream British society, most are aimed at a Somali clientele. However, the Midlands Somali Business Association has recognised {{the potential benefits of}} penetrating the larger British business community, and <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> stakeholders to tap into this sector. The organisation is also exploring opportunities for transnational businesses.|$|E

25|$|The Internet allows {{computer}} users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with computer security, i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, {{depending on the}} requirements. This <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before {{the widespread use of}} the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps {{on the other side of}} the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.|$|E
500|$|The {{association}} claims one of {{its biggest}} challenges <b>is</b> <b>encouraging</b> more adults to volunteer {{to reduce the number}} of young people currently on waiting lists (around 40,000).

Suzy comes in and tells Fauna of the date; that Doc made no pass at her, and that Doc confided how lonely he is. She is convinced Doc [...] "don't need nobody like me"; he needs a wife. Fauna <b>is</b> <b>encouraging,</b> but Suzy believes that Doc, knowing what he does of her history and work, will not want her. The Flophouse is to host a fancy dress party the following night, at which the raffle is to take place—Fauna proposes that at the party, Suzy sing [...] "Will You Marry Me?" [...] to Doc. Suzy is still nervous; Fauna reminds her that the previous night, Doc did not treat her like a tramp, and she did not act like one.
