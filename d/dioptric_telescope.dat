50|$|A refracting {{telescope}} (also called a refractor) {{is a type}} of optical telescope that uses a lens as its objective to form an image (also referred to a <b>dioptric</b> <b>telescope).</b> The {{refracting telescope}} design was originally used in spy glasses and astronomical telescopes but is also used for long focus camera lenses. Although large refracting telescopes were very popular {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, for most research purposes the refracting telescope has been superseded by the reflecting telescope which allows larger apertures. A refractor's magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the objective lens by that of the eyepiece.|$|E
5000|$|The PLATO payload {{is based}} on a multi-telescope approach, {{involving}} a set of 24 [...] "normal cameras" [...] working at a readout cadence of 25 sec and monitoring stars fainter than mV = 8 (apparent visual magnitude), plus two [...] "fast cameras" [...] working at a cadence of 2.5 sec, and observing stars in the magnitude range 4 to 8. The cameras are based on a fully <b>dioptric</b> <b>telescope</b> including 6 lenses; each camera has an 1100 deg2 field, and a pupil diameter of 120 mm. Each camera is equipped with its own CCD focal plane array, consisting of 4 CCDs with 4510 x 4510 pixels.|$|E
