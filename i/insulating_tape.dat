The experiments {{has been carried out}} to study the tape fin effect by using full length tape inserts of different materials namely Aluminum, Stainless steel and <b>insulated</b> <b>tape.</b> The tapes have twist ratios from 5. 2 to 3. 4. It is found that, for the flow in smooth tubes, full length twisted tapes yield improvement in average Nusselt number, for Reynolds number range of 200 to 2000. For Aluminum tapes, the maximum improvement in Nusselt number range from 50 % to 100 %; for Stainless steel tapes, maximum improvement in Nusselt number range from 40 % to 94 % and for <b>insulated</b> <b>tapes,</b> maximum improvement in Nusselt number range from 40 % to 67 %.

2500|$|Jackson had {{allegedly}} {{been using}} the tape whilst lapping hoses for beer kegs at the bar.

The effect, on the self field AC losses, of an inhomogenous distribution of critical current along the length of the tape is also discussed. Measurement of the frequency response of the losses show the importance of the eddy currents induced in the silver sheath.

40|$|AbstractMeasurements of V-I {{characteristics}} and AC losses of YBCO single pancakes and multipancake coils have been performed. YBCO pancakes and coils were wet-wound using non-insulated YBCO tapes. Layer-to-layer insulation {{was achieved by}} using epoxy filled with alumina particles that ensures higher effective current density of the coil in comparison with coils of standard <b>insulated</b> <b>tapes.</b> This procedure also improves the coil's thermal conductivity in the direction perpendicular to the tape plane. Static and alternating magnetic fields have been applied to the AC current carrying coils during measurements. DC magnetic fields up to 50 mT affect the V-I curves only slightly. On the other hand, AC magnetic fields with amplitudes up to 50 mT and frequencies 4 - 100 Hz change {{the form of the}} V-I curves and strongly reduce the critical current. AC losses and their distribution along the coil were measured by electrical and calorimetric methods. It was found that AC losses peak at the central region of the coil and depend strongly on distance between adjacent pancakes. Surprisingly, adjacent pancakes, even if kept in an open circuit state, increase the losses of a current carrying pancake. It is suggested that introduction of gaps between pancakes/double pancakes can be used as means for decreasing AC losses in multi-pancakes YBCO coils...|$|R

40|$|A {{literature}} {{review of the}} state of the art of HTS AC losses and power devices determined that the subject of low AC loss HTS tapes required additional work and input and that these could be applied to HTS transformers to obtain a device with lowered AC loss compared to using straight filament tape. A procedure for manufacturing short lengths of twisted filament tape, with novel matrix alloys, and physically distinct filaments was developed. Two alloys were used for the matrix material and the range of twist pitches was from 4 to 20 mm. Tapes samples with twist pitches of 10 and 8 mm were produced with Ic 2 ̆ 7 s of 40 A. The AC losses were measured at power fi-equencies in fields up to 0. 04 T using a pick-up loop and a lock-in amplifier technique. Control samples of HTS tapes with straight filaments were found to have an AC loss which was predicted very well by the estabhshed equations in the literature. Some twisted filament samples had an AC loss signature that showed a significant lowering of the losses in the range of 0. 01 to 0. 03 T. No straight filament samples, however, were found to have lowered losses, including those with novel matrix alloys.
