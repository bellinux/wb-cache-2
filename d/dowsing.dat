5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965. It {{dealt with the}} theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, {{and that they could}} be detected using pendulum <b>dowsing.</b> In 1966 he published A Step in the Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum <b>dowsing</b> present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E
5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general hotkey actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the <b>Dowsing</b> search function switches to a first-person view: <b>Dowsing</b> scans an area for a selected object, with new <b>Dowsing</b> objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{characters}} in the Sonic series, Amy can run at superhuman speeds but not as fast as Sonic. She attacks foes with her ever-present signature weapon, the Piko-Piko Hammer, with which she is very proficient. She also has other minor skills such as tarot card reading and <b>dowsing.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1809, Angel {{was heard}} {{as a witness}} at a trial where William <b>Dowse,</b> a lawyer from the county seat Cooperstown, {{appeared}} for the defense. After the trial, Angel was hired by <b>Dowse</b> as a handyman and, while working for <b>Dowse,</b> he read law and became a clerk in <b>Dowse's</b> office.|$|R
50|$|William <b>Dowse</b> {{lived in}} the house until his death in 1951. Florence <b>Dowse</b> {{remained}} for another two years before moving to Comstock; she died in 1969. The final occupants of the house were the family of William <b>Dowse,</b> Jr., who remained there until 1959, the year before his death.|$|R

5|$|Thomas Charles Lethbridge (23 March 1901 – 30 September 1971), {{better known}} as T.C. Lethbridge, was an English archaeologist, parapsychologist, and explorer. A {{specialist}} in Anglo-Saxon archaeology, he served as honorary Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology from 1923 to 1957, and {{over the course of}} his lifetime wrote twenty-four books on various subjects, becoming particularly well known for his advocacy of <b>dowsing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William <b>Dowsing</b> was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} {{university}} museum in 1957, Lethbridge moved with his wife to Branscombe, Devon. There he devoted himself to researching paranormal phenomena, publishing a string of {{books on the subject}} aimed at a popular rather than academic audience. Most of this involved his research into the use of pendulums for <b>dowsing,</b> although in other publications he championed the witch-cult hypothesis of Margaret Murray, articulated the Stone Tape theory as an explanation for ghost sightings, and argued that extraterrestrial species were involved in shaping human evolution; in this he came to embrace and perpetuate the esoteric ideas of the Earth mysteries movement. Although his work in parapsychology was derided and ignored as pseudo-scientific by the academic establishment, he attracted a cult following, and his work was posthumously championed by esotericists like Colin Wilson and Julian Cope. In 2011 he was made the subject of a biography by Terry Welbourn.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dowse,</b> {{who spoke}} some German, befriended a German {{corporal}} who worked alongside <b>Dowse</b> in the camp′s censor office. From this contact, <b>Dowse</b> {{was able to}} gain useful information and documents which aided the camp escape organisation. He was able to 'borrow' a genuine gate pass, which was copied by the camp's forgery department, and a copy was used on the delousing break mass escape in June 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Rev. Edmund <b>Dowse</b> House is a {{historic}} house at 25 Farm Road in Sherborn, Massachusetts. The Greek Revival house was built in 1838 for the Rev. Edmund <b>Dowse,</b> the first pastor of the Evangelical Society (now the Pilgrim Church), whose sone, William Bradford Homer <b>Dowse,</b> was a major benefactor of the town. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.|$|R
50|$|James Mack was the {{director}} of The <b>Dowse</b> Art Museum in Lower Hutt between 1981 and 1988. Art historian Douglas Lloyd Jenkins writes 'Under {{the director}}ship of James Mack...The <b>Dowse</b> Art Museum in Lower Hutt championed New Zealand craft and repositioned the gallery as a repository of decorative rather than fine arts.'Mack redefined The <b>Dowse’s</b> collection policy so that the focus was upon building a nationally and internationally significant collection of craft and applied art, including ceramics, jewellery, glass and textile art. The <b>Dowse</b> also programmed exhibitions that celebrated a range of craft artists and their practices, such as Pakohe in 1986, which celebrated master craftsmen working in stone.|$|R
5|$|When {{creating}} Link's sword movements, {{the team}} initially {{wanted them to}} be as realistic as possible, but as this was being detrimental to the character's portrayal, they had to include unrealistic movements to preserve the atmosphere. The Skyward Strike was initially born from Aonuma thinking up a possible mechanic of holding the sword still above Link: these also gave rise to the game's title. Having sword fighting relying on Wii MotionPlus freed up other buttons on the controller, allowing the addition of the Dash sprinting option. So as not to interrupt the flow of gameplay, they incorporated other elements into the Dash function, such as scaling walls rather than just slamming into them. The <b>Dowsing</b> mechanic was created early on, based on the gameplay themes of discovery and exploration. Due to the introduction of <b>Dowsing,</b> the team did not have to create environmental landmarks for places and objects of importance as they had done in previous titles. So players would not get lost in the terrain, they also introduced the marker beacons. Items were designed so they could be visible in any area, such as the bright blue Bombs. They were also designed based on their original location: those from Skyloft used a bird motif, while those from other Surface regions used more intricate designs. The Beetle acted as a replacement for the Boomarang, as the team wanted an item that players could control. The Beetle and other pseudo-technical items gave rise to the ancient mechanical theme that appeared in the Lanayru Desert region. At Miyamoto's insistence, the more desirable items that were normally placed towards the end of a campaign were made available to players from an early stage. When designing items, the developers were faced with the usual problems of the interdependence of items and dungeons creating a chicken-and-egg scenario for the developers. The menu for Item access was also redesigned around the use of Wii MotionPlus.|$|E

500|$|The first {{homestead}} {{established in}} Custer County {{was that of}} Lewis R. and Sarah M. <b>Dowse,</b> who in August 1873 occupied a site on the Middle Loup River.

25|$|Science {{writers such}} as William Benjamin Carpenter (1877), Millais Culpin (1920) and Martin Gardner (1957) {{considered}} the movement of <b>dowsing</b> rods {{to be the result}} of unconscious muscular action. This view is widely accepted amongst the scientific community. The <b>dowsing</b> apparatus is known to amplify slight movements of the hands caused by a phenomenon known as the ideomotor effect: people's subconscious minds may influence their bodies without consciously deciding to take action. This would make the <b>dowsing</b> rod susceptible to the diviner's subconscious knowledge or perception; but also to confirmation bias.|$|E

50|$|Sherborn was a sparsely {{populated}} town {{until the time}} of the American Revolutionary War. The Edward's Plain area, in the south of the district, was probably named for Edward West, who was appointed the local schoolmaster in 1694. <b>Dowse's</b> Corner, {{at the north end of}} the district, is named for Ebenezer <b>Dowse,</b> who settled in Sherborn after fleeing Charlestown before the 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. <b>Dowse</b> became a significant figure in the local industrial pursuits, establishing an early tannery in the buggy lowlands behind his house. Members of the <b>Dowse</b> family built a number of the houses in the area, predominantly Greek Revival houses built c. 1840-60. <b>Dowse's</b> efforts were the beginning of a cottage industry in shoe-making which persisted into the early 20th century. Most of the buildings associated with this and other small industry have either been lost to fire, been converted to residential uses, or moved out of the area.|$|R
