50|$|This course teaches drivers about <b>eco-driving.</b> <b>Eco-driving</b> {{is a set}} {{of simple}} driving habits that result in using less fuel, {{generating}} fewer emissions, and increasing safety. The course first explains the science behind <b>eco-driving,</b> as well as the environmental and mechanical benefits of doing so. Drivers are taught techniques such as avoiding aggressive acceleration, speeding and braking monitoring speed to maintain efficient and consistent speed; keeping RPM levels as low as possible for the speed and keeping the vehicle properly maintained, that they can use in their everyday driving in order to cut back on fuel consumption. The typical eco-driver can increase fuel efficiency by 10-30%.

The study aimed on to determine the understanding of <b>eco-driving</b> and how far UMP drivers adopt the ecodriving concepts. This study limits its study area to University Malaysia Pahang Campus Gambang. Based on the study, data for understanding of <b>eco-driving,</b> practicing of ecodriving and how often they practicing <b>eco-driving</b> in their journey were obtained from 240 participants at University Malaysia Pahang Campus Gambang. Results shows that a majority of UMP community understood about <b>eco-driving</b> concepts but there is a few number of participants still do not understand about <b>eco-driving</b> concepts where most of them are students. This is because the information about <b>eco-driving</b> is not fully conveyed to the students.

40|$|One {{strategy}} {{to reduce the}} environmental impact of the transport sector is to increase the adoption of <b>eco-driving</b> among both professional and private drivers. Attempts to introduce <b>eco-driving</b> have though had varying success, and many questions remain to be answered. Hence, the aim of this thesis has been to increase knowledge on the mechanisms behind the adoption of <b>eco-driving.</b> To fulfil the aim, three themes: <b>eco-driving</b> in practice, understanding <b>eco-driving,</b> and interventions to enhance the adoption, were explored in an integrated analysis of three studies. Multiple influences on drivers’ possibility and intention to adopt <b>eco-driving</b> were confirmed in the analysis. Influences include driver-related factors like ability and attitudes, as well as contextual influences originating in the vehicle, the physical environment and the social context. For professional drivers, the organisational context was identified as major source of influences. A hierarchy of <b>eco-driving</b> behaviours is introduced in the thesis, consisting of operational, tactical, and strategic levels of <b>eco-driving.</b> When investigated, participants’ understanding of <b>eco-driving</b> appears concentrated to one level or part of one level in this hierarchy. The limited interpretations give rise to issues when the motivated participants’ perceived and actual space for action does not match the <b>eco-driving</b> advice they know. It is hence proposed that interventions should aim to enhance the action space for <b>eco-driving.</b> Enabling and facilitating interventions should be put in place to widen the actual action space, and exemplifying and encouraging interventions should target the perception of it. In conclusion, the mechanisms behind the adoption of <b>eco-driving</b> are complex and the influences numerous. Still, adoption can be enhanced if these influences are taken into consideration and interventions designed to increase both perceived and actual <b>eco-driving</b> action space...|$|E
40|$|An {{attractive}} {{bus system}} {{is an important}} part of sustainable mobility, but its environmental impact can be decreased. Encouraging bus drivers to adopt <b>eco-driving</b> is one way of achieving this. As <b>eco-driving</b> requires bus drivers to change their driving behaviour, behaviour change intervention strategies are helpful in accomplishing this. However, there are problems with achieving the potential of <b>eco-driving</b> interventions. Therefore, the primary aim of this paper is to relate bus drivers’ views of <b>eco-driving</b> and the problems they face when attempting to change their behaviour with the help of <b>eco-driving</b> interventions. The secondary aim is to discuss the consequences of this when designing interventions to promote <b>eco-driving</b> in the future. The paper is based on data from two studies: one interview study with bus drivers regarding their work situation (n= 20), and one field trial (n= 54) aimed at testing the effects of two <b>eco-driving</b> interventions in buses. The studies reveal consensus among the drivers that <b>eco-driving</b> is important and they are positive to the concept, but they are divided over if <b>eco-driving</b> promotion is necessary. Drivers are knowledgeable on <b>eco-driving</b> but find it hard to translate from theory to practice. The studies exposed a multitude of barriers to the adoption of <b>eco-driving</b> that drivers face in their day-to-day work. These barriers relate to their occupation, the organisation in which they work, and the urban environment in which they drive. In order to overcome these barriers a systemic approach is necessary, applying a coordinated intervention system with a combination of informational and structural strategies...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{progress}} has allowed motorized transportation {{to make a}} step toward more sustainable mobility but {{remains one of the}} main causes of air pollution in France. One way to help reduce the detrimental impact of motorized road transportation is to lead drivers, particularly car-dependent ones, to adopt <b>eco-driving.</b> However numerous drivers do not abide by highway laws or display driving-anger behaviors, which are in opposition to <b>eco-driving.</b> Unfortunately, few people practice <b>eco-driving</b> and many new adopters often have trouble maintaining this driving style. What is more, most studies on this issue have focused on <b>eco-driving</b> gains, the ability of people to put it into effect, and/or the continuous {{decline in the number of}} people who practice <b>eco-driving.</b> They usually do not take into account people's self-perceptions about their driving style, nor the associated beliefs. The aim of the present self-report study was twofold: identify drivers' self-perceptions about being an eco-driver, and determine how these self-perceptions about being an eco-driver or not are linked to eco-driving-friendly behaviors, levers favoring <b>eco-driving</b> (concern for the environment), and brakes on <b>eco-driving</b> (driving anger and road violations), according to gender. An online survey was carried out with 300 French drivers (127 men) ages 19 - 83. In our sample, 11. 3 % of the drivers said they felt they were eco-drivers (G 1); 50 % said they feel trying to eco-drive (G 2); 9. 7 % said they had never heard of <b>eco-driving</b> and 25 % said they knew about <b>eco-driving</b> but didn't do it (G 3, felt they were not eco-driver), and 4 % said they felt they had abandoned <b>eco-driving</b> (G 4). The differences between the first three groups (G 1 vs. G 2 /G 3) were in line with their <b>eco-driving</b> self-perceptions: G 1 had higher scores on three eco-driving-friendly behavior scale components and on environmental conservation, and lower scores on one factor of the driving-anger scale. Also in line with the groups' <b>eco-driving</b> self-perceptions, G 2 's scores were higher than G 3 's scores on one <b>eco-driving</b> friendly behavior component. A gender-by-group interaction was found for G 1 vs. G 3 on one <b>eco-driving</b> friendly behavior component, with a larger increase in the men's than the women's scores on ecodriving self-perceptions.

Moreover, <b>eco-driving</b> reduces road-traffic noise, which is {{a serious threat to}} {{the health and well-being of}} many people. We investigated the psychological predictors of the adoption of <b>eco-driving</b> from the perspective of road-traffic noise abatement. The data came from 890 car drivers who participated in a longitudinal survey over four months. Specifically, we tested the effects of the intention to prevent road-traffic noise, variables derived from the theory of planned behavior (social norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude), and variables derived from the health action process approach (implementation intention, maintenance self-efficacy, and action control) on the intention to practice <b>eco-driving</b> and on <b>eco-driving</b> behavior. The intention to prevent road-traffic noise was not linked to the intention to practice <b>eco-driving.</b> The strongest predictors of the intention to practice <b>eco-driving</b> were attitude and perceived behavioral control. The strongest predictor of <b>eco-driving</b> behavior was action control. The link between behavioral intention and behavior was weak, indicating that drivers have difficulties putting their intention to practice <b>eco-driving</b> into action. Therefore, intervention efforts should directly address and support the transition from intention to behavior. This could be accomplished by providing reminders, which help to maintain behavioral intention, and by providing behavior feedback, which helps car drivers to monitor their behavior. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Eco-driving</b> is an {{initiative}} driving behavior {{which aims to}} reduce fuel consumption and emissions from automobiles. Recently, it has attracted increasing interests and has been adopted by many drivers in Australia. Although many of the studies have revealed considerable benefits in terms of fuel consumption and emissions after utilising <b>eco-driving,</b> most of the literature investigated <b>eco-driving</b> effects on individual driver but not traffic flow. The driving behavior of eco-drivers will potentially affect other drivers and thereby affects the entire traffic flow. To comprehensively assess and understand how effectively <b>eco-driving</b> can perform, therefore, measurement on traffic flow is necessary. In this paper, we proposed and demonstrated an evaluation method based on a microscopic traffic simulator (Aimsun). We focus on one particular <b>eco-driving</b> style which involves moderate and smooth acceleration. We evaluated both traffic performance (travel time) and environmental performance (fuel consumption and CO 2 emission) at traffic intersection level in a simple simulation model.

However, the benefits of such in-vehicle systems should be achieved without impairing driver safety. A simulator study evaluated both visual and haptic <b>eco-driving</b> feedback systems, which provided advice on gas pedal usage. Hill driving scenarios with variable traffic density were used to test drivers’ prioritization of safe and fuel-efficient driving. A visual, second-order display and a haptic force feedback gas pedal created the smallest errors in gas pedal usage and so maximized fuel efficiency. The visual display increased time spent looking away from the road, implying reduced driver safety. Participants were worse at <b>eco-driving</b> in more demanding, high traffic conditions. Drivers appeared to prioritize safety over <b>eco-driving,</b> however safety margins were shorter in the high density traffic condition, despite the degradation in <b>eco-driving</b> performance.

This does not only apply to the cars doing the <b>eco-driving</b> but also affect the cars following the <b>eco-driving</b> cars. Furthermore, by considering most of the studies up to now had been based on the computer simulations and there had been only a few studies that were based on the real situation, we conducted a test run by using vehicles on the public roads under the normal traffic conditions.

40|$|<b>Eco-driving</b> has the {{potential}} to reduce fuel consumption and therefore emissions considerably. Previous research suggests that drivers have a certain level of <b>eco-driving</b> knowledge and skills, which they refrain from practising in their everyday lives. At the same time misconceptions and ambiguous messages from <b>eco-driving</b> support systems can confuse and demotivate. This research aimed to identify the mental models of <b>eco-driving</b> that regular drivers have. A driving simulator experiment with a varied road layout comprising urban and motorway sections was designed. The study used simple driving task instructions to investigate changes in the participants’ behaviour and thoughts in three conditions. Sixteen drivers were asked to ‘Drive normally’, ‘Drive safely’ or ‘Drive fuel-efficiently’. Behavioural measures, think aloud protocols and interviews were compared and analysed. The emphasis of this study was on <b>eco-driving</b> relevant indicators such as accelerating, braking, coasting and car-following. The results show that the participants do have mental models of <b>eco-driving,</b> which they did not use in the Baseline drive, when they were instructed to ‘Drive normally’.

However it also has serious impacts on both public health and the environment. In-vehicle feedback systems are a relatively new approach to encouraging driver behavior change for improving fuel efficiency and safety in automotive environments. While many studies claim that the adoption of <b>eco-driving</b> practices, such as <b>eco-driving</b> training programs and in-vehicle feedback to drivers, has the potential to improve fuel efficiency, limited research has integrated safety and <b>eco-driving.</b> Therefore, it is crucial to understand the human factors related theories and practices which will inform the design of an in-vehicle Human Machine Interface (HMI) that could provide real-time driver feedback and consequently improve both fuel efficiency and safety. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of published literature on in-vehicle systems to identify and evaluate the impact of <b>eco-driving</b> and safety feedback systems. This paper also discusses how these factors may conflict with one another and {{have a negative effect on}} road safety, while also exploring possible <b>eco-driving</b> practices that could encourage more sustainable, environmentally-conscious and safe driving behavior. The review revealed a lack of comprehensive theoretical research integrating <b>eco-driving</b> and safe driving, and no current available HMI covering both aspects simultaneously. Furthermore, the review identified that some <b>eco-driving</b> in-vehicle systems may enhance fuel efficiency without compromising safety. The review has identified a range of concepts which can be developed to influence driver acceptance of safety and <b>eco-driving</b> systems within the area of HMI. This can promote new research aimed at enhancing our understanding of the relationship between <b>eco-driving</b> and safety from the human factors viewpoint.

The four patterns had the same travel distance (5. 2 km), but showed varying <b>eco-driving</b> achievement levels. Three ICEVs, one HEV and two EVs were tested using a C/D. Good linear relationships {{were found between the}} <b>eco-driving</b> achievement level and electric or fuel consumption rate of all vehicles. The reduction of CO 2 emissions was also estimated. The CO 2 -reduction rates of the four conventional (including hybrid) vehicles were 10. 9 %– 12. 6 %, while those of two types of EVs were 11. 7 %– 18. 4 %.

Clearly, <b>eco-driving</b> {{is one of the}} alternatives of a driving style to be much more economically, ecologically and can significantly reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emission. This paper presents the significance of educating the drivers about <b>eco-driving</b> as well as the information about the factors of <b>eco-driving</b> that involve environmental impact, behavior and cost saving which may influence the driver‟s decision. By using quantitative method, questionnaire is being distributed among 400 respondents of UUM students.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a decision ladder analysis of <b>eco-driving,</b> and {{a discussion of}} the resultant models in terms of the skills, rules and knowledge taxonomy of human behaviour and how this can inform the design of an in-vehicle, <b>eco-driving</b> support system. In order to understand the types of behaviours that characterise fuel-efficient driving, a review was conducted of the academic literature and of more publicly available resources, such as governmental, car manufacturers' and specific <b>eco-driving</b> organisations' websites. The review identified four largely distinct driving activities that {{play a central role in}} the use of fuel in the private road vehicle. A focus group involving four researchers in the transport ergonomics field, followed by a series of five interviews with <b>eco-driving</b> experts, served to validate, supplement and further specify the models...|$|E
40|$|<b>Eco-driving</b> has the {{potential}} to reduce fuel consumption and therefore emissions considerably. Previous research suggests that drivers already possess a certain level of <b>eco-driving</b> capability, which they do not practise in their everyday lives. The studies reported in this thesis are based on a mental models approach, which enabled an in-depth exploration of <b>eco-driving</b> knowledge and skills and broadened the understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms. This thesis describes two driving simulator experiments aiming to measure, activate and ultimately interrupt <b>eco-driving</b> mental models in a variety of scenarios, relevant for safe and <b>eco-driving.</b> The studies used simple driving task instructions, text message interventions as well as a workload task. Changes in the participants’ behaviour and thoughts were analysed with a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The results suggest that drivers have mental models of <b>eco-driving</b> on several levels, ranging from knowledge and strategies to tactics in specific situations to automated behaviour. However, in the first experiment they did not use them when they were instructed to ‘Drive normally’. In the second study text message primes and advice provided over two weeks were not able to replicate the effect of experimental instructions given directly before driving. Behavioural changes following these instructions were abandoned when performing a workload task, and not resumed afterwards. Future research needs to consider alternative methods to prompt drivers to use their existing <b>eco-driving</b> knowledge and skills. Studies with a larger number of participants, and in real-world settings can then validate findings. It is suggested to expand the mental models approach into other fields such as sustainable transport in general. ...|$|E
40|$|Following <b>eco-driving</b> {{instructions}} {{can reduce}} fuel consumption between 5 to 20 % on urban roads with manual cars. The majority of Australian cars have an automatic transmission gear-box. It is therefore {{of interest to}} verify whether current <b>eco-driving</b> instructions are e cient for such vehicles. In this pilot study, participants (N= 13) drove an instrumented vehicle (Toyota Camry 2007) with an automatic transmission. Fuel consumption of the participants was compared before and after they received simple <b>eco-driving</b> instructions. Participants drove the same vehicle on the same urban route under similar tra c conditions. We found that participants drove at similar speeds during their baseline and eco-friendly drives, and reduced {{the level of their}} accelerations and decelerations during <b>eco-driving.</b> Fuel consumption decreased for the complete drive by 7 %, but not on the motorway and inclined sections of the study. Gas emissions were estimated with the VT-micro model, and emissions of the studied pollutants (CO 2, CO, NOX and HC) were reduced, but no di erence was observed for CO 2 on the motorway and inclined sections. The di erence for the complete lap is 3 % for CO 2. We have found evidence showing that simple <b>eco-driving</b> instructions are e cient in the case of automatic transmission in an urban environment, but towards the lowest values of the spectrum of fuel consumption reduction from the di erent <b>eco-driving</b> studies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce CO 2 {{emission}} of automobiles, promotion of <b>eco-driving</b> is considered being effective. As a tool of promoting the <b>eco-driving,</b> some driver assistance systems {{have been developed for}} improving the drivers’ techniques by providing information after having evaluated the drivers’ behaviour when driving. What can make the drivers improve their driving to be more economically and ecologically attracts us to conduct this study. In this paper, factors affecting drivers’ improvement of <b>eco-driving</b> are reported on the basis of our analysis of the data collected from a social experiment undertaken during October 2009 and January 2010 in Toyota City...|$|E
