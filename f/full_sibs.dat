5000|$|The {{existence}} of altruism in nature is {{at first sight}} puzzling, because altruistic behaviour reduces the likelihood that an individual will reproduce. [...] The idea that group selection might explain the evolution of altruism was first broached by Darwin himself in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, (1871). The concept of group selection has had a chequered and controversial history in evolutionary biology but the uncritical 'good of the species' tradition {{came to an abrupt}} halt in the 1960s, due largely to the work of George C. Williams, and John Maynard Smith as well as Richard Dawkins. These evolutionary theorists pointed out that natural selection acts on the individual, and that it is the individual's fitness (number of offspring and grand-offspring produced compared {{to the rest of the}} population) that drives evolution. A group advantage (e.g. hunting in a pack) that is disadvantageous to the individual (who might be harmed during the hunt, when it could avoid injury by hanging back from the pack but still share in the spoils) cannot evolve, because the selfish individual will leave, on average, more offspring than those who join the pack and suffer injuries as a result. If the selfishness is hereditary, this will ultimately result in the population consisting entirely of selfish individuals. However, in the 1960s and 1970s an alternative to the [...] "group selection" [...] theory emerged. This was the kin selection theory, due originally to W. D. Hamilton. Kin selection is an instance of inclusive fitness, which is based on the notion that an individual shares only half its genes with each offspring, but also with each full-sib (See footnote). From an evolutionary genetic point of view it is therefore as advantageous to help with the upbringing of <b>full</b> <b>sibs</b> as it is to produce and raise one's own offspring. The two activities are evolutionarily entirely equivalent. Co-operative breeding (i.e. helping one's parents raise sibs—provided they are <b>full</b> <b>sibs)</b> could thus evolve without the need for group-level selection. This quickly gained prominence among biologists interested in the evolution of social behaviour.In 1971 Robert Trivers introduced his reciprocal altruism theory to explain the evolution of helping at the nest of an unrelated breeding pair of birds. He argued that an individual might act as a helper if there was a high probabilistic expectation of being helped by the recipients at some later date. If, however, the recipients did not reciprocate when it was possible to do so, the altruistic interaction with these recipients would be permanently terminated. But if the recipients did not cheat then the reciprocal altruism would continue indefinitely to both parties' advantage. This model was considered by many (e.g. West-Eberhard and Dawkins) to be evolutionarily unstable because it is prone to invasion by cheats for the same reason that cooperative hunting can be invaded and replaced by cheats. However, Trivers did make reference to the Prisoner's Dilemma Game which, 10 years later, would restore interest in Trivers' reciprocal altruism theory, but under the title of [...] "tit-for-tat".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Accounting for and {{quantifying}} the associative {{effect of}} each animal could improve both {{welfare of animals}} and response to selection. Because of the limitation of REML, Gibbs Sampling could be an alternative technique to estimate the variance component of the associative effect. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the estimation accuracy of the variance component of associative effect by using simulation via Gibbs Sampling. The simulated data comprised five generations of pigs. The breeding animals of each generation were selected randomly. In the simulation, variations were introduced for the methods of assigning pens (random, mixed <b>sib</b> and <b>full</b> <b>sib),</b> the number of pigs per pen (5 or 10), the number of breeding animals per generation (162 or 324) and the correlation between genetic direct effect and genetic associative effect (- 0. 5, 0. 1 or + 0. 5). Each set of simulation was run for 30 replications. Results Random assignment or mixed sib assignment resulted in bias of estimated variance components in only 3 of 24 combinations. Furthermore, these 3 cases occurred with 162 breeding animals. With <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> assignment, 9 out of 12 groups of estimates significantly deviated from the true parameter value. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with the <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> assignment were higher than with the other two methods of pen assignment in most of the cases. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with datasets with 324 breeding animals were notably smaller than the datasets from 162 breeding animals. Within each method of pen assignment, the relative bias of the associative effect was significantly smaller with group size 10 than with group size 5. Conclusion <b>Full</b> <b>sib</b> assignment caused difficulties to estimate variance components in most of the cases, due to a lack of identifiability. With random and mixed assignment, most data structures yielded unbiased results but increasing the number of breeding animals or group size improves the estimation. Thus to get identifiable and unbiased estimates of the genetic associative effect, it is recommended to avoid close genetic relationship between animals within one pen and to use sufficient numbers of breeding animals and sufficient group sizes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Stochastic {{simulations}} {{were used}} to compare genetic progress and inbreeding depending on whether <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> matings were allowed or not when applying individual selection. Fifteen selection cycles were considered, using a single pair mating design. Two levels of heritability (h²) were studied (0. 1; 0. 5) as well as four different proportions of selected animals (2, 5, 10 and 20 %), four population sizes (1000, 2, 000, 4, 000 and 10, 000 candidates) and two levels of inbreeding depression (0 and 5 % decrease of phenotype for 10 % increase in inbreeding). Fifty replicates were generated for each set of parameters. The simulations revealed that avoiding <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> matings became less and less relevant as population size and proportion of selected animals increased and as heritability and impact of inbreeding on phenotype decreased. In large populations (10, 000 candidates), excluding <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> matings was not worthwhile at all whereas in small populations with high selection intensity, it was a first useful way to manage genetic variability. This can be illustrated in two extreme situations.

There was an increase in power (4 – 16 %) and decrease in the bias of parameter estimates with the use of half-sib information. These improvements in power and parameter estimates depended on the number of the half sib pairs (half sib family size). Almost the same power as that obtained using all the available sib pairs could be achieved by selecting only 50 – 60 % the animals. The most effective method was to select both <b>full</b> and half <b>sib</b> pairs on the basis of high within <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> family variance for the trait in question.

40|$|SummaryRelative-pair {{designs are}} {{routinely}} employed in linkage studies of complex genetic diseases and quantitative traits. Valid {{application of these}} methods requires correct specification of the relationships of the pairs. For example, within a sibship, presumed <b>full</b> <b>sibs</b> actually might be MZ twins, half sibs, or unrelated. Misclassi-fication of half-sib pairs or unrelated individuals as <b>full</b> <b>sibs</b> can result in reduced power to detect linkage. When other family members, such as parents or additional siblings, are available, incorrectly specified relationships usually will be detected through apparent incompatibilities with Mendelian inheritance. Without other family members, sibling relationships cannot be determined absolutely, but they still can be inferred probabilistically if sufficient genetic marker data are available. In this paper, we describe a simple likelihood ratio method to infer the true relationship of a putative sibling pair. We explore the number of markers required to accurately infer relationships typically encountered in a sib-pair study, {{as a function of}} marker allele frequencies, marker spacing, and genotyping error rate, and we conclude that very accurate inference of relationships can be achieved, given the marker data from even part of a genome scan.

Non-genetic maternal effects were studied by comparing auto-antibody profiles of 36 weeks old hens from 2 other unrelated lines with the profiles from their chicks at hatch. IgM and IgG antibodies from parents and progeny from both H srbc and L srbc lines bound CLL fragments. Significant line and generation differences and their interactions were found for both isotypes. Higher staining of CLL fragments was usually found for H srbc line birds. Lines were clustered by auto-antibody profiles, but staining by birds of both lines in both generations was very individual for IgG and IgM.

When counselling <b>full</b> <b>sibs</b> of MS patients, risks can be better calculated if information is available on the age of MS onset in the patient and whether or not one parent has MS...|$|E
40|$|Medical genetic {{histories}} of 165 children with primary {{central nervous system}} (CNS) tumours and 4599 relatives of these probands were examined to identify birth defects or genetic disorders that {{may be associated with}} the aetiology of CNS tumours. Twelve primary malignancies were found in 329 (4 %) of the parents of probands. Two of 99 half sibs but no <b>full</b> <b>sibs</b> had malignancies. Twenty-four percent of families had histories warranting consultation for an inherited disorder or birth defect. Single instances of malformations or genetic disorders were reported in 36 families and several disorders were reported in more than one family, including familial hypercholesterolaemia (4), olivopontocerebellar atrophy (2), and familial abdominal aortic aneurysm (2). Although recurring abnormalities were not identified in probands, it is possible that {{one or more of the}} birth defects or genetic disorders observed in probands or relatives may be associated with CNS tumourigenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of genetic maps in grapevine {{started in the}} late 90 s. It greatly benefi ted from the {{development of}} SSR markers by an international consortium, leading {{to the construction of}} integrated genetic maps. Software was improved for facilitating map construction in <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> families. A review of the different strategies that were developed for mapping in grapevine, including mapping populations, software and markers is provided here together with a discussion on their interest and limitations. Thanks to all these resources and experience, genetic mapping is now easy to handle in grapevine and is now widely used for QTL detection, map-based cloning, comparative mapping across species and genome sequence anchoring...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The data of G- 5 {{generation}} of inbred and non-inbred populations of Dahlem Red were utilized {{in the present}} study. These populations were originally developed by a regular system of <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> and half sib mating for 5 successive generations. A random mated non-inbred population was also maintained. Consequently, 3 sub populations have been developed from the same base population, namely, a <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> mated group (FS), a half sib mated group (HS) and a non-inbred group (NB). The inbreeding coefficient in the G- 5 generation in the FS group and HS groups was 67. 2 % and 44. 9 %, respectively. These three sub populations were subjected to PCR-RAPD analysis to observe the genetic distance and similarity between different subpopulations. A total of 41 random primers (decamers) were screened for RAPD analysis, out of which 21 primers amplified the genomic DNA, generated 128 to 4544 bp bands. The Mean Average Percentage Difference (MAPD) varied between 13. 22 and 22. 20. The MAPD was highest between FS and NB and lowest between HS and FS. The intra-population genetic similarity was highest in FS (0. 7139) followed by HS (0. 7095) and NB (0. 7054) which indicated that FS subpopulation is most uniform. The FS and NB had maximum genetic distance (by both band sharing and band frequency) and FS and HS had lowest genetic distance. The immune response to SRBC was highest in NB group followed by FS and HS groups. Key words: RAPD-PCR, SRBC titre, inbred populations, Dahlem Re...|$|R
40|$|Traceability {{schemes for}} {{aquaculture}} species {{are essential for}} tracing market product to farm of origin {{in the event of}} detection of disease or toxins in the market fish. DNA markers have been proposed as a tool for traceability. These markers can be used to genotype fish by taking a sample from live fish or fish product at any stage along the production chain. In this paper, we consider three alternate traceability schemes using DNA markers. The example of the Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon industry was used. This industry, like many aquaculture industries, has three tiers, the nucleus, multiplier and commercial tiers. The nucleus individuals are grandparents of the commercial fish, and the multiplier individuals are the parents of the commercial fish. The traceability strategies we considered were: (1) FS, assignment of market place fish to <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> families based on the marker information (this strategy assumes all individuals from a <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> family are allocated to a single farm and a limited number of fish, representing all <b>full</b> <b>sib</b> families on that farm, are genotyped); (2) PAR, assignment of market place fish to parents (multiplier individuals) and (3) GRAND, assignment of market place fish to grandparents (nucleus individuals). Using simulation, we determined the number of DNA markers required to achieve 95 % of correct assignment decisions for each strategy. The simulation included a wild population which contributed to market place fish. The wild fish were correctly assigned if they were excluded from belonging to the farmed population in each strategy, otherwise they were incorrectly assigned. Both microsatellite markers or single nucleotide polymorphism markers were considered. Seventy five, 15, and 50 microsatellites were required to achieve 95 % correct assignment decisions for FS, PAR and GRAND, respectively. Four hundred, 75 and 200 SNPs were required to achieve 95 % correct assignment decisions for FS, PAR and GRAND, respectively. If the cost of genotyping microsatellites is assumed to be five times as high as genotyping a SNP, GRAND using SNP markers is the cheapest strategy. The logistics of implementing each strategy are discussed. GRAND in particular and PAR in some industries requires complicated logistics. The most suitable and cost effective traceability strategy for a particular industry will depend heavily on the organisation of that industry, for example the degree of recording transfer of fish, eggs and larvae between tiers. Even if complicated logistics prevent the adoption of marker based schemes by some industries, traceability with DNA markers may still be important for verification of labelling-based schemes...|$|R
