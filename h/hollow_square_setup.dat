40|$|Antennas are {{described}} with gravitational radiation properties such as polarization, directivity, and scalar and tensor characteristics. These antenna devices are mechanically resonant {{systems in the}} shape of a <b>hollow</b> <b>square</b> with fundamental frequencies in the Hz range. An antenna characteristic is that the absorption cross section for quadrupole radiation at the normal frequency of vibration is the same as that of the fundamental if the damping factors are the same. The absorption cross section of quadrupole gravitational radiation is calculated for a class- 1 detector of a cylindrical cross section and for a class- 2 detector shaped like a <b>hollow</b> <b>square...</b>|$|R

In the AMS Theorem Environment for LaTeX, the <b>hollow</b> <b>square</b> is the default end-of-proof symbol. Unicode explicitly provides the [...] "End of proof" [...] character, U+220E (∎). Some authors use other Unicode symbols {{to note the}} end of a proof, including, ▮ (U+25AE, a black vertical rectangle), and ‣ (U+2023, a triangular bullet). Other authors have adopted two forward slashes (//) or four forward slashes (////). In other cases, authors have elected to segregate proofs typographically by displaying them as indented blocks.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} study on carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabrics in axial strengthening of <b>hollow</b> <b>square</b> sections (HSS) {{was investigated in}} this paper. CFRP was used as strips form with other parameters such {{as the number of}} layers and spacing of strips. Experimental results revealed that the external bonding of normal modulus CFRP strips significantly enhanced the load carrying capacity and stiffness of the hollow sections and also reduced the axial shortening of columns by providing external confinement against the elastic deformation. The increase in the CFRP strips thickness effectively delayed the local buckling of the above members and led to the inward buckling rather than outward one. Finally, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element modeling of CFRP strengthened <b>hollow</b> <b>square</b> sectionswas created by using ANSYS 12. 0 to validate the results and the numerical results such as failure modes and load deformation behaviour fairly agreed with the experimental results...|$|R
