The different forms of RD {{can be caused by}} mutations in > 100 genes, including > 1600 exons. Consequently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are among the most promising approaches to identify mutations in RD. So far, NGS is not routinely used in <b>gene</b> <b>diagnostics.</b> We developed a diagnostic NGS pipeline to identify mutations in 170 genetically and clinically unselected RD patients. NGS was applied to 105 RD-associated genes. Underrepresented regions were examined by Sanger sequencing. The NGS approach was successfully established using cases with known sequence alterations. Depending on the initial clinical diagnosis, we identified likely causative mutations in 55 % of retinitis pigmentosa and 80 % of Bardet–Biedl or Usher syndrome cases. Seventy-one novel mutations in 40 genes were newly associated with RD. The genes USH 2 A, EYS, ABCA 4, and RHO were more frequently affected than others. Occasionally, cases carried mutations in more than one RD-associated gene.

Finally, ways in which the sexual cycle can be exploited for purposes including gene identification and localization, strain improvement, and gene complementation are covered.

40|$|NAD+-dependent DNA ligase {{has been}} widely used in <b>gene</b> <b>diagnostics</b> for disease-associated {{mutation}} detection and {{has proved to be}} necessary for screening bactericidal drugs targeted to DNA ligases. However, further research has been restricted since conventional ligase assay technology is limited to gel electrophoresis, which is discontinuous, time-consuming and laborious. An innovative approach is developed for monitoring the activity of E. coli DNA ligase catalyzing nucleic acid ligation in the report. This approach utilizes a molecular beacon hybridized with two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) segments to be ligated to form a hybrid with a nick, and could therefore be recognized by the enzyme. Ligation of the two ssDNA segments would cause conformation changes of the molecular beacon, leading to significant fluorescence enhancement. Compared to gel electrophoresis, this approach can provide real time information about ligase, is more time efficient, and is easier to use. The effect of quinacrine, a drug for malaria, on the activity of the ligase is detected, thereby certifying the capability of the method for developing novel antibacterial drugs targeted at NAD+-dependent ligase. The fidelity of strand joining by the ligase is examined based on this approach. The effects of external factors on activity of the ligase are analyzed, and then an assay of E. coli DNA ligase is performed with a broad linear range of 4. 0 6 1024 Weiss Unit mL 21 to 0. 4 Weiss Unit mL 21 and the detection limit of 4. 0 6 1024 Weiss Unit mL 21...|$|E

40|$|Ruthenium {{complexes}} with aromatic ligands {{have been}} extensively studied {{due to their}} interesting photophysical properties, including photophysics and electron transfer upon interaction with nucleic acids. For example, the broad absorption spectrum makes them suitable as antenna molecules in photochemical reaction systems {{and their ability to}} accept or donate electrons in their excited state could have potential in opto-electronical devices. Many of these molecules show high affinity for DNA. The chirality of the metal center and the large number of possible ligand combinations constitutes a toolkit for design of DNA binders, with potential applications in <b>gene</b> <b>diagnostics</b> and cancer therapeutics. In this thesis the environment-sensitive photophysics and strong DNA affinity, displayed by ruthenium complexes containing the [Ru(phen) 2 dppz] 2 + chromophore (phen= 1, 10 -phenanthroline, dppz=dipyrido[3, 2 -a: 2 ', 3 '-c]phen-azine), have been studied with optical spectroscopy techniques. The excited state relaxation of the chromophore is very sensitive to the environment, dramatically manifested by the > 10 4 increase in emission quantum yield upon binding to DNA compared to water solution, denoted as the "light-switch effect". Excited-state relaxation studies performed in water and glycerol show that at least three excited states of metal-to-ligand charge-transfer character are involved in the decay, the populations of which are sensitive to hydrogen bonding with the solvent. The second part of the thesis reports on thermodynamic and kinetic DNA binding properties of a dimer of the [Ru(phen) 2 dppz] 2 + chromophore. Flow linear dichroism studies show that all three stereoisomers (. DELTA. -. DELTA.,. DELTA. -. LAMDA., and. LAMDA. -. LAMDA.) bind to DNA by a threading bis-intercalative binding mode. Threading of bulky chiral subunits results in very slow reaction kinetics and, in contrast to thermodynamic properties, a pronounced enantioselectivity. The DNA binding and photophysical properties are finally combined in a study of the. DELTA. -. DELTA. D Ru-dppz dimer interacting with cells. The compound is found to be only moderately toxic to living cells at concentrations below 10 - 4 M, probably due to poor membrane penetration, but excellent as an emissive marker of DNA in fixated cells...|$|E
40|$|Lab-on-a-chip-systems (LOCs) are {{in special}} {{focus in the}} field of health-technologies. LOCs are miniaturised, {{portable}} analytical systems which offer a wide variety of laboratory diagnostics and allow for immediate subsequent intervention necessary at the point of care or point of need (POC/PON). This might result in a benefit for a number of medical sectors (e. g. diagnostics of infections and choice of therapy and/or medicinal product, especially in case of life-threatening diseases). Both the dynamic development and the potential of LOCs for the healthcare sector induced this analysis of legal aspects of LOCs and the need for legal amendment in order to provide a successful and thorough integration, especially into the system of the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI), and for the use of „direct-to-consumer“ (DTC) genetic- and HIV- (human immunodeficiency virus) testing. It can be assumed that fully analytical, portable, biomarker- and gene-based LOCs are to be considered a new examination method according to Section 135 of the German Social Code Book V and thus need to be evaluated by the (Federal) Joint Committee (“Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss”, G-BA) before being incorporated into the Uniform Value Scale (“Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab”, EBM) and become reimbursable. Within the Uniform Value Scale, the Chapters 11 and 32 appear to be suitable for regulations on LOCs. The current lack of reimbursement and the requirement of a preceding evaluation by the G-BA are a particular problem for the use of LOCs as Companion Diagnostics (CDx) {{in the field of}} personalised therapy with medicinal products. In order to avoid a de facto exclusion or a delayed use of the concerned medicinal products, it is essential to accelerate the procedure under Section 135 Social Code Book V (e. g. granting the right of application to manufacturers and patient organisations). Besides, a lump sum item should be created within the Uniform Value Scale to enable temporary reimbursement. Self-diagnostics by means of LOCs using DTC gene- and/or HIV-tests is not possible in Germany due to the current legal framework, which also applies for foreign offerers. In this context the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (IVD-VO) provides relevant innovations and an increased standard of quality.

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to develop longitudinal statistics toolbox, called LSTGEE, for the analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. We develop generalized estimating equations for jointly modeling imaging measures with behavioral and clinical variables from longitudinal studies. We develop a test procedure based on a score test statistic and a resampling method to test linear hypotheses of unknown parameters, such as associations between brain structure and function and covariates of interest, such as IQ, age, <b>gene,</b> <b>diagnostic</b> groups, and severity of disease. We demonstrate the application of our statistical methods to th...|$|R
