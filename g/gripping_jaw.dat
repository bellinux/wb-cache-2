50|$|When engaged, an {{automatic}} wire stripper first simultaneously grips the wire in {{one side and}} in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes {{the two sides of the}} mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and squeezes the handles together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The automatic wire stripper's cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 patent. All wire strippers are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. An automatic wire stripper's short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of wire strippers. The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably stripped. If the cutter opening is to small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to adjust the clamping force of the <b>gripping</b> <b>jaw.</b> The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, automatic wire strippers that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.|$|E

In this paper, the spleen tissue and a laparoscopic surgical grasper were modeled using ABAQUS software to investigate the tool-tissue interaction, considering large deformations for the spleen tissue. The spleen tissue was modeled as a hyper-elastic material. The laparoscopic grasper includes three <b>gripping</b> <b>jaws</b> that always remain parallel. The sliding can occur between the <b>gripping</b> <b>jaws</b> and the spleen tissue.

The pushing force varies from 0 (N) in pinch force of 1 (N) and the frictionless situation to 6. 125 (N) in pinch force of 6 (N) and the friction coefficient equal to 0. 3. Changing the shape of jaws can increase the pushing force up to 100 %. The results could help surgeons to predict the correlation between grasping conditions and applied forces for a safe grasping procedure in the laparoscopic operations...|$|R

5000|$|Unlike Poma's grips, Doppelmayr grips are double {{position}} grips. When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a <b>grip</b> <b>jaw.</b> The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. Grip clamping force is measured {{just prior to the}} double position grips reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R

These studies revealed the bullfrog's diet to be unique among North American ranids in the inclusion of a large percentage of aquatic animals, such as fish, tadpoles, ram's horn snails, and dytiscid beetles. Bullfrogs can capture large, strong prey because of the powerful <b>grip</b> of their <b>jaws</b> after the initial ranid tongue strike. The bullfrog is able to make allowance for light refraction at the water-air interface by striking at a position posterior to the target's perceived location.

40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on bulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and demate operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the connector shell until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the connector shell edge. Then, by squeezing the handles, the end effector <b>jaws</b> <b>grip</b> the connector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the connector shell is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism.
