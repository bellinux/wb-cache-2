5|$|Lugal: {{while in}} Mesopotamia a lugal {{designated}} a king, in Ebla it designated a governor who was <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> {{the authority of}} the capital. The nature of this title as part of Eblaite bureaucracy is ambiguous; each lugal was under {{the authority of the}} grand vizier, and the bearers ruled cities <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> the authority of the capital and they all brought goods to be kept in Ebla's storehouses. Pettinato counted 14 different lugals in the Eblaite administrative texts and deduced that the kingdom was divided into fourteen departments; two of them in the capital itself and the remaining twelve spanned the rest of the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A year later, Mechnikov {{studied a}} fresh water {{crustacean}} called Daphnia, a tiny transparent animal {{that can be}} examined <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the bacterium Bacillus anthracis could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called phagocytosis. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} and <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> {{the influence}} of estrogen, the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open {{in response to the}} higher levels of estrogen present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E

5|$|<b>Directly</b> <b>under</b> the {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the {{subtropical ridge}}, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|G-spot {{amplification}} (also called G-spot augmentation or the G-Shot) is {{a procedure}} intended to temporarily increase pleasure in sexually active women with normal sexual function, focusing on increasing {{the size and}} sensitivity of the G-spot. G-spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference. After numbing the area with a local anesthetic, human engineered collagen is then injected <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> the mucosa in the area the G-spot is concluded to be in.|$|E

5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located <b>directly</b> <b>under</b> the trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved {{and the only}} well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E

5|$|The College Republicans were financed, {{at least}} in part, by the Republican National Committee {{throughout}} much of its history.
