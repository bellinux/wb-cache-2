500|$|The family {{settled in}} a small house loaned to them by Princess George of Greece at Saint-Cloud, on the {{outskirts}} of Paris, where Princess Andrew helped in a charity shop for Greek refugees. She became deeply religious, and on 20 October 1928 entered the Greek Orthodox Church. That winter, she translated her husband's defence of his actions during the Greco-Turkish War into English. Soon afterward, she began claiming that she was receiving divine messages and that she had healing powers. In 1930, after suffering a severe nervous breakdown, Princess Andrew was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, first by Thomas Ross, a psychiatrist who specialised in shell-shock, and subsequently by Sir Maurice Craig, who treated the future King George VI before he had speech therapy. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> at Dr Ernst Simmel's sanatorium at Tegel, Berlin. She was forcibly removed from her family and placed in Dr Ludwig Binswanger's sanatorium in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. It was a famous and well-respected institution with several celebrity patients, including Vaslav Nijinsky, the ballet dancer and choreographer, who was there {{at the same time as}} Princess Andrew. Binswanger also diagnosed schizophrenia. Both he and Simmel consulted Sigmund Freud who believed that the princess's delusions were the result of sexual frustration. He recommended [...] "X-raying her ovaries in order to kill off her libido." [...] Princess Andrew protested her sanity and repeatedly tried to leave the asylum.|$|E
50|$|Manouvrier-Hanu et al. (1996) {{described}} the prenatal diagnosis of Fryns syndrome by ultrasonographic detection of diaphragmatic hernia and cystic hygroma. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> after {{termination of the}} pregnancy. The fetus also had 2 erupted incisors; natal teeth had not been mentioned in other cases of Fryns syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|His most cited {{paper is}} Bayoumi and Eichengreen [...] "Shocking Aspects of European Monetary Unification" [...] (1993) which {{argued that the}} European Union was less {{suitable}} as a Single Currency Area than the United States. This <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> in 2011 when external shocks caused the Eurozone Crisis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by {{gram stain}} of the {{synovial}} fluid, blood cultures and urethral cultures.|$|R
50|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by patch test, and {{management}} is by avoidance {{of exposure to}} the allergen.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> via biopsy of the tissue(s) {{suspected}} to {{be affected}} by SCC. For the skin, look under skin biopsy.|$|R
50|$|In March 2006, McPhee {{became aware}} of {{problems}} with his voice. After a number of tests, {{he was diagnosed with}} probable amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Lou Gehrig's disease) in June 2006. After the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> in August 2006, McPhee announced the news to his audience that he had Bulbar ALS, a severe form of the disease. The final Dream Doctor Radio Show was broadcast on October 20, 2006.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1962, Sayyab {{travelled}} to the UK. Professor Albert Hourani {{had managed}} to grant him a fellowship at Durham University and he also thought about registering {{as a student at}} Oxford University to undertake a PhD, but was not able to do so. Admitted to St Mary's Hospital, London his illness was finally diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis From London he went to Paris for a week in March 1963, where his <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed.</b>|$|E
5000|$|His {{parents are}} also notable for the {{remarkable}} degree {{of communication and}} care they managed to share {{with each other and}} their son when his <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed,</b> and on {{to the end of his}} life. Although by the time of his diagnosis they had divorced and were living separately, they transcended distance, time, and whatever history had led them to separate in order to discuss carefully and kindly the options, care, and ongoing prognosis for his life.|$|E
50|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by pathology. Histologically, {{papillary}} fibroelastomas have branching avascular papillae, {{composed of}} collagen, that {{are covered by}} endothelium.|$|R
50|$|The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by a skin biopsy and a {{positive}} culture for acid-fast bacilli. A PPD test may also result positive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> often {{suspected}} {{in patients}} in extremis (close to death) with abdominal trauma or with relevant risk-factors. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> {{quickly in the}} Emergency room by ultrasound or CT scan.|$|R
5000|$|On June 22, 2015, King {{announced}} that he would undergo prostate cancer surgery on June 26, adding, [...] "I'm looking forward to a full recovery and to continuing my service in the Senate." [...] King had shown no symptoms but doctors had found the cancer in a routine medical exam, and after a biopsy was given, the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed.</b> King also {{announced that}} this did not change his plans to run for reelection in 2018.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 October, Charlie {{was taken}} to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) {{and put on a}} {{mechanical}} ventilator, because his breathing had become shallow. By November, the doctors suspected that he had mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS), a set of rare diseases caused by mutations in genes essential for mitochondria to function. This <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> by a genetic test in mid-November, which found that he had two mutated versions of the gene coding for the RRM2B protein.|$|E
50|$|Schoenwetter's {{attorneys}} {{argued that}} he should be spared the death penalty due to mitigating factors. Schoenwetter was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome by two mental health experts. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> by a PET scan, which showed abnormalities in the brain associated with the disorder. But this defense was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} diagnosis failed to explain Schoenwetter's actions. He was sentenced to death for each of the murders, and life in prison for the attempted murder and burglary charges.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{contemplated}} {{based upon}} patient symptoms. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> during intravenous urography, by obtaining erect and supine films. The renal DMSA scan may show decreased counts {{in the sitting}} position compared with supine scan.|$|R
50|$|Adrenal {{insufficiency}} is {{a potentially}} life-threatening condition. Treatment should be initiated {{as soon as}} the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed,</b> or sooner if the patient presents in apparent adrenal crisis.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} that the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>be</b> <b>confirmed</b> before any procedures are performed. Incision and drainage of a suspected abscess, which instead is a pseudoaneurysm, could lead to extensive hemorrhage.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to Lowenthal and Haines' report, Gawler {{maintained that the}} <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> by his eminent team of physicians of the day who still stand by that diagnosis. He said that Haines and Lowenthal did not consult {{with any of these}} people in preparing their speculative hypothesis and, therefore, did not take account of his clinical history or the many diagnostic tests performed and deemed to be adequate by those physicians to confirm the diagnosis. Gawler's original physicians maintain that the TB developed as a complication of Gawler's osteogenic sarcoma, probably after chemotherapy weakened his immune system.|$|E
50|$|On 24 June 2016, Kim Sung Min's wife {{called police}} {{to check on}} her husband, saying that he had {{threatened}} to kill himself following an argument. Police found him attempting to commit suicide by hanging in the bathroom. On 26 June, the police stated Kim Sung Min, who had been in a coma since 24 June, was diagnosed as brain dead at 2AM KST. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> at 10:15 AM KST, and Kim Sung Min's family agreed to donate his organs. The police will have to sign off on the organ donation and a transplant could occur in the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|Katscher {{had been}} {{operated}} upon twice for {{cancer of the}} right breast. Shortly after the second operation, she consulted, for blindness of the left eye, Dr. Wilhelm Goldzieher, of Budapest, who sent her to Dr. Adamkiewicz with a diagnosis of cancerous infiltration of the choroid and partial detachment of the retina. This <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> by Dr. Sachs, assistant in the ophthalmological clinic of the University of Vienna. Sachs also followed up his ophthalmoscopic examinations during the treatment by cancroine, and certified to actual resorption of a cancerous process and restoration of vision to two thirds of normal. The conditions in the breast cicatrix were also improved.|$|E
30|$|Most {{cases of}} {{spontaneous}} pneumoperitoneum can be conservatively managed [2]. However, patients with ISP often undergo surgery because diagnosis of ISP preoperatively <b>is</b> difficult, and <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> by negative findings in laparotomy [3].|$|R

50|$|PCDH19 gene-related {{epilepsy}} is clinically {{based on}} patient and family seizure history, {{cognitive and behavioral}} neuropsychological evaluation, neurological examination, electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, and long term observation. <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> <b>confirmed</b> using molecular testing for PCDH19 mutations.|$|R
50|$|This study {{examined}} the clinical history of the CSF and urine of two Greek siblings who were both diagnosed with SR deficiency. Both siblings displayed delayed psychomotor development and a movement disorder. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> by measuring the SR enzyme activity and mutation analysis. The mutation analysis of the gene was performed using genomic DNA isolated from blood samples. The results concluded that both patients have low concentrations of HVA and HIAA and high concentrations of sepiapterin in the CSF, but neopterin and biopterin were abnormal in only one sibling. The results of this research indicates that when diagnosing the SR deficiency, the quantification of sepiapterin in the CSF is more important and indicative of SR deficiency than using neopterin and biopterin alone. The results also show that the urine concentrations of neurotransmitter metabolites are abnormal in patients with this disorder. This finding may provide an initial and easier indication of the deficiency before CSF analysis is performed.|$|E
5000|$|Nowinski {{played an}} {{integral}} {{role in the}} discovery of the fourth case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a former NFL football player, former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, who was killed in a fiery automobile crash in 2004 at age 36 after a 37-mile police chase at speeds up to 100 miles per hour {{on the wrong side of}} the highway. Julian Bailes, the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at West Virginia University and the Steelers' team neurosurgeon during Strzelczyk's career, insisted to Nowinski over a phone conversation that he thought Strzelczyk's death, which was precipitated by strange behavior that some had labeled as [...] "bipolar", was worth looking into due to its similarities to the Andre Waters case. Nowinski contacted Omalu, who discovered the brain was still available, and Nowinski called Mary Strzelczyk, Justin's mother, to ask for permission to Omalu to examine it for CTE. Omalu's positive <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> by two other neuropathologists.|$|E
5000|$|Deuteranopia (1% of males): Lacking {{the green}} cones for medium-wavelength cones, those {{affected}} are again unable {{to distinguish between}} colors in the green-yellow-red section of the spectrum. Their neutral point is at a slightly longer wavelength, 498 nm, a more greenish hue of cyan. A deuteranope suffers the same hue discrimination problems as protanopes, but without the abnormal dimming. Purple colors are not perceived as something opposite to spectral colors; all these appear similarly. This form of colorblindness {{is also known as}} Daltonism after John Dalton (his <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> as deuteranopia in 1995, some 150 years after his death, by DNA analysis of his preserved eyeball). Equivalent forms for daltonism in Romanic languages such as daltonismo (Spanish, Portuguese and Italian), daltonisme (French), daltonism (Romanian) are still used to describe color blindess in a broad sense or deuteranopia in a more restricted sense. Deuteranopic unilateral dichromats report that with only their deuteranopic eye open, they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and longer than it as yellow.|$|E

50|$|A {{study was}} done by Beauvois and Dérouesné on a 64-year-old man. The {{individual}} is described as right-handed, a retiree, and having formerly been an agricultural machinery representative. The individual had had surgery for a left parieto-occipital angioma. Scans showed a lesion at the left angular gyrus, the posterior part of the second temporal convolution, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the geniculostriate fibres and tapetum. The patient was also found to be suffering from neurological defects such as right inferior quadrantanopia, mild memory deficit, mild calculation impairment, minimal constructional apraxia, and astereognosia. It {{was found that the}} patient did not suffer from motor or sensory defects. He had been obliged to retire as the phonological dyslexia disrupted his ability to work. He had previously enjoyed reading, but was now unable to read his own or other pieces of writing. The <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> <b>confirmed</b> with the Alouette reading test, which concluded that the patient suffered from a reading disability. He was found to have the reading ability of a 6-year-old child, which is considered to be the lowest reading level. The level of reading was not determined from the speed, rather {{from the fact that the}} patient was not able to read more than 62 of the stimuli presented in three minutes, while 40% of the represented stimuli were either read incorrectly or left unread. The reading errors included adjectives, possessive adjectives, conjunctions and verbs.|$|E
