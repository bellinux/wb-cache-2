He added that the game's story was not interesting.|$|E

The new lyrics include the line: [...] "A little sweat ain’t hurt nobody [...] Don't <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there on the wall, everybody just move your body, move your body, move your body." [...] The song is a step-by-step flash dance-style workout that combines elements of hip hop music, Latin music as well as dancehall moves with traditional exercise. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy described [...] "Move Your Body" [...] as a [...] "kid-friendlier" [...] version {{of the original}}. Risa Dixon of Newsday praised the reworked version, calling it [...] "a fun, yet cardio-intensive workout song to get young people excited about exercising." ...|$|E
500|$|Brittany's role in {{the show}} was {{initially}} intended to be minor, but grew {{towards the end of}} the first season. She does not have any solo musical performances during season one, but Morris hoped she would have one in the second season. On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun. I literally <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there and doze off and then I'm like, 'Oh yeah, I have to speak now! At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated that Brittany would have [...] "big storylines" [...] in the new season, as viewers want to know more about her.|$|E

500|$|Other than reused {{footage from}} [...] "Pilot: Part 1" [...] in [...] "Exposé", Rose and Bernard do not feature in season three until the twenty-first episode [...] "Greatest Hits". The writers cited Caldwell and Anderson's other {{projects}} {{as a reason}} for their absence. Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if the couple appeared when many actors with star billing had received limited screentime in the early third season. The writers did not want to have the couple on the show to <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> in the background; they wanted to have Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines. Anderson found that although he normally had more fun portraying villains, playing Bernard was [...] "one of the greatest rides of [...] life".|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall called Ron [...] "easily the show's best {{creation}} so far," [...] {{and during the}} third season he wrote, [...] "Ron being both awesome and hilarious is something Nick Offerman and these writers can do in their sleep by now." [...] Sal Basile of UGO Networks wrote, [...] "How anyone can make Ron Swanson of Parks and Recreation likable is beyond us, but Offerman does it effortlessly. Before we knew it we couldn't wait to see Swanson's reactions to the slightest of problems." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN was critical of Ron {{at the start of}} the show, and called him [...] "a bit of the dud (who) offers little to the show, and almost <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> to sour the whole thing." [...] However, by the second season, Fowler said the character had improved and became [...] "an absolute stand-out in the series." [...] Several reviewers have praised the platonic relationship between Ron and Leslie, which has been compared to that of Mary Richards and Lou Grant in The Mary Tyler Moore Show.|$|E
500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E

2500|$|In the era before promotional {{videos were}} {{routinely}} produced for every charting single, the BBC would frequently have neither the band themselves nor alternative footage {{available for a}} song selected for the programme.

2500|$|The name [...] "Deftones" [...] {{was created}} by Carpenter, who wanted to pick [...] "something that would <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> out but you know, not be all cheese-ball at the same time." [...] Carpenter {{combined}} the hip hop slang term [...] "," [...] which was used by artists such as LL Cool J and Public Enemy, with the suffix [...] "-tones," [...] which was popular among 1950s bands (e.g., Dick Dale and the Del-Tones, The Quin-Tones, The Delltones, The Monotones, The Cleftones and The Harptones).

According to Linda Lister in Divafication: The Deification of Modern Female Pop Stars, she has been called the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] for her influence during the 1990s, commercially rivaling Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. Stephen Holden from The New York Times, in his review of Houston's Radio City Music Hall concert on July 20, 1993, praised her attitude as a singer, writing, [...] "Whitney Houston is one of the few contemporary pop stars of whom it might be said: the voice suffices. While almost every performer whose albums sell in the millions calls upon an entertainer's bag of tricks, from telling jokes to dancing to circus pyrotechnics, Ms. Houston would rather <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there and sing." [...] With regard to her singing style, he added: [...] "Her [...] stylistic trademarks– shivery melismas that ripple up in the middle of a song, twirling embellishments at the ends of phrases that suggest an almost breathless exhilaration– infuse her interpretations with flashes of musical and emotional lightning." ...|$|E

That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E

2500|$|Letts and Dicks also {{intended}} that Jo Grant {{would be}} cast {{so as to}} go beyond the stereotype of a [...] "pretty doll... who can <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there and scream." [...] They settled on young actress Katy Manning, whose personality had impressed in an otherwise shambolic audition. Others shortlisted for the part included Yutte Stensgaard, Shakira Baksh, Jenny McCracken, Cheryl Hall, and Gabrielle Drake. According to the commentary provided by Letts for the DVD release of Terror of the Autons, Rula Lenska and Anouska Hempel also auditioned for the role. The same DVD notes that Pertwee himself had spotted Manning {{in the lobby of the}} BBC TV Centre, but had not known who she was. He told Letts he had seen the [...] "perfect actress" [...] for the role, but Letts was unaware of who he was extolling. When Letts cast Manning and introduced her to the show's star, Pertwee was delighted and said [...] "I told you she was the girl for the part". Both Jenny McCracken and Cheryl Hall explain on the DVD commentary for the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of Carnival of Monsters, that they were on the final shortlist of six actresses for the part of Jo, losing out to Manning.

2500|$|In {{the speech}} Bannon invoked the Christian {{concept of the}} Church Militant.

[...] Bannon {{went on to say}} [...] "I believe we've come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years." [...] Bannon maintained that [...] "the West" [...] was successful due to a capitalism based on [...] "the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief." [...] Which was under threat from [...] "state-sponsored capitalism... you see in China and Russia.", from [...] "Ayn Rand or Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism", and from [...] "immense secularization of the West... the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration [...]" [...] Bannon held that the undermining of [...] "enlightened capitalism", and the loss of [...] "Judeo-Christian belief" [...] he held it was based on, were in dangerous decline right as [...] "we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism" [...] which includes Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram [...] "and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war". Bannon called on Christian capitalists to examine the purpose of their wealth and if divine providence was calling on them [...] "to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth...and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things... bind together as partners with others in other countries" [...] which would better prepare the West at these [...] "the very beginning stages of a global conflict".|$|E
2500|$|The tour notably {{promoted}} Justin Timberlake and Usher when Jackson selected both as {{its opening}} acts during their early careers, exposing {{them to a}} wider audience. Both artists credit Jackson as a major showmanship influence from both [...] "an entertainment and evolution perspective." [...] While Timberlake was part of 'N Sync, Jackson personally selected them to open for the tour, helping to introduce the relatively unknown group to the public. Timberlake said [...] "I had her poster on my wall so I'm psyched", later describing the experience as [...] "fulfilling." [...] Jackson performed with the group on several dates, including joining them for a live a cappella rendition of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Overjoyed." [...] A biography stated it was a [...] "highlight" [...] moment for Timberlake which [...] "gave Justin {{a chance to show}} his family and friends how far he had come." [...] The tour was the largest audience the group performed for at the time; JC Chasez commenting [...] "That was great because we got to see how a real professional tours. And not only that she is really sweet. We really enjoyed it." [...] Chris Kirkpatrick added, [...] "She is very good at entertaining. We learned a lot — that if people want to hear just the music, they can buy the CD. But it's the whole live aspect of changing the songs every night or the whole theatrical performance that she puts on. She's definitely one of our mentors when it comes to touring and the stage show. Her show told a story, and that's what people like to see." [...] Timberlake was previously inspired to become a performer after attending Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour, saying [...] "She didn't <b>just</b> <b>stand</b> there and sing her song", fascinated by her [...] "energy and exuberance". A friend commented [...] "He was always into Janet." [...] Author Sean Smith stated, [...] "Much has been made of Michael Jackson's influence on Justin's music, but he is only {{one of a number of}} influential artists who have shaped the musical style of Mr. JT, and he is not even the most influential member of the Jackson clan. That accolade firmly belongs to Janet Jackson", who was [...] "one of the most successful artists of the last twenty years." [...] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became [...] "good friends", ultimately leading to Timberlake performing alongside Jackson during a segment of Jackson's controversial Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Usher described opening for Jackson as [...] "the biggest event" [...] of his career and an [...] "honor", saying [...] "She's a definite entertainer, works hard and sweats every night. I learned a lot about how to make an artist look like a star." [...] Nick Lachey and group 98 Degrees opened for several dates and experienced increased commercial success following the tour. Upon the release of Never Gone, AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys described his hair as resembling [...] "Janet Jackson on the Velvet Rope Tour." ...|$|E
