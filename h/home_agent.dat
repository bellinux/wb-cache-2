50|$|A node {{wanting to}} {{communicate}} with the mobile node uses the permanent home address of the mobile node as the destination address to send packets to. Because the home address logically belongs to the network associated with the <b>home</b> <b>agent,</b> normal IP routing mechanisms forward these packets to the <b>home</b> <b>agent.</b> Instead of forwarding these packets to a destination that is physically in the same network as the <b>home</b> <b>agent,</b> the <b>home</b> <b>agent</b> redirects these packets towards the remote address through an IP tunnel by encapsulating the datagram with a new IP header using the care of address of the mobile node.|$|E
50|$|The Mobile IP {{allows for}} location-independent routing of IP {{datagrams}} on the Internet. Each mobile node is identified by its home address disregarding its current {{location in the}} Internet. While away from its home network, a mobile node {{is associated with a}} care-of address which identifies its current location and its home address is associated with the local endpoint of a tunnel to its <b>home</b> <b>agent.</b> Mobile IP specifies how a mobile node registers with its <b>home</b> <b>agent</b> and how the <b>home</b> <b>agent</b> routes datagrams to the mobile node through the tunnel.|$|E

50|$|In mobile IP, packets {{that are}} sent to a mobile host by the {{correspondent}} host are first routed to the mobile host's <b>home</b> <b>agent</b> and then forwarded to the mobile host at its current location by its <b>home</b> <b>agent.</b> However, packets that are sent from the mobile host should not be handled in this way, but be instead sent straight to their destination.|$|E
50|$|In case of Mobile-IP the <b>Home</b> <b>Agent</b> uses Proxy ARP {{in order}} to receive {{messages}} on behalf of the Mobile Node, so that it can forward the appropriate message to the actual mobile node's address (Care-of address).|$|E
5000|$|When {{acting as}} transmitter, a mobile node sends packets {{directly}} to the other communicating node, without sending the packets through the <b>home</b> <b>agent,</b> using its permanent home address as the source address for the IP packets. This is known as triangular routing or [...] "route optimization" [...] (RO) mode. If needed, the foreign agent could employ reverse tunneling by tunneling the mobile node's packets to the <b>home</b> <b>agent,</b> which in turn forwards them to the communicating node. This is needed in networks whose gateway routers check that the source IP address of the mobile host belongs to their subnet or discard the packet otherwise. In Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), [...] "reverse tunneling" [...] is the default behaviour, with RO being an optional behaviour.|$|E
40|$|Smart homes, {{as active}} {{participants}} in a smart grid, {{may no longer be}} modeled by passive load curves; because their interactive communication and bidirectional power flow within the smart grid affects demand, generation, and electricity rates. To consider such dynamic environmental properties, we use a multiagent-system-based approach in which individual <b>homes</b> are autonomous <b>agents</b> making rational decisions to buy, sell, or store electricity based on their present and expected future amount of load, generation, and storage, accounting for the benefits each decision can offer. In the proposed scheme, <b>home</b> <b>agents</b> prioritize their decisions based on the expected utilities they provide. Smart homes’ intention to minimize their electricity bills is in line with the grid’s aim to flatten the total demand curve. With a set of case studies and sensitivity analyses, we show how the overall performance of the <b>home</b> <b>agents</b> converges-as an emergent behavior-to an equilibrium benefiting both the entities in different operational conditions and determines the situations in which conventional homes would benefit from purchasing their own local generation-storage systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} cyclicality of {{portfolio}} flows under {{the presence of}} productivity growth rate shocks. Productivity growth rate shocks successfully replicate countercyclical net equity outflows and procyclical bond inflows for advanced countries, which couldn't be captured in a model with only level shocks. Similarly, for an emerging market economy, the model with growth rate shocks generates countercyclical net equity inflows and procyclical bond inflows in accordance with data. Following a growth rate shock, <b>home</b> <b>agents</b> experience a decrease both in equity inflows and outflows on impact. Inflows decrease due to sales of home equity to realize capital gains and outflows decrease due to initial dissaving to finance increases in consumption and investment. Equity inflows increase later, as home dividends rise. Equity outflows pick up also as wealthier <b>home</b> <b>agents</b> increase purchases of foreign assets to hedge against home productivity shocks.

50|$|This {{may lead}} to {{problems}} when using services that do ingress filtering, since the source address on the packet will be the home address of the mobile host, not the care-of address assigned to the host on its guest network.

50|$|Used in Internet routing, a care-of address (usually {{referred}} to as CoA) is a temporary IP address for a mobile device. This allows a <b>home</b> <b>agent</b> to forward messages to the mobile device. A separate address is required because the IP address of the device that is used as host identification is topologically incorrect - it does not match the network of attachment. The care-of address splits the dual nature of an IP address, that is, its use is to identify the host and the location within the global IP network.|$|E

40|$|Networks are {{protected}} using firewalls but when wireless networks are being used, {{the information in}} the network leaks like a sieve and information passes right over the firewall in both the directions. Hence these firewalls are not sufficient and effective in wireless networks. And even many intrusion detection systems are used in mobile ad-hoc networks like a). Signature-based IDS which is incapable of detecting novel threats and b). Anomaly detection scheme which can detect novel attacks but require much overhead, requires more processing capacity, and minor changes in the networks cannot be determined hence generate false positives. These IDS focus on either routing protocols or its efficiency, but it fails to address the security issues. Hence the ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users.
