5|$|Demand for Juventus {{tickets in}} {{occasional}} home games held away from Turin is high, suggesting that Juventus have stronger support {{in other parts}} of the country. Juventus is widely and especially popular throughout mainland Southern Italy, Sicily and Malta, leading the team to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest followings in its away matches, more than in Turin itself.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United are {{the largest}} fan-owned {{football}} club in the United Kingdom by number of members and <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest home attendances in English non-league football. The club is democratically run by its members who have equal voting rights and own one share in the club each.|$|E
5|$|The Nottingham Panthers <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest fanbases in British ice hockey, {{averaging}} over 5,000 spectators {{per game}} during the 2014–15 season. Their supporters have shared {{a number of}} rivalries with other teams during their history. Currently the Panthers have a fierce rivalry with the Sheffield Steelers. The two sides have played over 200 games, including eleven major finals, since 1992.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} partly self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed has been observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} {{been shown to}} <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best top-flight {{records in}} history, having {{finished}} below fourteenth only seven times. They {{have won the}} second most top flight league matches in English football, and have also accumulated the second most points, whether calculated by two points per win or by the contemporary points value. They {{have been in the}} top flight for the most consecutive seasons (92 as of 2017–18). Arsenal also have the highest average league finishing position for the 20th century, with an average league placement of 8.5.|$|E
5|$|BGSU {{was ranked}} 97th on the Top Public Schools ranking by U.S. News & World Report. The {{university}} remains {{a leader in}} teacher preparation and was ranked 127th among America's Best Education Schools by U.S. News & World Report. Students enrolled in the College of Education and Human Development may choose majors from among several teacher licensure areas, including early childhood (grades Pre-K to 3), Middle Childhood (grades 4 – 9), Adolescent-Young Adult (grades 7–12), Special Education (grades K–12), and foreign language (grades K–12).

50|$|Australian Bureau of Statistics {{research}} {{indicated in}} 2003 that the 2001 census {{data showed that}} Amata <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State's highest proportions of Aboriginal residents (89%) and, in all of South Australia, Amata at that time <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest ratios <b>of</b> women to men in the State, 54.6% (the highest being Springton, with 57.2%). Amata, like most APY communities, <b>has</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State's highest proportion of Australian-born residents (97%), <b>the</b> highest proportion <b>of</b> single parent families (27.3%) but <b>the</b> lowest ratio <b>of</b> home computer use (5.5%).|$|R

5|$|Birds <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most complex}} {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% {{of the fresh}} air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of}} the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|Entanglement {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species.|$|E
5|$|Fey's {{performance}} on the show was inspired by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and later used Louis-Dreyfus to play the stand-in for the character of Liz Lemon in flashback scenes during the live episode of the fifth season. After receiving 13 Emmy Award nominations and two wins for the final season, 30 Rock ended its critically acclaimed run with 112 Emmy award nominations. It has been cited {{as one of the}} greatest TV series of all time and it is considered to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greatest finales in television history.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once {{every three to}} five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot whales. For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.|$|E
5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but flatten during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi {{has been shown to}} dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of Keeper of the Archives at the University of Oxford dates from 1634. The university's records pre-date this, and it claims to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest continuous record-keeping traditions in Britain. Records were initially {{kept in the}} Priory of St Frideswide (the site of the present-day Christ Church), moving to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century, where they were housed with money and other valuables. The archives were left in considerable disarray by a burglary in 1544, and remained in chaos until Brian Twyne attended {{to them in the}} 17th century. As part of his work {{as a member of the}} committee preparing new statutes for the university (at the request of the Chancellor of the University, William Laud), Twyne prepared an index of the archives by 1631, and was appointed the first Keeper of the Archives under the revised statutes in 1634 as a reward for his work. Under Twyne and Gerard Langbaine, his successor as Keeper, the archives were moved into one of the rooms in the Tower of the Five Orders in the Bodleian Library; three of the wooden cupboards that were built at that time to store them are still in use.|$|E
