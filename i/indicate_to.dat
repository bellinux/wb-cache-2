5|$|Present weather, which present {{restrictions}} to visibility or {{presence of}} thunder or squalls, {{are reported in}} observations to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> aviation any possible threats during landings and takeoffs from airports. Types included in surface weather observations include precipitation, obscurations, other weather phenomena such as, well-developed dust/sand whirls, squalls, tornadic activity, sandstorms, volcanic ash, and dust storms.|$|E
5|$|Ambulances {{may also}} carry an emblem (either {{as part of}} the passive warning {{markings}} or not), such as a Red Cross, Red Crescent or Red Crystal (collective known as the Protective Symbols). These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red Cross member organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to {{correctly}} dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5000|$|By 1930, {{the highway}} was <b>indicated</b> <b>to</b> have a [...] "hard surface" [...] in Mobile and Citronelle; a gravel/chert or a sand-clay/topsoil surface from Mobile to Citronelle; and [...] "graded" [...] from Citronelle to the Mississippi state line. Later that year, the entire Mobile County segment was <b>indicated</b> <b>to</b> have a [...] "hard surface". The entire Washington County segment was <b>indicated</b> <b>to</b> have been graded. By {{the end of}} 1934, US 43, along with SR 5 were {{designated}} in Mobile, but the state maps are unclear {{as to whether they}} traveled concurrently with US 45/SR 57. By 1935, the entire Mobile County segment was <b>indicated</b> <b>to</b> have a [...] "pavement" [...] surface. The entire Washington County segment was <b>indicated</b> <b>to</b> have a [...] "gravel or chert" [...] surface. By 1939, the highway was <b>indicated</b> <b>to</b> be under construction from the Mobile-Washington county line to about Fruitdale.|$|R

5|$|At 20:15, {{the camp}} was secured from the Japanese and Prince fired his flare to signal {{the end of the}} assault. No gunfire had {{occurred}} for the last fifteen minutes. However, as the Rangers headed towards the meetup, Cpl. Roy Sweezy was shot twice by friendly fire, and later died. The Rangers and the weary, frail, and disease-ridden POWs {{made their way to the}} appointed Pampanga River rendezvous, where a caravan of 26carabao carts waited to transport them to Plateros, driven by local villagers organized by Pajota. At 20:40, once Prince determined that everyone had crossed the Pampanga River, he fired his second flare to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> Pajota and Joson's men to withdraw. The Scouts stayed behind at the meetup to survey the area for enemy retaliatory movements. Meanwhile, Pajota's men continued to resist the attacking enemy until they could finally withdraw at 22:00, when the Japanese forces stopped charging the bridge. Joson and his men met no opposition, and they returned to help escort the POWs.|$|E
5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a half}} after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E
5|$|The buttons worn on the Infantryman's {{clothing}} {{is not as}} minor a detail as it would sound. The average infantryman may have had his uniform made for him in Richmond, Virginia, however, the man enlisted in Georgia, and is now marching through the former state. In reflection to his loyalties to home, this man, for example, could have adorned his uniform with Georgia State buttons. This would <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> his fellow soldiers his allegiance to both his state and his military unit. This was common practice during the war for {{both sides in the}} conflict.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

25|$|In {{association}} football, linesmen carry small flags {{along the}} touch lines. They use the flags to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> the referee potential infringements of the laws, or who {{is entitled to}} possession of the ball that {{has gone out of}} the field of play, or, most famously, raising the flag to indicate an offside offence. Officials called touch judges use flags for similar purposes in both codes of rugby.|$|E
25|$|Headlight {{flashing}} in India {{is often used}} as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering {{to let you go}} first. Such use is however strongly discouraged because it can lead to accidents where the driver flashing has not seen the approach of another road user. It is also used to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes.|$|E

The numbers by every terminal node represent the payoffs to the players (e.g. 2,1 represents a payoff of 2 to player 1 and a payoff of 1 to player 2). The labels by every edge of the graph are {{the name of the}} action that edge represents.|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange automatically senses an off-hook {{condition of the}} telephone when the user removes the handset from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides dial tone {{at that time to}} <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> the user that the exchange is ready to receive dialed digits. The pulses or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange.|$|E
25|$|Two {{trackside}} signs exist: The “S”-Sign is {{posted at}} revenue tracks and indicates to the operator that a station is ahead. It {{is located at}} a distance no greater than 1200 feet (365.75 m) before a station platform. The “TB”-Sign is posted to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> the operator that an eight-car train (the longest used in the system) is clear of an interlocking (“turnback”) when the train front is flush with the sign, and that the train can turn back in the direction from which it came on the opposite track.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the first}} regiment, {{the second was}} {{distinguished}} by the shako which all the modern works <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> have been cylindrical, and was decorated by a surmounted rosette of a ganse cord and of a half-spherical pompom. The cord was tied in front of and behind the neck for the officers, the troopers carrying it in the usual way. The shako issued to the regiment is therefore same as that worn by the hussars at the time. The spherical pompom was the colour of the squadron.|$|E
25|$|The red body, slow {{peculiar}} flight, bright colouration {{and pattern}} of the wings are meant to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> predators that this butterfly is inedible, being well protected by the poisons it has sequestered from its larval food plant. It also emits a nasty smelling substance when handled to further enhance its unappealing qualities. Hence it is rarely attacked by predators, a strategy so successful, that edible butterflies have evolved to mimic it, the classic example being that of the female morph of the common Mormon that is Papilio polytes, female form stichius.|$|E
25|$|Since {{applications}} {{can communicate}} either {{with or without}} TLS (or SSL), {{it is necessary for}} the client to <b>indicate</b> <b>to</b> the server the setup of a TLS connection. One of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for TLS connections, for example port 443 for HTTPS. Another mechanism is for the client to make a protocol-specific request to the server to switch the connection to TLS; for example, by making a STARTTLS request when using the mail and news protocols.|$|E
