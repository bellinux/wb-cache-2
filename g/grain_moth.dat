40|$|More than 55 % of Africans {{earn their}} {{livelihood}} from agriculture, {{which is also}} the key to economic development of the continent. The agriculture is largely traditional and grains constitute the bulk of food production. Sorghum, maize, rice, wheat and millet for cereals and cowpeas, dry beans, groundnut, chickpea and bambara groundnut for pulses, are most common in Africa. Because agricultural production is seasonal while the demands for agricultural commodities are more evenly spread throughout the year, grain storage becomes a particularly important agricultural activity. Grain storage is done on-farm, peasant farmers’ residences (family granaries), community stores and large warehouses. Since most of the grains produced in Africa are destined for human consumption, storage in family granaries predominates. Unfortunately, the technology and management of family granaries and other storage structures are seriously wanting. These predispose the grains to serious attacks from biotic constraints such as insects, rodents, birds and micro-organisms. The rate of insect proliferation in these storage structures could be alarmingly high, especially with the warm climate in tropical Africa. Annual grain losses of up to 50 % in cereals and 100 % in pulses have been reported, although average losses stand at roughly 20 %. Major insects that attack cereals and pulses include grain weevils, grain borers, grain beetles and <b>grain</b> <b>moths.</b> Pest prevention, early detection and pest control would greatly reduce grain losses during storage. Control methods comprise physical, chemical and phytochemical measures with emphasis on the use of traditional botanical pesticides. This paper discusses the major cereals and pulses stored in Africa, the different storage structures, storage losses, constraints, control measures, and the relationship between storage structures and pest infestation.

The monitoring methods comprised visual observation, monitoring of harvested panicles for the emergence of adults and use of sex pheromone or aggregation traps.

Finally, collected rice samples were taken to the laboratory to identify insect species and count the number of individuals.

This research focuses mainly on the insect communities of stored wheat and stored rice in two different geographical locations, their temporal relationships and the most important or abundant species within that community. Stored wheat was sampled for one season in Manhattan, KS and for rice stored in Beaumont, TX was sampled for two seasons. Hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea stercorea (Coleoptera: Mycetophagidae) was one of the most abundant species and was present in every bin of either wheat or rice and appeared to move into and out of the grain mass. In wheat bin, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was a predominant species captured in the bin headspace, but was not frequently recovered in the grain mass. Headspace temperatures tended to be warmer than grain temperatures and outside temperatures. Other major insects recovered in wheat bin included the following groups or species: Anthicidae, Lathridiidae, Cryptolestes, foreign grain beetle Ahasverus advena (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), sawtoothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), smalleyed flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionoidea) and minute pirate bug Xylocoris favipes (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae).

40|$|Abstract—The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} on induction {{and stability of}} parasitization of less preferred factitious host (the Angoumois <b>grain</b> <b>moth,</b> Sitotroga cerealella) eggs by Trichogramma principium females were studied under laboratory conditions. The percentage of parasitizing females at 15 °C was significantly lower than that at 20, 25, and 30 °С. At constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C, mean durations of pre-oviposition periods were 6. 5, 2. 1, 0. 9, and 0. 6 days, respectively (differences were significant between all regimens). In most of females, parasi-tization induced by high temperature (25 °C) continued after the temperature decrease to 15 °C. These results sug-gest that although emerged females are ready to lay eggs, rather prolonged pre-oviposition period may precede parasitization of less preferred hosts, and the duration of this period may depend on temperature.

Dissections showed that refusing females had significantly more mature eggs than ovipositing females, independent of host age.

40|$|Abstract—Experiments have {{showed that}} heat shock (45 °C during 30 min) caused a twofold {{increase}} in mortality of T. principium females recorded during {{two days after}} the shock. The percentage of females that have started parasitization of the <b>grain</b> <b>moth</b> eggs (among all survived females) sharply decreased (40 – 50 % and 30 % in controls and in treated females, respectively). Thus, the switch from egg retention to parasitization of less preferred hosts was not the result of “pathological ” changes in a senescent or dying wasp, but a “normal ” stage of adult life. Fe-males that have already started parasitization before the heat shock, continued to parasitize after the shock (differ-ences between treatments and controls were not significant). Obviously, the heat shock influence on oviposition was mostly indirect (as a cue factor) and the wasps that have already started parasitization, were insensitive to this cue. These data resemble the loss of sensitivity to the diapause-inducing factor which was often observed after re-activation. We conclude that the results of our study confirm analogies between egg retention and reproductive dia-pause.

40|$|Abstract—Laboratory {{experiments}} {{conducted at}} L: D = 16 : 8 {{have shown that}} the observed temporal pattern of parasitization of the Angoumois <b>grain</b> <b>moth,</b> Sitotroga cerealella eggs by Trichogramma principium females repre-sents a resultant of arrhythmic age-related trends and circadian rhythms. Most of females delayed parasitization. The daily number of females starting to parasitize was maximal {{on the first day of}} contact with the host and then gradually declined. Practically all of the females started parasitization during the photophase. Moreover, when the first contact with the host fell on the scotophase, the total cumulative percentage of females that started parasitiza-tion during four days of the experiment significantly decreased. Oviposition activities of parasitizing females also occurred mainly during photophase. However, under constant light, these circadian rhythms were damped out after one cycle. In addition, anticipatory period of darkness during photophase directly inhibited parasitization. This suggests that the observed rhythms can be easily modified by the direct environmental influence. Under natural conditions, such a flexible oviposition rhythm may be of advantage for these parasitoids enabling them to use any opportunity for reproduction. In biocontrol practice, the lability of parasitization rhythms may enable Tricho-gramma females to adapt immediately to any new light–dark regimes, although darkness may have negative effects on their efficiency.
