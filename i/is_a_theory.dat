5|$|In economics, the {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> {{of the market}} interest rate.

The term loanable funds includes all forms of credit, such as loans, bonds, or savings deposits.|$|E
5|$|Eliminativists such as Paul and Patricia Churchland {{argue that}} folk {{psychology}} is a fully developed but non-formalized theory of human behavior. It {{is used to}} explain and make predictions about human mental states and behavior. This view {{is often referred to}} as the theory of mind or just simply theory-theory, for it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> which theorizes the existence of an unacknowledged theory. As a theory in the scientific sense, eliminativists maintain, folk psychology needs to be evaluated on the basis of its predictive power and explanatory success as a research program for the investigation of the mind/brain.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>theory</b> T <b>is</b> <b>an</b> o-minimal <b>theory</b> {{if every}} model of T is o-minimal. It {{is known that}} the {{complete}} <b>theory</b> T of <b>an</b> o-minimal structure <b>is</b> <b>an</b> o-minimal <b>theory.</b> This result is remarkable because the complete <b>theory</b> of <b>a</b> minimal structure need not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> strongly minimal <b>theory,</b> that is, there may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> elementarily equivalent structure which is not minimal.|$|R
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> of gravitation {{that was}} developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|M-theory <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> {{in physics}} that unifies all {{consistent}} versions of superstring theory. The {{existence of such}} a theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California {{in the spring of}} 1995. Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> {{in evolutionary}} biology which proposes that once species {{appear in the}} fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E

5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> which describes {{three of the}} four known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E
