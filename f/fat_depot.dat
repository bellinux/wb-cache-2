25|$|Fatty Tissue. In Biology, {{adipose tissue}} (/ˈædəˌpoʊs/) or body fat or <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> or just fat is loose {{connective}} tissue composed of adipocytes. It is technically composed of roughly only 80% fat; fat in its solitary state {{exists in the}} liver and muscles. Adipose tissue is derived from lipoblasts. Its main role is to store {{energy in the form}} of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ, as it produces hormones such as leptin, resistin, and the cytokine TNFα. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat—to be specific, adipose tissue. Two types of adipose tissue exist: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene. Adipose tissue was first identified by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in 1551.|$|E

40|$|During the {{finishing}} phase of bovines, {{large amounts of}} subcutaneous and visceral fats are deposited leading to production inefficiencies with major impact on meat quality. A {{better understanding of the}} cellularity features of the main fat depots could provide strategies for adipose tissue manipulation. This study assessed the effect of feeding diets with distinct forage to concentrate ratios on the cellularity of two fat depots of beef cattle and their implications on the fatty acid profile. Thus, two phylogenetically distant Portuguese bovine breeds, Alentejana and Barros&# 227;, were selected. The results did not show differences in subcutaneous fat deposition nor in visceral fat depots partitioning. Plasma adipokines concentration failed to show a consistent relationship with fatness, as leptin remained constant in all experimental groups, whereas interleukin- 6 was influenced by breed. <b>Fat</b> <b>depot</b> seems to determine the area and number of adipocytes, with larger adipocytes and a lower number of cells in subcutaneous fat than in mesenteric fat. Neither breed nor diet influenced adipocytes area and number. The contents of total fatty acids, partial sums of fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid isomeric profile were affected by breed and <b>fat</b> <b>depot.</b> The incorporation of saturated fatty acids (SFA), trans fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) was higher in mesenteric <b>fat</b> <b>depot,</b> whereas subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> had greater percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). In addition, SFA and MUFA proportions seem to be breed-related. In spite of the less relevant role of diet, the percentages of PUFA and BCFA were influenced by this factor. Under these experimental conditions, the effect of <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> on cellularity and fatty acid composition prevails over breed or diet, as reinforced by the principal component analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Anatomically {{separate}} <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> {{differ in}} size, function, and contribution to pathological {{states such as}} the metabolic syndrome. We isolated preadipocytes from different human <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> {{to determine if the}} basis for this variation is partly attributable to differences in inherent properties of fat cell progenitors.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{previously}} reported {{the presence of}} brown/beige adipocytes in the white <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of mature cattle. The present study exam-ined the effects of dietary vitamin A on the expression of brown/beige adipocyte-related genes in the white <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of fattening cattle. No significant differences were observed in the expression of Ucp 1 between vitamin A-deficient cattle and control cattle. However, {{the expression of the}} other brown/beige adipocyte-related genes was slightly higher in the mesenteric <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of vitamin A-deficient cattle. The present results suggest that a vitamin A deficiency does not markedly affect the expression of Ucp 1 in white <b>fat</b> <b>depots,</b> but imply that it may stimulate the emergence of beige adipocytes in the mesenteric <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of fattening cattle.

40|$|Background Puberty is {{a period}} of rapid growth {{associated}} with metabolic, hormonal, and body composition changes that can influence risk factors for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Objective To evaluate body composition and insulin sensitivity (IS) modifications throughout puberty in a large group of obese Caucasian subjects. Methods Five hundred and nineteen obese subjects (4 - 19 years), grouped according to gender and Tanner stage (T), underwent oral glucose tolerance test. Quantitative insulin check index (QUICKI) and ISI were calculated as indexes of IS. In 309 subjects, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, IGF 1, adiponectin, and leptin were also evaluated. Results Body composition modifications were sexually dimorphic, with girls not modifying fat and lean percentage and fat distribution (P> 0. 15), and boys decreasing fat percentage and increasing lean percentage and central <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> (P< 0. 001) across Ts. IS decreased during mid-puberty and returned to prepubertal levels by the end of puberty. Girls showed lower IS than boys (P< 0. 01 and = 0. 03 for QUICKI and ISI respectively). In multivariate analysis factors that negatively influenced IS, independently from T or age, were total fat mass and central <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> in girls (P< 0. 05 and < 0. 01, respectively), total fat and lean mass in boys (P< 0. 01). IGF 1, adiponectin, and leptin were not related to pubertal IS. Conclusions In obese Caucasian subjects, further decrease of IS observed during puberty is a transient phenomenon.

Objective: To characterize the prevalence and respiratory activity of brown-like adipocytes within pADR, OME and subcutaneous (SC) <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> in human adult pheo patients. Design: This was an observational cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: We studied 46 patients who underwent surgery for benign adrenal tumors (21 pheos and 25 controls with adrenocortical adenomas). Main outcome measure: We characterized adipocyte browning in pADR, SC, and OME <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> for histological and immunohistological features, mitochondrial respiration rate, and gene expression. We also determined circulating levels of catecholamines and other browning-related hormones. Results: 11 of 21 pheo pADR adipose samples, but only 1 of 25 pADR samples from control patients, exhibited multilocular adipocytes. The pADR browning phenotype was associated with higher plasma catecholamines and raised UCP 1. Mitochondria from multilocular pADR fat of pheo patients exhibited increased rates of coupled and uncoupled respiration. Global gene expression analysis in pADR fat revealed enrichment in β-oxidation genes in pheo patients with multilocular adipocytes. No SC or OME <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> exhibited aspects of browning. Conclusion: Browning of the pADR depot occurred in half of pheo patients and was associated with increased catecholamines and mitochondrial activity.

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} beta (TGF-β) plays an {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of obesity, influencing the release of inflammation mediators and promoting remodeling and collagen deposition in the adipose tissue (AT). In this context, this work aims to elucidate whether TGF-β and Smad-dependent or Smad-independent signaling pathways contribute to regional differentiation of AT in high-fat diet (HFD) and energy-restricted (ER) rat models. For this, TGF-β, TGF-β receptors I and II, PAI- 1 and GLUT 4 mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR, and western blotting assays allowed the semiquantification of TGF-β and proteins from Smad 3, ERK 1 / 2 and Akt signaling pathways in subcutaneous and visceral (epididymal, retroperitoneal and mesenteric) <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> from control, HFD and ER-treated rats. HFD was associated to increased levels of TGF-β and PAI- 1 mRNA in epididymal and retroperitoneal visceral <b>fat</b> <b>depots,</b> while ER diet induced a reduction of TGF-β mRNA levels in mesenteric, but surprisingly an increase in retroperitoneal fat. Regarding the different signaling pathways, contrarily to what was found for Smad 3, activation of ERK 1 / 2 and Akt in response to HFD was detected in all the visceral but not in subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> ER-treated rats presented a more heterogeneous signaling response, as well as decreased TGF-β receptors expression, in the different visceral <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> In conclusion, subcutaneous and visceral AT respond differently to distinct diet patterns regarding TGF-β expression and activated signaling pathways.

We measured appropriate biomarkers of skeletal muscle (creatinine) and AT (nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), glycerol, leptin) drainage. Blood obtained in this way from the saphenous vein did not show creatinine release (creatinine concentration 100. 5 +/- 0. 4 %, mean +/- s. e. m., of that in arterialized blood), whereas creatinine concentrations in blood draining forearm muscle averaged 121 +/- 1 % of those in arterialized blood. Fatty acid release from the tissue drained was suppressed after feeding and increased during beta-adrenergic stimulation. We also demonstrated leptin secretion.

The present study aimed at comparing expression and subcellular distribution of perilipin and hormone-sensitive lipase in two abdominal adipose tissues of lean and obese women. We examined whether regional differences in perilipin expression contribute to impaired lipolytic rates. Methods Abdominal subcutaneous and omental adipose tissues were obtained from six lean and ten obese women. We measured total protein content and relative distribution of hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin proteins between lipid and non-lipid fractions in tissue homogenates. Hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin mRNA levels, adipocyte size, basal (non-stimulated) and noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis in isolated adipocytes were determined.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of brown adipocytes: {{classical}} brown adipocytes that form the brown <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> and beige adipocytes that emerge in the white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> Beige adipocytes have a low level of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp 1) expression in the basal state, but Ucp 1 expression is increased in response to β adrenergic receptor activation. The present study explored the factors responsible for the differentiation of 3 T 3 -L 1 white preadipocytes to beige adipocytes. Significant expression of Ucp 1 was not detected under any tested conditions in the absence of isoproterenol (Iso), an agonist of β adrenergic receptor. Iso-induced Ucp 1 expression was significantly higher in the cells treated with a mixture of triiodothyronine (T[3]) and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) for days 0 – 8 than in the control cells. Chronic IBMX treatment was indispensable for the enhanced Iso-induced Ucp 1 expression, and treatment with additional rosiglitazone (Rosi) for days 0 – 8 further increased the Ucp 1 expression. Recently, genes were identified that are predominantly expressed in beige adipocytes, which were induced from stromal vascular cells in white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> However, the expression levels of the beige adipocyte-selective genes in the adipocytes induced by the mixture of T[3], IBMX and Rosi did not differ from those in the control adipocytes.

The fact that MAT increases in the setting of calorie restriction/ anorexia is a feature that distinguishes this <b>depot</b> from other <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> Exercise regulates MAT, decreasing MAT quantity and diminishing the size of marrow adipocytes. [...] The exercise regulation of marrow fat suggests that it bears some physiologic similarity to other white adipose depots. Moreover, increased MAT in obesity further suggests a similarity to white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b>|$|R

Despite the long experience of adipose tissue autotransplantation there is still no guarantee of optimal result in late postoperative period. All these are the reasons to search for new techniques, supplementary factors preventing lysis and fibrosis of graft, and for the most appropriate adipose depots.

40|$|Calcitriol, a calcitrophic {{hormone that}} can be {{suppressed}} by high dietary calcium, favors fatty acid synthesis and inhibits lipolysis via non-genomicmodulation of Ca 2 + influx. Calcitriol also suppresses UCP 2 expression via the nVDRand thereby increases energy efficiency. Calcitriol exerts a dose-dependent impact on adipocyte apoptosis and regulates adipose tissue <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> location and expansion by promoting glucocorticoid production and release. Recent data also demonstrate a pivotal role of calcitriol in the modulation of cytokines, with potential roles in energy metabolism in adipocytes, macrophages, and skeletal muscle...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{test the}} {{association}} of regional <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> with circulating adiponectin and resistin concentrations and to assess the potential mediating effect of adipokines on associations between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> and cardiometabolic risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Participants from the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort (n 916, 55 % women; mean age 59 years) free of cardiovascular disease underwent computed tomography measurement of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), pericardial fat, and intrathoracic fat volumes and assays of circulating adiponectin and resistin. RESULTS — VAT, SAT, pericardial fat, and intrathoracic fat were negatively correlated with adiponectin (r 0. 19 to 0. 34, P 0. 001 [women]; r 0. 15 to 0. 26, P 0. 01 [men] except SAT) and positively correlated with resistin (r 0. 16 – 0. 21, P 0. 001 [women]; r 0. 11 – 0. 14, P 0. 05 [men] except VAT). VAT increased the multivariable model R 2 for adi-ponectin from 2 – 4 % to 10 – 13 % and for resistin from 3 – 4 % to 3 – 6 %. Adjustment for adipo-kines did not fully attenuate associations between VAT, SAT, and cardiometabolic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS — Adiponectin and resistin are correlated with <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> cross-sectionally...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStimulating {{conversion}} of white fat to metabolically active adipocytes (beige fat) constitutes a promising strategy against weight gain and its deleterious associated-disorders. We provide direct evidence that prolactin (PRL), {{best known for}} its actions on the mammary gland, plays a pivotal role in energy balance through the control of adipocyte differentiation and fate. Here we show that lack of prolactin receptor (PRLR) causes resistance to high-fat-diet-induced obesity due to enhanced energy expenditure and increased metabolic rate. Mutant mice displayed reduced fat mass associated with appearance of massive brown-like adipocyte foci in perirenal and subcutaneous but not in gonadal <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> under a high-fat diet. Positron emission tomography imaging further demonstrated the occurrence of these thermogenic brown <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> in adult mice, providing additional support for recruitable brown-like adipocytes (beigeing) in white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> Consistent with the activation of brown adipose tissue, PRLR inactivation increases expression of master genes controlling brown adipocyte fate (PRDM 16) and mitochondrial function (PGC 1 α, UCP 1). Altered pRb/Foxc 2 expression suggests that this PRL-regulated pathway may contribute to beige cell commitment. Together, these results provide direct genetic evidence that PRLR affects energy balance and metabolic adaptation in rodents via effects on brown adipose tissue differentiation and function...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. There are {{two types}} of brown adipocytes: {{classical}} brown adipocytes that form the brown <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> and beige adipocytes that emerge in the white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> Beige adipocytes have a low level of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp 1) expression in the basal state, but Ucp 1 expression is increased in response to β adrenergic receptor activation. The present study explored the factors responsible for the differentia-tion of 3 T 3 -L 1 white preadipocytes to beige adipocytes. Significant expression of Ucp 1 was not detected under any tested conditions in the absence of isoproterenol (Iso), an agonist of β adrenergic receptor. Iso-induced Ucp 1 expression was significantly higher in the cells treated with a mixture of triiodothyronine (T 3) and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) for days 0 – 8 than in the control cells. Chronic IBMX treatment was indispensable for the enhanced Iso-induced Ucp 1 expression, and treatment with additional rosiglitazone (Rosi) for days 0 – 8 further increased the Ucp 1 expression. Recently, genes were identified that are predominantly expressed in beige adipocytes, which were induced from stromal vascular cells in white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> However, the expression levels of the beige adipocyte-selective genes in the adipocytes induced by the mixture of T 3, IBMX and Rosi did not differ from those in the control adipocytes. The present study indicates that 3 T 3 -L 1 cells can differentiate to beige-like adipocytes by prolonged treatment with the mixture of T 3, IBMX and Rosi and that the gene expression profile of the adipocytes is distinct from those previously induced from white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> KEY WORDS: adipocyte, beige adipocyte, cell culture, cellular differentiation, Ucp 1. doi: 10. 1292 /jvms. 13 - 0359; J.
