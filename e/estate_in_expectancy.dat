DESIGN: Mortality data for English health authorities from 1984 - 94, compiled by the Office for National Statistics, were assessed conventionally and using life table techniques. SETTING: District health authorities in England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> the 105 DHAs in relation to rank, to gender, and to deprivation category based on the census based Jarman score. CONCLUSIONS: Differences <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> had widened over the decade and prosperous areas with greatest longevity had seen the largest gains. In most deprived areas improvements <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> were negligible. The greatest gender differences <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> were also seen in deprived areas...|$|R

40|$|The present article analyzed, how {{need for}} {{cognition}} (NFC) influences {{the formation of}} performance expectancies. When processing information, individuals with lower NFC often rely on salient information and shortcuts compared to individuals higher in NFC. We assume that these preferences of processing will also make individuals low in NFC more responsive to salient achievement-related cues because the processing of salient cues is cognitively less demanding than the processing of non-salient cues. Therefore, individuals lower in NFC should tend to draw wider ranging inferences from salient achievement-related information. In a sample of N = 197 secondary school students, achievement-related feedback (grade on an English examination) affected changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> non-corresponding academic subjects (e. g., expectation of final grade in mathematics or history) when NFC was lower, whereas for students with higher NFC, changes <b>in</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>in</b> non-corresponding academic subjects were not affected...|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to partition the change <b>in</b> US life <b>expectancy</b> into those major causes of death and age groups that contributed most to the decline <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> for Black males and females and to the increase <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> for White males and females in the period from 1984 through 1989. METHODS. By means of a life table partitioning technique, the positive and negative contributions of age and cause of death to changes <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> were estimated. RESULTS. Causes contributing most to the decrease <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> for Black males included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (or = 85 years of age). CONCLUSIONS. Mortality trends between the two major race groups in the United States diverged sharply, and without precedent, during the late 1980 s. A description of these trends in terms of contributions to change <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> may help us better analyze and interpret changes in the health of these groups and may contribute to a better allocation of resources for research, education, and public health programs...|$|R

" The gender difference was analyzed by decomposition method, including age-specific decomposition and cause-specific decomposition. Women lived much longer than men in Chinese urban areas, with remarkable gains <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> since 2005, respectively. The gender difference reached a peak in 2007. Mortality difference {{between men and women}} in the 60 - 79 age group made the largest contributions to the gender gap <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> all 6 years. Among causes of death, cancers, circulatory diseases and respiratory diseases made the largest contributions to the gender gap. 33 - 38 % of the gender gap were caused by cancers, among which lung cancer contributed 0. 6 years of the overall gap. The contribution of cancers to the gender gap reduced over time, mostly influenced by the narrowing effect of liver cancer on gender gap. Traffic accidents and suicide were the external causes influencing the gender gap, contributing 10 - 16 % of the overall difference. Public health efforts to reduce excess mortalities for cancers, circulatory disease, respiratory diseases, and suicide among men in particular might further narrow the gender gap <b>in</b> life <b>expectancy</b> <b>in</b> Chinese cities...|$|R
