5|$|A non-supercharged {{version of}} the Merlin using a larger {{proportion}} of steel and iron components was produced for use <b>in</b> <b>tanks.</b> This engine, the Rolls-Royce Meteor, in turn led to the smaller Rolls-Royce Meteorite. In 1943, further Meteor development was handed over to Rover, in exchange for Rover's gas turbine interests.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> so that they could deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{participated in}} the {{mobilization}} of the nation's economy and resources. Domestically, the state produced munitions in an army plant near Sellersburg. The P-47 fighter-plane was manufactured in Evansville at Republic Aviation. The steel produced in northern Indiana was used <b>in</b> <b>tanks,</b> battleships, and submarines. Other war-related materials were produced throughout the state. Indiana's military bases were activated, with areas such as Camp Atterbury reaching historical peaks in activity.|$|E
30|$|Depending on the {{increase}} in the pressure of ammonia gas <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A, the compressor suction valve of tank B opens, and thus, the entire amount of ammonia gas enters tank B from tank A. When the compressor suction valve is open, the compressor does not run, because the ammonia gas, which is vaporized <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A and passed to tank B, can decrease the ammonia gas concentration <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> B. The main principle in this process is {{the increase}} in the ammonia concentration <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> B.|$|R
30|$|One way {{for this}} {{increase}} is as follows: The ammonia gas is vaporized <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A, but <b>in</b> the meantime, the ammonia gas pressure <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A must be increased extensively {{within a short}} process time. This operation will continue until the ammonia gas concentration <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> B is 100  %. When the ammonia gas concentration is 100  %, liquid ammonia can enter <b>tank</b> B. Moreover, <b>in</b> the time frame shown in Fig.  2, the ammonia gas concentration is monitored <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> B, and accordingly, the amount of purged nitrogen gas is calculated.|$|R
30|$|The {{ammonia gas}} {{entering}} tank B forces the nitrogen gas <b>in</b> this <b>tank</b> to be {{expelled from the}} discharge point. Similarly, when the pressure difference between tanks A and B decreases, the compressor suction valve is closed and the compressor is allowed to run for allowing nitrogen gas to flow between the tanks and for discharging nitrogen gas by creating pressure <b>in</b> the <b>tank.</b> Thus, the vaporized ammonia <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A is liquefied and stored <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A. Once the pressure of ammonia gas <b>in</b> the <b>tank</b> is increased by the multistage compressor, the compressor stops, and thus, liquid ammonia <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A is vaporized.|$|R

5|$|Despite Germany's reorganization, their {{manpower}} {{was still}} incomparable {{to that of}} the Western Allies. While Germany's Army Group B was able to increase their armored strength from 100 to 239 vehicles, these were opposed by 2,300 Allied tanks. Field Marshal Model reported that only 6,500 replacements had been sent to cover the 75,000 casualties suffered during the month of September. General Eisenhower commanded three army groups, totaling eight field armies with 55 divisions; these provided a two-to-one advantage in artillery guns and a twenty-to-one advantage <b>in</b> <b>tanks,</b> and could count on almost 14,000 combat aircraft, as compared to the Luftwaffe's 573.|$|E

5|$|Far Side Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos <b>in</b> <b>Tanks.</b> First {{conceived as a}} series of ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and outdated computer sound design. The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, disposable consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Red Army {{resumed their}} {{offensive}} on 12 January 1945. German forces were outnumbered twenty {{to one in}} aircraft, eleven to one in infantry, and seven to one <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> on the Eastern Front. By {{the end of the}} month, the Red Army had made bridgeheads across the Oder, the last geographic obstacle before Berlin. The western Allies continued to advance as well, but not as rapidly as the Red Army. The Panzer Corps conducted a successful defensive operation on 17–24 February at the Hron River, stalling the Allied advance towards Vienna. The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Corps made their way towards Austria, but were slowed by damaged railways.|$|E
5|$|Other organic {{materials}} such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E

5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The {{vicinity}} of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and traffic jams on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was stopped short of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|After the Villa Expedition, Patton was {{detailed}} to Front Royal, Virginia, {{to oversee}} horse procurement for the Army, but Pershing intervened on his behalf. After the United States entered World War I, and Pershing was named {{commander of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) on the Western Front, Patton requested to join his staff. Patton was promoted to captain on May 15, 1917 and left for Europe, among the 180 men of Pershing's advance party which departed May 28 and arrived in Liverpool, England, on June 8. Taken as Pershing's personal aide, Patton oversaw the training of American troops in Paris until September, then moved to Chaumont and assigned as a post adjutant, commanding the headquarters company overseeing the base. Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to take an interest <b>in</b> <b>tanks,</b> as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion. While in a hospital for jaundice, Patton met Colonel Fox Conner, who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.|$|E

5|$|German forces also {{operated}} in the Battle of Jarama, {{which began with}} a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937. It included German-supplied ground forces, including two batteries of machine guns, a tank division, and the Condor Legion's anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft helped ensure a stalemate. It showed up the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft, faced with superior Soviet-made fighters. The Legion's efforts only partly mitigated what was a significant defeat for the Nationalists at the Battle of Guadalajara during March. A joint Italian-German general {{had been set up}} in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than first thought, it was the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5|$|The Norman town of Caen was a D-Day {{objective}} for the 3rd Infantry Division, which {{landed on}} Sword Beach on 6 June 1944. The capture of Caen {{was the most}} ambitious objective of I Corps (Lieutenant-General John Crocker). The Overlord plan called for the Second Army (Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey) to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the south-east of Caen, acquiring airfields and protecting the left flank of the US First Army while it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, {{which could be used}} as the pivot for a swing left of the Allied front to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River. The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations. The Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> and mobile units and a battle of manoeuvre would be to their advantage.|$|E
30|$|Another {{purpose of}} the {{operation}} {{is to ensure that}} the entire amount of ammonia is used to exert pressure on the nitrogen gas, for purging nitrogen <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> B. The entire amount of ammonia gas in the available system is transferred from tank A to tank B. The vaporized part of liquid ammonia <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A is sent to the multistage compressor for liquefaction, and this liquefied ammonia is sent to tank A for storage. Most of the vaporized ammonia <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A flows to tank B because of the concentration gradient and the difference between B and C.|$|R
30|$|Tank A {{is filled}} with liquid ammonia, and tank B {{is filled with}} {{nitrogen}} gas. The purpose of this arrangement is to purge nitrogen gas <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> B, <b>in</b> preparation for filling with liquid ammonia. Because of the ambient temperature, the liquid ammonia <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A (1  atm, − 33  °C) may vaporize and reach the compressor suction by pipeline 1. The liquefied ammonia is repeatedly directed to tank A from the compressor discharge via pipelines 2 – 5. The conditioning work involving prefilling tank B with liquid ammonia, by using pipeline 1, was accomplished by the vaporized ammonia <b>in</b> <b>tank</b> A.|$|R

5|$|The Romans {{constructed}} numerous aqueducts. A surviving treatise by Frontinus, {{who served}} as curator aquarum (water commissioner) under Nerva, reflects the administrative importance placed on ensuring the water supply. Masonry channels carried water from distant springs and reservoirs along a precise gradient, using gravity alone. After the water passed through the aqueduct, it was collected <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> and fed through pipes to public fountains, baths, toilets, or industrial sites. The main aqueducts {{in the city of}} Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia. The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120km away along a sinuous route of more than 336km. Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance, and to a technological standard that was not to be equalled until modern times. The Romans also made use of aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire, at sites such as Las Medulas and Dolaucothi in South Wales.|$|E
5|$|The initial Overlord {{plan called}} for the British Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l'Éventé to the {{south-east}} of Caen, to acquire space for airfields {{and to protect the}} left flank of the United States First Army while it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its environs would give the Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, which could then be used as the pivot for a swing left to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River. The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially attractive to Allied planners, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations. Since the Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> and mobile units, creating the conditions for a fluid, fast moving battle was to their advantage.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even <b>in</b> <b>tanks</b> as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E
