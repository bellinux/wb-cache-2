5|$|Kettle Creek is a <b>freestone</b> stream, {{meaning that}} there is little {{limestone}} and alkalinity in it.|$|E
5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, {{but some of the}} northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a <b>freestone</b> stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern <b>freestone</b> streams.|$|E
5|$|There is a flooded {{strip mine}} {{in the western part}} of the {{watershed}} of Little Catawissa Creek. The headwaters of the creek are on a mountain known as Big Mountain. The creek is a <b>freestone</b> stream.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of frame}} and <b>freestones</b> houses from 17.-19. century {{can be found}} in {{quarters}} and suburbs, f.e. Poppenreuth, Burgfarrnbach, Vach and Dambach.|$|R
50|$|In the 2009-10 season, De Vries surpassed Roger <b>Freestone's</b> club {{record of}} 22 clean sheets {{in a single}} season with a shut-out against Scunthorpe United on 5 April 2010. He {{would go on to}} finish the season with 25 clean sheets, winning the Football League's Golden Glove award for the Championship in the process.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} is constructed of rubble stone, dressed with <b>freestones.</b> The roof is tiled with stone tiles, there are stone finials and grouped ashlar chimneystacks. Originally set {{out as a}} hall house, but changed later to form an L-shaped floorplan. The {{building is}} two storeys high, with four gables on the frontage, two smaller triangular ones and two larger ogee headed ones.|$|R
5|$|The Romans {{would later}} refer to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, Hibernia, or Scotia. Ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting {{every part of}} Ireland in 100 CE. The {{relationship}} between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of <b>Freestone</b> Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry (mainly gritstone) and dressed with <b>freestone.</b> The nave {{measures}} 44feet 9inches long by 15feet 6inches wide (13.6 by 4.7m) and the chancel measures 32feet 9inches long by 20feet 6inches (10 by 6.25m) wide. The nave has three bays, and the chancel {{at the east}} end of the nave has two bays; it is slightly wider than the nave. The nave and the chancel have external buttresses.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{resident}} {{rainbow trout}} usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are {{native to the}} alluvial or <b>freestone</b> streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as bedrock and spring creeks. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.|$|E
25|$|Table above: Compositions {{of glass}} from the 1st Millennium AD. Adapted from data {{published}} in Sanderson, Hunter and Warren’s analysis of 1st Millennium AD glass (top) and data published by <b>Freestone’s</b> study of the provenance of ancient glass through compositional analysis (bottom). HIMT stands for high iron, manganese and titanium glass, nm for not measured and where there were only traces or the value was below the analytical equipment's detection limits <0.1 is used.|$|R
6000|$|Deep-tangled forest {{filled the}} lower claylands, {{swarming}} with pheasant, roe, badger, and more wolves than were needed. Broken, park-like glades covered the upper <b>freestones,</b> where the red deer {{came out from}} harbor for their evening graze, and the partridges and plovers whirred up, and the hares and rabbits loped away, innumerable; and where hollies and ferns always gave dry lying for the night. What did men need more, whose bodies were as stout as their hearts? ...|$|R
25|$|Cultivated peaches {{are divided}} into clingstones and <b>freestones,</b> {{depending}} on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skin. Low-acid white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed cultivars.|$|R
5|$|Dolomite, {{sandstone}} and quartzite rock {{have been}} extensively mined in the park. Though traces of silver, copper and gold are present, {{there have been}} no economic finds. The park is scattered with many quarries; the largest within the park is an open-cut in the northwest corner. It was in operation until 1982 supplying stone for buildings, including Adelaide's war memorial and St Peter's Cathedral. Tea Tree Gully <b>Freestone</b> from some quarries has been used for the facades and ornamental dressing of many of Adelaide’s Victorian public buildings. Adelaide Town Hall, the General Post Office and Supreme Court Buildings in Adelaide were all built entirely of this stone. The quarries supplied dressing stock for ornamentation on buildings, including St Peter's Cathedral, St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Flinders Street Baptist Church and the University of Adelaide's Mitchell Building.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with <b>freestone</b> and ashlar dressings, copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The doorway to the tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry, dressed with <b>freestone.</b> It {{measures}} 45 feet by 14 feet 6inches (14 by 4.4metres). The building is largely 12th-century in construction, with {{the walls and}} a narrow lancet window in the south wall dating from that time; another window at {{the east end of}} the south wall is rectangular and dates from the late 14th or early 15th centuries, with a more modern window in between. The east wall and window, with stone tracery and an ogee-topped light in a pointed arch, are from the 14th century. Some of the windows use atypical green glass, and some have frames made out of wood.|$|E
6000|$|Lying on it, {{as we go}} south-eastward, appear {{alternate}} beds {{of sandy}} limestone, with vast depths of clay between them. These [...] "oolites," [...] or <b>freestones,</b> furnish the famous Bath stone, the Oxford stone, and the Barnack stone of Northamptonshire, of which {{some of the finest}} cathedrals are built--a stone only surpassed, I believe, by the Caen stone, which comes from beds of the same age in Normandy. These <b>freestones</b> and clays abound in fossils, but of kinds, be it remembered, which differ more and more from those of the lias beneath, as the beds are higher in the series, and therefore nearer. [...] There, too, are found principally the bones of that extraordinary flying lizard, the Pterodactyle, which had wings formed out of its fore-legs, on somewhat the same plan as those of a bat, but with one exception. In the bat, as any one may see, four fingers of the hand are lengthened to carry the wing, while the first alone is left free, as a thumb: but in the Pterodactyle, the outer or [...] "little" [...] finger alone is lengthened, and the other four fingers left free--one of those strange instances in nature of the same effect being produced in widely different plants and animals, and yet by slightly different means, on which a whole chapter of natural philosophy--say, rather, natural theology--will have to be written some day.|$|R
50|$|The {{city centre}} is typified by {{the streets with}} intact {{architecture}} from the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the old town, around the Church of St. Michael, there are ensembles of buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries. Of particular note is the Hornschuch Promenade with Gründerzeit and Jugendstil apartment houses. The Südstadt, {{the southern part of}} the town, also has many historic buildings, but these tend to be former workers' tenements, so the house fronts are less grand.A lot of frame and <b>freestones</b> houses from 17.-19. century can be found in quarters and suburbs, f.e. Poppenreuth, Burgfarrnbach, Vach and Dambach.|$|R
60|$|As a set-off {{against such}} discussions as these there had come an {{improvement}} in their pecuniary position, which earlier in their experience would have made them cheerful. Jude had quite unexpectedly found good employment at his old trade almost directly he arrived, the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution; and outwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which is in itself so grateful after vicissitude. People seemed to have forgotten that he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies: and he daily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges he could never enter, and renewed the crumbling <b>freestones</b> of mullioned windows he would never look from, {{as if he had}} known no wish to do otherwise.|$|R
5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and <b>freestone</b> and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example of an attempt to introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A {{dividing}} ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large <b>freestone</b> stream. Roaring Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable coal is present in the watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the water line. To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown soil that is slightly poorly or moderately well drained and is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone.|$|E

6000|$|After we pass Oxford, or the Vale of Aylesbury, {{we enter}} yet another world. We {{come to a}} bed of sand, under which the <b>freestones</b> and their {{adjoining}} clays dip to the south-east. This is called commonly the lower Greensand, {{though it is not}} green, but rich iron-red. Then succeeds a band of stiff blue clay, called the Gault, and then another bed of sand, the upper Greensand, which is more worthy of the name, for it does carry, in most places, a band of green or [...] "glauconite" [...] sand. But it and the upper layers of the lower Greensand also, are worth our attention; for we are all probably eating them {{from time to time in}} the form of bran.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Placement of the Jurassi~Cretaceous {{boundary}} and its {{correlation between}} the Tethyan and Boreal realms are still contentious. The distribution of stratigraphically significant dinoflagellate cysts in the Portland Stone and Purbeck formations of the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, UK provides a basis for direct {{correlation between the}}se sections and the type Berriasian in southeast France. The base of the Berriasian- and thus of the currently accepted Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary- most probably lies {{at the base of}} the Cypris <b>Freestones</b> in the Purbeck Formation. Miospore correlation between the Dorset sections and ammonite-bearing rocks in the Spilsby Province suggests hat he base of the Cretaceous lies close t the base of the Subcraspidites preplicomphalus zone in the Boreal Realm. The latest Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous were marked globally by low sea-levels and conse-quent provincialism of marine biota. European biotas are divided biogeographically into the southern Tethyan province and the northern Boreal province (Fig. 1). The distinctive natur...|$|R

"Ages and AEons since, {{thousands}} {{on thousands}} of years {{before there was a}} man to till the ground, I the little pebble was a living sponge, in the milky depths of the great chalk ocean; and hundreds of living atomies, each more fantastic than a ghost-painter's dreams, swam round me, and grew on me, and multiplied, till I became a tiny hive of wonders, each one of which would take you a life to understand. And then, I cannot yet tell you how, and till I tell you you will never know, the delicate flint-needles in my skin gathered other particles of flint to them, and I and all my inhabitants became a stone; and the chalk-mud settled round us, I know not how, and covered us in; and for ages on ages I lay buried in the nether dark, and felt the glow of the nether fires, and was cracked and tossed by a hundred earthquakes. Again and again I have been part of an island, and then again sunk beneath the sea, to be upheaved again after long centuries, till I saw the light once more, and dropped from the face of some chalk cliff far away among high hills which have long since been swept {{off the face of the}} earth, and was tossed by currents till I became a pebble on the beach, while Reading was a sand-bank in a shallow sea.
