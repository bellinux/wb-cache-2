5|$|Immortalité almost reached safety. On {{the morning}} of 20 October, Captain Jean-François Legrand was {{approaching}} Brest when he was spotted by Captain Thomas Byam Martin of HMS Fisgard. Fisgard, part of the inshore squadron of the Brest blockade, immediately offered battle. Immortalité initially attempted to flee but was forced to engage the faster Fisgard at 11:00. During the bitter, close–range action, Fisgard took severe damage and almost lost her opponent. Immortalité, which <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> mast and was in a sinking condition, surrendered at 15:00. Among the 115 casualties aboard Immortalité were Captain Legrand, his first lieutenant and General Monge (commander of the 250 soldiers on board), all dead.

5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E

This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers won the 1963 World Series. This series {{represented}} {{the first time}} that the New York Yankees <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> World Series in four games. Alston's pitchers excelled, as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw a shutout in Game 3. Over the four games, Alston employed only three starting pitchers and one relief pitcher in the series. In 1964, the team finished 80-82 in its first losing season in several years. Alston used the team's 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. In spring training before the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of Mughal-e-Azam began in 1944, when Asif read a play {{set in the}} reign of Emperor Akbar (1556–1605). Production was plagued by delays and financial uncertainty.

Mughal-e-Azam cost more to produce than any previous Indian motion picture; the budget for a single song sequence exceeded that typical for an entire film of the period. The soundtrack, inspired by Indian classical and folk music, comprises 12 songs voiced by playback singers including Lata Mangeshkar and classical singer Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, and is often cited among the finest in Bollywood cinematic history.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans in East Africa {{were left}} with few options {{if they wanted to}} {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns.

Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British force at the Battle of Mahiwa he <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> large number of troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons and no way of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war.
