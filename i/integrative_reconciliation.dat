This analysis illustrates the use and the ranges of some assumptions, such as hierarchy, progressive differentiation and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation,</b> provided by the Theory of Meaningful Learning. The discussions about results of the analysis showed both a connection between the different meanings of combination analysis, as well as the need to enhance the process of learning about this topic in classroom. This learning can occur through activities that contribute the use of mathematical objects, their meanings denotative and appreciation idiosyncratic in the solution of mathematical exercises...|$|E

The research of the theme homeostasis involved a sample of these students and teaching actions about this subject with the use of teaching resources. The nature of the study is a qualitative one based on the Ausubelian theoretical matrix in which teaching actions involve progressive differentiation and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation,</b> articulation between concepts and ideas traditionally produced and taught in a fragmentary manner. The results obtained show that students develop more scientific ideas about biological phenomena, in particular homeostasis, that they start to take a more active part in the (re) construction of personal knowledge and {{in the development of a}} new school curriculum; that they overcome the knowledge fragmentation which makes understanding, representing and teaching knowledge itself harder nowadays...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we discuss}} some {{preliminary}} findings {{based on the}} implementation of a Potentially Meaningful Teaching Unit (PMTU) in four different classrooms of the third year high school, in a public school in a hinterland town of Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil. The proposed content for this implementation deals with concepts linked to quantum physics (quantization, uncertainty, state, and superposition of states), which we have organized according to the principles of the Meaningful Learning Theory (MLT), such as progressive differentiation and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation.</b> It analyzes mind maps and concept mapping, with a focus on their structure and on the changes that have occurred in the process of comparing these maps. It also includes students ’ comments on the development of their own understanding of the concepts this research proposal has approached. Notwithstanding the incompletion of its results, this study can provide some evidence of the occurrence of meaningful learning, which constitutes the main objective of {{the implementation of a}} PMTU. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for educational activities in which the Potentially Meaningful Teaching Unit (PMTU), proposed in Moreira (2011), are subsidized by mathematical modeling activities. We present results of a research that investigated the occurrence of meaningful learning of students involved in the modeling activities in a teaching unit associated with the study of difference equations. The activities were conducted within the discipline Mathematical Modeling Perspective on Mathematics Education in the fourth year of a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics. The analysis we did shows some evidence that modeling activities include conceptual and methodological principles that guide a PMTU. From the identification of these elements we analyzed 04 students during the development of PMTU mediated modeling activities and we may conjecture that the basic principles for the occurrence of meaningful learning and signaling <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation</b> and progressive differentiation can be demonstrated. In this regard, the inclusion of modeling activities in PMTU can strengthen it with respect to its ability to promote meaningful learning...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} world is undergoing by fast and deep transformations. One {{of the most}} interesting aspects in this new period it is the acceptance that theories, concepts, models and solutions previously considered enough in the resolution of scientific and social problems are under a critical exam. They become object of inquiries and bring us to think over what is really in crisis is the civilization model; in other words, the paradigm of the Modernity. The complexity principle establishes itself as challenge and motivation to think about it and the fragmentation principle becomes reduction mutilate of the thought. The acceptance of such arguments leads us to the interdisciplinarity in the teaching as a possible practice to be implemented and a methodological way which creates a dialogue among disciplinary knowledges, with an intrinsic integrate quality in this process. We propose that such conception provide an <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation</b> capable to prepare the students for interpretations and actions in the real world...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{motivated}} by the strong need of preparing instructional materials in electronic support (CD-Rom and others) or its diffusion through information nets (internet), as well by the scarcity of research studies, under a constructivist view, {{in the area of}} Earth sciences. We tried to investigate whether there is a relationship between the type of hypertextual organization of information and the resulting type of learning and/or reasoning, attempting to understand which are the best solutions in terms of hypermedia documents construction. In order to support theoretically our study we used the theories of meaningful learning and cognitive flexibility. Two hyperdocuments, constructed with similar contents but different organization (hierarchically and in network) were applied to a sample of 31 students (14 5 o 16 years). In the construction of the hyperdocuments studies by Chi et al. on conceptual change were also taken into account. Research findings suggest that hierarchical hypertextual structure seems to favor subordinate and superordinate meaningful learning associated to descriptive and classificative reasonings. However, the network hipertextual structure, while favoring cognitive flexibility, might stimulate progressive differentiation and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation</b> promoting combinatorial learning associated to interpretive and explicative reasonings...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contains}} reflections {{and results}} of a research that aimed to apply and analyze the use of concept maps in Higher Education {{as an indicator of}} significant learning concerning derivative as mathematical object with students that finished Differential and Integral Calculus. This is a qualitative approach, situated in the area of mathematics education, based on Ausubel's Theory of Meaningful Learning and on technique of Novak's Concept Mapping. As data acquisition instruments, use of classroom observations, questionnaire, brainstorming and digital conceptual mapping, made by an undergraduate physics course. To analyze we defined four aspects to be observed in the maps constructed by students: (i) validity of propositions formed with concepts, (ii) hierarchization, (iii) cross-links between the propositions, and (vi) the presence of applications. The identification of these elements, taken as reference to analyze the maps, allowed the collection of information about how each student has structured and correlated the set of concepts learned on the derivative of a function along their course. Based on the results, we have identified in the digital conceptual maps effective tools to evaluate the students in terms of meaningful learning about specific contents of Differential and Integral Calculus by the hierarchy of concepts, progressive differentiation and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation</b> as defined in the Theory of Meaningful Learning...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, implementation {{and evaluation of}} a teaching sequence that worked the fundamental concepts of electricity, as {{the intensity of the}} electric current, the electrical resistance and the combination of resistors in the Youth and Adult Education. The instructional material used as support of the teaching sequence was a Virtual Teaching Environment (VTE). The Virtual Teaching Environment includes issues related to simple electric circuits and its development is based on the principles of progressive differentiation and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation</b> as proposed by the Meaningful Verbal Learning Theory by David Ausubel. Another milestone of this work is the Conceptual Change Model by Posner and colleagues. In order to evaluate the impact of the proposed teaching sequence on the students’ learning of the subject we made use of qualitative and quantitative analysis. For this goal, two classrooms in the second phase of Education of Young and Adult level were divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group had access to the content through the VTE, while the control group accessed the content in the format of the traditional classroom. Data were collected in three moments: semi-structured clinical interview, test dissertation with real images of the components of simple electrical circuits and test dissertation with symbols usually used in physics to represent the electrical circuit components. All tests were applied before and after instruction. These tests were designed to search for evidence to the promotion of meaningful learning and conceptual change in students’ beliefs. The results, both quantitative and qualitative, indicate {{a significant difference in the}} post-tests of the experimental group as compared to the post-tests of the control group which points out to the positive effect of the proposed teaching sequence in to develop meaningful learning by the experimental group...|$|E
40|$|A finalidade desta pesquisa foi estudar os aspectos socioculturais de um ambiente penitenciário, que podem influenciar o ensino e a prática de atividades físicas coletivas (AFC) por mulheres presas identificadas como os outros, {{conforme}} interpretações de referências teóricas dos Estudos Culturais. Dentre os objetivos específicos pretendíamos identificar as motivações para a prática de AFC; avaliar e monitorar os possíveis efeitos da prática de AFC e investigar evidências sobre a ocorrência de aprendizagem significativa, por meio da análise de mapas conceituais e textos dissertativos criados pelas próprias mulheres presas. As análises dos resultados obtidos indicaram que o estudo das motivações para a prática de AFC foi importante para desenvolver atividades físicas que correspondessem às expectativas das mulheres presas, como os Jogos Cooperativos, que incentivaram a participação e evitaram desistências. O uso do questionário DALDA permitiu a identificação e monitoramento semanal de fontes e sintomas de estresse, além de motivar a reflexão crítica das mulheres presas sobre os seus hábitos cotidianos no ambiente cultural penitenciário. A avaliação da percepção subjetiva de esforço (PSE) possibilitou o monitoramento de intensidade das sessões de AFC. Assim, ambos os métodos contribuíram para a promoção de saúde e qualidade de vidas das mulheres presas. Todos esses procedimentos vivenciados ativamente pelas mulheres presas proporcionaram processos de diferenciação progressiva e reconciliação integradora, que foram evidenciados em mapas conceituais e textos dissertativos, indicando a ocorrência de aprendizagem significativa em alguns casos. Os métodos e procedimentos utilizados nesta pesquisa foram eficientes e pouco invasivos para à privacidade e integridade das mulheres presas. Portanto, podem ser recomendadas para a elaboração programas educacionais de intervenção em saúde pública, por profissionais da área da saúde e de atividades físicas. The goal of {{this research}} was to study the social and cultural aspects of a prison environment, which may influence the teaching and practice of collective physical activities (CPA) by women prisoners identified as öthersäs interpretations of theoretical references of Cultural Studies. Among the specific objectives intended to identify the motivations for the practice of CPA, evaluate and monitor the possible effects of the practice of CPA and investigate evidence for the occurrence of significant learning, through the analysis of concept maps and texts created by women prisoners themselves. The analysis of the results indicated that: a) the study of the motivations for the practice of CPA was important to develop physical activities that correspond to the expectations of women prisoners, as Cooperative Games that encouraged participation and avoided dropouts. The use of the DALDA questionnaire allowed identification and weekly monitoring of sources and symptoms of stress and motivate critical reflection of women prisoners about their daily habits the cultural prison. The evaluation of ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) allowed the monitoring intensity of sessions CPA. Thus, both methods have contributed to the promotion of health and quality of lives of women prisoners. All these procedures experienced by women prisoners actively provided progressive differentiation processes and <b>integrative</b> <b>reconciliation,</b> which were found in conceptual maps and texts, indicating the occurrence of significant learning in some cases. The methods and procedures used in this research were effective and less invasive to the privacy and integrity of women prisoners. Therefore, can be recommended for the development of educational programs in public health intervention, by professionals in the health and physical activity...|$|E
