5|$|No <b>Good</b> <b>Deed</b> was {{released}} in front of Logan on March 3, 2017. The next day, Reynolds released an alternate version of the short online. Responses to the short praised it as a tease for Deadpool 2 and for showing that Leitch understands the character ahead of directing that film. Its humor was also highlighted by many critics.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No <b>Good</b> <b>Deed</b> (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examines {{and compares}} the attitudes towards <b>good</b> <b>deeds</b> taken by two great thinkers of Latin Christianity and Sunni Islam, namely, Saint Augustine of Hippo (354 - 430 CE) and Imām Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī al-al-Ṭūsī (1058 - 1111 CE / 450 - 505 AH). Both thinkers {{address the issue}} in their own unique and profound ways, with a strong focus on the inner dimension of <b>good</b> <b>deeds.</b> However, their spiritual insights into the issue have not really been studied comparatively. This research focuses on their thoughts about the nature, significance, and inner dimension of <b>good</b> <b>deeds,</b> employing descriptive, analytic, and comparative methods. The scope {{of this research is}} divided into two main parts. The first part offers a general analysis of the concepts of <b>good</b> <b>deeds</b> in relation to religious faith as addressed and understood in both Christianity and Islam, and it attempts to establish their significance in both religions. The second part scrutinises some relevant issues in depth that are related to the attitudes of Augustine and al-Ghazālī towards <b>good</b> <b>deeds.</b> It covers their responses to particular interpretations and controversies, their understandings of the nature and significance of <b>good</b> <b>deeds,</b> and most importantly, their insights into the inner dimension of such actions. Augustine and al-Ghazali were each formulating their reflections on the subject within the framework of their religious traditions at a time of great controversy and debate on the subject within each of their traditions. While neither offers the last word on the subject within their religious traditions, they both focus on an inner dimension of <b>good</b> <b>deeds</b> in a way that deserves attention from Muslims and Christians alike. Indeed, both offer a sophisticated way of understanding and performing <b>good</b> <b>deeds.</b> They address their inner meaning and either directly or indirectly reveal some inner preconditions that need to be observed in performing <b>good</b> <b>deeds.</b> They believe that an appropriate balance between their outward and inward observance is an essential requirement in transforming <b>good</b> <b>deeds</b> from dry understanding and mere outward practices—as exhibited in pure ritualism and legalism—to spiritually fruitful ones. Thus, their insights are not only useful in improving the quality of <b>good</b> <b>deeds,</b> but they also pave a way for a personal spiritual transformation in returning to God, and establishing an intimate relationship with Him...|$|R
25|$|The <b>good</b> <b>deed</b> {{is a key}} {{component}} of the law and promise. Baden-Powell felt this is the main duty God asks for, and fulfilling our duty to others makes us happy, which fulfills the duty to ourselves. The point {{is not so much the}} deed itself, which could be minor, but to teach the Scout to always pay attention and recognise if he could help someone.|$|E

The Grand Prize is eight tickets to the final home game of the regular season, including the opportunity to throw the ceremonial last first pitch of season.|$|E
25|$|A Scout {{should be}} spiritual but Scouting {{is open to}} all {{religions}}. Scouting deals with religions in the practical way: by nature study (to see what God is) and helping others (which is what God asks for). According to Baden-Powell this is part of all religions. Scouting develops the spiritual side through teaching life-saving techniques and by promoting the daily <b>good</b> <b>deed.</b> Today religious practice is not a duty any more, as long as the Scout follows the Scout law and promise.|$|E

25|$|Volunteering has {{the ability}} {{to improve the quality of}} life and health of those who donate their time and {{research}} has found that older adults will benefit the most from volunteering. Physical and mental ailments plaguing older adults can be healed through the simple act of helping others; however, one must be performing the <b>good</b> <b>deed</b> from a selfless nature. There are barriers that can prevent older adults from participating in volunteer work, such as socio-economic status, opinions held by others, and even current health issues. However, these barriers can be overcome so that if one would like to be involved in volunteer work they can do so. Volunteering improves not only the communities in which one serves, but also the life of the individual who is providing help to the community.|$|E
25|$|The Crown Princess Victoria Fund’s means mainly {{derive from}} {{donations}} by the public, but large {{companies such as}} Arla Foods, Swedbank and AB Svenska Returpack are constant sponsor partners. Additional support comes from The Association of Swedish Bakers & Confectioners who every year arrange a national “princess cake week” during which the participating cafés and bakeries give 2,50 SEK per sold princess pastry and 10 SEK per sold princess cake to the fund. The result of this fund-raising drive is usually presented to Victoria herself on her name day on 12 March every year; in 2007, the total amount was 200,000 SEK. Congratulatory and memorial cards are also issued by Radiohjälpen benefitting the fund, {{a simple way to}} pay respects and do a <b>good</b> <b>deed</b> in one act.
