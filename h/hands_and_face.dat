Believing her friend dead, Pearl attacks the villain directly and suffers serious burns to her <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face.</b> She faints after she subdues him. She awakens in a hospital and finds herself healed except for her hair.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of August 1915, Sing was hospitalised for four days with influenza. That same month, an enemy sniper's bullet struck Sheehan's spotting telescope, injuring his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face,</b> and then hit Sing's shoulder, but the latter was back in action after a week's recuperation. Sheehan was more severely wounded, and was shipped back to Australia. This was reportedly {{the only time that}} Sing was injured at Gallipoli. He would not fare so well later on in the war.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

25|$|Detailed {{scholarly}} {{attention has}} focused on prescribing female dress in conformity with hijab. The four major Sunni schools of thought (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali) hold that the entire body of the woman, except her face and hands– though a few clerics say face, hands– must be covered during prayer and in public settings (see Awrah). There are those who allow the feet to be uncovered {{as well as the}} <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
25|$|That January RJ Lamont {{started the}} Omineca Express and {{delivered}} mail from Omineca to Quesnel using a dog team. His first round trip took him six weeks: he left Quesnel on January 31, arrived at Vital Creek {{and returned to}} Quesnel on March 16 with part of his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> frozen. Nevertheless, he continued this service throughout {{the spring and summer}} of 1870, handling the Omineca mail for Wells Fargo and Barnard's Express. Each letter sent to or from the goldfields cost the sender a whopping $2.50.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Vogt-Mugnier rediscovered the {{so-called}} ‘status marmoratus’ of the corpus striatum, characterized by slow, writhing, purposeless movements mainly affecting the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face.</b> This syndrome {{had already been}} described by Gabriel Anton in 1896, however his paper attracted little attention whereas Vogt-Mugnier's report {{brought it to the}} forefront of research in basal ganglia pathology. Vogt-Mugnier continued to lead the pioneering work on the neuroanatomy of the thalamus and together with Hermann Oppenheim published their findings on hereditary palsy and double athetosis, in which she noted the mottled appearance of the striatum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{probabilistic}} {{framework for}} vision based volumetric reconstruction and marker free tracking of <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> volumes is presented, which exclu-sively relies on off-the-shelf hardware components {{and can be}} applied in stan-dard office environments. Here a 3 D reconstruction of the interaction environ-ment (user-space) is derived from multiple camera viewpoints which serve as input sources for mixture particle filtering to infer position estimates of <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> volumes. The system implementation utilizes graphics hardware to comply with real-time constraints on a single desktop computer...|$|R

25|$|In 1906, Ramsay {{performed}} a successful resuscitation {{of the heart}} by massage, opening the thorax of a patient who had clinically died during operation; becoming the first surgeon in Australasia to perform a successful resuscitation. Designing and building St. Margaret's Hospital in Launceston, Ramsay entered private practice in 1912 upon the hospital's foundation. However, he retained his connection with the Launceston General Hospital, serving as an honorary consulting surgeon for the hospital. Interested {{in the works of}} Wilhelm Röntgen in regards to the potential of deep x-ray therapy, Ramsay had permanent scarring on his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> as a result of experiments with x-ray. In 1919, he visited Germany to purchase x-ray equipment from Siemens.|$|E
25|$|It once {{happened}} in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a living creature {{was caught in the}} forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human shape, however, in every detail, both as to <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> and feet; but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking.|$|E
25|$|Cortical {{stimulation}} mapping is {{used for}} somatotopy to determine {{the areas of the}} cerebral cortex that connect through nerve fibers with different body parts. Cortical stimulation identifies which regions of the brain are vital for certain functions, thereby allowing a 'map' to be made which can be used to decide if brain areas are safe to remove. Cortical stimulation mapping {{led to the development of}} a homunculus for the motor and sensory cortices, which is a diagram showing the brain's connections to different areas of the body. An example is the cortical homunculus of the primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex, which are separated by the central sulcus. The diagram starts in the longitudinal fissure and continues out laterally from the center of the brain, representing the general pattern from lower extremities and genitals in the fissure up to the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> on outer edges of the brain.|$|E

6000|$|I {{returned}} to the ship, disconcerted and perplexed. That day it was the men came aft, with blistered <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>faces,</b> <b>and</b> sullen eyes. When they proclaimed, through Edwards, their spokesman, [...] "We've had enough of this, and we mean it," [...] I answered very readily, [...] "So have I. Let's go." ...|$|R
30|$|Force field {{also has}} a direction, i.e., when a hand enters in the face region, there {{is a change in}} {{regional}} structure {{in the direction of the}} force because both <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> have different force vector fields, and these force fields look like edges in the image. Hence, force field measures regional edge like structure of <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> when merging together in a particular image frame and when edges having gaps in between due to noise or due to lighting effects at that point net force become zero, and those points are known as well positions.|$|R
25|$|Later in the year, Guns N' Roses {{went on the}} Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour, with American {{heavy metal}} band Metallica, being {{supported}} by Faith No More, Motörhead, and Body Count. During a show in August 1992 at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, Metallica's lead singer James Hetfield suffered second degree burns to his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> after malfunctions with a pyrotechnics blast. Metallica was forced to cancel the second hour of the show, but promised {{to return to the}} city for another performance. After a long delay, during which the audience became increasingly restless, Guns N' Roses took the stage. However, the shortened time between sets did not allow for adequate tuning of stage monitors, resulting in members of GN'R not being able to hear themselves. In addition, Rose claimed that his throat hurt, causing the band to leave the stage early. The cancellation led to another audience riot, with three police officers and 10 rioters injured. Police made at least a dozen arrests related to the incident.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face.</b> When {{he approached the}} station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only reason people entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E

500|$|In an {{investigation}} by Human Rights Watch, Dr. Rula al-Saffar stated {{that she had been}} given electric shocks in the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face,</b> and threatened with rape. Al-Ekri described being [...] "constantly beaten by cables, hoses, and fists", as well as being forced to stand for a full day. Dr. Ghassan Dhaif stated that he remained handcuffed and blindfolded for 21 days, and [...] "was beaten every hour". Dr. Basim Dhaif alleged that he was beaten in front of his children at his home {{at the time of his}} arrest, and eventually signed a false confession while in custody after authorities threatened to harm his family. Dr. Nader Dawani, a pediatrician, stated that he was forced to stand for seven days while being beaten by a female officer, and that other officers had tried to force a bottle into his anus.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin {{believed}} his first influence {{to be his}} mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting {{at the window and}} mimicking passers-by: [...] "it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face,</b> but also how to observe and study people." [...] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. [...] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his [...] "training ground", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.|$|E
500|$|The {{dining room}} is devoted to Geoffrey Chaucer's The House of Fame {{and the art of}} story-telling, Crook {{explaining}} that [...] "tall stories are part of the dining room rite". The hooded chimneypiece, of Devonshire marble, contained a bronze figure above the fireplace representing the Goddess of Fame; its <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>face</b> were made of ivory, with sapphires for eyes. [...] It was later stolen. The tiles on the walls depict fairy stories, including Reynard the Fox, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood. The room also shows Burges's innovative use of materials: Handley-Read observed that the Victorians had [...] "a horror of food smells" [...] and therefore the room was constructed using materials that did not absorb odours and could be washed. The walls are covered with Devonshire marble, surmounted by glazed picture tiles, while the ceiling is of sheet metal. The ceiling is divided into coffered compartments by square beams, and features symbols of the Sun, the planets and the signs of the Zodiac. Burges designed most of the cutlery and plate used in this room, which display his skills as a designer of metalwork, including the claret jug and Cat Cup chosen by Lord and Lady Bute as mementos from Burges's collection after his death. The panels of the wine cupboard were decorated by Dante Gabriel Rossetti.|$|E
