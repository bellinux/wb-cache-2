This method measures {{the change in the}} rotational speed of a <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> ligand once it is bound to the receptor. [...] Polarized light is used in order to excite the ligand, and the amount of light emitted is measured. [...] Depolarization of the emitted light depends on ligand being bound (e.g., to receptor). If ligand is unbound, it will have a large depolarization (ligand is free to spin rapidly, rotating the light). If the ligand is bound, the combined larger size results in slower rotation and therefore, reduced depolarization. [...] An advantage of this method is that it requires only one labeling step.

50|$|Today, the {{fluorescence}} method is preferred to radioactive materials {{due to a}} much lower cost, lower hazard, {{and the possibility of}} multiplexing the reactions in a high-throughput manner. One problem is that <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> ligands have to bear a bulky fluorophore that may cause it to hinder the ligand binding.

Cells able to associate with <b>fluorescent-labelled</b> bacteria (by attachment to the cell membrane or by internalization within the cell) acquired increased fluorescence and were readily differentiated from cells unable to interact with bacteria.

40|$|The use of <b>fluorescent-labelled</b> simple {{sequence}} repeat (SSR) markers {{allows the}} simultaneous analysis of diverse loci in multiplex series, providing an enhanced precision of {{the determination of the}} allele size when a large number of genotypes is used. Twenty-five <b>fluorescent-labelled</b> SSR markers were used to genotype 242 accessions of the Brazilian Rice Core Collection. Based on the Polymorphism Information Content (PIC) values of each marker, groups with 5, 10, 15 and 20 markers were formed. The average PIC values varied from 0. 67 to 0. 89 and the number of alleles sampled per group, from 70 to 377. In the case of rice, which has a narrow genetic base, the conclusion was drawn that it is of fundamental importance that the genotypes must be evaluated by the highest possible number of regularly spaced SSR markers in the genome, and that these, preferentially, should offer a high information content. 200...|$|R

50|$|Two primary {{antibodies}} {{raised in}} different species recognize the target antigen on the proteins of interest. Secondary antibodies (2o Ab) {{directed against the}} constant regions of the different primary antibodies, called PLA probes, bind to the primary antibodies. Each of the PLA probes has a unique short DNA strand attached to it, If the PLA probes are in close proximity (that is, if the two original proteins of interest are in close proximity, or part of a protein complex, {{as shown in the}} figures), the DNA strands can participate in rolling circle DNA synthesis when appropriate substrates and enzymes are added.The DNA synthesis reaction results in several-hundredfold amplification of the DNA circle. Next, <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> complementary oligonucleotide probes are added, and they bind to the amplified DNA. The resulting high concentration of fluorescence is easily visible as a distinct bright spot when viewed with a fluorescence microscope. In the specific case shown, the nucleus is enlarged because this is a B-cell lymphoma cell. The 2 proteins of interest are a B cell receptor and MYD88. The finding of interaction in the cytoplasm was interesting because B cell receptors are thought of as being located in the cell membrane.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the binding}} affinities of the <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> benzodiazepines {{described}} in Part 1 are compared {{to assess the}} influence of the labeling position and the choice of fluorophore on the binding affinity. This comparison was extended by taking into account the data of other <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> benzodiazepines in the literature. The differences in the binding affinities observed could partly be explained by structure -activity relationships (SAR). On the basis of this comparison, <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> desethylflumazenil (Rol 5 - 3890, 19) derivatives were selected as the most suitable labeled ligands, in fluorescent receptor assays. A methyl-methoxycoumarin derivative (Mmc-O-CO-(CH 2) (3) -Ro 15 - 3890) (20 b) had a K-i-value of 6. 5 nM, and a 7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 diazole derivative (NBD-NH-(CH 2) (3) -Ro 15 - 3890, 21) had a K-i-value of 5. 7 nM. In order to yield sufficient sensitivity in the final receptor assay, a suitable fluoresent labeled ligand should have a K-i < 10 nM. A further advantage of the above two ligands is that the benzodiazepine moiety has no receptor affinity of its own. Thus, if some hydrolysis of the labeled ligand were to occur, the resulting Rol 5 - 3890 (18) would hardly affect the outcome of the assay. In the second part of this paper the prerequisites of the fluorophore are being examined. In this regard, 20 b is preferred, because the coumarin derivative has higher fluorescence intensities in aqueous media than the NBD-derivative. Therefore, 20 b was selected as a <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> ligand {{in the development of a}} non-radioactive receptor assay for benzodiazepines...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{calculate}} the time {{dependence of the}} polarized fluorescence signal from <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> elements of a biological assembly that are rotationally diffusing in an arbitrary three-dimensional angular potential.

After incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and <b>fluorescent-labelled</b> anti-human antibodies, the kinetoplast will fluoresce.

50|$|Typically, {{the rate}} at which a {{molecule}} rotates is indicative of its size. When a <b>fluorescent-labelled</b> molecule (tracer) binds to another molecule the rotational motion will change, resulting in an altered intensity of plane-polarized light, which results in altered fluorescence polarization. Fluorescence polarization immunoassays employ a fluorophore bound antigen that when bound to the antibody of interest, will increase fluorescence polarization. The change in polarization is proportional to the amount of antigen in sample, and is measured by a fluorescence polarization analyzer.|$|R

40|$|Background: Radioimmunotherapy utilize a {{targeting}} antibody {{coupled to}} a therapeutic isotope to target and treat a tumor or disease. In {{this study we}} examine the synthesis and cell binding of a polymer scaffold containing a radiotherapeutic isotope and a targeting antibody. Methods: The multistep synthesis of a fluorescent or 149 Promethium-labeled Trastuzumab-polyethyleneimine (PEI), Trastuzumab, or PEI is described. In vitro uptake, internalization and/or the binding affinity to the Her 2 /neu expressing human breast adenocarcinoma SKBr 3 cells was investigated with the labeled compounds. Results: <b>Fluorescent-labeled</b> Trastuzumab-PEI was internalized more into cells at 2 and 18 h than <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> Trastuzumab or PEI. The <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> Trastuzumab was concentrated on the cell surface at 2 and 18 h and the labeled PEI had minimal uptake. DOTA-PEI was prepared and contained an average of 16 chelates per PEI; the compound was radio-labeled with 149 Promethium and conjugated to Trastuzumab. The purified 149 Pm-DOTA-PEI-Trastuzumab had a radiochemical purity of 96. 7 % and a specific activity of 0. 118 TBq/g. The compound demonstrated a dissociation constant for the Her 2 /neu receptor of 20. 30 ± 6. 91 nM.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} the potential use of <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> annexin V, anti-human fibrinogen antibody, and anti-human thrombospondin antibody for detection of the activation of equine platelets {{by use of}} flow cytometry. Sample Population-Platelets obtained from 6 Thoroughbreds. Procedure-Flow cytometry {{was used to assess}} platelet activation as indicated by detection of binding of <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> annexin V, anti-human fibrinogen antibody, and anti-thrombospondin antibody to unactivated and ADP-, collagen-, platelet activating factor (PAF) -, and A 23187 -activated equine platelets. Human platelets were used as control samples. Determination of C- 14 -serotonin uptake and release was used to assess the extent of platelet secretion. Results-Anti-human thrombospondin antibody failed to bind to equine platelets. Annexin V bound to platelets activated with PAF or A 23187 when platelets had undergone secretion, Anti-human fibrinogen antibody bound to ADP-, PAF-, and A 23817 -activated platelets, but binding was not dependent on platelet secretion. The extent of binding of anti-fibrinogen antibody was less in equine platelets, compared with that for human platelets, despite maximal stimulation. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Activation of equine platelets can be detected by use of <b>fluorescent-labeled</b> annexin V and anti-human fibrinogen antibody but not by use of anti-human thrombospondin antibody. These flow cytometric techniques have the potential for detection of in vivo platelet activation in horses at risk of developing thrombotic disorders...|$|E
