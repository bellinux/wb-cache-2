5|$|After {{the death}} of bin Laden, some {{officials}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration, such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey, wrote op-eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized (since legally clarified as torture) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden's hideout. Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden's courier.|$|E
5|$|Local labour was {{supplied}} by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A {{week after the}} landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment {{found it difficult to}} lure the frightened local people in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush,</b> but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began to walk in. ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed camps for the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains and brought back the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Army quickly {{deemed the}} French {{experiment}} a failure. It reassigned 7 Independent Company in late November to Marymount Mission, a small settlement {{to the east}} of Rusambo where there was a minor police station. The number of patrols they would embark on was reduced. Two of the company's vehicles were ambushed by cadres between Marymount and Rusambo on 6 January 1978, resulting in two men being injured, one fatally so. A week later another truck was surprised on the same bush road, resulting in one death and three serious casualties. The company was brought back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> four days later for rest and recuperation (R) in Salisbury.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} English players and {{commentators}} noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation {{came too late}} for this particular match, but was to have immense significance in the next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero. The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records {{for the day and}} some have stood the test of time. In all, Bradman scored 974runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2012, no-one has matched or exceeded 974runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, work on the Great Hall ceased. Some of the students enlisted {{in the armed forces}} while others assisted on the home front. Montsalvat was turned into a farm and market garden. Jörgensen and his now smaller 'team' turned their creative abilities to these new projects, building the barns and sheds. Materials were scarce, but they managed to scrounge odd bits and pieces – from discarded broken bricks and rusty galvanized iron to timber poles cut <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush.</b> Additional to the market garden was the dairy and poultry farm with the produce being sold through the local markets.|$|E

He also ordered the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, in Cuba, though it remains open, as well as lifted some travel and money restrictions to the island.|$|E
500|$|Hornung had {{his first}} work {{published}} in 1887—the short story [...] "Stroke of Five" [...] in Belgravia magazine. His first novel, A Bride <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush,</b> was published in 1890, and Hornung used his Australian experiences as a backdrop to the story. He went on to use Australia as a setting or plot element in a further seven novels and two collections of short stories.|$|E
500|$|Although Hornung's Australian {{experience}} was brief, it influenced {{most of his}} literary work from A Bride <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> published in 1899, to Old Offenders and a Few Old Scores, which was published after his death. According to Chandler, [...] "nearly two-thirds of [...] books refer in varying degrees to Australian incidents and experiences", with [...] "even Raffles" [...] starting his criminal career in Australia. Some of Horning's works—such as A Bride from the Bush—were praised for their accuracy of detail in depicting the Australian environment, although the detail could overwhelm the storyline, as in The Rogue's March.|$|E

500|$|In 1898 {{he wrote}} [...] "In the Chains of Crime", which {{introduced}} Raffles and his sidekick, Bunny Manders; the characters were based partly on his friends Oscar Wilde and his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, {{and also on}} the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, created by his brother-in-law, Arthur Conan Doyle. The series of Raffles short stories were collected for sale in book form in 1899, and two further books of Raffles short stories followed, {{as well as a}} poorly received novel. Aside from his Raffles stories, Hornung was a prodigious writer of fiction, publishing numerous books from 1890, with A Bride <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> to his 1914 novel The Crime Doctor.|$|E
500|$|After Bush won {{a second}} term in the 2004 general election, Kennedy {{continued}} to oppose him on Iraq and many other issues. However, Kennedy sought to partner with Republicans again {{on the matter of}} immigration reform {{in the context of the}} ongoing United States immigration debate. Kennedy was chair of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Refugees, and in 2005, Kennedy teamed with Republican Senator John McCain on the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act. [...] The [...] "McCain-Kennedy bill" [...] did not reach a Senate vote, but provided a template for further attempts at dealing comprehensively with legalization, guest worker programs, and border enforcement components. [...] Kennedy returned again with the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was sponsored by an ideologically diverse, bipartisan group of senators and had strong support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration. The bill aroused furious grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others as an [...] "amnesty" [...] program, and despite Kennedy's last-minute attempts to salvage it, failed a cloture vote in the Senate. Kennedy was philosophical about the defeat, saying that it often took several attempts across multiple Congresses for this type of legislation to build enough momentum for passage.|$|E
500|$|During {{and after}} the war, the AIF was often portrayed in glowing terms. As part of the [...] "Anzac legend", the {{soldiers}} were depicted as good humoured and egalitarian men who had little time for the formalities of military life or strict discipline, yet fought fiercely and skilfully in battle. Australian soldiers was also seen as resourceful and self-reliant. The wartime official correspondent and post-war official historian C.E.W. Bean was central {{to the development of}} this stereotype. Bean believed that the character and achievements of the AIF reflected the unique nature of rural Australians, and frequently exaggerated the democratic nature of the force and the proportion of soldiers from rural areas in his journalism and the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918. The perceived qualities of the AIF were seen as being unique, as the product of the harsh Australian environment, the ethos of the bush and egalitarianism. Such notions built on the concept of men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> being excellent natural soldiers which was prevalent in Australian culture before the war. The achievements of the AIF, especially during the Gallipoli campaign, were also frequently portrayed by Bean and others as having marked the birth of Australia as a nation. Moreover, the AIF's performance was often seen as proof that the character of Australians had passed the test of war.|$|E
