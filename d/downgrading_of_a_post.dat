40|$|We {{study the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{sovereign}} credit rating change of one country on the sovereign credit spreads of other countries for 155 ratings change events from 1991 to 2000. We find evidence of spillover effects, that is, a ratings change in one country has {{a significant effect on}} sovereign credit spreads of other countries. This effect is asymmetric: positive ratings events abroad have no discernable impact on sovereign spreads, whereas negative ratings events are associated with an increase in spreads. On average, <b>a</b> one-notch <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sovereign bond is associated with a 12 basis point increase in spreads of sovereign bonds of other countries. Interestingly, the magnitude of the spillover effect following a negative ratings change is amplified by recent ratings changes in other countries. Conceptually, we distinguish between common information and competitive components of spillovers. While common information spillovers imply that sovereign spreads move in tandem, competitive spillovers are expected to result in <b>a</b> differential effect <b>of</b> ratings events across countries. Despite the predominance of common information spillovers, we also find evidence of competitive spillovers among countries with highly negatively correlated capital flows or trade flows vis-ˆj-vis the United States. That is, spreads in these countries generally fall relative to other countries in response to <b>a</b> <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country with highly negatively correlated capital or trade flows. Variables proxying for cultural or institutional linkages (e. g., common language, formal trade blocs, common-law legal systems), physical proximity, or rule of law traditions across countries do not seem to affect estimated spillover effects. ...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{credit rating}} {{agencies}} such as Moody’s, S&P and Fitch either upgraded or downgraded countries when their economies were either blossoming or in a chaotic state. There is general consensus that credit rating agencies’ actions have triggered substantial financial unrestrained behaviour that resulted to the recent financial meltdown in 2008. To what extent does a sovereign ratings upgrade or <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> the major trade partners <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emerging market economy impact trade both domestically and internationally? This research is done using data from 10 emerging countries between 2000 - 2011 to investigate the cross-country impact <b>of</b> either <b>an</b> upgrade or <b>downgrade</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emerging economy’s principal trade partners on its financial market. In addition we analyse the impact prior and after the 2008 financial crisis. The ramifying impact on emerging economies due to sovereign grade change given a 10 days event window prior and after the event is investigated. We use both a pooled panel framework and event study methodology to assess {{the significance of the}} effect of rating change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{investigation}} {{offers a}} synthesizing thermodynamic approach to modeling, simulation and power maximization in various energy converters, such as thermal, solar and chemical engines and fuel cells. Thermodynamic analyses lead to efficiencies {{in terms of}} propelling fluxes. Efficiency equations are applied to determine maxima of power integrals (work) in dynamical systems, which work with upgrading and <b>downgrading</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resource medium. While optimization of static systems requires using of differential calculus and Lagrange multipliers, dynamic optimization involves variational calculus and dynamic programming. In reacting mixtures balances of mass and energy are applied to derive power yield in terms <b>of</b> <b>an</b> active part <b>of</b> chemical affinity. Power maximization approach is also applied for fuel cells. Maximum power data provide power limits for SOFC energy generators. Index Terms — engines, power bounds, thermodynamics...|$|R
