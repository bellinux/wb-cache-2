40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of CFRP needs <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> {{in order to}} remove burrs as well as undefined orientated fibres and to shape the final part contour. <b>Edge</b> <b>trimming</b> is usually done by contour milling. The quality of machined edges may be affected by fibre protrusions and delaminated fibres which cause manual repair or may even lead to scrap. Delamination of fibres is often initiated by stresses applied during engagement of the cutting edge. Based on measured cutting forces, the stress distribution and the inter fibre fracture modes in the boundary zone of the machined surface are calculated using Lekhnitskii's theory of elasticity for anisotropic elastic bodies and the fracture criteria of Puck. In course of the continuing <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> process, fibre ends in the damaged boundary zone might not be cut off but deflected by subsequent tool engagements, as {{can be observed in}} high speed videos. In the case of existing fibre protrusions, a relation between the minimum depth of the damaged zone, the fibre orientation at the machined edge and the fibre properties was derived using elementary bending models. The analysis underlines the existence of only one type of surface ply delamination i. e. fibre protrusions and fibre delamination always occur together...|$|E

The most advanced development and implementation took place in laser welding and cutting of metals in automotive and ship building industries. However, there is high potential to apply laser processing to other materials in various industrial fields. One of these potential fields could be paper industry to fulfill the demand for high quality, fast and reliable cutting technology. Difficulties in industrial application of laser cutting for paper industry are associated to lack of basic information, awareness of technology and its application possibilities. Nowadays possibilities of using laser cutting for paper materials are widened and high automation level of equipment has made this technology more interesting for manufacturing processes. Promising area of laser cutting application at paper making machines is longitudinal cutting of paper web (<b>edge</b> <b>trimming).</b> There are few locations at a paper making machine where <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> is usually done: wet press section, calender or rewinder.

40|$|Basic quality {{requirements}} in machining of CFRP components, besides the geometric precision, are thermally undamaged and delamination-free cutting surfaces and edges. Machining of large CFRP structures implies {{a high risk}} of component recovery cost and time, since machining operations are late within the production process chain of those components. Moreover, machinery for processing large CFRP structures is very expensive. These reasons substantiate the need for online-monitored reliable high-productivity CFRP machining capable of preventing rework and waste. Existing process monitoring and control systems developed for metal machining are not suitable for CFRP because the material-specific machinability in terms of tool wear, forces and surface quality call for different detection mechanisms. Accordingly, this study is dedicated to experimental investigations of CFRP machining in order to determine suitable signals and sensors for online monitoring of the relevant tool wear and quality parameters. As the <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of large CFRP components is most difficult to control up to now, the study focuses on this operation. Promising first results with regard to preventive monitoring of tool wear and surface temperature were obtained by force and acceleration evaluation. Experimental studies have been performed in CFRP machining in order to establish a basis for online monitoring with focus on <b>edge</b> <b>trimming.</b> The findings can be summarized as follows: - According to the anisotropy of CFRP the cutting force, the surface temperature and the main spindle power as well as the feed drive torque exhibit a periodic variation - Continuously progressing tool wear with feed travel and local cutting edge chipping are related to an increase of the feed or active force in milling - The amplitudes of the feed force and of the acceleration at the spindle head, which correspond to the spindle speed and its first two harmonic multiples, indicate a clear difference between new and worn cutters - The maximum surface temperature easily exceeds the temperature limit of epoxy resins and is related to the active force - Automated online detection of delamination remains a challenge...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} thermal effects generated during conventional CNC machining of polymer-based composites. A sensorised cutting tool incorporating a wireless embedded thermocouple {{is used to}} extract tool-side temperature information during <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates whilst an infrared thermal imaging camera extracted workpiece temperature. Force data was collected to measure the specific cutting energy for each set of parameters tested. Parameters varied included feed rate, workpiece thickness and vertical cutting strategy in conjunction with design of experiment (DOE) methods. The temperature results of this investigation indicate that both vertical cutting strategy and depth of cut produce strongly significant effects on the steady-state temperature reached during machining. Force results demonstrate that while feed rate and axial depth of cut variations cause significant changes to the process forces, cutting strategy does not. The extremely sensitive nature {{of this process is}} demonstrated through detrimental surface quality, particularly at low chip loads, due to thermal constriction occurring when trimming takes place at the tool tip...|$|E

Machining characteristics of the Preform and SMC processed random direction short GFRPs are evaluated in terms of cutting forces, surface quality, and tool wear. It is found that composite primary processing and fiber contents are major contributing factors influencing the cutting force magnitudes and surface textures. The SMC composites show better surface finish over the Preform composites due to less delamination and fiber pullouts. Moreover, matrix damage and fiber protrusions at the machined edge are reduced by increasing fiber content in the random direction short GFRP composites...|$|E

40|$|Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} polymers (CFRPs) {{have found}} wide-ranging applications in numerous industrial {{fields such as}} aerospace, automotive, and shipping industries due to their excellent mechanical properties that lead to enhanced functional performance. In this paper, an experimental study on <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> of CFRP was done with various cutting conditions and different geometry of tools such as helical-, fluted-, and burr-type tools. The investigation involves the measurement of cutting forces for the different machining conditions {{and its effect on}} the surface quality of the trimmed edges. The modern cutting tools (router tools or burr tools) selected for machining CFRPs, have complex geometries in cutting edges and surfaces, and therefore a traditional method of direct tool wear evaluation is not applicable. An acoustic emission (AE) sensing was employed for on-line monitoring of the performance of router tools to determine the relationship between AE signal and length of machining for different kinds of geometry of tools. The investigation showed that the router tool with a flat cutting edge has better performance by generating lower cutting force and better surface finish with no delamination on trimmed edges.

"Carbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites (CFRP) {{have found}} extensive application in today’s {{industries such as}} aerospace, automotive and shipping industries for their high strength and light weight. But due to its inhomogeneous nature they encounter numerous machining problems. Service life of a component is highly dependent {{on the quality of}} machining. An experimental investigation is conducted to determine the effect of process parameters spindle speed and feed rate and tool condition on the surface quality of a machined CFRP composite material. Machining operation used is <b>edge</b> <b>trimming.</b> The aim of the experiment is to set optimum parameters for obtaining quality machined surfaces. Surface Quality was quantified based on delamination depth and surface roughness. It was found that delamination depth and surface roughness increase with an increase in feed rate and an increase in cutting distance and decrease with an increase in spindle speed. So the cutting conditions for best surface quality are high spindle speed and low feed rate and the cutting conditions for worst surface quality is low spindle speed and high feed rate. Results from this work were interpreted in the form of line graphs, 3 D graphs and microscopic pictures for process optimization. Statistical analysis was done to validate the experimental results...|$|E

With {{an increase in the}} use of composite FRP materials in industries, secondary machining operations of these materials {{play an important role in}} final assemblage. This requires adherence of the machined components to the established geometric tolerance, dimensional accuracy, and surface quality. In a previous study, a tool life prediction equation was established based on the process parameters (speed and feed). Since this equation is not satisfactory, this study focuses on economic machining conditions and improved surface quality of the finished component by establishing an equation to predict tool life based on cutting forces and surface temperature in multi directional CFRP machining. The results of experiments show that normal force increases with an increase in feed rate and decreases with an increase in spindle speed and cutting distance. Feed force, axial force and surface temperature increase with an increase in feed rate and cutting distance and decrease with an increase in spindle speed.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThough {{composites}} {{are commonly}} molded for achieving near net-shape, {{they have to}} undergo precise machining {{in order to achieve}} the dimensional stability and an interface quality. A complicated interaction between polymer matrix and carbon fiber reinforcement makes the machining of the CFRP material a major concern. Due to this heterogeneous nature of the CFRP, the machined surfaces result in damages like delamination, spalling, and splintering. In order to minimize these damages, knowledge about tool replacement time or tool life is necessary. In this study an effort is made to determine the tool life for diamond interlocked knurled tool commonly used for machining CFRP material. Direct tool wear measurement techniques were inadequate to determine the tool life because of the complex geometry of this tool. Therefore, in this study indirect tool wear measurement technique is used to quantify the tool wear based on delamination. The damage caused by delamination on the CFRP material undergoing <b>edge</b> <b>trimming</b> operation is measured in the form of delamination depth as well as number of delamination occurrences per inch. The effects of experimental parameters on delamination depth as well as number of delamination occurrences per inch are observed to find optimized process parameters.
