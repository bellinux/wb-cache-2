The modulator converts an analog input into a high-speed binary sequence, which can he delayed and shifted with a binary shift register.

In this paper we investigate the different sources of {{power dissipation}} of a dynamic resonant tunneling device logic family. Due to the self-latching behavior of the gates and the bitlevel pipelined circuit style an adiabatic clocking scheme is ideally suited to reduce the dynamic switching energy. Extrapolations for laterally scaled resonant tunneling devices predict a total power dissipation below 20 W per gate at 5 GHz for a minimum feature size of 200 nm and a peak current density of j P = 10 kA=cm 2. Compared to a non-adiabatic operation this is a reduction of the switching energy by about one order of magnitude. 1.

40|$|Optical beam {{steering}} devices, which control the propagation direction of light, have diverse applications, including LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), optical wireless communication, optical imaging, and sensing. In all applications, {{there have been}} growing demands for smaller device size, faster scanning speed, and lower power consumption. Among various types of optical {{beam steering}} devices, phased-array InP optical beam steering devices have several advantages, such as compact size, fast steering speed above few hundred MHz, and integratability with laser diodes. On the other hand, InP/InGaAsP waveguide device in general suffers from a difficulty in extracting the light {{out of the plane}} efficiently, due to the relatively small refractive index difference between InP and InGaAsP. In this research, we aim to realize efficient and compact phased-array optical beam steering devices on InP. This work consists of two parts. We first design, fabricate, and demonstrate one-dimensional (1 D) optical beam steering <b>device</b> <b>circuits</b> on InP. Then, we develop a novel type of vertical optical coupler having a slanted mirror, which could be used to realize truly two-dimensional beam-steering. The 1 D optical beam steering devices are designed based on the concept of phased array, and its characteristics are calculated by using the beam-propagation method. The designed devices are fabricated by the standard III-V semiconductor optical device process. A far-field optical measurement setup is newly built to characterize the beam-steering function of the fabricated devices. We experimentally demonstrate large steering angle of ± 28 degree as well as low wavelength dependency over wide wavelength range from 1530 nm to 1570 nm. The vertical optical coupler, having a slanted mirror, is designed by using the eigenmode expansion method. The designed optical coupler is then fabricated by C 12 /Ar reactive-ion-etching process with the use of two newly developed Al stages. Using the fabricated structure, we demonstrate efficient vertical coupling with the fiber-to-fiber loss as low as 13. 3 dB. We expect that by integrating the demonstrated coupler structure with the above-mentioned optical beam steering device chip, we could realize wide ranges of vertically emitting beam-steering devices, including the two-dimensional (2 D) beam scanners. 報告番号:; 学位授与日: 2013 - 03 - 25; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科・電気系工学専...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} of {{optoelectronics}} a common barrier has been integrating logic and <b>device</b> <b>circuits</b> on a single substrate, as it was generally only possible to optimize the device for the logic, or the optoelectronic device at hand. However, a new approach that uses metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) enables the growth of Ill-V semiconductors on silicon substrates. The fact that 111 -V semiconductors can now be integrated within the current silicon CMOS processes may allow new possibilities. An approach to investigate the feasibility of this process has been investigated. The enabler to integrate HI-V is an innovative approach called aspect ratio trapping (ART) developed by Amberwave. This method {{involves the use of}} oxide trenches to trap defects in a buffer region during crystal growth (Figure 1). The growth process is a selective growth that only occurs on silicon and this process. ART on Ill-V’s only works well with a ratio greater than 2 : 1 for oxide thickness to patterned oxide opening. The objective of this project is to develop a process to build these structures at HIT, perform a growth in Amberwave’s reactor, and then characterize the film. In the future, HIT may also become involved in the Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process for these structures. A mask was designed with four different pitches to characterize different density of features (fig. 5). Text labels were also added on the mask so that one could optically determine the pitch and in addition the reticle had labels that describe the relative field position to be used for CMP characterization. In {{order to be able to}} pattern the submicron features with a positive tone resist, a bottom antireflective coating (BARC) donated by Brewer Science was used to increase the process window in which a useable image was present. The thickness of this layer was tuned specifically to minimize the substrate reflection. By optimizing film thickness parameters and setting the focus near the bottom of the resist, this yielded much greater process latitude. After this the patterns were etched using the P 5000 ’s magnetically enhanced etch chamber, the etched features were imaged a new Zeiss SEM at University of Rochester and the 3 : 1 etched features yielded acceptable profiles (fig. 10). In order to prepare patterned wafers here at HIT, the level of contamination in the process and toolset at HIT must to be characterized. The main concern is to not contaminate the growth chamber that Amberwave will be using to perform the growth of the semiconductor materials. A method of metals analysis called vapor phase decomposition-inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (VPD ICP MS) was utilized as a surface contamination metric. After sending the samples to ChemTrace, it was determined that an RCA would dramatically reduce the surface contaminates present on the wafer to acceptable levels for the MOCVD reactor (fig. 6). Interesting future projects include building and characterizing a GaAs laser. Another appealing project involves building silicon drive transistors connecting them to GaAs tunneling or memory devices. It was shown that the pattern transfer portion is indeed possible at HIT and this project has set the stage for future projects regarding aspect ratio trapping...|$|E

40|$|In this review, we {{will discuss}} a {{possible}} roadmap in scaling a nanoelectronic device from today's CMOS technology to the ultimate limit when the device fails. In other words, at the limit, CMOS will have a severe short channel effect, significant power dissipation in its quiescent (standby) state, and problems related to other essential characteristics. Efforts to use structures such as the double gate, vertical surround gate, and SOI to improve the gate control have continually been made. Other types of structures using SiGe source/drain, asymmetric Schottky source/drain, and the like will be investigated as viable structures to achieve ultimate CMOS. In reaching its scaling limit, tunneling will be an issue for CMOS. The tunneling current through the gate oxide and between the source and drain will limit the device operation. When tunneling becomes significant, circuits may incorporate tunneling devices with CMOS to further increase the functionality per device count. We will discuss both the top-down and bottom-up approaches in attaining the nanometer scale and eventually the atomic scale. Self-assembly {{is used as a}} bottom-up approach. The state of the art is reviewed, and the challenges of the multiple-step processing in using the self-assembly approach are outlined. Another facet of the scaling trend is to decrease the number of electrons in devices, ultimately leading to single electrons. If the size of a single-electron device is scaled {{in such a way that}} the Coulomb self-energy is higher than the thermal energy (at room temperature), a single-electron device will be able to operate at room temperature. In principle, the speed of the device will be fast as long as the capacitance of the load is also scaled accordingly. The single-electron device will have a small drive current, and thus the load capacitance, including those of interconnects and fanouts, must be small to achieve a reasonable speed. However, because the increase in the density (and/or functionality) of integrated circuits is the principal driver, the wiring or interconnects will increase and become the bottleneck for the design of future high-density and high-functionality circuits, particularly for single-electron devices. Furthermore, the massive interconnects needed in the architecture used today will result in an increase in load capacitance. Thus for single-electron <b>device</b> <b>circuits,</b> it is critical to have minimal interconnect loads. And new types of architectures with minimal numbers of global interconnects will be needed. Cellular automata, which need only nearest-neighbor interconnects, are discussed as a plausible example. Other architectures such as neural networks are also possible. Examples of signal processing using cellular automata are discussed. Quantum computing and information processing are based on quantum mechanical descriptions of individual particles correlated among each other. A quantum bit or qubit is described as a linear superposition of the wave functions of a two-state system, for example, the spin of a particle. With the interaction of two qubits, they are connected in a "wireless fashion" using wave functions via quantum mechanical interaction, referred to as entanglement. The interconnection by the nonlocality of wave functions affords a massive parallel nature for computing or so-called quantum parallelism. We will describe the potential and solid-state implementations of quantum computing and information, using electron spin and/or nuclear spin in Si and Ge.
