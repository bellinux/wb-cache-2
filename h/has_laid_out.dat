5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> their {{strategy in the}} battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Budan's theorem was of such great importance, the {{appearance}} of Sturm's theorem in 1827 gave it (and Vincent's theorem) the death blow. Sturm's theorem solved the real root isolation problem, by defining the precise number of real roots a polynomial has in a real open interval (a, b); moreover, Sturm himself, p.108, acknowledges the great influence Fourier's theorem had on him: « C'est en m'appuyant sur les principes qu'il a posés, et en imitant ses démonstrations, que j'ai trouvé les nouveaux théorèmes que je vais énoncer. » which translates to «It is by relying upon the principles he <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> and by imitating his proofs that I have found the new theorems which I am about to present.» Because of the above, the theorems by Fourier and Sturm appear in almost all the books on the theory of equations and Sturm's method for computing the real roots of polynomials {{has been the only}} one widely known and used ever since – up to about 1980, when it was replaced (in almost all computer algebra systems) by methods derived from Vincent's theorem, the fastest one being the Vincent–Akritas–Strzeboński (VAS) method.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, {{a beautifully}} attired Nastassya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are to escort her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastassya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not {{particularly}} surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day, he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him {{to come back to the}} house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastassya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in his study.|$|E
500|$|The Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> {{long-term}} {{plans for}} improvements {{to both the}} southern and northern termini of Route4. During the1980s and 1990s, RIDOT announced plans to eliminate the three traffic lights along {{the southern end of}} the highway. The department planned to replace the existing signalized US1 and Route4 merge, converting it into a grade-separated interchange with an extensive overpass. This would cut-off access to three local roads that intersect US1 near the signal. The plan also included the replacement of the two other signaled intersections at West Allenton Road and Oak Hill Road with overpasses; the overpass for West Allenton Road is planned to be constructed as a new exit4. In the 1990s, the state purchased and demolished several houses in the region to allow for an expanded Route4 right-of-way in the vicinity of West Allenton Road.|$|E

Sam resents Roy's interest in Cassidy, even acquiescing in the boy's brief jailing on a trumped-up charge, where he scolds him, [...] "I {{spent the better part}} of my life trying to live down the reputation that your hero <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> for the Parker name and you grow up worshipping him."

60|$|Mr. Griffith further {{informs us}} that the Colonial Government is desirous of {{fostering}} and encouraging agriculture; that it proposes to establish, or rather to re-establish, a model farm; that lands have been granted at a trifling sum to Mr. William Grant on condition of his devoting capital and labour {{to the development of}} agriculture; that Mr. Thomas Bright <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a coffee and cocoa farm at Murray Town; and that Mr. Samuel Lewis, a barrister-at-law, universally well spoken of, is engaged in cultivation, with a view of studying the best methods and of influencing his fellow-countrymen in favour of agricultural pursuits. Major Bolton also is working the land seventeen miles down coast, and planting cocoa-nuts, chocolate, and Kola-trees. The latter, when ten years old, are said each to fetch 15l. per annum.

He was formerly a member of Parliament. I had met him before at dinner at Mrs. H------'s. [...] . He took pleasure in showing me his grounds, through which he <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> a walk, winding up and down through dells and over hillocks, and now and then crossing a rustic bridge; so that you have an idea of quite an extensive domain.|$|E

60|$|But, moreover, he saw {{everywhere}} beauty; shapes, and colours, and sounds, {{which were}} beautiful in his eyes, {{and gave him}} pleasure deep and strange, he knew not why: and the Spirit of God within him told him--'These fair things please thee. Do they not please Him who made them? He that formed the ear, shall he not hear the song of birds? He that made the eye, shall he not see the colours of the flowers? He who made thee to rejoice in {{the beauty of the}} earth, shall not he rejoice in his own works?' And God seemed to him, in his mind's eye, to delight in his own works, as a painter delights in the picture which he has drawn, as a gardener delights in the flowers which he has planted; as a cunning workman delights in the curious machine which he has invented; as a king delights in the fair parks and gardens and stately palaces which he <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out,</b> and builded, and adorned, for his own pleasure, {{as well as for the}} good of his subjects.|$|E

"Here," [...] he explained, {{tapping the}} book, [...] "I've got a double entry of every likely client that I know, {{with a note}} {{of the things he}} may have to sell and the things he may want to buy. When it is {{something}} that he has for sale there are cross-references to likely purchasers of that particular line of article. I don't limit myself to things that I actually know people to be in want of, I go further than that and have theories, carefully indexed theories, as to the things that people might want to buy. At the right moment, if I can get the opportunity, I mention the article that is in my mind's eye to the possible purchaser who has also been in my mind's eye, and I frequently bring off a sale. I started a chance acquaintance on a career of print-buying the other day merely by telling him of a couple of good prints that I knew of, that were to be had at a quite reasonable price; he is a man with more money than he knows what to do with, and he <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> quite a lot on old prints since his first purchase. Most of his collection he has got through me, and of course I net a commission on each transaction. So you see, old man, how useful, not to say necessary, a club with a large membership is to me. The more mixed and socially chaotic it is, the more serviceable it is." ...|$|E

60|$|Within {{the figure}} and frame and clothes and cuticle, within {{the bones and}} flesh of many of us, there is but one person,--a man or woman, with a {{preponderance}} either of good or evil, whose conduct in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman. Such persons are simple, single, and, perhaps, generally, safe. They walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles, and are to-day as they were yesterday, and will be to-morrow as they are to-day. Lady Eustace was such a person, and so was Lucy Morris. Opposite in their characters as the two poles, they were, each of them, a simple entity; and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman. But there are human beings who, though of necessity single in body, are dual in character;--in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good,--but to whom evil is sometimes horribly, hideously evil, but is sometimes also not hideous at all. Of such men it may be said that Satan obtains an intermittent grasp, from which, when it is released, the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble. Such men,--or women,--may hardly, perhaps, debase themselves with the more vulgar vices. They will not be rogues, or thieves, or drunkards,--or, perhaps, liars; but ambition, luxury, self-indulgence, pride, and covetousness will {{get a hold of}} them, and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices. Such a man was Frank Greystock, who could walk {{along the banks of the}} quiet, trout-giving Bob, at Bobsborough, whipping the river with his rod, telling himself that the world lost for love would be a bad thing well lost for a fine purpose; and who could also stand, with his hands in his trousers pockets, looking down upon the pavement, in the purlieus of the courts at Westminster, and swear to himself that he would win the game, let the cost to his heart be what it might. What must a man be who would allow some undefined feeling,--some inward ache which he calls a passion and cannot analyse, some desire which has come of instinct and not of judgment,--to interfere with all the projects of his intellect, with all the work which he <b>has</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> for his accomplishment? Circumstances had thrown him into a path of life for which, indeed, his means were insufficient, but which he regarded as, of all paths, the noblest and the manliest. If he could be true to himself,--with such truth as at these moments would seem to him to be the truest truth,--there was nothing in rank, nothing in ambition, which might not be within his reach. He might live with the highest, the best-educated, and the most beautiful; he might assist in directing national councils by his intelligence; and might make a name for himself which should be remembered in his country, and of which men would read the records in the histories written in after ages. But to do this, he must walk warily. He, an embarrassed man, a man already in debt, a man with no realised property coming to him in reversion, was called upon to live, and to live as though at his ease, among those who had been born to wealth. And, indeed, he had so cleverly learned the ways of the wealthy, that he hardly knew any longer how to live at his ease among the poor.|$|E
