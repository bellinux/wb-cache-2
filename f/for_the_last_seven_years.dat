25|$|Brevik was {{the furthest}} along the South Coast that the railway reached {{at the time}} it opened, and {{remained}} in that position until the opening of the Kragerø Line in 1927. In that period the station acted as a transfer station between the train and steamships for the fastest transport along the coast. The ferry service, Brevikruta, commenced in 1896, and continued until 1934, although it struggled <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years.</b> Plans for a railway ferry service to Continental Europe were launched in 1912. By 1915 Frederikshavn had been settled on and it was argued that it would provide fastest service from Norway to Hamburg, Germany. Two ferries would be required, each using seven hours on a crossing and allowing for two return services per day. However the plans were never carried through.|$|E
