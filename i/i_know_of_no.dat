He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E

[...] Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel {{would have to be}} sent from Philadelphia. [...] New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, proposing [...] "to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> one competent to this task, except our Melter & Refiner, Mr. Peale."

500|$|In {{spite of}} Washington's pleas, Mason {{remained}} in Virginia, plagued by illness and heavily occupied, {{both on the}} Committee of Safety and elsewhere in defending the Fairfax County area. [...] Most of the legislation Mason introduced in the House of Delegates was war related, often aimed at raising the men or money needed by Congress for Washington's Continental Army. The new federal and state governments, short on cash, issued paper money. By 1777, the value of Virginia's paper money had dropped precipitously, and Mason developed a plan to redeem the notes with a tax on real estate. Due to illness, Mason was three weeks late in arriving at Richmond, to the frustration of Washington, who had faith in Mason's knowledge of financial affairs. The general wrote to Custis, [...] "It is much to be wished that a remedy {{could be applied to}} the depreciation of our Currency... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> person better qualified to do this than Colonel Mason".|$|E
500|$|Second, Schulz is {{credited}} with being the first center to {{step back from the}} line while playing defense. [...] Prior to Schulz's innovation, centers played in the line on defense. [...] In 1905, Schulz began dropping back from the line, enabling him to use his speed to move laterally and giving him greater coverage across the field of play. [...] At the time, the innovation was referred to as a [...] "roving center", but it was effectively the birth of the linebacker position in American football. [...] Asked how he developed the [...] "roving center" [...] idea, Schulz noted that the backs started from five yards behind the line and concluded, [...] "No back living could move five yards while I was moving four". [...] He described his thinking to Coach Yost this way: [...] "It's all very simple, Yost. The ball carrier travels five yards while I travel only four yard to meet him. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> back who can beat me in a five-yard race after giving me a one-yard handicap".|$|E

500|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{doctrine}} of parliamentary sovereignty, Coke's theory gradually died out; William Blackstone, in the first edition of his Commentaries on the Laws of England, wrote that [...] "if the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is unreasonable, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> power that can control it: and the examples alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them prove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the judges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial power above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all government". Parliamentary sovereignty is now upheld by the English judiciary as a [...] "central principle of British constitutionalism" [...] despite with some issues by membership in the European Union. The case's modern irrelevance is such that Philip Hamburger wrote in 2008, [...] "Bonham's Case scarcely deserves mention in a history of judicial duty, except for reasons that are now largely forgotten".|$|E

Her balance is marvelous — almost uncanny. Try as I would — one element after another — they all swung into the same identical line. I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's midship section. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” ...|$|E

He wrote, [...] "No issue, no bill, no policy is comparable in importance with a demonstration that Indians can maintain unity and cordial feelings even at times of difference upon specific points." [...] McKenzie was well connected to the political establishment in Washington, D.C., and by 1914, he solicited over 400 Non-native associate memberships from influential academicians, politicians and Progressive organizations. [...] Parker noted, [...] "I am sure that we all wish you to secure for us as many members {{as you can and}} win for us the right kind of friends." [...] Parker was deeply grateful for McKenzie's support and assistance through the Society's most productive years, and in 1913 nominated McKenzie for Commissioner of Indian Affairs to Franklin K. Lane, then U.S. Secretary of the Interior. Writing without McKenzie's knowledge, Parker cited [...] "his friend's broad experience, special knowledge of the Indian, rare understanding of the legal and social status of our native wards. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> fitter person for the difficult task that falls upon the Office of the Indian Commissioner." [...] McKenzie and Parker collaborated until 1915, when McKenzie departed Ohio State University and his friends in Columbus to assume the Presidency of Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.

2500|$|That {{same year}} the {{rebuilding}} was already well underway. In {{a letter from}} the amateur architect Sir Thomas Robinson of Rokeby to his father-in-law Lord Carlisle of 6 June 1734, Sir Thomas reports that he found the garden front [...] "finished" [...] and that a start had been made on the main front: [...] "when finished 'twill be a stupendous fabric, infinitely superior to anything we have now in England," [...] and he adds [...] "The whole finishing will be entirely submitted to Lord Burlington, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> subject's house in Europe will have 7 such magnificent rooms so finely proportioned as these will be." [...] In the 20thcentury, Nikolaus Pevsner would agree, but the mention of the architect-earl Burlington, arbiter of architectural taste, boded ill for the provincial surveyor-builder, Tunnicliffe. It is doubtless to Burlington's intervention that about this time, before the West Front was finished, the Earl of Malton, as he had now become, commissioned Henry Flitcroft to revise Tunnicliffe's plan there and build the East Front range. Flitcroft was Burlington's professional architectural amanuensis— [...] "Burlington Harry" [...] as he was called; he had prepared for the engravers the designs of Inigo Jones published by Burlington and William Kent in 1727, and in fact Kent was also called in for confabulation over Wentworth Woodhouse, mediated by Sir Thomas Robinson, though in the event the pedestrian Flitcroft was not unseated and continued to provide designs for the house over the following decade: he revised and enlarged Tunnicliffe's provincial Baroque West Front and added wings, as well as temples and other structures in the park. Contemporary engravings of the grand public East Front give Flitcroft as architect. [...] Flitcroft, right-hand man of the architectural dilettanti and fully occupied as well at the Royal Board of Works, could not constantly be on-site, however: Francis Bickerton, surveyor and builder of York, paid bills in 1738 and 1743.|$|E
