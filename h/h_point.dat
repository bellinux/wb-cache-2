Testis levels of retinoic acid decreased (32 %) in a statistically significant manner at the 12 and 48 <b>h</b> time <b>points.</b> However, retinol and retinaldehyde were not sig-nificantly affected by molinate.

40|$|Injection of {{carrageenan}} 1 % (50 μl) in {{the mouse}} paw causes a biphasic response: an early inflammatory response that lasts 6 h {{and a second}} late response that peaks at 72 h, declining at 96 h. Only mice 7 - or 8 -week old, weighing 32 – 34 g, displayed a consistent response in both phases. In 8 -week-old mice, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels are significantly elevated in the early phase at 6 h and reach their maximum at 24 h to decline to basal value at 48 h. Nitrate+nitrite (NOx) levels in the paw are maximal after 2 h and slowly decline thereafter in contrast to prostaglandin E 2 levels that peak {{in the second phase}} at the 72 <b>h</b> <b>point.</b> Western blot analysis showed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is detectable at 6 h and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) at 24 <b>h</b> <b>point,</b> respectively. Analysis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), iNOS and COX- 2 expression at 6 and 24 h in 3 – 8 -week-old mice demonstrated that both eNOS and iNOS expressions are dependent upon the age–weight of mice, as opposite to COX- 2 that is present only in {{the second phase of the}} oedema and is not linked to mouse age–weight. Subplantar injection of carrageenan to C 57 BL/ 6 J causes a biphasic oedema that is significantly reduced by about 20 % when compared to CD 1 mice. Interestingly, in these mice, iNOS expression is absent up to 6 h, as opposite to CD 1, and becomes detectable at the 24 <b>h</b> <b>point.</b> Cyclooxygenase (COX- 1) expression is upregulated between 4 and 24 h after carrageenan injection, whereas in CD 1 mice COX- 1 remains unchanged after irritant agent injection. MPO levels are maximal at the 24 <b>h</b> <b>point</b> and they are significantly lower, at 6 <b>h</b> <b>point,</b> than MPO levels detected in CD 1 mice. In conclusion, mouse paw oedema is biphasic and age-weight dependent. The present results are the first report on the differential expressions of eNOS, iNOS, COX- 1 and COX- 2 in response to carrageenan injection in the two phases of the mouse paw oedema...|$|E
