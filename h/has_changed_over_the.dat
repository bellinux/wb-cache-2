5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries. One major change was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} ADF {{personnel}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last 20 years. During the 1990s {{the strength of}} the ADF was reduced from around 70,000 to 50,000 permanent personnel as a result of budget cuts and the commercialisation of some elements of the military. The ADF began to grow from 2000 after the defence white paper released that year called for an expansion to the military's strength, though the size of the military decreased between the 2003–04 to 2005–06 financial due to problems with attracting further recruits. By 2009–10 the ADF was above its budgeted size, leading to reductions until 2014–15. The ADF has not met its recruitment targets over the period since the 1995–96 financial year.|$|E

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals {{had been known}} to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans {{and the destruction of}} the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E

The particular brand and model of card <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years; in early models, it was Atheros brand, while since late 2008 they have been Broadcom cards. This distinction is mostly of concern to those who run other operating systems such as Linux on MacBooks, as different cards require different device drivers.|$|E
25|$|Historically, pederasty {{has existed}} as {{a variety of}} customs and {{practices}} within different cultures. The status of pederasty <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of history, at times considered an ideal {{and at other times}} a crime. In the history of Europe, its most structured cultural manifestation was Athenian pederasty, and became most prominent in the 6th century BC. Greek pederasty's various forms were the subject of philosophic debates in which the purely carnal type was unfavorably compared with erotic friendships and moderate forms, known as Sophrosyne.|$|E
25|$|The {{connection}} between Mont Saint-Michel and the mainland <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries. Previously {{connected by a}} tidal causeway (a path uncovered only at low tide), this was converted into a raised (permanently dry) causeway in 1879, preventing the tide from scouring the silt around the mount. The coastal flats have also been polderised to create pastureland, decreasing {{the distance between the}} shore and the island, and the Couesnon River has been canalised, reducing the dispersion of the flow of water. These factors all encouraged silting-up of the bay.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of {{megalencephaly}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years, however, {{with the}} development of more advanced equipment, physicians have been able to confirm the disorder with better accuracy. Usually, a physical exam is first performed when characteristics of megalencephaly have appeared. This typically occurs at birth or during early child development. A physician will then take head measurements {{in order to determine the}} circumference. This is known as the head circumference. Then a family background will be recorded in order to determine if there has been a history of megalencephaly in the family.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{damage has}} been one of the many causes in {{diseases}} related to aging. The stability of the genome is defined by the cells machinery of repair, damage tolerance, and checkpoint pathways that counteracts DNA damage. One hypothesis proposed by Gioacchino Failla in 1958 is that damage accumulation to the DNA causes aging. The hypothesis was developed soon by physicist Leó Szilárd. This theory <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years as new research has discovered new types of DNA damage and mutations, and several theories of aging argue that DNA damage with or without mutations causes aging.|$|E
25|$|Amazon state {{sales tax}} {{collection}} policy <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years since in the company's beginning {{it did not}} collect any sale taxes. In the U.S., state and local sales taxes are levied by state and local governments, not at the federal level. In most countries where Amazon operates, a sales tax or value added tax is uniform throughout the country, and Amazon is obliged to collect it from all customers. Proponents of forcing Amazon.com to collect sales tax—at least in states where it maintains a physical presence—argue the corporation wields an anti-competitive advantage over storefront businesses forced to collect sales tax.|$|E

25|$|The {{crest of}} Barcelona <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. The teams' first crest {{consisted}} of {{a modified version of}} the city of Barcelona's Coat of Arms in dark blue borders. The team used this crest for two years until 1927. In 1935, the first major change came when they used Barcelona's flag in a circle, with a triangle behind it bearing the team's initials. In 1955, after the team won their first Guayas Championship, the team adopted their current crest, which is similar to FC Barcelona's. Changes they made to it included the number of spikes, the color of the ball, border color, and the initials.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} Toronto-Dominion Bank's top {{executive}} <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. Initially it was styled as chairman. Later, it became {{chief executive officer}} and one often carried additional responsibilities {{as chairman of the}} board, while the second-in-command was the President. After the merger of the Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canada Trust, while Charles Baillie was {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of the combined entity, Clark was appointed President and chief operating officer which solidified him as the eventual successor to Baillie. Upon Baillie's retirement, Clark became the President and chief executive officer, as the bank decided to appoint John M. Thompson as non-executive chairman.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of the two ex-college campuses <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> years. While {{at the time of}} unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in brutalist style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.|$|E
