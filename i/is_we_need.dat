Istrati's articles in Cruciada Românismului are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, [...] "A Letter to Love", led {{to a series of}} articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: [...] "Panait Istrati, {{do you know what it}} <b>is</b> <b>we</b> <b>need?</b> A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, for as long as the Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets". Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.|$|E
2500|$|On March 11, 2016, HRC {{voted to}} endorse Republican US Senator Mark Kirk over his Democratic Party {{challenger}} Representative Tammy Duckworth in his re-election bid to the US Senate. [...] The endorsement {{was met with}} widespread surprise and criticism in news media and social media as HRC had given Kirk a score of 78 percent out of 100 percent on LGBT issues, while HRC awarded Duckworth a score of 100 percent. David Nir at Daily Kos called the endorsement as [...] "appalling as it is embarrassing" [...] and [...] "pathetic and stupid", while Slate observed that Democrat control of the Senate was effectively necessary for passing the Equality Act of 2015 and beneficial for many other LGBT equality issues, and thus {{it would be in}} line with the organization's stated goals for Duckworth to be elected rather than Kirk. Meanwhile, The New Republic stated that, in light of a recent internal report revealing HRC's [...] "serious diversity problem", [...] "Choosing the white male candidate in this race over the Asian-American female candidate—someone who happens to have a better voting record anyway—is probably the worst way of convincing your detractors that you are taking a core problem seriously." [...] HRC president Chad Griffin defended the endorsement in a column published by the Independent Journal Review, describing the senator's work on behalf of LGBT equality issues including co-sponsoring the Equality Act of 2015. Griffin stated: [...] "The truth <b>is</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> more cross party cooperation on issues of equality, not less", adding [...] "when members of Congress vote the right way and stand up for equality — regardless of party — we must stand with them. We simply cannot ask members of Congress to vote with us, and then turn around and try to kick them out of office." ...|$|E

6000|$|One of the ballads, also, has a {{good deal}} of spirit. It is by Kostes Palamas and was {{suggested}} by an interesting incident which occurred some years ago in Athens. In the summer of 1881 there was borne through the streets the remains of an aged woman in the complete costume of a Pallikar, which dress she had worn at the siege of Missolonghi and in it had requested to be buried. The life of this real Greek heroine should be studied by those who are investigating the question of wherein womanliness consists. The view the poet takes of her <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> hardly say, very different from that which Canon Liddon would entertain. Yet it is none the less fine on this account, and we are glad that this old lady has been given a place in art.

60|$|By the label, DEMON NEWSWRITER, it is {{not meant}} that the Author of this poor Paper was an actual Devil, or infernal Spiritual Essence of miraculous {{spectral}} nature. By no means! Beyond doubt, he is some poor Frenchman, more or less definable as flesh-and-blood; gesturing about, visibly, at Berlin in 1752; in cocked-hat and bright shoe-buckles; grinning elaborate salutations to certain of his fellow-creatures there. Possibly some hungry ATTACHE of Milord Tyrconnel's Legation; fatally shut out from the beatitudes of this barbarous Court, and willing to seek solacement, and turn a dishonest penny, in the PER-CONTRA course? Who he <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not know or care: too evident, he has the sad quality of transmuting, in his dirty organs, heavenly Brilliancy, more or less, into infernal Darkness and Hatefulness; which I reckon to have been, at all times, the principal function of a Devil;--function still carried on extensively, under Firms of another title, in this world.|$|E
60|$|V. The {{problem of}} free will is so intimately {{bound up with the}} {{analysis}} of causation that, old as it <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not despair of obtaining new light on it by the help of new views on the notion of cause. The free-will problem has, at one time or another, stirred men's passions profoundly, and the fear that the will might not be free has been to some men a source of great unhappiness. I believe that, under the influence of a cool analysis, the doubtful questions involved will be found to have no such emotional importance as is sometimes thought, since the disagreeable consequences supposed to flow from a denial {{of free will}} do not flow from this denial in any form in which there is reason to make it. It is not, however, on this account chiefly that I wish to discuss this problem, but rather because it affords {{a good example of the}} clarifying effect of analysis and of the interminable controversies which may result from its neglect.|$|E
60|$|What {{is wanted}} {{for the cause}} of England to-day is an Englishman with enough {{imagination}} to love his country from the outside as well as the inside. That <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> somebody who will do for the English what has never been done for them, but what is done for any outlandish peasantry or even any savage tribe. We want people who can make England attractive; quite apart from disputes about whether England is strong or weak. We want somebody to explain, not that England is everywhere, but what England is anywhere; not that England is or is not really dying, but why we do not want her to die. For this purpose the official and conventional compliments or claims can never get any farther than pompous abstractions about Law and Justice and Truth; the ideals which England accepts as every civilised state accepts them, and violates as every civilised state violates them. That is not {{the way in which the}} picture of any people has ever been painted on the sympathetic imagination of the world. Enthusiasts for old Japan did not tell us that the Japs recognised the existence of abstract morality; but that they lived in paper houses or wrote letters with paint-brushes. Men who wished to interest us in Arabs did not confine themselves to saying that they are monotheists or moralists; they filled our romances with the rush of Arab steeds or the colours of strange tents or carpets. What we want is somebody who will do for the Englishman with his front garden what was done for the Jap and his paper house; who shall understand the Englishman with his dog as well as the Arab with his horse. In a word, what nobody has really tried to do is the one thing that really wants doing. It is to make England attractive as a nationality, and even as a small nationality.|$|E
