From seasons 3–6, it was filmed in an actual watch tower (in reality located at Port Carling, Ont.). By season 8, it was a set. [...] Gord appeared in the lodge during season 7, {{saying that he had}} eaten the front two legs of the tower and caused it to fall over. [...] In the movie Duct Tape Forever, the tower had burned down and Ranger Gord was then in charge of a train station located {{at the end of a}} section of unfinished tracks and thus where no trains ever run; this is an obvious pun on Gord's still having a [...] "dead-end job", just like his former merely-self-maintained <b>forest-ranger</b> position that the National Forest Service cared nothing about.|$|E

40|$|The studied {{forest is}} a {{protected}} area located in Southern Burundi, close to Bururi city and to agricultural villages. The effective protection of this forest started in 1980 but the protected area delimitation occurred in 2000. The forest spatial dynamic is analyzed {{to assess the}} effectiveness of this protection status. The study combines six Landsat multispectral satellite images analysis with field observations. Forest area and perimeter analysis highlights its dynamic in two phases: the first one is mainly characterised by deforestation and savannah development around agricultural lands but also by forest regrowth processes between 1986 and 2001. The second phase (2001 - 2011) of the forest dynamic is characterized by the increase of its surface and perimeter following the transformation of savannah zones. The anthropogenic effect limitation linked to the protected area delimitation, agricultural activities disturbance during socio-political instability period and to the increasing number of <b>forest-rangers,</b> would have influenced the surface and perimeter gain between 2001 and 2011. Local population implication in forest protection could further limit human pressure and promote degraded zones regeneration. Thus, agropastoral practices innovation in neighboring villages of the protected zone could contribute to limit these anthropogenic disturbances. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

60|$|A few claims, with log cabins {{of recent}} settlers, {{once or twice}} the shack of a <b>forest-ranger,</b> a {{telephone}} in a box by the road or a rough R. F. D. box nailed to a pine trunk, these indicated that civilization still existed, but they were only melancholy blurs. She was in a cold enchantment. All of her was dead save the ability to keep on driving, forever, with no hope of the tedium ending. She was bewildered. She passed six times {{what seemed to be}} precisely the same forest clearing, always with the road on a tiny ridge {{to the left of the}} clearing, always with a darkness-stilled house at one end and always, in the pasture at the other end, a horse which neighed. She was in a panorama stage-scene; things moved steadily by her, there was a sound of the engine, and a sensation of steering, but she was forever in the same place, among the same pines, with the same scowling blackness between their bare clean trunks. Only the road ahead was clear: a one-way track, the foot-high earthy bank and the pine-roots beside it, two distinct ruts, and a roughening of strewn brown bark and pine-needles, which, in the beating light of the car's lamps, made the sandy road scabrous with little incessant shadows.|$|E
40|$|A FORESTRY MANUAL OF YEAR X - The unrecognized work of Jean-Georges-Bernard LORENTZfirst {{director}} of the School of Forestry. - The Annals have published in 1929 the first lectures givenat the Forestry School of Nancy from 1825 to 1829 by LORENTZ. Professor HUFFEL in his introduction has clearly emphasized thefeatures of this instruction, which remains at the basis of thedevelopment of ideas about forestry in France, during the nineteenthcentury. This instruction was very closely in touchwith German Sylviculture, with the works of BURGSDORF andHARTIG, and by virtue of this, it is shown to have brokendeliberately in many respects with the traditional French Sylviculture,as practised by the officers of the « Master Crafts ». In his work M. BLAIS first studies shortly the developmentof forestry ideas in France between {{the beginning of the}} Revolutionand the establishment of the School; then he presentsa Forestry Manual which appeared in Year X of the Republic(1801 - 1802). This book constitutes a very remarkable elementof transition between the French and the German Sylviculture. Extracts from the most interesting chapters are reported,which reveal that the author of the Manual did not contenthimself with stealing from his predecessors, but succeeded inconciliating them and in making a really synthetic exposition. The chapter on the methods of forest-organization by areaand volume is very significant in this respect. In a concluding section M. BLAIS studies the problem of theauthorship. The Manual is the work of a certain J. B. LORENZ :there had never been any question of identifying this man never specially remarked until now, with the celebrated founder ofthe School of Nancy, whose biography was well-known inanother way. M. BLAIS proves this identification : he showsthat the "Forestry Manual" is attributable to the pen of theyoung Bernard LORENTZ, who was then <b>Forest-ranger</b> at Kirchheimbolandin the department of Mont-Tonnerre, an excellentobservation-post from which to study German sylviculture. Being given the strong personality of LORENTZ, this identificationhas not failed to rouse objections, which the authortakes pains to refute. Finally LORENTZ emerges from thishitherto unknown paternity with an enhanced reputation, andit is with a lively sympathy that he, who was destinated tobecome the intransigent advocate of conversions into highforest,may be seen seeking in his youth his true direction...|$|E
