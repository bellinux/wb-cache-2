You {{should see}} my mom and her {{brothers}} and sisters... We just vary in color, shapes and sizes. But we’re still Latinos — that doesn’t change a damn thing.|$|E
500|$|Woon {{stepped down}} as Attorney-General on 10 April 2010 after a two-year term. In a media interview, {{he said that the}} post [...] "was not a job I really wanted or enjoyed. I did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> asked to do the job. So I did my best under the {{circumstances}} with what I had." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Deronda, {{you must}} {{enlighten}} my ignorance. I {{want to know}} why you thought it wrong for me to gamble. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a woman?" ...|$|R
60|$|I beg {{you to give}} my best {{thanks to}} the Bath Club for the offer of its hospitalities, but <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> able to take {{advantage}} of <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> to be a guest in a private house during my stay in London.|$|R
500|$|An attorney-at-law with a {{disability}} who was blinded as a youth in an accident with bio-waste that drastically heightened his remaining senses {{and gave him a}} [...] "sonar-sense", which allowed him to perceive his surroundings, and makes a silent promise with his father to [...] "stick up for the long shots". His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{starring}} in Show Boat, Clayton met Robert Lerner, an {{heir to the}} women's clothing shops bearing his name. They were married and moved to California, where Lerner attended Loyola Law School and Clayton concentrated on mothering. [...] "We had three children in three years", {{she said in a}} 1976 interview with People magazine. [...] "Then came Lassie"; [...] "I took <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> dying to work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former New Zealand All Blacks wing Stu Wilson {{writes in}} the tribute book David Campese that, [...] "When asked by a {{television}} reporter if he {{was looking forward to}} mark Stu Wilson he replied, 'Stu who?'" [...] Campese responded in the same book by replying that, [...] "The story is true, but Stu misunderstood why I said it. I didn't say <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> cocky. I said it because I honestly did not know who Stu Wilson was. I was a nineteen-year-old boy from Queanbeyan. My background had been in rugby league, not rugby union." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Tell {{him that}} you are my sister, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> his son, that I love you so, that I love him so; tell him anything. Say {{that he ought to}} do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Hebrew.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Giladi {{has strong}} views on Zionism and its {{negative}} effects and his article {{begins with the}} following passage: [...] "I write this article {{for the same reason}} I wrote my book: to tell the American people, and especially American Jews, that Jews from Islamic lands did not emigrate willingly to Israel; that, to force them to leave, Jews killed Jews; and that, to buy time to confiscate ever more Arab lands, Jews on numerous occasions rejected genuine peace initiatives from their Arab neighbors. I write about what the first prime minister of Israel called 'cruel Zionism'. I write about <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> part of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes had a {{very poor}} {{relationship}} with his father, with whom he lived in Mexico {{for a brief period}} in 1919. Upon graduating from high school in June 1920, Hughes returned to Mexico to live with his father, hoping to convince him to support his plan to attend Columbia University. Hughes later said that, prior to arriving in Mexico, [...] "I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people. I didn't understand <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a Negro, and I liked Negroes very much." [...] Initially, his father had hoped for Hughes to attend a university abroad, and to study for a career in engineering. On these grounds, he was willing to provide financial assistance to his son but did not support his desire to be a writer. Eventually, Hughes and his father came to a compromise: Hughes would study engineering, so long as he could attend Columbia. His tuition provided; Hughes left his father after more than a year. While at Columbia in 1921, Hughes managed to maintain a B+ grade average. He left in 1922 because of racial prejudice. He was attracted more to the people and the neighborhood of Harlem than his studies, though he continued writing poetry.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, yes,' said Uncle Benjy hastily; 'the box is iron, you see. However, {{take care}} of <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{going to make it}} worth your while. Ah, you are a good girl, Anne. <b>I</b> wish you <b>was</b> mine!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Lewis {{offered the}} opinion {{that it was all}} bad, an artistic failure because [...] "I lost the magic". Quoted in Entertainment Weekly: [...] "You will never see it. No one will ever see <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> embarrassed at the poor work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I deny altogether. It {{was his own}} to do as {{he liked}} with it. Had he married I should not have {{expected}} <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the heir. But, if you please, aunt, do not say a word more about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! I thought I smelt it most deliciously as {{you came}} in, but I was afraid I only fancied <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} about it. Dear Cora, {{how good you}} are!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{laughed a}} little. [...] "You don't understand. I did <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid," [...] said he. [...] "Now if I hadn't been, I'd have backed that man {{right into the}} river without {{touching}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{while on}} this digression, let me repeat the {{question}} I have repeated to myself ten thousand times. WHY DID I DRINK? What need {{was there for}} it? I was happy. Was <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too happy? I was strong. Was <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> too strong? Did I possess too much vitality? I don't know why I drank. I cannot answer, though I can voice the suspicion that ever grows in me. I had been in too-familiar contact with John Barleycorn through too many years. A left-handed man, by long practice, can become a right-handed man. Had I, a non-alcoholic, by long practice become an alcoholic? ...|$|E
6000|$|Deringham, however, {{smiled a}} little as he took a wallet from his pocket. [...] "I can {{understand}} <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also a busy man when I'm at home," [...] he said. [...] "It {{is a question of}} the value of your time and Mr. Calhoun's apparently?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope you'll excuse me, Mr Palliser, I do, indeed; but <b>I</b> say <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> half {{afraid of}} some--some--some {{diminution}} of good feeling, perhaps, I had better call it, {{between you and}} your uncle. Anything of that kind would be such a monstrous pity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>it's</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a Blue Light," [...] {{returned}} the marine, with a laugh. [...] "At all events, {{it is certain}} that whatever good there may be about me at all is the result of that Light which is as free to you as to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] said Okanagan. [...] "You needn't worry. I {{was kind}} of hoping he would do <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> anxious about the bleeding. Now we'll get {{everything}} fixed up before he comes round again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Mrs. Dr. dear, you {{are quite}} right. I {{did not think}} of <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite past {{thinking}} rationally. I was just clean mad. Come in the house and I will tell you all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't tell you, dear, {{because the}} mere mention of {{smallpox}} always upsets you so much, especially just now with all this election worry going on; and I knew <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the Smiths' cottage and nursing the baby when the doctor came in and said it was smallpox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] she asked. [...] "Why do {{you want}} me to marry you? You do not care for me. You do not care for me at all. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> rich? But you--you <b>are</b> rich yourselves. <b>I</b> would offer you my money, but you cannot want that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would be proper not to {{understand}} your civility?--But that is not my way--I don't make a courtesy for <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sitting on horseback. But, seriously, I deserve your exception, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the only conversable being about the Hall, except the old priest and Rashleigh." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “I {{became very}} anxious as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting {{more into the}} gambling. Maybe <b>it’s</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> worried about the money I lost, the money <b>I</b> borrowed… <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also scared that <b>I</b> might not <b>be</b> able to control myself forever. Then <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so anxious, <b>I</b> needed to do something. Then I went to the casino or bar to gamble.” [...]...|$|R
60|$|MacShaughnassy {{said it was}} a good thing. We should {{clear the}} suburb at one swoop. The beetles had now been eating this poison {{steadily}} for ten days, and he said that the end could not be far off. I was glad to hear <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> beginning to find this unlimited hospitality expensive. It was a dear poison that we were giving them, and they were hearty eaters.|$|E
6000|$|My {{mother used}} to say to me: [...] "Never expect to find brains in a pretty girl." [...] Perhaps she said <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not a pretty girl and she wished to {{encourage}} me. In any event, that absurd notion of the ancients that when the fairies bestow the gift of beauty on a baby they withhold all other qualities has so often been disproved that we may well disregard it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Without {{a minute}} to think of it," [...] she said to herself, presently,--"without any {{consideration}} at all. And now it is done! It was not like me. I do not know myself. But yes!" [...] she exclaimed, speaking so that any one near might have heard her, [...] "I do know myself. I said <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid, if I did not say it then, I should {{never be able to}} say it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{powers that}} be do not think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{interesting}} enough. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{a member of an}} ethnic minority? How often do you see Paul J. Medford being publicised?...It's as though the BBC are playing us down. I can't believe the white majority of the public are against blacks being stars. They don't give a damn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Mr. Monk, and {{how they}} left Miss Fregelius behind, and you went to fetch her, {{and all sorts of}} strange things {{happened}} to you. We think it quite wonderful and romantic. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> writing to dear Miss Porson to tell her about <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure that you are too modest to sing your own praises." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{trouble you}} with this much about <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{naturally}} desirous you should understand that if I could possibly have been of any service, or have suggested anything to this poor lady, I would not have lost the opportunity. But I cannot help her, and I assure you that I cannot honestly encourage her to hope. I fear her enterprise has no hope in it.|$|R
