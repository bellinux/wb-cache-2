Grain elevators, warehouses and shipping traffic had overtaxed the two existing fireboats: John T. Hutchinson (Engine 23) and George R. Potter (Engine 29). Also, the city of Buffalo had shoreline hookups to allow the fireboats to serve as floating pumping stations supplying high pressure water to a fire <b>hydrant</b> system that <b>covered</b> the downtown area. [...] The decision was made by city officials to order a third boat that would also have icebreaking capability along with her normal firefighting duties.|$|R
500|$|Down on {{his luck}} and starved for inspiration, Lisa {{recommends}} Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum. But {{none of the}} art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists have done, and it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him about the artist Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire <b>hydrants</b> (having <b>covered</b> the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so {{that they do not}} drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made [...] "Grand Canals of Springfield" [...] along with the swimming zoo animals. As Marge and Homer kiss each other on the roof of their house Jasper Johns comes on a boat and steals the painting Marge was painting. The song playing in the end of episode is [...] "Arrivederci Roma" [...] performed by Michael Dees.|$|R
