5|$|American {{hazelnut}} (Corylus americana), appealing for breeding {{because of}} <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> hardiness.|$|E
5|$|Marylebone {{is one of}} {{the squares}} on the British Monopoly board, and is popular for filming because of <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> {{quietness}} compared to other London termini.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). <b>Its</b> <b>relative</b> rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} being trapped in the condensing gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E
50|$|As an ester of oxymorphone, it is presumably a Schedule II {{controlled}} substance as it and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> save acetlmorphone do not specifically appear in Schedule I. 3,14-Diacetyloxymorphone and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> including acetylmorphone do not, however, have annual production quotas {{published by the}} DEA in the Federal Register.|$|R
50|$|Also like <b>its</b> close <b>relatives,</b> Coloborhynchus had a keel-shaped crest on {{the front}} of its jaws, though it was broad and thinned from base to top, rather than the uniformly thin crests of <b>its</b> <b>relatives.</b> This kind of {{thickened}} crest is also seen in Siroccopteryx moroccensis, which may be <b>its</b> closest <b>relative</b> or a member of the same genus. It also had a straight, rather than curved, front margin, unlike <b>its</b> <b>relatives,</b> and begins {{at the tip of the}} snout, rather than further back as in other species.|$|R
50|$|Examples include Volvox and <b>its</b> <b>relatives,</b> Scenedesmus, Pediastrum, and Hydrodictyon.|$|R
5|$|Another {{formation}} with tyrannosaur {{remains is}} the Lance Formation of Wyoming. This {{has been interpreted}} as a bayou environment similar to today's Gulf Coast. The fauna was very similar to Hell Creek, but with Struthiomimus replacing <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> Ornithomimus. The small ceratopsian Leptoceratops also lived in the area.|$|E
5|$|However, the boar and <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> the pig started {{being seen}} as polluting since the 12th century, due to Muslim {{influence}} on India. Muslims consider the pig and its meat unclean. This led {{to a decline in}} Varaha worship to a certain extent.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> the guinea pig, the {{capybara}} {{does not}} have the capacity to synthesize vitamin C, and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvy.|$|E
50|$|Pokur {{has lost}} the noun-class concord found in <b>its</b> <b>relatives.</b>|$|R
25|$|Abbottella and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> {{appear to}} have evolved on {{mainland}} Hispaniola, and thus {{were not part of}} the Tiburon Peninsula species assemblage that was tectonically rafted to the island. Preliminary radular and phylogenetic studies clearly indicate that Abbottella and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> are a distinct monophyletic group apart {{from the rest of the}} Annulariidae.|$|R
5000|$|Dennis, in Latin Dionysius, and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> mean [...] "of Dionysus." ...|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} {{is a much}} more approachable bird than the water pipit. If startled, it flies a fairly short {{distance}}, close to the ground, before it alights, whereas <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> is warier and flies some distance before landing again. Eurasian rock pipits are usually solitary, only occasionally forming small flocks.|$|E
5|$|The Marshlink line {{is one of}} the few in South East England {{that has}} not been electrified, and uses the British Rail Class 171 diesel rolling stock. Despite <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> unimportance in the {{national}} rail network, it is now considered politically significant as electrification of the line could allow High Speed 1 to be extended to Hastings and Eastbourne.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} is omnivorous, eating {{a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like <b>its</b> <b>relative,</b> the blackbird, the song thrush finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E

50|$|Like <b>its</b> <b>relatives,</b> it {{produces}} small, white, fragrant flowers and fleshy fruits.|$|R
50|$|This plant often hybridizes with <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> Scirpus atrocinctus and S. pedicellatus.|$|R
5|$|The {{water pipit}} {{is a much}} less approachable bird than the Eurasian rock pipit. It is warier than <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> and if {{approached}} it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels only a short distance, close to the ground, before it alights.|$|E
5|$|This species, like <b>its</b> <b>relative,</b> is seen {{regularly}} {{killed by}} farmers and on grouse estates. In County Cork, Ireland, the county's gun clubs shot over 23,000 hooded crows {{in two years}} in the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Where the {{two species}} occur in the same mountains, the Alpine species tends to breed at a higher {{elevation}} than <b>its</b> <b>relative,</b> since it is better adapted for a diet at high altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Subfamily Paulchoffatiinae {{includes}} Paulchoffatia and <b>its</b> <b>relatives.</b> This taxon contains nine genera.|$|R

5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere). The Alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than <b>its</b> <b>relative,</b> although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour.|$|E
5|$|It {{closely resembles}} <b>its</b> <b>relative,</b> the Moreton Bay fig (F.macrophylla). Having similar ranges in the wild, {{they are often}} confused. The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves of F.rubiginosa are the easiest {{distinguishing}} features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (F.obliqua), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12mm long and 4–11mm in diameter, compared with 7–17mm long and 8–17mm diameter for F. rubiginosa.|$|E
5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>its</b> <b>relatives,</b> {{the giant}} {{squirrel}} balances using its two hind feet, instead of its tail.|$|R

40|$|The collection, conservation, {{evaluation}} {{and the information}} management for the genetic resources of Citrus and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> were performed and the genotypes of AAT isozyme were analyzed. The genes at Aat- 1 locus were, F, S, A, and B, alleles, and there results analyzed the alleles in Citrus and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> assumed to have originated from S or F genes, Poncirus have P allele, and {{is different from the}} ancestors of Citrus and Fortunella. The genes at Aat- 2 locus were F, B, E, I, G, C, H, A, J, and D alleles, these results suggested gene duplication in Citrus and <b>its</b> <b>relatives</b> except for Poncirus. 植物遺伝資源として収集･保存･評価およびその情報管理を進めているカンキツ類のAAT酵素アイソザイムにおける遺伝子型の解析を行った. Aat- 1 遺伝子座に関する遺伝子は五つの遺伝子(F,S,A,B) であり,カンキツはS遺伝子を祖先に持つものとF遺伝子を持つものになる. カラタチはP遺伝子を持ち,カンキツ,キンカンとは異なる. Aat- 2 遺伝子座に関する遺伝子は 10 個(F,B,E,I,G,C,H,A,J,D) 認められ,カラタチを除いて遺伝子の重複が考えられた. これらの遺伝子は種類によって異なり,マーカー遺伝子として重要である...|$|R
5|$|The African crake {{is smaller}} than the corn crake, which also has darker upperparts, a plain grey face and {{different}} underparts barring pattern. In flight, the African species has shorter, blunter wings with a less prominent white leading edge, and deeper wingbeats than <b>its</b> <b>relative.</b> Other sympatric crakes are smaller with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and a shorter bill. The African rail has dark brown upperparts, a long red bill and red legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine chough lays its eggs {{about one}} month later than <b>its</b> <b>relative,</b> {{although}} breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar. The similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour. The first-year survival rate of the juvenile red-billed chough is 72.5 percent, and for the Alpine it is 77%. The annual adult survival rate is 83–92% for Alpine, but is unknown for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in vivo, and in silico. In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and <b>its</b> <b>relative</b> affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein {{in the context of}} a cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E
