5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a bribery offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, <b>faces</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E

500|$|M. H. Abrams wrote a broad {{description}} of the works in 1965. He observed that in each, the speaker [...] "begins with a {{description of}} the landscape; an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape evokes a varied by integral process of memory, thought, anticipation, and feeling which remains closely intervolved with the outer scene. In the course of this meditation the lyric speaker achieves an insight, <b>faces</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a tragic loss, comes to a moral decision, or resolves an emotional problem. Often the poem rounds itself to end where it began, at the outer scene, but with an altered mood and deepened understanding which {{is the result of the}} intervening meditation." [...] In fact, Abrams was describing both the conversation poems and later works influenced by them. Abrams' essay has been describes as a [...] "touchstone of literary criticism". As Paul Magnuson wrote in 2002, [...] "Abrams credited Coleridge with originating what Abrams called the 'greater Romantic lyric', a genre that began with Coleridge's 'Conversation' poems, and included William Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey, Percy Bysshe Shelley's Stanzas Written in Dejection and John Keats's Ode to a Nightingale, and was a major influence on more modern lyrics by Matthew Arnold, Walt Whitman, Wallace Stevens, and W. H. Auden." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} called The Return of the King [...] "bigger and better" [...] than The Two Towers. [...] "In The Two Towers {{the player}} would occasionally run into 10 or 15 enemies," [...] said lead game designer Chris Tremmel, [...] "in The Return of the King there are {{areas where the}} player <b>faces</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 40 orcs [...] Fans familiar with The Two Towers will find that the combat experience in The Return of the King feels familiar but much deeper." [...] Before creating levels, the developers would initially look at the script and determine what parts from the film to highlight in that particular level, and how to structure that event as a mission. They would then write in-depth level designs out on paper, going into details such as combat setup, special props and enemy types, all the while using the film as their main reference point. They would then create an animatic of the level, working out problems and fine-tuning design concepts. The levels would then be created in the game environment. The game is also graphically improved over The Two Towers. According to Neil Young, [...] "we've developed some new lighting techniques to allow the characters to look richer. We are pushing 2x the number of polys & 2x the texture density [...] we also stream our geometry and textures from the disc so the game has a much higher density of imagery." [...] Enemy AI was improved, and developers also {{spent a lot of}} time working on the sound of the game, which was THX certified.|$|E
