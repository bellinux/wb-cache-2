40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> of the flow hrough {{calorimeter}} KONTAS-cp at the concentrator test bench KONTAS and the subsequent measurements of the specific heat capacity of the silicon based HTF Syltherm 800. After the verification of the functionality of the calorimeter by a final cp measurement connected to a water circuit, the draining and reconstruction of the pipe network are outstanding. The electrical connection of the system control, a stress analysis and the final checking for leakages, have to be accomplished before the competition of the operational readiness. The <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> {{will be followed by}} test measurements and troubleshooting, before final cp measurements at operational conditions can be performed. Besides the practical works, the fault effect analysis, the measurement evaluation as well as the uncertainty estimation are pending. After the completion {{of this work}} and the successful <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning,</b> KONTAS-cp will be prepared for operation. Since the calorimeter bypass is portable and its data acquisition system autonomous, it can be connected to any test facility to quantify the specific heat capacity of HTFs such as Therminol VP 1, Syltherm 800 and Helisol 5 A at CSP relevant operation conditions. It also enables an examination of the natural aging process of the HTF by periodical measurements of the fluid properties and thereby supports an economic management of CSP plants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the problems of}} instable combustion, serious slag, outfire in boilers with horizontal concentrated boiler, taking a 410 t/h boiler as the sample. Through experimental researches on different adjusting characteristics of horizontal concentrated burners, {{it is found that}} the coal air mixture has different characteristics in velocity and concentration when the baffles are respectively left in the centrifugal or centripetal side of the bent pipes, and that the baffles wear pattern also depends on individual installation location. During many cold and <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> tests, the effective height of baffles is regulated and the original refractory belts are replaced to vertical evenly spaced bare-tube wall. After taking the above measures, the significant problems in the boiler are settled and the economics and safety operation performance is improved considerably. Thus the paper can offer certain references for other boilers with horizontal concentrated burners...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin of}} a series of {{atmospheric}} radioxenon events detected at the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) International Monitoring System site in Melbourne, Australia, between November 2008 and February 2009 was investigated. Backward tracking analyses indicated that the events were consistent with releases associated with <b>hot</b> <b>commission</b> testing of the Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation (ANSTO) radiopharmaceutical production facility in Sydney, Australia. Forward dispersion analyses were used to estimate release magnitudes and transport times. The estimated 133 Xe release magnitude of the largest event (between 0. 2 and 34 TBq over a 2 d window), was in close agreement with the stack emission releases estimated by the facility for this time period (between 0. 5 and 2 TBq). Modelling of irradiation conditions and theoretical radioxenon emission rates were undertaken and provided further evidence that the Melbourne detections originated from this radiopharmaceutical production facility. These findings do not have public health implications. This is the first comprehensive study of atmospheric radioxenon measurements and releases in Australia. Â© 2010, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA new neutron {{radiography}} / tomography / imaging instrument DINGO {{was built to}} support the area of neutron imaging research ({{neutron radiography}}/tomography) at ANSTO. The instrument is designed for an international user community and for routine quality control for defense, industrial, cultural heritage and archaeology applications. In the industrial field it provides {{a useful tool for}} studying cracking and defects in steel or other metals. The instrument construction was completed at the end of June 2013 and it is currently in the <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> stage. The usable neutron flux is mainly determined by the neutron source, but it depends on the instrument position and the resolution. The instrument position for DINGO is the thermal neutron beam port HB- 2 in the reactor hall. The measured flux (using gold foil) for an L/D of approximately 500 at HB- 2 is 5. 3 * 107 [n/cm 2 s], which is in a similar range to other facilities. A special feature of DINGO is the in-pile collimator position in front of the main shutter at HB- 2. The collimator offers two pinholes with a possible L/D of 500 and 1000. A secondary collimator separates the two beams by blocking one and positions another aperture for the other beam. The whole instrument operates in two different positions, one for high resolution and one for high speed. In the current configuration DINGO measured first radiography and tomography data sets on friendly user test samples...|$|E
40|$|The Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL) - {{located at}} BM 20 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France - is in {{operation}} since 1998. This 7 th report covers {{the period from}} January 2009 to December 2010. In these two years, 67 peer- reviewed papers have been published based on experiments done at the beamline, more than in any biannual period before. Six highlight reports have been selected for this report to demonstrate the scientific strength and diversity of the experiments performed on the two end-stations of the beamline, dedicated to Radiochemistry (RCH) and Materials Research (MRH). The beamtime was more heavily overbooked than ever before, with an acceptance rate of only 25 % experiments. We {{would like to thank}} our external proposal review members, Prof. Andre Maes (KU Leuven, Belgium), Prof. Laurent Charlet (UJF Grenoble, France), Dr. Andreas Leinweber (MPI Metallforschung, Stuttgart, Germany), Prof. David Rafaja (TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany), Prof. Dirk Meyer (TU Dresden, Germany), who evaluated the inhouse proposals in a thorough manner, thereby ensuring that beamtime was distributed according to scientific merit. The period was not only characterized by very successful science, but also by intense work on the optics upgrade. In spring 2009, a workshop was held at ROBL, assembling beamline experts from German, Spanish and Swiss synchrotrons, to evaluate the best setup for the new optics. These suggestions was used to prepare the call for tender published in July 2009. From the tender acceptance in November 2009 on, a series of design review meetings and factory acceptance tests followed. Already in July 2010, the first piece of equipment was delivered, the new double-crystal, double-multilayer monochromator. The disassembly of the old optics components started end of July, 2011, followed by the installation of the new components. As of December 2011, the new optics have seen the first test beam and thorough <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> will be continued until May 2012, since the ESRF shuts down for a major upgrade from December 2011 to April 2012. We expect that we will be ready for user operation from June 2012 on, with a better beamline than ever. The beamline staff would like to thank all partners, research groups and organizations who supported the beamline during the last 24 months. Special thanks to the FZD management, the CRG office of the ESRF with Axel Kaprolat as liaison officer and Eric Dettona as lead technician, and to the ESRF safety group members, Paul Berkvens, Patrick Colomp and Yann Pira...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the commercial application of an innovative plasma mass separator called the Archimedes Filter to a pre-treatment plant {{that can be}} integrated into the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Hanford and Savannah River Sites to significantly enhance the treatment of radioactive high-level waste. The output of the Archimedes Filter is completely compatible with existing waste immobilization processes such as vitrification and requires no new waste form to be developed. A full-geometric-scale Demonstration Filter Unit (DEMO) has been constructed and is undergoing initial testing at the Archimedes Technology Group Development Facilities in San Diego. Some of the technology and engineering development is being performed by other organizations in collaboration with Archimedes. The Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) is developing the plasma calcination technology and all of the associated systems for AFP feed preparation. Two Russian institutes are involved {{in the development of the}} ICP torch and injector system. The Remote System Group (UT-Battelle) at ORNL is developing the remote maintenance system for the filter units. Conceptual design of the Archimedes Filter Plant (AFP) is being developed concurrently with the DEMO testing program. The AFP mission is to significantly reduce the cost and accelerate the rate of vitrification of high-level waste by separating low activity waste from the sludge removed from underground storage tanks. Mass separation is accomplished by vaporizing the sludge feed and injecting it into a partially ionized, neutral plasma. In a single pass, heavy ions are deposited near the center of the filter and light mass ions are transported by the plasma to the ends of the cylindrically-shaped vacuum vessel. Responding to the DOE programs for cost reduction and cleanup acceleration, the AFP Project is planned on an expeditious schedule that executes all phases of the project with private sector funding. The initial AFP implementation is targeted for the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) at the Hanford Site. <b>Hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> is scheduled for late 2007 with design throughput and availability achieved by end of 2008. It is anticipated that AFP revenues will be based on a shared cost savings model, thus providing first revenues by late 2007. Preliminary safety studies have shown that AFP process hazards are similar to or less hazardous than those in a radio-chemical pre-treatment plant for high-level waste. Conservative criticality evaluations indicate very large margins from criticality. Development of a Preliminary Safety Analysis Report will begin in mid 2003 to support licensing activities. A detailed permitting plan has been developed which, when combined with other activities, support a start of construction in 2005...|$|E
50|$|P.2d 911 (1980) (allowing warrantless home arrest upon <b>hot</b> pursuit from <b>commission</b> of {{misdemeanor}} in the officer's presence). The approach {{taken in}} these cases should not be surprising. Indeed, without necessarily approving any of these particular holdings or considering every possible factual situation, we note {{that it is difficult}} to conceive of a warrantless home arrest that would not be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the underlying offense is extremely minor.|$|R
50|$|During the Reconstruction Era, several {{conflicting}} {{land claims}} reached the U.S. Congress {{and resulted in}} an April 24, 1876, Supreme Court ruling that the land title of Hot Springs belonged to the federal government. Protests ensued. To deal with the situation, Congress formed the <b>Hot</b> Springs <b>Commission</b> to lay out streets {{in the town of}} Hot Springs, deal with land claims, define property lines, condemn buildings illegally on the permanent reservation (now the national park) and define a process for claimants to purchase land. The commission surveyed and set aside 264.93 acre encompassing the hot springs and Hot Springs Mountain to be a permanent government reservation. Another 1200 acre became the Hot Springs townsite, with 700 acre awarded to claimants. The townsite consisted of 196 blocks and 50 mi of streets and alleys. The remaining portion of the original four sections of government land consisted of hills and mountains which were mostly unoccupied, and Congress acted on the commission's recommendation in June 1880 by adding those lands to the permanent reservation.|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of River Protection (ORP) {{manages the}} River Protection Project (RPP). The RPP {{mission is to}} {{retrieve}} and treat Hanford's tank waste and close the tank farms to protect the Columbia River. As a result, the ORP {{is responsible for the}} retrieval, treatment, and disposal of the approximately 57 million gallons of radioactive waste contained in the Hanford Site waste tanks and closure of all the tanks and associated facilities. The previous revision of the System Plan was issued in September 2003. ORP has approved a number of changes to the tank waste treatment strategy and plans since the last revision of this document, and additional changes are under consideration. The ORP has established contracts to implement this strategy to establish a basic capability to complete the overall mission. The current strategy for completion of the mission uses a number of interrelated activities. The ORP will reduce risk to the environment posed by tank wastes by: (1) Retrieving the waste from the single-shell tanks (SST) to double-shell tanks (DST) for treatment and disposal; (2) Constructing and operating the WTP, which will safely treat all of the high-level waste (HLW) and about half of the low-activity waste (LAW) contained in the tank farms, and maximizing its capability and capacity; (3) Developing and deploying supplemental treatment capability or a second WTP LAW Facility that can safely treat about half of the LAW contained in the tank farms; (4) Developing and deploying treatment and packaging capability for transuranic (TRU) tank waste for shipment to and disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP); (5) Deploying interim storage capacity for the immobilized HLW and shipping that waste to Yucca Mountain for disposal; (6) Operating the Integrated Disposal Facility for the disposal of immobilized LAW, along with the associated secondary waste, (7) Closing the SST and DST tank farms, ancillary facilities, and al 1 waste management and treatment facilities, (8) Developing and implementing technical solutions to mitigate the impact from substantial 1 y increased estimates of Na added during the pretreatment of the tank waste solids, This involves a combination of: (1) refining or modifying the flowsheet to reduce the required amount of additional sodium, (2) increasing the overall LAW vitrification capacity, (3) increasing the incorporation of sodium into the LAW glass, or (4) accepting an increase in mission duration, ORP has made and continues to make modifications to the WTP contract as needed to improve projected plant performance and address known or emerging risks, Key elements of the implementation of this strategy are included within the scope of the Tank Operations Contract, currently in procurement Since 2003, the ORP has conducted over 30 design oversight assessments of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). The estimated cost at completion has increased and the schedule for construction and commissioning of the WTP has extended, The DOE, Office of Environmental Management (EM), sanctioned a comprehensive review of the WTP flowsheet, focusing on throughput. In 2005, the TFC completed interim stabilization of the SSTs and as of March 2007, has completed the retrieval of seven selected SSTs. Demonstration of supplemental treatment technologies continues. The ongoing tank waste retrieval experience, progress with supplemental treatment technologies, and changes in WTP schedule led to the FY 2007 TFC baseline submittal in November 2006. The TFC baseline submittal was developed before the WTP schedule was fully understood and approved by ORP, and therefore reflects an earlier start date for the WTP facilities. This System Plan is aligned with the current WTP schedule with <b>hot</b> <b>commissioning</b> beginning in 2018 and full operations beginning in 2019. Major decisions regarding the use of supplemental treatment and the associated technology, the ultimate needed capacity, and its relationship to the WTP have not yet been finalized. This System Plan assumes that the outcome of this decision will be to provide a supplemental LAW treatment system using in-container vitrification (ICV{trademark}) as the enabling technology. No final implementation decisions regarding supplemental technology can be made until the Tank Closure and Waste Management Environmental Impact Statement is completed and a Record of Decision is issued by the DOE...|$|E

50|$|The Hale was {{constructed}} in 1892-93, replacing an earlier Hale bathhouse. The Hale was probably {{the first of the}} Hot Springs 19th-century bathhouses to offer modern conveniences to its bathers, and thus became more cosmopolitan in nature. The first Hale Bathhouse, built in 1841 by John C. Hale, was the first to provide more than just a bath as a service. Within twenty years there were at least three establishments in Hot Springs bearing Hale's name, although none of these appear to have been situated at the location of the present Hale. It is very likely that all the early structures were destroyed by raiders during the Civil War. Following the war, Hale rebuilt his bathhouse near the Alum Spring. John Hale died in 1875 and the bathhouse lease was sold or transferred by his heirs. After the <b>Hot</b> Springs <b>Commission</b> settled land claims in the area in 1879, William Nelson built a bathhouse adjacent to the existing Hale Bathhouse with the intent to replace it. The 1879 frame structure was razed in 1891 and a new building put up on the site the next year by principal owner Colonel Root. The building retains a considerable amount of its 19th-century character and probably has extensive historical archeological potential around its foundation.|$|R
