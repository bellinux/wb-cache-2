5|$|At home, staying {{informed}} about volcanic activity, and having contingency plans {{in place for}} alternative shelter locations, constitutes good preparedness for an ash fall event. This can prevent some impacts associated with ash fall, reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A <b>few</b> <b>items</b> such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Because Lazenby had {{informed}} the producers that On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was to be}} his only outing as Bond {{and because of the}} lack of gadgets used by Bond in the film, <b>few</b> <b>items</b> of merchandise were produced for the film, apart from the soundtrack album and a film edition of the book. Those that were produced included a number of Corgi Toys, including Tracey's Cougar, Campbell's Volkswagen and two versions of the bobsleigh—one with the 007 logo and one with the Piz Gloria logo. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was nominated for only one award: George Lazenby was nominated in the New Star of the Year – Actor category at the 1970 Golden Globe Award ceremony, losing out to Jon Voight.|$|E
5|$|Metroid: Other M is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to feature melee attacks. With well-timed button presses, players can use special techniques, such as the Sense Move, which allows them to dodge enemy attacks, and the Overblast, where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point-blank range. Unlike other Metroid games, enemies do not drop items, with the {{restoration}} of health and ammo occurring either by using the Navigation Booths, or employing of the Concentration technique, where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health. Players can also use the Navigation Booths to save their progress. While there are power-ups scattered around the Bottle Ship, a <b>few</b> <b>items</b> are already equipped by Samus, but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes her to do so. Players can find items that will augment Samus's abilities, such as Energy and Missile Tanks.|$|E

50|$|In both {{short-term}} memory and long-term memory Smith measured output interference in three age groups (aged 20-39, 40-59, 60-80 years). The results of recall performance revealed significant differences due to age where the older group recalled <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> than the middle group who recalled <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> than the youngest group. Overall Smith concluded that memory decline appears with increased age with long-term memory forgetting rather than {{short-term memory}} forgetting and short-term memory was unaffected by age. However output interference {{was unable to}} explain the memory deficit seen in older subject.|$|R

5|$|The {{basement}} {{contains the}} gunner's mess, canteen, No. 1 ancillary store, pantry and officer's kitchen. The canteen sold everyday necessities {{as well as}} a <b>few</b> <b>items</b> like biscuits, sweets and tobacco to the stationed troops. Profits from the canteen were used to fund sporting equipment for the garrison. The No.1 ancillary store was used for various pieces of delicate equipment, fuses, friction tubes and rockets. In 1887 an explosion in the room caused a number of injuries, damage to the store and to the above officer's quarters. The barracks room and officer's quarters are connected with a door, probably added in the 1930s as it {{is not part of the}} original plans. The barracks room accommodated approximately 20 men. For display purposes it is outfitted as for similar period barracks.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Pennington, {{a leading}} {{member of the}} {{territorial}} legislature, was able to secure the election of many anti-slavery delegates to the constitutional convention. Jennings was a delegate from Clark County. At the convention, held in June 1816 in the new territorial capital of Corydon, Jennings {{was elected president of}} the assembly, which permitted him to appoint the convention's committee chairmen. Although the delegates drafted a new constitution for Indiana, the majority of the content was copied from other state constitutions, most notably Ohio and Kentucky. A <b>few</b> <b>items</b> were new and unique to Indiana. Slavery, which was already prohibited in territorial legislation, was banned in the Indiana constitution; however, contracts for indentured servants, if they were already in existence, were preserved. The new state government, divided into legislative, executive, and judicial branches, gave the governor limited powers and concentrated authority {{in the hands of the}} Indiana General Assembly and county officials. Shortly after the convention, Jennings publicly announced his candidacy for governor.|$|E
5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a <b>few</b> <b>items</b> were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{grouping}} items into categories were assessed for three methods of selection: 1) selecting a toolbar item with a mouse (Toolbar method); 2) selecting a menu item with a mouse (Menu method); and 3) selecting a menu item with a keyboard shortcut (Keyboard method). Users performed {{one of the}} three methods across 270 trials and had their speeds assessed in blocks of 30 trials. For each method, half the us-ers selected items from a single menu or toolbar while the other half selected items from two menus or toolbars. Overall, the Keyboard method was the fastest, followed by the Toolbar method. When two menus or toolbars were used, users reported making category decisions regardless of the method used. With the Menu method, category decisions did not slow performance because they were offset by faster item selec-tion due to <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> in each menu when two menus were used. With the Toolbar method, the effect of <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> in each toolbar when two toolbars were used was less pronounced. With the Keyboard method, there was no effect of <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> in each menu because users recalled the keyboard shortcuts without looking at the menu items. These findings, coupled with past research that proficient use of the Keyboard method requires more trials than the other methods, confirm the use of toolbars for infrequently-used inter-faces and keyboard shortcuts for frequently-used interfaces...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} contribution of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the attentional resources in episodic encoding for both verbal and non-verbal material. Paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) were used to interfere transiently with either the left or right DLPFC during encoding under full attention (FA) or under divided attention (DA) in a recognition paradigm using words and random shapes. Participants recognized <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> after TMS over the left DLPFC than over the right DLPFC during FA encoding. However, TMS over the left DLPFC did not impair performance when compared to sham condition. Conversely, participants produced <b>fewer</b> <b>items</b> after TMS over the right DLPFC in DA encoding compared to sham condition, but not compared to TMS over the left DLPFC. These effects were found for both words and random shapes. These results suggest that the right DLPFC {{play an important role in}} successful encoding with a concomitant task regardless of the type of material...|$|R
