500|$|The ninth season {{received}} more positive reviews, Rob Salem of Toronto Star called it [...] "a solid return to form." [...] Brad Williams writing for What Culture praised the show's development over the season saying, [...] "Grey's Anatomy has {{developed into a}} fine example of how a TV show can mature beyond its initial purpose." [...] calling it [...] "something almost anyone can watch and enjoy." [...] Praising the friendship between Cristina and Meredith of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "There's still one good reason to keep watching: Where <b>else</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> find such deep friendships between female co-workers". The tenth season was also marked with praise, Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "There's true sorrow here along with the passion, which keeps their dynamic so intriguing to me." [...] Caroline Siede from The A.V. Club wrote in her review for the 10th season [...] "At its best, Grey's Anatomy is about everyday bravery, sacrifice, and courage. At its worst, it's a melodramatic, moralizing soap opera. Both sides are on display as the show heads confidently into its 10th season." [...] Many sources, including Rachel Simon of Bustle and Nicole Pomarico of Wetpaint, claimed that Sandra Oh's performance during her final season on Grey's Anatomy is worthy of an Emmy nomination.|$|E
