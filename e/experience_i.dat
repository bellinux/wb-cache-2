25|$|My first {{experience}} shooting {{was with my}} older brother when I was 14. He also liked guns and took me shooting with friends and family. We would {{have a great time}} setting up and shooting targets with an assortment of firearms.

25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal <b>experience,</b> <b>I</b> will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E

500|$|Rowling's {{favourite}} {{aspect of}} this book was introducing the character Remus Lupin, Rowling additionally said in 2004 that Prisoner of Azkaban was [...] "the best writing <b>experience</b> <b>I</b> ever had...I was in a very comfortable place writing (number) three.

500|$|The {{manner in}} which Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} received mixed reviews. Adams compared Colbert's cameo to former lead actor Steve Carell's appearance in the first series of the BBC Two sitcom Life's Too Short, calling it [...] "an unfortunate echo". White wrote that his cameo was not [...] "quite the sublime <b>experience</b> <b>I</b> was hoping for" [...] {{largely due to the}} amount of anticipation that was put into his appearance. Kratzer called the underuse of Colbert [...] "borderline criminal".|$|E
500|$|On the {{day that}} Pinfold was published, Waugh was persuaded to attend a Foyle's Literary Luncheon, {{as a means of}} {{promoting}} the book. He informed his audience that [...] "Three years ago, I had quite a new <b>experience.</b> <b>I</b> went off my head for about three weeks". To further stimulate sales the dust-jacket also emphasised Waugh's experiences of madness, which brought him a large correspondence from strangers anxious to relate their own parallel experiences—"the voices... of the persecuted, turning to him as confessor".|$|E
5000|$|... "My {{decision}} was not motivated only by expedience. I was aesthetically pleased and genuinely moved {{by some of}} the rituals I attended, {{and as a result of}} these <b>experiences,</b> <b>I</b> changed in significant ways. Because I decided to remain open and vulnerable during rituals, I gained access to imaginative <b>experiences</b> <b>I</b> had banished from my consciousness since reaching adulthood. These were crucial in helping me understand the essence of the culture I was studying; had I not had them, I would have failed to grasp the importance of religious ecstasy in the Neo-Pagan experience."

40|$|Since BOBCATSSS-Symposia {{usually have}} an open minded atmosphere, they present a very good {{opportunity}} for an open and undogmatic discussion about the challenges of librarianship and information science. This article deals with <b>experiences</b> <b>I</b> made when I visited several workshops and panels dealing with the topics “Information Literacy in the Digital Age” and “Web 2. 0 Applications for Libraries”.

It may seem hard to believe such a thing could happen and not be noticed, but from my own <b>experience</b> <b>I</b> {{understand}} it. The men in the turret often stopped their ears, and perhaps their eyes, {{at the moment of}} firing, and then instantly worked the run-in levers, and did not notice how much the guns had recoiled. This no doubt occurred. Both guns were at once reloaded, and the rammer's indicator, working by machinery, set fast and failed to show how far the new charge had gone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Love Club" [...] is a electropop song. It {{addresses}} the befriending of [...] "a bad crowd." [...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} <b>experience</b> <b>I</b> had {{about a year ago}} where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation.

500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the <b>experience</b> <b>I</b> had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E
500|$|Manning {{was always}} a close {{observer}} of life, and gifted with a photographic memory. She told her friend Kay Dick that [...] "I write out of <b>experience,</b> <b>I</b> have no fantasy. I don't think anything I've experienced has ever been wasted. However, her 1974 novel The Rain Forest showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants. Set in 1953, the novel's central characters are a British couple; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies {{against the background of}} a violent end to colonial British rule. The book is one of Manning's lesser-known books, and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the Booker prize.|$|E
500|$|The {{departure}} {{and split}} with the Maharishi was well-publicised. In Delhi, Lennon and Harrison told the reporters {{that they had}} urgent business in London {{and they did not}} want to appear in the Maharishi's film. Back in the UK the band members said that they were disillusioned by the Maharishi's desire for financial gain. McCartney said that [...] "Rishikesh was a good <b>experience.</b> <b>I</b> enjoyed it". Lennon said on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, [...] "We believe in meditation, but not the Maharishi and his scene", and, [...] "We made a mistake. He's human like the rest of us".

500|$|To {{prepare for}} her role, Moore visited strip clubs in New York City, California, and Florida, and {{she met with}} strippers. Moore really did dance topless in the part, {{and this was the}} sixth time she showed her breasts on film. She also read the novel, exercised, and practiced yoga. Moore was cast before other {{important}} parts were cast, creating some interest in the project. In the first attempt at filming Moore stripping, two hundred actors were used to portray the audience. Although their salaries were small, many accepted the role to see Moore nude. After waiting for a while, when Moore finally appeared and started dancing the crowd turned so loud and wild that the shooting had to temporarily cease. As Moore said, [...] "After my <b>experience,</b> <b>I</b> felt very confident." ...|$|E

[...] Four singles were released from the album: the title track [...] "All I Want Is You", [...] "Sure Thing", [...] "Quickie", and [...] "Girls Like You".
