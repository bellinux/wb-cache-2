Sleepiness is manifested as a desire to nap, unintended dozing, impaired mental acuity, irritability, reduced performance, and accident proneness. Shift work is often combined with extended hours of duty, so fatigue can be a compounding factor.

40|$|An {{increased}} risk for coronary heart disease among shift workers is earlier shown in the epidemiological literature. The aim of this thesis has been to penetrate metabolic disturbances and obesity among shift workers compared to day workers, and to compare if {{there are differences in}} total mortality or cause specific mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes or ischaemic stroke in between the two groups. In an intervention study on female nurses (N= 11), on night schedules in Umeå hospital, the highest peak value of glucose and insulin after meal ingestion was seen in the late evening (23 : 30). The post-prandial area under curve (AUC) of glucose and insulin was correspondingly largest after meal ingestion the same clock hour compared to meal ingestion other clock times. In two different cross-sectional studies Västerbotten Inventory Study (VIP) (N= 27, 485) and in a subset of Work, Lipids and Fibrinogen Study (WOLF) (N= 1, 324) metabolic differences in between shift and day workers has been evaluated. In both studies have obesity, high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol been more prevalent among the shift-working group compared to the day-working group. After adjustments for age and socio-economic factors in the VIP-study obesity and high triglycerides remained as risk factors in shift workers in both men and women. After directly age standardisation, a clustering effect, simultaneously, of two or more metabolic risk factors (obesity, hypertension, and high triglycerides) was seen in both genders among the shift workers compared to the day workers. Correspondingly, in the Wolf study low HDL-cholesterol and high triglycerides remained as significant risk factors after adjustments of confounders as age, socio-economic group, physical activity, current smoking, low social support and high job strain. In a cohort study from one company (MoDo) with two plants in the pulp and paper industry 2, 354 male shift workers and 3, 088 male day workers were followed from January 1, 1952 to December 31, 2001 regarding total and cause specific mortality due to CHD, diabetes and ischaemic stroke. Groups of workers defined by different <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> exposure were compared with day workers by calculating standardised relative rates (SRR). No {{increased risk}} of total mortality was seen among shift workers compared to day workers.

However, its association with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate this association in two cohorts of US women. Methods and Findings: We followed 69, 269 women aged 42 – 67 in Nurses ’ Health Study I (NHS I, 1988 – 2008), and 107, 915 women aged 25 – 42 in NHS II (1989 – 2007) without diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at baseline. Participants were asked how long they had worked rotating night shifts (defined as at least three nights/month in addition to days and evenings in that month) at baseline. This information was updated every 2 – 4 years in NHS II. Self-reported type 2 diabetes was confirmed by a validated supplementary questionnaire.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} shift work and death from ischaemic heart disease (IHD). METHODS: A nested case-control approach was used. The cohort comprised male manual workers who joined an industrial company aged 50 years or under between 1 January 1950 and 31 December 1992 and worked there {{for at least one}} month. Cases were 467 cohort members who died during the same period aged 75 years or under, with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (international classification of diseases (ICD) 410 - 414) coded from the death certificate. For each case a control worker was chosen, who joined the company at the same age and in the same period but who survived the case. Work status (shift work or day work) was assigned to cases for their entire employment and to controls for that part of their employment which preceded the matching case's death. The main source of information was historical personnel records containing pay codes which differed for day work and shift work. Information on weight, height, blood pressure, and smoking from a pre-employment medical was available. RESULTS: Two thirds of subjects had been employed for at least one month as shift workers and there was evidence that they had slightly better health at recruitment than day workers. The odds ratio for shift workers during the period starting 10 years after shift work began, and after adjustment for height, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking, duration of employment, and job status (skilled or unskilled) was 0. 90 (90 % confidence interval (90 % CI) : 0. 68 - 1. 21). There was no relation between risk of IHD death, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> work, but there was evidence of a reduced risk when actively employed as a shift worker, together with an increased risk in the first five years after leaving shift work to do day work. CONCLUSIONS: Shift work did not increase the risk of death from ischaemic heart disease in this study. Those workers with poorer cardiovascular health may be under represented in groups with longer shift work experience because of health related selection out of shift work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nowadays, {{hierarchical}} organizational structure, {{which has}} been created and dominated in 20 th century, still remain widely used. The success of hierarchy in organizations {{in a period of}} time from 1960 to 2000 had been justified by such factors as: the relatively steady environment and preference of transparency and predictability over flexibility. However, in 21 th century the business environment changed, therefore, the relevance of hierarchy becomes questionable. The given study provides a comparison between the hierarchical organizational structure and a modern holacratic structure. The research problem for this study is the lack of scientific and empirical data on how organizations can embrace the change in its structure and increase its vitality and adaptivity. The purpose of the current master’s thesis is to resolve the stated problem by investigating the organizational change of US-based company Zappos that was established in 1999 as a pioneer of online retail company and became a large corporation 10 years later. Following the process of expanding in 2013, the company switched from hierarchical organizational structure to the holacratic. The study is divided into three historical embedded cases in order to evaluate the reasons and outcomes of the organizational change. According to the research findings, the premises of Zappos organizational change was exceptional culture, orientation on long-term perspective and the influence of CEO visionary leadership. Additionally, the outcome of this study indicated that for large organizations that have hierarchical organizational structure the transformation to holacratic structure is too risky due to the complexity and long <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifting</b> process.

As such, attention has been placed on trying to identify good and bad features <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> systems, with a view to minimising the possible ill health as a consequence of shiftwork. The present study focuses on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shift</b> and looks at the implications for individual health, wellbeing, and alertness during the <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> extending the <b>shift</b> from the traditional eight hours to 12.

This thesis studies the systematic shifts in stream flow that have been observed in urban, suburban and agricultural watersheds {{in and around the}} Greater Chicago area. A novel statistical method, the Procedure for Change Pattern and Signi ficance (PCPS), is developed to detect non-stationarity and identify the timing and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> these <b>shifts</b> in hydrologic records. This method uses the rank correlations of the Mann-Kendall statistics to extract information that can be interpreted to identify the timing and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> a detected <b>shift,</b> while it also adopts the Mann-Kendall test to determine whether the change is statistically signi ficant. It is also shown that incorporating the aspects <b>of</b> timing, <b>duration</b> and signi ficance in a consistent analytical framework enables the issue of serial correlation to be tackled better. The proposed statistical framework is associated with conceptual modeling tools to understand how adaptive human responses to urbanization mitigate and sometimes even o ffset the e ffects of land-use change in a large urban area, such as the Greater Chicago area. Results of PCPS, along with an analysis of the recession process, show that while impervious surfaces increase flooding, stormwater management facilities mitigate or even counter this impact over a wide range of scales. On the other hand, an urban water balance shows that low flows have increased since the impacts of e ffluent discharges, pipe leakage and garden irrigation from municipal water systems using water from Lake Michigan outweigh the reduction of basefl ow due to impervious surfaces. In addition, the increasing trend of the mean flow in the area {{can be explained by the}} combined impacts of water withdrawals from Lake Michigan, land-use change and climatic variability. Finally, it is found that a step increase in rainfall coincides with a step increases in streamfl ow around 1970. Thus, PCPS detects the impacts of climate and urbanization on stream flow throughout the Greater Chicago area...|$|R

Patient characteristics were: females 50 percent; mean age, 46 +/- 12 yrs; prior medication use [...] benzodiazepines, 47 percent, antidepressants, 23 percent; median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> use 104 +/- 96 wks; median daily dose, 0. 5 mg; continued effectiveness of alprazolam 50 percent. Over the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> use patients <b>shifted</b> their initial pattern of use from as prescribed to a self-controlled 2 ̆ 2 as required 2 ̆ 2 basis (p less than. 05). Interviews using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) yielded diagnoses of DSM-III-R alprazolam dependence in all patients plus at least one additional psychiatric diagnosis in 65 percent (Axis I 65...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} stratospheric {{radiative}} damping time scales on stratospheric variability and on stratosphere–troposphere coupling is investigated in a simplified global circulation model by modifying the vertical profile of radiative damping {{in the stratosphere}} while holding it fixed in the troposphere. Perpetual-January conditions are imposed, with sinusoidal topography of zonal wavenumber 1 or 2. The depth and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the simulated sudden stratospheric warmings closely track the lower-stratospheric radiative time scales. Simulations with the most realistic profiles of radiative damping exhibit extended time-scale recoveries analogous to polar-night jet oscillation (PJO) events, which are observed to follow sufficiently deep stratospheric warmings. These events are characterized by weak lower-stratospheric winds and enhanced stability near the tropopause, which persist for up to 3 months following the initial warming. They are obtained with both wave- 1 and wave- 2 topography. Planetary-scale Eliassen–Palm (EP) fluxes entering the vortex are also suppressed, which is in agreement with observed PJO events. Consistent with previous studies, the tropospheric jets shift equatorward {{in response to the}} warmings. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shift</b> is closely correlated with the period of enhanced stability. The magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>shift</b> in these runs, however, is sensitive only to the zonal wavenumber of the topography. Although the shift is sustained primarily by synoptic-scale eddies, the net effect of the topographic form drag and the planetary-scale fluxes is not negligible; they damp the surface wind response but enhance the vertical shear. The tropospheric response may also reduce the generation of planetary waves, further extending the stratospheric dynamical time scales...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} the mechanisms <b>of</b> Holter ST <b>shift</b> {{in patients with}} acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis. DESIGN [...] Prospective observational study. SETTING [...] A London district general hospital. SUBJECTS [...] The study group consisted of 94 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated by thrombolysis. INTERVENTIONS [...] All underwent early 48 hour Holter ST monitoring and elective coronary arteriography. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Relation <b>of</b> Holter ST <b>shift</b> to multivessel coronary disease, coronary patency, collateralisation, and morphology of the infarct related lesion. RESULTS [...] There was a trend towards an increased prevalence <b>of</b> Holter ST <b>shift</b> in patients with patency of the infarct related artery and those with multivessel disease. This was only significant in patients with three vessel disease, a significantly higher proportion of whom had > 3 episodes <b>of</b> ST <b>shift</b> (41 % v 14 %; p = 0. 02) or a total <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> ST <b>shift</b> > 1 hour (35 % v 13 %; p = 0. 04) than those with less extensive coronary disease. Holter ST shift occurred in a significantly higher proportion of patients with complex lesion morphology (Ambrose type 2 or 3) compared with those with lesions of Ambrose morphology type 1 or 2 (60 % v 33 %; p = 0. 05). CONCLUSION [...] Holter ST shift detected early after thrombolysis is an ischaemic phenomenon with a complex pathophysiology. It reflects both remote ischaemia in patients with multivessel disease, and dynamic ischaemic processes related to complex lesion morphology in those with a patent infarct related artery...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: While {{some studies}} have {{suggested}} associations between shift work and obesity, few have been population-based or considered multiple shift schedules. Since obesity is linked with several chronic health conditions, understanding which types <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> work influence obesity is important and additional work with more detailed exposure assessment <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> work is warranted. Methods: Using multivariate polytomous logistic regression, we investigated the associations between shift work (evening/night, rotating and other shift schedules) and overweight and obesity as measured by body mass index cross-sectionally among 1561 men. These men had previously participated as population controls in a prostate cancer case-control study conducted in northeastern Ontario from 1995 to 1999. We obtained information on work history (including shift work), height and weight from the existing self-reported questionnaire data. Results: We observed an association for ever (vs. never) having been employed in rotating shift work for both the overweight (OR [odds ratio] = 1. 34; 95 % CI [confidence interval]: 1. 05 – 1. 73) and obese (OR = 1. 57; 95 % CI: 1. 12 – 2. 21) groups. We also observed nonsignificant associations for ever (vs. never) having been employed in permanent evening/night shifts. In addition, we found a significant trend of increased risk for both overweight and obesity with increasing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> rotating <b>shift</b> work. Conclusion: Both the positive association between rotating shift work and obesity and the suggested positive association for permanent evening/night shift work {{in this study are}} consistent with previous findings. Future population-based research that is able to build on our results while examining additional shift work characteristics will further clarify whether some shift patterns have a greater impact on obesity than others...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{evidence}} that connects drought and desertification in the Sahel with climate change past, present and future. Advances in climate modeling point to the oceans, not land, {{as the cause of}} the recent persistence of drought in the Sahel. The current generation of global climate models reproduces the spatial extent, continental in scale, and the timing and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shift</b> to dry conditions that occurred in the late 1960 ¿s given knowledge of observed surface oceanic conditions only. The pattern statistically and dynamically associated with drought is one of warming of the tropical oceans, especially the Pacific and Indian Oceans, superimposed on an enhanced warming of the southern compared to the northern hemisphere most evident in the Atlantic. These models, which include a prognostic description of land surface and/or vegetation, albeit crude, indicate that positive feedbacks between precipitation and land surface/cover may act to amplify the ocean-forced component of continental climate. Despite the advances made in understanding the recent past, uncertainty dominates as we move forward in time, to the present, partial greening of the Sahel, and to the future of climate change projections.

40|$|Exploration of {{the visual}} world {{requires}} almost incessant movements {{of the visual}} axis (gaze), which are separated by periods of fixation. This thesis describes the neural control of fixation and saccadic gaze displacements. The superior colliculus (SC) is a mid-brain structure involved in gaze redirection executed either by the eyes alone or by combined eye and head movements. Microstimulation of the cat SC revealed a map <b>of</b> evoked gaze <b>shifts,</b> which was coextensive with the motor map encoded by the neuronal activity. The spatio-temporal characteristics of these evoked gaze shifts depended, to some extent, on stimulus parameters or active fixation. A definite role in fixation behavior for the fixation cells situated at the SC's rostral pole was revealed by showing that microstimulation of this area suppresses both electrically-evoked and natural gaze shifts. A pathway mediating this gaze shift suppression was demonstrated by physiological evidence that the SC's "fixation area" provides the major collicular input to brainstem omnipause neurons (OPNs), which inhibit the saccadic premotor elements. In the head-restrained animal, OPNs exhibit a pause in activity related to eye saccades. It was shown here that, in the head-unrestrained cat, OPNs pause not for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> rapid orienting eye movements, but for the entire <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> gaze <b>shifts</b> irrespective <b>of</b> {{the shape of the}} trajectory of the eye in the orbit. However, recording the OPNs during SC stimulation indicated that the pause is not directly related to the SC command, but to the movement overtly produced: either head-fixed eye saccades or head-free gaze shifts. We suggest that OPNs are controlled by two systems acting synergistically: a brainstem mechanism involved in quick phase generation and a collicular gaze saccade generator...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{investigation}} of repetitive utterances in a Swedish database of spontaneous computer-directed speech. A spoken dialogue system was installed in a public location in downtown Stockholm and spontaneous human-computer interactions with adults and children were recorded [1]. Several acoustic and prosodic features such as <b>duration,</b> <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> focus and hyperarticulation were examined to see whether repetitions could be distinguished from what the users first said to the system. The present study indicates that adults and children use partly different strategies {{as they attempt to}} resolve errors by means of repetition. As repetition occurs, duration is increased and words are often hyperarticulated or contrastively focused. These results could have implications for the development of future spoken dialogue systems with robust error handling. 1...|$|R
