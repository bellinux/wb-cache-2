The four oldest and in history most influential parties are the Conservative People's Party, the Social Democrats, Venstre ("Left", a conservative-liberal party) and the Danish Social Liberal Party. However, demographics have been in favour of younger parties (such as the nationalist far-right Danish People's Party and the far-left Red-Green Alliance), {{which has led to}} a constant process of policy development and <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> amongst the political parties.|$|E
50|$|The {{twentieth century}} was period of immense {{upheaval}} and conflict, {{but also a}} <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> of Lao literature. Both French and Thai nationalist policies aggressively sought to assimilate the Lao during the 1920s-1940s.

Politics split Lao society and Lao literature, while the Royal Lao Government struggled to establish itself from 1954-1975.|$|E
40|$|New {{observations}} of physical, biological, and chemical parameters were obtained between July 2003 and February 2005 in Nitinat Lake, British Columbia, a permanently anoxic seawater fjord. These observations include continuous profiles of nitrate and bisulfide {{using a new}} instrument for in situ ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Anoxic seawaters in this 200 -m–deep basin can be found as shallow as 7 m. However, Nitinat Lake is surprisingly dynamic, with a deep-water renewal time of only about 5 yr and significant spatial and temporal variability. Exchange with the ocean {{is limited by the}} size of the linking channel, and during low tides the outflow is subject to an hydraulic control. This nonlinearity causes a relatively large fortnightly cycle in water level and explains flooding events associated with heavy rainstorms. In addition, the restricted flow makes deep-water <b>renewal</b> <b>gradual</b> so that anoxic conditions are preserved. Intermediate waters (5 – 40 m in depth) are renewed alternately by oxygenation from surface mixing in winter and by upwelling of anoxic water and horizontal inflow of subducted ocean water in summer. The horizontal inflow results in a subsurface region of suboxic water in mid-fjord during summer. No suboxic regime is evident at either the river end of Nitinat Lake (where oxygen and sulfide–rich regions adjoin in a nitrate-depleted water column) or at the ocean end of Nitinat Lake (where oxygen and nitrate–rich regions sometimes overlap with sulfide-rich regions).

60|$|Whatever may be {{the term}} most {{eligible}} {{for the duration of}} the mandate, it might seem natural that the individual member should vacate his seat at the expiration of that term from the day of his election, and that there should be no general renewal of the whole House. A great deal might be said for this system if there were any practical object in recommending it. But it is condemned by much stronger reasons than can be alleged in its support. One is, that there would be no means of promptly getting rid of a majority which had pursued a course offensive to the nation. The certainty of a general election after a limited, which would often be a nearly expired period, and the possibility of it at any time when the minister either desires it for his own sake, or thinks that it would make him popular with the country, tend to prevent that wide divergence between the feelings of the assembly and those of the constituency, which might subsist indefinitely if the majority of the House had always several years of their term still to run--if it received new infusions drop by drop, which would be more likely to assume than to modify the qualities of the mass they were joined to. It is as essential that the general sense of the House should accord in the main with that of the nation as is that distinguished individuals should be able, without forfeiting their seats, to give free utterance to the most unpopular sentiments. There is another reason, of much weight, against the <b>gradual</b> and partial <b>renewal</b> of a representative assembly. It is useful that there should be a periodical general muster of opposing forces to gauge the state of the national mind, and ascertain, beyond dispute, the relative strength of different parties and opinions. This is not done conclusively by any partial renewal, even where, as in some of the French constitutions, a large fraction--a fifth or a third--go out at once.|$|R

40|$|Nowdays, {{the renewal}} of water supply {{infrastructure}} is becoming increasingly hot topic. <b>Gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> {{is one of the}} key points for long-term maintenance of quality and trouble-free operation. The most basic element of the entire water supply system are water resources, which shouldn't be neglected during the planning of a renewal. This thesis deals with technical construction of drinking water resources and it is mainly focused on ground-water resources. The main part of the thesis is the design of a technical assessment system for underground drinking water resources for public water supply. The purpose of such system is to create a tool for technical assessment that will identify current technical status of multiple water resources and will compare them.

40|$|This Bachelor's Thesis {{is focused}} on {{cultural}} monuments of Liberec Region, specifically on category of chateaus, castles and ruined castles which are accessible to public. Aim of this thesis {{is to find out}} the number of the objects which were newly made accessible from 1989 to 2011, and to find out if there is some kind of trend in this process. Result of the analysis of all objects accessible to public is a group of six diverse cultural monuments, which were firstly made accessible to public after 1989. The process of making accessible is perceived as introducing the opening hours and the admission for the visit, and the establishment of an exposition or a tour through interiors. A trend {{can be seen in the}} number of objects (four of six) that were opened to public by the municipalities. State-owned castle and chateau Grabštejn is shown here as an example of best practice of <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> and the involvement of non-governmental non-profit sector...|$|E
30|$|Questioned on this subject, an Alikan {{shepherd}} simply {{answered that}} the modern tents, whether umbrella tents or in nylon, were not the nomads' tents. This is why the mosaic tents that keep {{the spirit of the}} traditional nomadic tent (enabling a partial and <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> of the vellum without obliging the owner to invest in a new tent) and maintain the identity role are preferred by the Alikan tribe than the cotton or nylon tents even if they do not practice nomadism stricto sensu anymore. Indeed, it should be known that for the past few years, there have been several cases of definitive settlement by Alikan families in the city of Van. Those families have not abandoned sheep breeding, but now practice a local transhumance in a form of seminomadism, meeting every summer on the mountain pastures situated on the heights of Lake Van. Some of these families separate from their sheep every winter by selling them and buy new flocks in the spring to produce lambs and cheese.|$|E
40|$|Community {{assembly}} is studied using individual-based multispecies models. The {{models have}} stochastic population dynamics with mutation, migration, and extinction of species. Mutants {{appear as a}} result of mutation of the resident species, while migrants have no correlation with the resident species. It is found that the dynamics of community assembly with mutations are quite different from the case with migrations. In contrast to mutation models, which show intermittent dynamics of quasi-steady states interrupted by sudden reorganizations of the community, migration models show smooth and <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> of the community. As a consequence, instead of the $ 1 /f$ diversity fluctuations found for the mutation models, $ 1 /f^ 2 $, random-walk like fluctuations are observed for the migration models. In addition, a characteristic species-lifetime distribution is found: a power law that is cut off by a "skewed" distribution in the long-lifetime regime. The latter has a longer tail than a simple exponential function, which indicates an age-dependent species-mortality function. Since this characteristic profile has been observed, both in fossil data and in several other mathematical models, we conclude that it is a universal feature of macroevolution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract During the Plio-Pleistocene, sharp {{important}} {{changes in the}} large mammal assemblages of the Italian Peninsula are not clearly recognizable. Sometimes, a progressive and <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> can be observed, either due to local evolution of pre-existing forms or by recurrent immigrations from Asia or Central Europe. The renewal phases are probably related to climatic fluctuations. An acceleration of this phenomenon may be noticed in concurrence to the major climatic crises. Under these conditions, and {{taking into account that}} the response of single taxa to climatic and environmental variations is neither uniform nor contemporary, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to fix a limit between two faunal units. In the case of the "Villafranchian"/"Galerian" faunal transition in Italy, {{there are at least three}} possible hypotheses: a) the transition can be considered to have happened more or less at the lower Pleistocene/Middle Pleistocene boundary: b) institution of the new Mammal Age, the Protogalerian, which covers the Early Pleistocene before the Great Glacial. It is characterized by the progressive appearance of "Galerian" taxa and by persistence of the arvicolids of the Microtus (Allophaiomys) subgenus: c) the transition between Villafranchian and Galerian faunas can be established conventionally e. g. at the first appearence in Italy of Megaceroides verticornis...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the study of}} the {{influence}} of subcutaneous transplantation of cryoconservated placenta on the experimental acute aseptic inflammation of rat testes was carried. The research was carried on 65 Vistar male rats. The experimental aseptic inflammation was caused by intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg -caraginen (“Sigma Co”) in 1 ml 0, 9 % solution of sodium chloride. The transplantation of cryoconservated placenta by a single subcutaneous injection was made. Testes were taken in 6, 12, 24 hours and on 2 nd, 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 10 th day after beginning of aseptic inflammation and after placenta injection. Thin sections were stained by metilen blue. It was determined that on 7 th day after the beginning of experiment the phenomenon of edema of connective tissue diminished. The blood supply at the microcirculatory level was renewed on 7 - 10 th day of experiment. The destruction, desqumation, discomplexation of spermatogonia, spermatocytes I and II, spermatids have dimin-ished also by this term. On a 10 th day the <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> of cellular layers and wholeness of basal parts of epithelium of seminiferous tubules was determined. Thus, after injection of placenta there is renewal of cellular composition of spermato-genic epithelium in testes with aseptic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of ventilation timescales and radiocarbon (14 C) uptake to subgrid-scale mixing parameterization is studied {{in a global}} ocean model. Seven experiments are examined that are identical in every manner except their representation of subgrid-scale mixing of tracers. The cases include (i) two runs with traditional Cartesian mixing (HOR), (ii) a run with enhanced isopycnal mixing (ISO), and (iii) four runs in which the effects of eddies on the mean ocean flow are parameterized following Gent and McWilliams (GM). Horizontal, isopycnal, and isopycnal-thickness diffusion coefficients are varied sequentially in the model runs. Of particular interest {{is the role of}} the tracer mixing schemes in influencing longer timescale ventilation processes—centennial and beyond—such as deep water mass renewal and circulation. Simulated ventilation timescales and 14 C vary greatly between the three mixing schemes. The isopycnal mixing run exhibits the most rapid water mass renewal due to strong diffusion effects and excessive surface convective overturn, particularly in the Southern Ocean. In contrast, the GM cases show much more <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> of deep and bottom waters, with limited vertical convection of surface waters and slower abyssal currents. Under GM, a background horizontal diffusion or altered isopycnal mixing do not significantly change interior ocean ventilation rates. This means modelers can adjust these background diffusion coefficients under GM (for numerica...|$|E
40|$|Michail Ščepkin {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} representatives of early nineteenth-century Russian theatre. After his debut as a serf actor on the provincial stage, Ščepkin achieved his greatest successes in Moscow in the 1930 s and 1940 s, when the Higher Theatre School was consolidating the progressive idea of educational theatre and forming a new generation of critics, more attentive to and aware of the importance of actors. Ščepkin had stimulating relationships with intellectuals and artists like Granovsky and Gogol', and participated in the <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> of the Russian scene in the name of greater realism. Contemporary critics and later historians have insisted on the ‘naturalness’ and ‘simplicity’ of Ščepkin. However, despite an evident anti-classicist tendency, his style clearly reveals a search for the ‘perfect truth’ for a combination of realism and formal precision. Thus the peculiarity of Ščepkin’s acting lies not in its realistic inclinations, a tendency which was already prominent in Russia, but rather in the definition of the character. Ščepkin implemented a strong portrayal of the character, emotionally saturating it and imbuing it with strong passions. At the same time he gave his characters a psychological complexity that impressed the audience and the critics, even when performing low-level repertoire. This was the case of the Mariner, a banal melodramatic vaudeville that Ščepkin turned into a mere masterpiece thanks to skilful silent scenes and subtle interpretative nuances. The psychological analysis of the role appears therefore as a fundamental element of Ščepkin’s acting technique...|$|E

40|$|The Thesis is a {{retrospective}} examination of housing action consequences and effectiveness in the Bishop Auckland Area, {{by the author}} who was involved with the initiation and execution of repair, improvement, closure and demolition of houses in the private sector, carried out {{within the framework of}} Durham County Council's controversial Settlement Policy. The local, post-war, housing policy revolved around cherished concepts, that a Development Plan would lead to the "Good Life"; slum clearance processes were designed to protect people from themselves; and relocating residents from outdated villages to modern semi-detached estates heralded a new beginning. The irony of a working class political machine, over which the population had virtually no influence, imposing a policy which destroyed working class life styles is noted, together with the creation of a bitter and inflexible climate which nurtured an unintended but resolute opposition and resulted in a change of political control at local level. Focus is on Witton Park, the devastated archetype Category 'D' village, a victim of prejudice and time seemingly forever to bear a slum label as a shrine to the County Development Plan. A comparison is made with the villages of Binchester, Escomb and Eldon Lane/Coundon Grange also affected by renewal policies. It is contended that undue attention was paid by bureaucracy to a distorted image of slum housing which resulted in extensive and excessive demolition with consequential individual and collective injustice; and that an almost exclusive over emphasis on physical aspects destroyed the territorial basis of community life, and ignored people and their aspirations. Direction altered, belatedly, in the late 1960 s after nearly 2, 300 houses had been demolished. The newer policy of <b>gradual</b> <b>renewal</b> rather than total clearance was influenced by political change, more enlightened attitudes and the availability of wider powers.
