5000|$|The memory-based Yule-Simon (MBYS) {{model of}} Cattuto {{attempted}} to explain tag choices by a stochastic process. They {{found that the}} temporal order of tag assignment influences users' tag choices. Similar to the stochastic urn model, the MBYS model assumed that at each time step a tag would be randomly sampled: with probability p the sampled tag was new, and with probability 1-p the sampled tag was copied from existing tags. When copying, the probability of selecting a tag was assumed to decay with time, and this decay function was found to follow a power law distribution. Thus, tags that were recently used had a higher probability of being reused than those used in the past. One major finding by Cattuto et al. was that semantically general tags (e.g., [...] "blog") tended to co-occur more frequently with other tags than semantically narrower tags (e.g., [...] "ajax"), and this difference could be captured by the decay function of tag reuse in their model. Specifically, they found that a slower <b>decay</b> <b>parameter</b> (when the tag is reused more often) could explain the phenomenon that semantically general tags tended to co-occur with a larger set of tags. In other words, they argued that the [...] "semantic breadth" [...] of a tag could be modeled by a memory decay function, {{which could lead to}} different emergent behavioral patterns in a tagging system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The weight-decay {{technique}} {{is an effective}} approach to handle overfitting and weight fault.

It {{is well known that}} the weight-decay method can also suppress the effect of weight fault. For the faulty case, using a test set to select the <b>decay</b> <b>parameter</b> is not practice because there are huge number of possible faulty networks for a trained network. This paper develops two mean prediction error (MPE) formulae for predicting the performance of faulty radial basis function (RBF) networks. Two fault models, multiplicative weight noise and open weight fault, are considered. Our MPE formulae involve the training error and trained weights only. Besides, in our method, we do not need to generate a huge number of faulty networks to measure the test error for the fault situation. The MPE formulae allow us to select appropriate values of <b>decay</b> <b>parameter</b> for faulty networks.

40|$|An {{enhanced}} {{method of}} elliptic grid generation has been invented. Whereas prior methods require user input of certain grid parameters, this method provides for these parameters {{to be determined}} automatically. "Elliptic grid generation" signifies generation of generalized curvilinear coordinate grids through solution of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). Usually, such grids are fitted to bounding bodies and used in numerical solution of other PDEs like those of fluid flow, heat flow, and electromagnetics. Such a grid is smooth and has continuous first and second derivatives (and possibly also continuous higher-order derivatives), grid lines are appropriately stretched or clustered, and grid lines are orthogonal or nearly so {{over most of the}} grid domain. The source terms in the grid-generating PDEs (hereafter called "defining" PDEs) make it possible for the grid to satisfy requirements for clustering and orthogonality properties in the vicinity of specific surfaces in three dimensions or in the vicinity of specific lines in two dimensions. The grid parameters in question are <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> that appear in the source terms of the inhomogeneous defining PDEs. The <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> are characteristic lengths in exponential- decay factors that express how the influences of the boundaries decrease with distance from the boundaries. These terms govern the rates at which distance between adjacent grid lines change with distance from nearby boundaries. Heretofore, users have arbitrarily specified <b>decay</b> <b>parameters.</b> However, the characteristic lengths are coupled with the strengths of the source terms, such that arbitrary specification could lead to conflicts among parameter values. Moreover, the manual insertion of <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> is cumbersome for static grids and infeasible for dynamically changing grids. In the present method, manual insertion and user specification of <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> are neither required nor allowed. Instead, the <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> are determined automatically as part of the solution of the defining PDEs. Depending on the shape of the boundary segments and the physical nature of the problem to be solved on the grid, the solution of the defining PDEs may provide for rates of decay to vary along and among the boundary segments and may lend itself to interpretation in terms of one or more physical quantities associated with the problem...|$|R

This method includes both real and virtual photon effects {{and can be}} applied for dipoles with different transition frequencies in both weak and strong coupling regimes. Numerical validations have been made for dipoles in vacuum and in an ideal planar microcavity. For dipoles located in photonic crystal nanocavity, {{it is found that}} the cooperative <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> and the dipole-dipole interaction potential strongly depend on the following four factors: the atomic position, the atomic transition frequency, the resonance frequency, and the cavity quality factor. Properly arranging the positions of the two atoms, we can acquire equal value of the cooperative <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> and the local coupling strength. Large cooperative <b>decay</b> <b>parameters</b> can be achieved when transition frequency is equal to the resonance frequency. For transition frequency varying in a domain of the cavity linewidth around the resonance frequency, dipole-dipole interaction potential changes continuously from attractive to repulsive case. Larger value and sharper change of cooperative parameters and dipole-dipole interaction can be obtained for higher quality factor. Our results provide some manipulative approaches for dipole-dipole interaction with potential application in various fields such as quantum computation and quantum information processing based on solid state nanocavity and quantum dot system.
