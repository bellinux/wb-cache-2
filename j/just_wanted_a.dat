5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E
25|$|Sources vary as to {{the causes}} of this absence, the Chinese media mostly cited the {{conflict}} {{between her and the}} China's National Tennis Team's administration and coaching staff.

25|$|In 1983 The Faith {{released}} an eight-song twelve inch EP called Subject to Change. It {{was produced by}} Ian MacKaye and showed the band progressing into more melodic territory {{with the addition of}} a second guitarist. Eddie Janney, formerly of the Untouchables and Ian MacKaye's short-lived Skewbald/Grand Union, joined The Faith at the end of 1982 to play second guitar and made his recorded debut. The addition was made because they wanted to get some more complex guitar ideas into the songs and soften the impact of guitar malfunctions, which were a constant threat during good shows. Not to mention, they <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> fuller sound and liked the way Eddie played.|$|E

25|$|The Altair 8800 is a {{microcomputer}} {{designed in}} 1974 by MITS {{and based on}} the Intel 8080 CPU. Interest grew quickly after it was featured {{on the cover of the}} January 1975 issue (published in late November 1974) of Popular Electronics, and was sold by mail order through advertisements there, in Radio-Electronics, and in other hobbyist magazines. The designers hoped to sell a few hundred build-it-yourself kits to hobbyists, and were surprised when they sold thousands in the first month. The Altair also appealed to individuals and businesses that <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> computer and purchased the assembled version. The Altair is widely recognized as the spark that ignited the microcomputer revolution as the first commercially successful personal computer. The computer bus designed for the Altair was to become a de facto standard in the form of the S-100 bus, and the first programming language for the machine was Microsoft's founding product, Altair BASIC.|$|E
500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I think they <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> northwest guy to do it, {{because they were}} shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, but I think I was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the story appeared, Hollywood was {{releasing}} adaptations of works set in the South by writers such as Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner. [...] Kurtzman said his inspiration came from his memories of Paris, Texas, where he was stationed during World War II. [...] He learned the Southern drawl used in the story from what he heard at United Service Organizations (USO) dances. [...] He recalled, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> parody of that town. [...] I worked from memory." [...] The scene in which the unemployed townsmen mentally undress Honey Lou affected Art Spiegelman, who saw the possibilities of the comics medium in the formalities of the scene's portrayal of motion.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} work on Deadly Shadows, Jordan Thomas went to Irrational Games, where he designed the [...] "Fort Frolic" [...] section of BioShock. He {{later became the}} creative director of BioShock 2. Because of tensions and disagreements within the Deadly Shadows team, Randy Smith was fired from Ion Storm {{near the end of}} the game's production, and he founded Tiger Style with fellow Deadly Shadows designer David Kalina. Smith later wondered if the team had [...] "overdone it" [...] with [...] "Robbing the Cradle", and he stated, [...] "I worry a little bit in retrospect about people who <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> 'sneaking around mansions and stealing stuff' experience [...] forced into their deepest nightmares." [...] The positive reception of [...] "Robbing the Cradle" [...] inspired Eidos Montréal to create a similar asylum level in 2014's Thief.|$|E
500|$|During {{her early}} {{appearances}} on the show, Billie Jenkins {{is identified as}} the Charmed Ones' protégée. Cuoco viewed Billie as a [...] "little sister" [...] to the Halliwell sisters, and attributed her as [...] "very naive and always getting in trouble". She described the character's wardrobe as [...] "cute and fun", and felt that it matched her own personal style. When discussing the casting process, Cuoco stated that Billie's initial characterization was based solely on her physical appearance, explained, [...] "I think they <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> blonde on the show". Co-executive producer James L. Conway believed Billie's identity as a novice witch added a new dynamic to the show, while Pam Shae called the character [...] "demanding", [...] "spunky", and [...] "very, very confident" [...] despite her inexperience with magic. Keri Blakinger of New York Daily News felt that Billie developed into a [...] "powerful witch in her own right" [...] {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} me, maybe {{because they thought}} I was different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E

[...] The United States does not have a DVD boxed set of Kill Bill, though box sets of the two separate volumes are available in other countries, such as France, Japan and the United Kingdom.

2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland {{explained}} that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence. [...] "I'd say {{the main difference between}} this new album and my previous albums, is that this time I wasn't afraid to take a risk. I didn't care whether it was urban, dance, hip hop, WHATEVER... I <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy." [...] Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said [...] "For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it – it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked right into it. ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction." [...] Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said [...] "I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ...
