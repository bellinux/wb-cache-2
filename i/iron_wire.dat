5|$|Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and Oscar Kjellberg {{released}} the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used clay and lime coating {{to stabilize the}} arc, while Kjellberg dipped <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> into mixtures of carbonates and silicates to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, {{the development of an}} extrusion process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three {{engineers}} associated with the Ganz factory, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a wound around <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> ring core or b)surrounded by <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely {{within the confines of}} the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see toroidal cores). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. The Ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers. This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.|$|E

5000|$|Magnetic {{detector}} - Developed by Guglielmo Marconi in 1902 from {{a method}} invented by Ernest Rutherford {{and used by}} the Marconi Co. until it adopted the Audion vacuum tube around 1912, this was a mechanical device consisting of an endless band of <b>iron</b> <b>wires</b> which passed between two pulleys turned by a windup mechanism. [...] The <b>iron</b> <b>wires</b> passed through a coil of fine wire attached to the antenna, in a magnetic field created by two magnets. The hysteresis of the iron induced a pulse of current in a sensor coil each time a radio signal passed through the exciting coil. The magnetic detector was used on shipboard receivers due to its insensitivity to vibration. One {{was part of the}} wireless station of the RMS Titanic which was used to summon help during its famous 15 April 1912 sinking.|$|R

[...] Mu-metal cable is easier to construct than permalloy cable, the mu-metal being wound around the core copper conductor {{in much the same way}} as the <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> in Krarup cable. [...] A further advantage with mu-metal cable is that the construction lends itself to a variable loading profile whereby the loading is tapered towards the ends.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} loading coils was {{discovered}} by Oliver Heaviside in studying the problem of slow signalling speed of the first transatlantic telegraph cable in the 1860s. He concluded additional inductance was required to prevent amplitude and time delay distortion of the transmitted signal. [...] The mathematical condition for distortion-free transmission {{is known as the}} Heaviside condition. [...] Previous telegraph lines were overland or shorter and hence had less delay, and the need for extra inductance was not as great. [...] Submarine communications cables are particularly subject to the problem, but early 20th century installations using balanced pairs were often continuously loaded with <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> or tape rather than discretely with loading coils, which avoided the sealing problem.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine what metal the strings of Cristofori's pianos were made of, since strings are replaced as they break, and sometimes restorers even replace the entire set of strings. According to Stewart Pollens, [...] "the earlier museum records document that all three [...] Cristofori pianos were discovered with similar gauges of <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> through much of the compass, and brass in the bass." [...] The New York instrument was restrung entirely in brass in 1970; Pollens reports that with this modification the instrument cannot be tuned closer than a minor third below pitch without breaking strings. This may indicate that the original strings did indeed include iron ones; however, the breakage might also be blamed on the massive rebuilding of this instrument, which changed its tonal range.|$|E
2500|$|When Allied {{troops were}} halted near Anzio, Italy {{during the spring}} of 1944, powered {{personal}} radio receivers were strictly prohibited as the Germans had equipment that could detect the local oscillator signal of superheterodyne receivers. [...] Crystal sets lack power driven local oscillators, hence they could not be detected. Some resourceful soldiers constructed [...] "crystal" [...] sets from discarded materials to listen to news and music. One type used a blue steel razor blade and a pencil lead for a detector. [...] The lead point touching the semiconducting oxide coating (rust) on the blade formed a crude point-contact diode. [...] By carefully adjusting the pencil lead {{on the surface of the}} blade, they could find sensitive spots, of iron oxide, capable of rectification. [...] The lead of the pencil is made of graphite and clay and so it would inhibit further corrosion that would result if copper or <b>iron</b> <b>wire</b> was used in its place. Any further corrosion at the point of contact would ruin the diode effect found at that spot and further adjustment would be necessary. The sets were dubbed [...] "foxhole radios" [...] by the popular press, and they became part of the folklore of World War II.|$|E

2500|$|Possibly {{the same}} device was {{referred}} to as [...] "umbrella lamp" [...] and mentioned as [...] "a variety of zoetrope" [...] which [...] "may well have originated in China" [...] by historian of Chinese technology Joseph Needham. It had pictures painted on thin panes of paper or mica on the sides of a light cylindrical canopy bearing vanes at the top. When placed over a lamp it would give an impression of movement of animals or men. Needham mentions several other descriptions of figures moving after the lighting of a candle or lamp, but some of these have a semi-fabulous context or can be compared to heat operated carousel toys. It is possible that all these early Chinese examples were actually the same as, or very similar to, the [...] "trotting horse lamp" [...] known in China since before 1000 CE. This is a lantern which on the inside has cut-out silhouettes or painted figures attached to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. The moving silhouettes are projected on the thin paper sides of the lantern. Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected <b>iron</b> <b>wire.</b> None of these lamps are known to have featured sequential substitution of images depicting motion and thus don't display animation {{in the way that the}} zoetrope does.|$|E

50|$|Transformers for use at {{power or}} audio {{frequencies}} typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel. The steel has a permeability {{many times that}} of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings. Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated <b>iron</b> <b>wires.</b> Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.
