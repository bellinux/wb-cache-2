5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project <b>even</b> <b>found</b> and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} of the union {{was to create a}} common state under Władysław Jagiełło, but the ruling oligarchy of Poland learned that their goal of incorporating Lithuania into Poland was unrealistic. Territorial disputes led to warfare between Poland and Lithuania or Lithuanian factions; the Lithuanians at times <b>even</b> <b>found</b> it expedient to conspire with the Teutonic Knights against the Poles. Geographic consequences of the dynastic union and the preferences of the Jagiellonian kings instead created a process of orientating Polish territorial priorities to the east.|$|E
5|$|In 1623, Galileo {{published}} The Assayer—Il Saggiatore, which attacked theories {{based on}} Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and <b>even</b> <b>found</b> {{support among the}} higher echelons of the Christian church. Following the success of The Assayer, Galileo published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care {{to adhere to the}} Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze) in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.|$|E

5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the marsh rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study <b>even</b> <b>found</b> the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The local Partisans {{had been}} advised of the {{presence}} of the camp and the children, probably by Branko Davila, a doctor who had worked at the pre-existing children's home on the camp site. At dawn on 26August 1942, the Partisan 4th Kordun Brigade attacked the camp and dispersed the Ustaše guard force. The children heard the shooting and began shouting that the Partisans had arrived. Despite attempts by the nuns to hide the children, Partisan troops broke into the buildings and rescued many children. Some of the fighters <b>even</b> <b>found</b> a brother or sister within the camp. The Partisans gave what food they had to the children, and led away from the camp all the children that could walk.|$|E
5|$|With the {{advantages}} of incumbency and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, Jefferson County, and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he <b>even</b> <b>found</b> support among some voters who had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due to the term limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and Paul E. Patton was reelected in 1999. In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election. Similarly, he appointed Greenup to {{a position on the}} Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802.|$|E

5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the only}} time the Locust was used in action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole. A report issued {{at the end of a}} conference held by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 {{confirmed}} that the Locust design was considered obsolete; any light tanks to be used in post-war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs. The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries. Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments, and a few Locusts <b>even</b> <b>found</b> their way back to the U.S., where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors. A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army, replacing a number of older tank models, such as the Vickers-Armstrong Mark V light tank, that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period. Several company-sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E

25|$|Esox lucius {{is found}} in fresh water {{throughout}} the Northern Hemisphere, including Russia, Europe, and North America.

25|$|Light {{responses}} were <b>even</b> <b>found</b> in roots, previously {{thought to be}} largely insensitive to light. While the gravitropic response of A. thaliana root organs is their predominant tropic response, specimens treated with mutagens and selected {{for the absence of}} gravitropic action showed negative phototropic response to blue or white light, and positive response to red light, indicating that the roots also show positive phototropism.|$|E
25|$|He took {{an active}} part in every {{department}} of business, but relied heavily on extra-official counsellors of his own choosing rather than upon the Privy Council of Sweden. The effort to remedy the widespread corruption that had flourished under the Hats and Caps engaged a considerable share of his time and he <b>even</b> <b>found</b> it necessary to put on trial the entire Göta Hovrätt, the superior court of justice, in Jönköping.|$|E
60|$|The whole party {{remained}} in St. Louis one day. Then they sped eastward on the Limited, {{and the following}} <b>evening</b> <b>found</b> them {{on their way to}} Valley Brook farm, the Stanhopes and Lanings having decided to stop off there for at least a day or two.|$|R
50|$|Vlasto {{tried to}} {{introduce}} immigrants to US politics {{and was a}} staunch supporter of Theodore Roosevelt.

25|$|The {{adoption}} support {{found by}} the 2012-15 surveys in the above table, was detected while a majority of Poles in the same surveys said they expected the euro adoption would negatively impact the Polish economy. In example, 58% of the surveyed in May 2012 had this belief. A later poll for the German Marshall Fund published in September 2012, <b>even</b> <b>found</b> 71% of Poles believed an immediate switch to the euro would be bad for the Polish economy.|$|E
25|$|Eosinophilia {{is not a}} {{reliable}} measure of extent of infection because it varies from individual to individual. Some cases with multiple pairs of worms have reported low eosinophil levels, while other cases with a single pair had very high eosinophil counts. Such variation {{may be due to}} the lack of host tissue invasion by the parasite, since M. laryngeus attaches to the mucosal epithelium in the tracheolaryngeal region. A singular case <b>even</b> <b>found</b> worms within a cyst.|$|E
25|$|Dicraeosaurids {{are a part}} of Diplodocoidea and are {{the sister}} group to Diploidocidae. In the past two decades, the known {{diversity}} of the group has doubled. However, the classification of Suuwassea as a dicraeosaurid is not universally agreed upon. Some phylogenetic analyses have found Suuwassea to be a basal diplodocoid instead of a dicraeosaurid. One 2015 analysis has <b>even</b> <b>found</b> Dyslocosaurus and Dystrophaeus as members of Dicraeosauridae. A 2016 reappraisal of Amargatitanis has placed it into the Dicraeosauridae, as well.|$|E
