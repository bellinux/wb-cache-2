25|$|Fissile U-235 and non-fissile but {{fissionable}} and fertile U-238 {{are both}} {{used in the}} fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 {{is more likely to}} capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the <b>initial</b> <b>loading</b> of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.|$|E

In order to apply appropriate torque, the relationship between tightening torque and <b>initial</b> <b>load</b> should be determined. In this study, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model of bolted joints was established with consideration of helix angle, pitch, thread type, tooth-type angle, and other details. The process of pre-tightening of bolted joints was simulated to validate the finite element model. The curves for the relationship between the torque and <b>initial</b> <b>load</b> obtained from finite element analysis agree well with those calculated from theoretical equations. Then, the influence of the friction coefficient, pitch, elastic modulus, assembly clearance, and strain-hardening exponent on the relationship was studied. The results show that the friction coefficient between nut and joint has great influence on the relationship between torque and <b>initial</b> <b>load,</b> that is, the larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the <b>initial</b> <b>load</b> of bolt at the same tightening torque. In contrast, the pitch, assembly clearance, Young’s modulus, and strain-hardening exponent have little influence on torque–initial load relation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{numerical}} approach {{to analyze the}} dynamic stability of a ribbed plate subjected to harmonic loading is presented. The harmonic balance method and the modified Newmark method of direct integration to solve the equations of motion are used. Unstable regions which include resonant frequencies of the external load are discussed. Then the stability loss occurs by flutter, i. e. exponentially growing oscillations. The modified Newmark direct integration method to analyze the equations of motion is used. Some results which describe the time history of resonance vibrations (unstable) and those nonresonances (stable) are presented. The effects of constraint parameters such a modulation depth E and constraint frequency T are investigated. Also the <b>initial</b> <b>load</b> and internal damping are taken into account.

40|$|Abstract. Before {{concrete}} {{structures are}} subjected to dynamic loadings such as earthquake, usually they have already withstood static loads.

In this study, experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of <b>initial</b> static <b>load</b> on the dynamic strength and deformation characteristics of concrete in compression. A load was initially applied on the specimen at a very low speed to a specified value and then the dynamic load was applied at a high strain rate up to the failure of the specimen.

50|$|In a GFR reactor design, {{the unit}} {{operates}} on fast neutrons, no moderator {{is needed to}} slow neutrons down. This means that, apart from nuclear fuel such as uranium, other fuels can be used. The most common is thorium, which absorbs a fast neutron and decays into Uranium 233. This means GFR designs have breeding properties—they can use fuel that is unsuitable in light water reactor designs and breed fuel. Because of these properties, once the <b>initial</b> <b>loading</b> of fuel has been applied into the reactor, the unit can go years without needing fuel.
