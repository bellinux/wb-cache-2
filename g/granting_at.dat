60|$|Meanwhile war {{had broken}} out between England and France, causing the {{frequent}} detention of vessels; and a store-ship in the harbour caught fire, the precursor of a worse misfortune. On a Sunday morning, 1794, as the unfortunates were looking out for the Company's craft (the Harpy), a French man-of-war sailed into the roadstead, pillaged the 'church and the apothecary's shop,' and burnt boats as well as town. The assailant then wasted Granville, sailed up to Bance Island, and finally captured two vessels, besides the long-expected Harpy. Having thus left his mark, he disappeared, after <b>granting,</b> <b>at</b> the Governor's urgent request, two or three weeks' provision for the whites. Famine followed, with sickness in its train, and the neighbouring slave-dealers added all they could to the sufferings of the settlement.|$|E
60|$|The {{news was}} {{received}} in England with astonishment and sorrow. Great concessions {{had been made}} by Parliament, but the news had reached America too late to avoid hostilities. Public opinion was divided; many were in favor of <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> once all that the colonists demanded, and many officers of rank and position resigned their commissions rather than fight against the Americans. The division, indeed, was almost as general and complete as {{it had been in the}} time of our own civil war. In London the feeling in favor of the colonists was strong, but in the country generally the determination to repress the rising was in the ascendant. The colonists had, with great shrewdness, dispatched a fast-sailing ship to Europe upon the day following the battle of Lexington, giving their account of the affair, and representing it as a massacre of defenseless colonists by British troops; and the story thus told excited a sympathy which would not, perhaps, have been extended to them had the real facts of the case been known. Representatives from all the colonies met at Philadelphia to organize the national resistance; but as yet, although many of the bolder spirits spoke of altogether throwing off allegiance to England, no resolution was proposed to that effect.|$|E

The approach proposed in this paper takes into consideration the most common suggested standards used in designing this kind of systems and introduces new general concepts which demystify {{the use of such}} standards in actual applications. This paper illustrates the roadmap to be followed in general when designing level crossing monitoring systems, to minimize the risk due to object misdetection occurring on barrier closure when exploiting radar technology...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{characterization}} by means of cone-calorimeter tests of rice dust explosiveness, determining the ignition temperature of a 5 mm thick layer, T 5 mm, in order to define the critical temperature range for industrial processes management where such materials are involved, <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> the same time plant safety and efficiency. The variability in material behavior, along seasons and/or production process phases, requires an expeditious evaluation of explosiveness conditions, especially regarding the minimum ignition energy and temperature.

Formation control, however, {{is a difficult}} problem to cope with for these kind of vehicles, since they are highly nonlinear, underactuated and the feasible control actions are constrained. Moreover the computational capabilities which can be mounted on aerial vehicles are usually limited, thus centralized solutions should be avoided. To solve these problems, a Nonlinear Decentralized Model Predictive Control algorithm is presented in this paper, taking into account both physical and actuation constraints. Each vehicle is equipped with sensors providing inertial measurements and communicates with its neighbours using a Wireless Local Area Network. Simulation results applied to a formation of quadrotor vehicles show that the proposed technique is a valid way to solve the control problem for a generic formation, <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time the}} possibility to deal with constraints...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Nowadays, {{software}} {{evolution is}} a very hot topic. It is particularly complex when it regards critical and nonstopping systems. Usually, these situations are tackled by hard-coding all the foreseeable evolutions in the application design and code. Neglecting the obvious difficulties in pursuing this approach, we also get the application code and design polluted with details that do not regard the current system functionality, and that hamper design analysis, code reuse and application maintenance in general. Petri Nets (PN), as a formalism for modeling and designing distributed/concurrent software systems, are not exempt from this issue. The goal of this work is to propose a PN based reflective framework that lets everyone model a system able to evolve, keeping separated functional aspects from evolutionary ones and applying evolution to the model only if necessary. Such an approach tries to keep system’s model as simple as possible, preserving (and exploiting) ability of formally verifying system properties typical of PN, <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> the same time adaptability...|$|E
40|$|Health {{monitoring}} is nowadays one of {{the hottest}} markets due to the increasing interest in prevention and treatment of physical problems. In this context the development of wearable, wireless, open-source, and nonintrusive sensing solutions is still an open problem. Indeed, most of the existing commercial architectures are closed and provide little flexibility. In this paper, an open hardware architecture for designing a modular wireless sensor node for health monitoring is proposed. By separating the connection and sensing functions in two separate boards, compliant with the IEEE 1451 standard, we add plug and play capabilities to analog transducers, while <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> the same time a high level of customization. As an additional contribution of the work, we developed a cosimulation tool which simplifies the physical connection with the hardware devices and provides support for complex systems. Finally, a wireless body area network for fall detection and health monitoring, based on wireless node prototypes realized according to the proposed architecture, is presented as an application scenario...|$|E
40|$|A programmable-gain {{preamplifier}} and filter for {{detection of}} spontaneous heart activity in an {{implantable cardiac pacemaker}} is presented. The system is fully integrated in a standard 0. 35 -μm CMOS technology, including all auxiliary circuits. Two channels are available in order to process both atrial and ventricular signals. CMOS translinear circuits, with particular emphasis on log-domain techniques, have been exploited in order to contain current consumption and to allow correct operation with a reduced supply voltage, due to battery discharging. Indeed, the realized system can operate down to 1. 8 V of supply voltage and dissipates at most 1. 8 μA, <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> least 47 dB of dynamic range (DR) for the atrial chain, which is compatible with advanced digital sensing. Current consumption can be further reduced {{at the expense of}} DR if a simpler sensing like peak detection is adopted. All system performance have been verified by measurements results and are compatible with the requirements of cardiac pacemakers. This work, therefore, demonstrates how a proper design approach, exploiting low-power and low-voltage techniques, allows one to optimize performance for the cardiac pacemaker...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new way to}} deal with Grid portals referring to our implementation. L-GRID is a light portal to access the EGEE/EGI Grid infrastructure via Web, allowing users to submit their jobs from a common Web browser in a few minutes, without any knowledge about the Grid infrastructure. It provides the control over the complete lifecycle of a Grid Job, from its submission and status monitoring, to the output retrieval. The system, implemented as client-server architecture, is based on the Globus Grid middleware. The client side application is based on a java applet; the server relies on a Globus User Interface. There is no need of user registration on the server side, and the user needs only his own X. 509 personal certificate. The system is user-friendly, secure (it uses SSL protocol, mechanism for dynamic delegation and identity creation in public key infrastructures), highly customizable, open source, and easy to install. The X. 509 personal certificate does not get out from the local machine. It allows to reduce the time spent for the job submission, <b>granting</b> <b>at</b> the same time a higher efficiency and a better security level in proxy delegation and management.

Among Earth Observation (EO) techniques in the last decades optical Very High Resolution (VHR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery represent very effective tools for these implementations, since very high spatial resolution can be obtained by means of optical systems, and by the new generations of sensors designed for interferometric applications. Although these spaceborne platforms have revisiting times of few days they still cannot match the spatial detail or time resolution achievable by means of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Digital Photogrammetry (DP), and ground-based devices, such as Ground-Based Interferometric SAR (GB-InSAR), Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and InfraRed Thermography (IRT), which in the recent years have undergone a significant increase of usage, thanks to their technological development and data quality improvement, fast measurement and processing times, portability and cost-effectiveness.
