5|$|Glass Joe's French {{characteristics}} {{have been}} discussed by critics such as writer Sumantra Lahiri and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. IGN's Craig Harris <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NES game focused more on his weaknesses and that the Wii game emphasized his stereotypes. A member of the Retronauts podcast also {{felt that he was}} defined more by his weakness than his nationality until he learned more about French stereotypes. Chris Buffa <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stereotypes could be considered offensive while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis felt that there was nothing legitimately offensive.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg, who <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} in Benchley's script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite, {{but he declined}} the offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of online play, additional mutant powers, {{and a larger}} cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were critical of the game's voice acting and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies {{to be added to}} the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.|$|E

5|$|The soundtrack album for The Last of Us was {{released}} on iTunes in June 2013. Additional compositions, including some composed for Left Behind, were released on a second soundtrack in February 2014. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music connected appropriately with the gameplay. In particular, critics <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> minimalist approach of the soundtrack's composition matched the gameplay. The game's music was nominated for numerous awards. Several tracks became popular and begot cover versions and live performances.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Kameo release, lead {{designer}} George Andreas <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original Kameo concept of finding and using monsters had evolved and carried through to the final product. He {{said that there were}} enough ideas for a sequel within the new intellectual property if players were interested. Years later, Andreas reappraised and said that the game should never have been released and remains a sore subject for him to discuss. Since the project was nearly finished, they had opted for launch title release instead of starting over. Andreas <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effort to conceal the fairy Kameo as an elf was unsuccessful and that the character did not match the Xbox's first-person shooter demographic.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} development, {{multiple}} {{members of}} staff voiced dissatisfaction with the final product. Ito and Suzuki <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> portrayals of the Law and Chaos Heroes were imbalanced, with the Chaos Hero being too emotional and the Law Hero being unsympathetic. They also saw the demon fusion system as too difficult for players to master. Okada, while commenting on what improvements would {{be made for the}} next game, stated that there were too many useless items in the game. Niino <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game's pacing and flow needed to be addressed, as after naming the characters, the player immediately is prompted to divide their status points.|$|E

5|$|Chartjackers {{garnered}} a viewing figures peak {{of almost}} half a million with its final episode and was critically panned by reviewers. Some commentators <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> programme's concept was ridiculous and doomed from the start, others <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series showed a contempt for music and the general public, and other critics questioned whether {{the point of the}} project was to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves. The show was nominated for a 2010 Broadcast Digital Award in the Best Multi-Platform Project category, but lost out to The Operation...Surgery Live.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{when the}} star was first awarded. It has {{received}} mixed reviews from food critics both while {{in its current}} incarnation, and while it was run by head chef Marcus Wareing. It was <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dishes were sometimes overcomplicated, and designed primarily to gain Michelin stars. The restaurant was named after the French wine Pétrus.|$|E
5|$|Earlier ornithologists <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> kakapo {{might be}} related to the ground parrots and night parrot of Australia due to their similar colouration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the cryptic colour seems to be {{adaptation}} to terrestrial habits that evolved twice convergently.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Akitoshi Kawazu {{was pleased}} by Famitsus rating but {{admitted that he}} thought the game was not perfect; he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storyline did not meet some fans' expectations. Kawazu expressed his frustration and regrets regarding the storyline, citing creative differences between the PlayOnline and Final Fantasy Tactics members of the development team.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{enjoyed the}} higher speed of battle {{compared}} to Episode I. Parkin echoed these sentiments while also noted how mechanics such as Boost {{and the addition}} of side quest content made the game better than its predecessor. GamePro positively noted that the first game's mechanics had been made more approachable for series newcomers, while Massimilla <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> simplified nature of the character growth system brought down the experience in addition to being shorter than other RPGs available at the time. Nutt <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> alterations made battles far more enjoyable despite the character growth system lacking any meaningful customization options. Dunham echoed other reviewers' opinions on both the upgrades to battle and the reworked character progression system, in addition to the lack of in-game currency to buy items.|$|E
5|$|Formally {{backing the}} festival's trans-exclusion policy led to protests and boycotts aimed towards Mr. Lady acts, Wilson and The Butchies in particular. Groups such as Camp Trans, and many {{participants}} in the queercore community disagreed with Mr. Lady's stance and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group and label exploited transgender images. The label went defunct in June 2004.|$|E

5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Abbe {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom. He went at {{the invitation}} of the London Judo Society (LJS), and was the first master to teach aikido in the UK. That year, he demonstrated aikido at the LJS and at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Abbe came to experience two problems at the LJS: first, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> students there were more concerned with competition than his theories, and second, he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> students did not treat him with the appropriate respect for someone of his rank and experience in the martial arts. According to the International Budo Council (IBC), he founded the IBC in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Front Mission was re-released for the PlayStation as Front Mission 1st, and a {{corresponding}} promotional sound track album was released as Front Mission 1st Special BGM Selection. The nine-track album contains eight tracks by Shimomura and Matsueda, arranged by Hidenori Iwasaki, and one new track by Iwasaki {{out of the}} five he composed for the remake. It was published by Square Enix on October 23, 2003 with the catalog number FM1-DA, and has a total length of 18:25. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described the album as a good sampler for the full soundtrack, and claimed that it had slightly better sound quality. He also <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new track was a good addition to the rest. Dave of Square Enix Music Online agreed with these praises, though he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> large amount of overlap between the promotional disc and the full soundtrack made its purchase not worthwhile.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{purpose of the}} events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached {{at the turn of}} the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E
5|$|James Palermo, {{artistic and}} general {{director}} of the Grant Park Music Festival <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> musicians were able to interact more effectively with the new sound system because {{they were able to}} hear each other better.|$|E
