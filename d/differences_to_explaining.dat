Nevertheless, even assuming that craters formed on melt pools are 2 times smaller than those on normal ejecta deposits assuming same impactors, the large crater density difference still exists (Xiao 2016; Zanetti et al. 2017).|$|R
30|$|This article {{compares the}} attitudes of white Swedes towards interracial marriages with someone of non-white migrant origin and a non-white {{transnational}} adoptee. The analysis {{is based on a}} postal survey and follow-up interviews conducted in Malmö, Sweden. Survey results show that transnational adoptees are not preferred as marriage partners by white Swedes to the same extent as white Swedes. Moreover, the differences in attitudes towards marriages with migrants and non-white adoptees are not statistically significant. Interviewees utilized the notion of cultural <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the attitudes towards intermarriages with migrants. However, this was highly contested when talking about the attitudes towards non-white transnational adoptees. These results show how race and visible differences play a role in attitudes toward interracial marriages in Sweden.|$|R

Study Design: 112 rats were implanted with non-crosslinked InteXen LP, cross-linked Pelvicol, and two investigational acellular collagen matrices (ACMs) sterilized either with ethylene oxide (ACM ETO) or gamma-irradiation (ACM GI). After 14, 30, 90 and 180 days, 7 animals per group were sacrificed to document adhesions, herniation, infection, stress resistance and histology. Results: The 2 sterilization methods {{did not cause}} measurable differences between ACMs. Pelvicol was more resistant than ACMs but showed degradation at 90 days without loss of strength. InteXen LP became remodeled as a thin fibrous scar and was more resistant at all time points; however, some animals developed bulging.

However, at the moment, the percentage of UN female military peacekeepers is still stagnant at 3 %, while the campaign aimed at 10 %. There is clearly a discrepancy between policy and practice. This research aimed to find out to what extent this failure of the UN to achieve a participation of 10 % female military personnel in peace operations, can be explained by using a gender perspective. This campaign, related policies, and underlying assumptions, as well as, the implementation of these policies, are discussed. Chances, challenges and misunderstandings related to an increase of the percentage of female militaries in peacekeeping troops, and in particularly the influence of this increase on the effectivity of gender equality efforts and successfulness of peace missions, are explained. Using a gender perspective reveals that the influence of gender on security issues is significant.

40|$|Purpose - While {{the number}} of women in {{managerial}} positions has been increasing, the gender composition of top management teams is skewed. There are barriers and obstacles in place that limit the movement of women into leadership roles. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the relationship between modesty and access to leadership. Specifically, tendencies toward modesty and lack of self-promotion are hypothesized to perpetuate the lack of female involvement in top management positions. Design/methodology/approach - The literature on modesty and self-promotion is reviewed. The findings are discussed in terms of the persistent challenges faced by women with regard to their ability to enter senior levels of management. Findings - The overall message of the paper is that behaviours that are successful for males in the workplace are not successful for females. The good news is that women do not need to adopt male ways of being in order to succeed. A limitation is that the paper is largely "uni-cultural", as the research referenced is primarily that undertaken in a North American context. Self-promotion and modesty may be conceptualized differently in other contexts.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Familial {{transmission}} {{of mental illness}} is common. Recent studies in behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry reveal the importance of epigenetic mechanisms of transmission that center on the developmental consequences of variations in parental care. Studies with rats suggest that environmental adversity results in patterns of parent–offspring interactions that increase stress reactivity through sustained effects on gene expression in brain regions known to regulate behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to stress. While such effects might be adaptive, the associated cost involves an increased risk for stress-related illness. KEYWORDS—maternal care; stress responses; epigenesis; stress hormones; individual <b>differences</b> <b>To</b> <b>explain</b> the relation between family function and health in adulthood, researchers have proposed stress-diathesis models (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002). These models suggest that a decreased quality of parental care alters the development of neural and endocrine systems, increasing the magnitude of emotional, autonomic, and endocrine responses to stress (collectively referred to here as defensive responses) and thus predisposing individuals to illness. The term diathesis refers to the interaction between development—including the potential influence of genetic variations—and the prevailing level of stress experienced by an individual in predicting health outcomes. Such models have considerable appeal, and could identify both the origins of illness {{and the nature of}} underlying vulnerabilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks to}} expand our {{knowledge}} about immigrant political socialization and Latino political behavior. While many studies of Latino politics focus on issue attitudes and nationality <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> partisan attachments and electoral choices, we argue that local context [...] in particular, the unequal distribution {{of social and economic}} resources within a given community – can be a powerful source of political socialization for Hispanic immigrants. Using data from an exit poll conducted in Miami-Dade County in 2004, we examine the voting behavior among non-Cuban Hispanics in the presidential contest, the Florida senate race, and the local mayoral election. Our theoretical framework predicts that anti-Cuban resentments will be salient and consequential to non-Cuban Hispanic voting in both the presidential and senate elections. Our findings confirm these expectations; non-Cuban Hispanic opinions regarding anti-Castro policies are significant predictors of voting behavior after controlling for traditionally powerful explanatory factors such as political party, economic optimism, opinion on the Iraq war, social issue attitudes, and socio-demographic characteristics. Our results also suggest that power relations in the local arena constitute an important agent of political socialization for new Latino immigrants, much as they were for the European immigrants {{at the turn of the}} century...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine empirically the {{relationship}} between psychic distance and adaptation of the retail offer across a range of countries. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using a mail survey of randomly selected non-food retailers that operated stores in at least three foreign countries. Findings – Findings of this study suggest that a substantial proportion of retail offer adaptation is explained by psychic distance. In particular, differences in market structure, business practices and language between the home and foreign market significantly increase the extent to which retailers adapt their offer. Research limitations/implications – The research findings may be limited in terms of their generalisability across retail sectors, as the study focused on non-food retailers only. Practical implications – These results have implications for researchers and managers in suggesting that we need to go beyond consumer behaviour <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> fully the degree to which international firms standardise or adapt their strategies in foreign markets. Originality/value – Much of the existing research into standardisation and adaptation is limited in terms of geographic scope and a focus on the marketing strategies of manufacturing and export firms. Thus, this paper addresses a substantial gap in existing research by empirically examining the relationship between psychic distance and adaptation in a retail context and across a range of countries. <br /...|$|R
