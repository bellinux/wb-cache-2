40|$|Monel alloys are {{pioneering}} materials {{which have}} exceptional engineering properties such as corrosion resistance, high toughness and show good response to cryogenic treatment. It finds uses in ship building, nuclear aerospace, missile and valve industries. These materials shows strain hardening effect {{which results in}} tool wear {{and in some cases}} tool breakage when machined by conventional methodshence, unconventional machining such as electrical discharge machining (EDM) discoverspurpose for machining of such materials. Researchers have recognized relation between electrical input process parameters of EDM process and output parameters of EDM process. But researchers have not investigated the influence of external magnetic field and cryo-treatment of work piece on EDM performance measures namely material removal rate (MRR) and tool wear rate (TWR). In vision of this the objective of present work was to study the effect of gap current, external magnetic field and cryogenic treatment of <b>work</b> <b>part</b> on MRR and TWR. Experiments were carried out by creating a 3 mm square hole on Monel 400 alloys. Based on experimental results it was found that as gap current increases the MRR and TWR increases for untreated <b>work</b> <b>part.</b> For treated <b>work</b> <b>part</b> MRR increases and TWR decreases with increasein gap current. MRR and TWR increases with constant gap current for untreated <b>work</b> <b>part,</b> as magnetic field increases. For treated <b>work</b> <b>part</b> MRR increases and TWR decreases with increase in magnetic field at constant gap current...|$|R
