40|$|The {{corporate}} {{challenge of}} being “one generation ahead” has prompted {{us to find}} new ways to improve our time to market, size, and cost of our WLAN products. By identifying the key issues which challenged us in our previous-generation products and by shifting our design effort to a platform-level optimization, we moved to a topdown approach in our Si and hardware architecture design flow. By taking the product-level requirements down to the last component on the board using this new methodology, we enabled smoother and <b>cleaner</b> <b>platform</b> integrations, as well as smaller and cheaper solutions. This paper summarizes the different architectural and functional changes in our products, from the system level down to the board/Si level. In addition, we discuss some of the design issues to ensure robust and reliable RF designs in our radio chips. The Intel ® PRO/Wireles...|$|R
40|$|This {{method for}} {{determining}} aluminum in serum and urine is essentially free from matrix interference {{and gives a}} linear response with concentration to at least 500 zg/L. Use of a stabilized temperature platform (L’vov platform, Perkin-Elmer Corp.) to approach a “steady-state ” tem-perature, addition of matrix modifiers [especially Mg(N 03) 2], {{and the use of}} peak area integration all helped substantially diminish spectral interference. With the <b>platform</b> <b>furnace,</b> serum protein concentrations as great as 260 gIL did not interfere with the determination of Al. The within- and between-assay precision (CV) was 3. 5 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. Analytical recovery of Al added to serum ranged between 95 and 101 % throughout the linear calibration range (to 500 g/L), either when mea-sured directly from the standard curve or by the metho...|$|R
5000|$|Initially {{the railway}} {{commuter}} passenger trains stopped {{just outside the}} metro pavilion. However, since the early 1990s they have been making longer journeys well beyond the metro trains' arrival zone {{and most of the}} passengers were forced to walk a train length. By the early 2000s {{it was clear that the}} transfer point needed a major reconstruction. In 2004 the station was closed to mainline trains (passengers were told to use the Kazansky railway station instead). During this time the old 1960s concrete hinged roofs on the railway platforms were knocked down. These were replaced with modern light green and white transparent roofs with decorative features. The stairwells from the subways were covered with separate pavilions where turnstiles were inserted, and the concrete floor was repaved with stone. The combined metro and railway platform was re-divided along the width where a pavilion was built. Thus the centre-bound metro platform was nearly trebled in area (accounting for the dismantled ticket offices as well), and safety walls were installed on the railway side. The metro part of the station kept its hinged roofs, but these were completely repainted and the crude lighting elements in the hinges were replaced with never ones. Giving the <b>platform</b> a <b>cleaner</b> look, the subways were also widened and cleaned up with the old tile work replaced by marble. Additional subway was built as well. The complex was re-opened to the public on 2 October 2004.|$|R

40|$|Graphite filter atomizers (GFA) for {{electrothermal}} {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry (ETAAS) show substantial advantages over commonly employed electrothermal vaporizers and atomizers, tube and <b>platform</b> <b>furnaces,</b> for direct determination of high and medium volatility elements in matrices associated with strong spectral and chemical interferences. Two factors provide lower limits of detection and shorter determination cycles with the GFA: the vaporization area in the GFA is separated from the absorption volume by a porous graphite partition; the sample is distributed over a large surface of a collector in the vaporization area. These factors convert the GFA into an efficient chemical reactor. The research concerning the GFA concept, technique and analytical methodology, carried out mainly in the author's laboratory in Russia and South Africa, is reviewed. Examples of analytical applications of the GFA in AAS for analysis of organic liquids and slurries, bio-samples and food products are given. Future prospects for the GFA are discussed in connection with analyses by fast multi-element AAS...|$|R
50|$|The {{graphite}} {{tubes are}} heated via their ohmic resistance using a low-voltage high-current power supply; {{the temperature in}} the individual stages can be controlled very closely, and temperature ramps between the individual stages facilitate separation of sample components. Tubes may be heated transversely or longitudinally, where the former ones have the advantage of a more homogeneous temperature distribution over their length. The so-called stabilized temperature <b>platform</b> <b>furnace</b> (STPF) concept, proposed by Walter Slavin, based on research of Boris L’vov, makes ET AAS essentially free from interference. The major components of this concept are atomization of the sample from a graphite platform inserted into the graphite tube (L’vov platform) instead of from the tube wall in order to delay atomization until the gas phase in the atomizer has reached a stable temperature; use of a chemical modifier in order to stabilize the analyte to a pyrolysis temperature that is sufficient to remove the majority of the matrix components; and integration of the absorbance over the time of the transient absorption signal instead of using peak height absorbance for quantification.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} protein-protein {{interactions}} {{is a major}} theme in biological disciplines. Pull-down or affinity-precipitation assays using GST fusion proteins have {{become one of the}} most common and valuable approaches to identify novel binding partners for proteins of interest (bait). Non-specific binding of prey proteins to the beads or to GST itself, however, inevitably complicates and impedes subsequent analysis of pull-down results. A variety of measures, each with inherent advantages and limitations, can minimise the extent of the background. This technical brief details and tests a modification of established GST pull-down protocols. By specifically eluting only the bait (minus the GST tag) and the associated non-specific binding proteins with a simple, single-step protease cleavage, a <b>cleaner</b> <b>platform</b> for downstream protein identification with MS is established. We present a proof of concept for this method, as evidenced by a GST pull-down/MS case study of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rab 31 in which: (i) sensitivity was enhanced, (ii) a reduced level of background was observed, (iii) distinguishability of non-specific contaminant proteins from genuine binders was improved and (iv) a putative new protein-protein interaction was discovered. Our protease cleavage step is readily applicable to all further affinity tag pull-downs...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1990s, the Generation series {{ushered in}} a new <b>platform</b> for the <b>cleaner.</b> The {{addition}} of TechDrive variable power assist eliminated 90% of the effort required to move the unit back and forth. The current model, the Avalir, continues the tradition that converts the vacuum into several different units beginning with the Model 508 in 1948. With {{the introduction of the}} Model 505, the handle could be removed and the machine converted to a portable unit with a shoulder strap so that cleaning in difficult areas could be performed, and the machine converted into a canister-type cleaner with a long hose attached to the front for dusting tasks. With most vacuum cleaner models, the rubber drive belt that powers the brush bar, an integral component with most modern machines, remains in place and is only examined when it breaks. Vacuum attachments are available on other machines but don't require the drive belt to be disconnected. Kirby attachments are connected to the power unit in place of the carpet nozzle, and disconnecting the drive belt is usually involved in the process that add to its flexibility.|$|R
5000|$|Han Qizhi was {{the first}} person to climb the {{exterior}} of the Jin Mao Tower. [...] At 88 stories, the Jin Mao was the tallest building in China at the time—and 5th tallest building in the world (measured by roof height). The structure in Shanghai is clad in metal latticework which seemed to offer ready footholds to a climber. In early March 2001, Han walked around the building at ground level a couple of times with a companion before removing his jacket and starting upwards. An official report would later say he was [...] "struck by a rash impulse" [...] before climbing the skyscraper while barehanded and while wearing regular day clothes. He nearly reached the top before being intercepted by police near a window <b>cleaner's</b> <b>platform.</b> [...] His hands were bloody after climbing over 1,000 feet in frigid temperatures, cold fog, and strong winds. He was taken into police custody and detained for around two weeks. [...] Han had no professional climbing experience. Apparently a hope that his feat might bring fame to himself and to his shoe business in Hefei was a factor.|$|R
40|$|The Graphite furnace atomic {{absorption}} spectrometry (GF AAS) was the technique chosen by the inorganic contamination laboratory (INCQ/ FIOCRUZ) to be validated and applied in routine analysis for arsenic detection and quantification. The selectivity, linearity, sensibility, detection, and quantification limits besides accuracy and precision parameters were studied and optimized under Stabilized Temperature <b>Platform</b> <b>Furnace</b> (STPF) conditions. The limit of detection obtained was 0. 13 µg. L- 1 and the limit of quantification was 1. 04 µg. L- 1, with an average precision, for total arsenic, less than 15 % and an accuracy of 96 %. To quantify the chemical species As(III) and As(V), an ion-exchange resin (Dowex 1 X 8, Cl- form) was used and the physical-chemical parameters were optimized resulting in a recuperation of 98 % of As(III) and of 90 % of As(V). The method was applied to groundwater, mineral water, and hemodialysis purified water samples. All results obtained were lower than the maximum limit values established by the legal Brazilian regulations, in effect, 50, 10, and 5 µg. L- 1 para As total, As(III) e As(V), respectively.

40|$|Integrated micro-CHP (Cooling, Heating and Power) system {{solutions}} represent {{an opportunity to}} address all of the following requirements at once: conservation of scarce energy resources, moderation of pollutant release into our environment, and assured comfort for home-owners. The objective of this effort was to establish strategies for development, demonstration, and sustainable commercialization of cost-effective integrated CHP systems for residential applications. A unified approach to market and opportunity identification, technology assessment, specific system designs, adaptation to modular product platform component conceptual designs was employed. UTRC's recommendation to U. S. Department of Energy is {{to go ahead with}} the execution of the proposed product development and commercialization strategy plan under Phase II of this effort. Recent indicators show the emergence of micro-CHP. More than 12, 000 micro-CHP systems have been sold worldwide so far, around 7, 500 in 2004. Market projections predict a world-wide market growth over 35 % per year. In 2004 the installations were mainly in Europe (73. 5 %) and in Japan (26. 4 %). The market in North-America is almost non-existent (0. 1 %). High energy consumption, high energy expenditure, large spark-spread (i. e., difference between electricity and fuel costs), big square footage, and high income are the key conditions for market acceptance. Today, these conditions are best found in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, New England states. A multiple stage development plan is proposed to address risk mitigation. These stages include concept development and supplier engagement, component development, system integration, system demonstration, and field trials. A two stage commercialization strategy is suggested based on two product versions. The first version [...] a heat and power system named Micro-Cogen, provides the heat and essential electrical power to the homeowner. In its proposed embodiment, the system has a 2 kW prime mover integrated to a <b>furnace</b> <b>platform.</b> The second version is a Micro-Trigen system with heating, cooling and power. It has the same Micro-Cogen platform integrated with a 14 kW thermally activated chiller. A Stirling engine is suggested as a promising path for the prime mover. A LiBr absorption chiller is today's best technology in term of readiness level. Paybacks are acceptable for the Micro-Cogen version. However, there is no clear economically viable path for a Micro-Trigen version with today's available technology. This illustrates the importance of financial incentives to home owners in the initial stage of micro-CHP commercialization. It will help create the necessary conditions of volume demand to start transitioning to mass-production and cost reduction. Incentives to the manufacturers will help improve efficiency, enhance reliability, and lower cost, making micro-CHP products more attractive. Successful development of a micro-CHP system for residential applications has the potential to provide significant benefits to users, customers, manufacturers, and suppliers of such systems and, in general, to the nation as a whole. The benefits to the ultimate user are a comfortable and healthy home environment at an affordable cost, potential utility savings, and a reliable supply of energy. Manufacturers, component suppliers, and system integrators will see growth of a new market segment for integrated energy products. The benefits to the nation include significantly increased energy efficiency, reduced consumption of fossil fuels, pollutant and CO{sub 2 } emissions from power generation, enhanced security from power interruptions as well as enhanced economic activity and job creation. An integrated micro-CHP energy system provides advantages over conventional power generation, since the energy is used more efficiently by means of efficient heat recovery. Foreign companies are readily selling products, mostly in Europe, and it is urgent to react promptly to these offerings that will soon emerge on the U. S. market as well. For all these reasons, UTC urges the U. S. Department of Energy to fund the Phase II Development Program in the nation's interest. The objective of this study of micro-CHP systems was to establish strategies for development, demonstration, and sustainable commercialization of cost-effective integrated Cooling, Heating and Power (CHP) systems for residential applications. Successful commercialization will ultimately involve component suppliers both for the micro-CHP system, and for the building electric power, heating, cooling, ventilation, and hot water supply systems. All of these components must be compatible and integrated as a system with their safe and reliable operation coordinated by an overall supervisory control system...|$|R

A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the determination of lead in wine by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry without any sample preparation and calibration against aqueous standards, using 7. 5 g Pd as a chemical modifier. The results obtained for seven wines using the proposed method and an acid digestion procedure did not show any significant difference using a Student’s t-test. Atomization in a transversally heated filter atomizer (THFA) was compared with atomization in a conventional transversally heated <b>platform</b> <b>furnace.</b> The former provided a 2. 6 -fold higher sensitivity, improving the characteristic mass from 34 to 12 pg and a 1. 6 -fold better limit of detection (0. 3 gL− 1 compared to 0. 5 gL− 1) for aqueous solutions using the same injection volume of 20 L. However, the average precision, expressed as the relative standard deviation for the determination of lead in wine under routine conditions was improved from 4. 6 % with platform atomization to 0. 6 % in the THFA.

40|$|AbstractWorkplace health {{promotion}} {{is a business}} management system that aims to promote and improve the health situations of all employees in a comprehensive and sustainable mode, and {{should be seen as}} an equal partner for occupational health and safety. Certain industrial hazards (in particular chemical agents) display oxidant capacity in the human body acting via oxidative stress, caused by a cellular excess of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Species like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are involved in protein kinase regulation, while nitric oxide and peroxynitrite inactivate phosphatases as well as activating kinases, which are key agents for translating signals of cell needs into metabolic change through enzyme action, gene transcription, protein synthesis, and biochemical flux. These reactions are permanently balanced by the redox system, a nonequilibrium thermodynamic state as a basic part of aerobic life, determined by relative and constantly changing amounts of oxidative and antioxidative (reductive) agents. Review {{of a large number of}} studies shows that external sources of antioxidants, mainly fruits and vegetables, are a real benefit for human defense mechanisms, considering now that sufficient scientific evidence exists for public health policy to promote a plant-rich diet. In our investigation, we focused on anthocyanins, as highly potent phytochemical antioxidants expected to protect us from oxidative injury. Furthermore, these specific antioxidants were found to act against lipoperoxidation and oxidative stress induced by industrial chemicals like carbon tetrachloride, paraquat or heavy metals. Anthocyanin extracts of Vaccinium Myrtillus (bilberry) improve night vision and eye strain caused by excessive computer use. Because of the antioxidant skin protection against UVB radiation, these phytochemicals can be used (both local and oral administration) by workers from oil-bearing <b>platforms,</b> <b>furnaces</b> or agriculture. We think that such important findings may be used for workplace {{health promotion}} projects in chemical industry, in order to prevent occupational diseases or work-related diseases. The individual approach of workplace health promotion focuses on the health-related behaviors of employees, and is called risk factor reduction (educational approach). We focused our initiative on using dietary natural antioxidants by running health campaigns, and raising awareness of the harmful effects of chemical agents and xenobiotics, addressed both to employees and managers. We propose a one year project sustaining behavior change mainly through educational and informative sessions, based on assessment of workers’ needs and also on developing healthy lifestyles. We also want to encourage company managers to offer antioxidant supplements/fresh fruits/berries juices to those employees who are working in harmful conditions, considering a daily estimated intake of 200 mg anthocyanins. Health promotion on consuming anthocyanins-rich fruits and vegetables may contribute in reducing age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, age-related metabolic diseases (especially cardiovascular diseases), and not at least, cancer. Designing potent antioxidant phytococktails and standardised mixtures of anthocyanins for human consumption will be a great challenge on essentially inter-disciplinary research topic involving interaction of nutritionists, physicians, chemists, pharmacists and others...|$|R
