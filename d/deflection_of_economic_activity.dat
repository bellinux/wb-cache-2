40|$|The article {{presents}} {{results of the}} study <b>of</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> development <b>of</b> Ukraine during the past decade. It marks out three phases of development of the national economy. It shows {{that it is necessary to}} reveal and analyse those types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> that exert the biggest influence upon the dynamics of the GDP of the country when studying specific features and disproportions of development of the Ukrainian economy. The article allocates the most large-scale, by their absolute volume, types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the GDP of Ukraine and analyses their dynamics. It builds a matrix of positioning <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine in the “scalability – dynamics” plane. It analyses dynamics <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the Ukrainian economy by the absolute volume of export and calculates the absolute gain of export from Ukraine by types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> It underlines the biggest, by import volume, types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine and absolute gain of import in Ukraine by types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> It analyses export and import orientation <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine. It builds a matrix of positioning in the “export orientation – import dependence” plane <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine. It presents distribution <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine in the “export orientation – import dependence” plane by clusters. It calculates the ratio of full costs <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine. It distributes types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine with consideration of their interrelation. It offers comparative characteristics of main types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> GDP of Ukraine in 2003 – 2012. It marks out leading types <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> which cover 35 % in GDP of the country and have a significant multiplicative effect on development of other sectors of economy and identify sustainability of their development...|$|R

40|$|In the United States {{the density}} <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> in cities {{differed}} significantly over time. Between {{the eighteenth and}} early nineteenth centuries, cities became increasingly dense; however, since {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, the trend has reversed as cities have become dispersed. The density <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> differed significantly across cities as well. At any given point in time, there is a great variation in the density <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> across cities. The dynamic changes in the spatial organization <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> also differed across cities. In some cities, such as New York, population density grew and plateaued while in others, such as St. Louis, it grew and fell dramatically. Yet, despite the fact that the defining element of a city is its density, few scholars have systematically examined the long-run changes in the spatial organization <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities.</b> This paper documents the historical changes in the density <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> and explores the causes of their rise and decline. ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the article}} {{is the study of}} the {{structure}} of the system <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> households in Ukraine and dynamics of interconnections between the main indicators of its functioning. In order to study dynamics of main indicators of the system <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> households, the article uses tools of econometric vector-autoregression modelling (VAR models). Based on the existing statistical data and a developed VAR model, the article studies individual and aggregate influence of lag values of indicators upon their current values, system reaction on main indicators impulses, analyses dynamics of change of explanation of dispersion of some indicators with others, and conducts two types of forecasts that reflect a general tendency <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> households in Ukraine. High accuracy of forecasts obtained with the help of the proposed econometric model testifies to a possibility of its practical application for assessment of the state of main indicators <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> households of Ukraine.

We develop a new economic geography model based on the original Krugman (1991) model, and show that trade liberalization will foster agglomeration <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> in the location that has the lowest-cost access to foreign markets. Our results thus differ from Krugman and Livas's (1996) conclusions. We expect the CEECs' economies to shift <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> towards EU markets.

The results indicate that unemployment in different sectors <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> responds differently to various {{macroeconomic policy}} shocks. © 2009 M. E. Sharpe, Inc.
