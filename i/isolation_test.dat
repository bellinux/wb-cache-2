5000|$|An {{electrical}} <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> is {{a direct}} current (DC) resistance test that is performed between subcircuit common and subsystem chassis to verify that a specified level of isolation resistance is met. Isolation testing may also be conducted between one or more electrical circuits of the same subsystem. The test often reveals problems that occurred during assembly, such as defective/wrong component, improper component placement/orientation and wire insulation or insulator defects that may cause inadvertent shorting or grounding to chassis, in turn, compromising electrical circuit quality and product safety.|$|E

The success of any BVD virus eradication programme depends on the ability to detect all PI animals at a young age. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the use of the antigen ELISA test and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the diagnosis of PI animals in the presence of maternal antibodies, and to compare them with the classical virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test.</b> In this experiment, 25 calves born after an experimental infection with a mixture of BVD virus field strains were used. All calves were found to be positive for BVD virus using the virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test,</b> both before the ingestion of colostrum and again at 10 weeks of age. Both the virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> and the antigen ELISA test were shown to be unreliable indicators for the diagnosis of persistent infections with BVD virus, when used in the presence of high levels of maternal antibodies. However, the RT-PCR test gave positive results even in the presence of high maternal antibody titres, indicating the suitability of the RT-PCR test for use in eradication programmes...|$|E
40|$|The {{validity}} of the <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in manual muscle testing was investigated. The flexion force of the knee joint was measured for the following leg positions: lateral rotation, mid position and medial rotation. The results showed that muscle strength was the highest for lateral rotation, followed by mid position, and medial rotation, in this order (11. 08, 10. 69 and 9. 68 kg, respectively). If the flexion force of the knee joint in mid position {{is the sum of}} medial and lateral rotators, then flexion force should be highest in mid position, but this did not hold true. Also, if the activities of medial rotators are suppressed in lateral rotation, then flexion force should be decreased by the degree of suppression, but this did not hold true. The same applies to medial rotation. Hence, the <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in manual muscle testing lacks validity...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fundamental {{studies have}} been carried out on the {{flammability}} aspects of decorative trimmings used on upholstered furniture. In addition to the trimmings being <b>tested</b> in <b>isolation,</b> <b>tests</b> were also carried out to assess their flammability in conjunction with flammable upholstery foam as well as with a variety of fabric/foam composites. The flammability has been assessed by ignition to a smouldering cigarette and by a match-equivalent butane flame on a BS 5852 rig. A test method has been proposed which is a modification of the US-UFAC test to include the assessment of trimming ignitability to a simulated match flame. The effect of live flame was found to be different from the effect of a smouldering cigarette. In live flame tests the pass/fail boundary was found to be dependent on the type of fabric covering the foam.

40|$|Intraventricular corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) was {{administered}} to guinea pig pups both with a freehand injection technique and via indwelling cannula. Behavioral effects depended upon the technique used. The highest dose of CRF (5 μg) inhibited the vocalizing of pups in a subsequent <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> only when CRF was given by freehand injection. The possibility that disturbance attendant to the freehand procedure can account for this difference is discussed. To {{determine the effect of}} endogenous CRF in the absence of additional disturbance, the CRF antagonist α-helical CRF (ahCRF) {{was administered}} with the indwelling cannula procedure. ahCRF enhanced vocalizing during the first 10 min, and enhanced locomotor activity during the last 10 min, of a 30 -min <b>isolation</b> <b>test.</b> Overall, the results indicate that endogenous CRF reduces vocalizing and locomotion during social isolation and that under certain injection conditions exogenous CRF can exacerbate the behavioral effect. The results also demonstrate the potential impact of the technique used to administer exogenous CRF. Further, the prevailing view, that CRF mediates stress-related behavioral responses, is supported only if behavioral inhibition, rather than vocalizing or locomotor activity, is viewed as the stress-related response in this situation...|$|E

40|$|Capillary {{blood samples}} from 63 infants {{collected}} 3 - 7 days after birth, and thereafter stored on filter papers for 12 - 18 y, were {{tested for the}} presence of CMV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Of 16 infants with proven congenital CMV infection (positive virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in urine sampled within 1 week of age), 13 (81 %) had a positive CMV PCR test and 3 (19 %) a negative PCR test. All blood samples from 16 control infants without congenital CMV infection (negative virus <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> in urine sampled within 1 week of age) were CMV PCR-negative. When 31 samples on filter papers stored above or below the samples of the infected infants were tested, 6 (19 %) had a weak reactivity. This suggests that CMV DNA can be transferred from one filter paper to another during storage. We conclude that PCR performed on dried blood stored on filter paper is a useful method in the retrospective diagnostics of congenital CMV infection. Consideration must be given, however, to the possibility of transfer of CMV DNA from blood samples stored nearby...|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{concerns}} about having transformerless electrical systems feed into the public utility grid.

For relatively short gate-drain distances or ohmic-to-ohmic spacings, source-drain punch-through is suggested to be the limiting breakdown mechanism in either HEMTs under off-state conditions or ohmic-to-ohmic <b>isolation</b> <b>test</b> structures, respectively. The mechanism ultimately limiting the HEMT off-state voltage blocking capability is instead the vertical drain-to-substrate breakdown for long gate-drain spacings. The latter phenomenon is induced, in HEMTs on a low-resistivity p-type substrate like those considered here, by the triggering of a high-field carrier generation mechanism rather than by carrier injection...|$|E

40|$|Maternal {{care has}} been shown to affect the {{development}} of the brain, behaviour, social skills and emotional systems of the young of many mammalian species including dogs. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effects of maternal care on the behavioural responses of family dog puppies towards environmental and social stimuli. In order to do this, maternal care (licking puppy’s ano-genital area, licking the puppy, nursing and mother-puppy contact) during the first three weeks after birth was assessed in 12 litters of domestic dog puppies reared in home environments (total = 72 puppies). The behavioural responses of puppies were assessed in an arena and an <b>isolation</b> <b>test,</b> which were performed when the puppies were two-month old. Data were analysed using principal components analysis and projection to latent structures regression. A systematic relationship was found between maternal care and behaviour in both tests. In the arena test, maternal care was found to be positively associated with approach to the stranger, attention oriented to the stranger, time spent near the enclosure, yawning, whining and yelping (R 2 Y = 0. 613, p = 8. 2 × 10 − 9). Amount of maternal care was negatively associated with the number of squares crossed and the time spent individually playing with the rope. In the <b>isolation</b> <b>test,</b> the amount of maternal care was positively associated with standing posture, paw lifting, and howling, and it was negatively associated with yawning, lying down and nose licking (R 2 Y = 0. 507, p = 0. 000626). These results suggest that the amount of maternal care received during early life influences the pattern of behavioural responses and coping strategies of puppies at two-months of age. On the basis of these findings it could be speculated that early maternal care contributes to adaption to the environment in which family puppies are developing, with particular regard to social relationships with people...|$|E
