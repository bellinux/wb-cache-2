50|$|On August 22, 2013, {{with the}} plant online at 98% power, {{all three of}} the plant's main {{feedwater}} pumps tripped causing a drop of the reactor water level. The reactor subsequently tripped. The loss of feedwater and sudden trip from the high power level caused the reactor water level to drop below -46 inches. After passing this point, the emergency core cooling system automatically activated. The RCIC and HPCI systems promptly restored the reactor water level to normal. The cause of the <b>electrical</b> <b>trip</b> to the feedwater pumps is under investigation.|$|E

50|$|Cords: Electrical cords {{connecting}} a neon artwork to a {{power source}} should be checked {{on a regular}} basis for any signs of fraying or wear and tear. The placement of cords is also important. If cords are run in high traffic areas, they may pose a tripping hazard to visitors, which could potentially result in personal injury and damage to the cord and/or artwork. The placement of cords in and against walls and out of traffic areas provide better safety and use. Use of extension cords are not recommended, as they increase the risk of potential <b>electrical</b> and <b>tripping</b> hazards. Review of the artwork and its installation, including outlet and cord placement,by curatorial, installation, and electrical staff will help ensure the safety of the artwork.|$|R
500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Compton had become {{interested}} in cosmic rays. At the time, their existence was known but their origin and nature remained speculative. Their presence could be detected using a spherical [...] "bomb" [...] containing compressed air or argon gas and measuring its <b>electrical</b> conductivity. <b>Trips</b> to Europe, India, Mexico, Peru and Australia gave Compton the opportunity to measure cosmic rays at different altitudes and latitudes. Along with other groups who made observations around the globe, they found that cosmic rays were 15 per cent more intense at the poles than at the equator. Compton attributed this {{to the effect of}} cosmic rays being made up principally of charged particles, rather than photons as Robert Millikan had suggested, with the latitude effect being due to Earth's magnetic field.|$|R

A safer working environment not only will be conducive to a highly performing workforce {{but also in the}} long run will be more cost effective because of no employee time loss and requirement for medical expenditure and compensation if there are any incidents occurring in one?s workplace. A safe working environment must be free from physical stressor and accident and risk free or in worst case scenario if not eliminated must be managed accordingly by the company personnel.

25|$|A strobe {{without a}} {{capacitor}} storage device simply discharges mains voltages across the tube once it's fired. This type of strobe requires no charging time {{and allows for}} much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such strobes require a form of current limiting, because as mentioned above, an arc acts {{as a kind of}} short circuit. If this current limiting were to be eliminated, the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially <b>tripping</b> <b>electrical</b> breakers or causing voltage drops in the power supply line.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} time, {{reliability}} {{and stability of}} electric power have been very important {{when it comes to}} electrical systems in any plants, especially in terms of distribution. Phoenix Pulp & Paper PCL (PPPC) in Khon Kaen, Thailand, is currently generating electric power about 90 % of its current needed by themselves and buys the rest from Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Nonetheless, the protection system should be installed to protect the electrical bus when <b>electrical</b> generating process <b>trips</b> or breakdown. Otherwise, it would cause the shutdown of electrical system and lose all manufacturing. To protect electrical system, PPPC therefore has to use load shedding system for cutting the connection of the machines from the system within few minutes. Power flow of electric power from 115 kV PEA to 11 kV via 2 transformers of 115 kV/ 11 kV and PPPC's 3 generators are studied in this research by setting the real electric power (P), reactive electric power (Q), current (I) and voltage (V) in the protection relay of load shedding system of 11 kV switchboards. In addition, motor control panel, simulated by SKM Power Tools program, is investigated in this research work. The simulation results: P, Q, I and V will be divided into 4 cases: the trips from TG-PUC, TG 2, TG 3 (in-house generation) and the one from PEA. In the case that there is a <b>trip</b> from PEA <b>electrical</b> distribution, P, only generated from the first three generators in house, will be insufficient to cover the plant's electric need and require around 6, 512 kW more. As a result, the machines would have to be stopped running. However, if there is a trip from its in-house generation (TG-PUC, TG 2 and TG 3) instead, some P can be directly received from PEA. Thus, the load shedding scheme is important to protect the blackout system from <b>electrical</b> system's <b>trip</b> in distribution...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. Injury {{is a major}} US {{public health}} problem, {{particularly}} in urban minority communities. This paper evaluates {{the impact of the}} Safe Block Project, a comprehensive injury prevention trial, on home hazards and injury prevention knowledge in a poor urban African-American community. METHODS. Nine census tracts in the community were allocated to either the intervention area or the control area. The intervention, carried out by trained community outreach workers, consisted of (1) home modification for simple prevention measures, (2) home inspection accompanied by information about home hazards, and (3) education about selected injury prevention practices. Approximately 12 months after the intervention, random samples of control and intervention homes were assessed for home hazards and injury prevention knowledge. RESULTS. A significantly larger proportion of intervention homes than control homes had functioning smoke detectors, syrup of ipecac, safely stored medications, and reduced <b>electrical</b> and <b>tripping</b> hazards. No consistent differences were observed between control and intervention homes on home hazards requiring major effort to correct. CONCLUSIONS. There was a distinct difference between control and intervention homes with respect to safety knowledge and home hazards requiring minimal to moderate effort to correct. The Safe Block Project could {{serve as a model for}} future urban injury prevention efforts...|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} {{equipment}} malfunctions, operator errors, and abnormal occurrences {{that may occur}} with moderate frequency can cause an unplanned increase in reactor coolant inventory. Depending on the boron concentration and temperature of the injected water and {{the response of the}} automatic control systems, a power level increase may result and lead to fuel damage or over-pressurization of the reactor coolant system. Alternatively, a power level decrease and depressurization may result. The reactor will trip from high water level, high flux, or high or low pressure. This SRP section is intended to be applicable to these types of moderate frequency events that increase reactor coolant inventory. These transients should be discussed in individual sections of the'applicant's safety analysis report (SAR), as required by the Standard Format (Ref. 1). The specific initiating events considered in this SRP section are: 1. Boiling water reactors (BWRs) [...] Inadvertent operation of the high pressure core spray, high pressure coolant Injection, or reactor core isolation cooling system. 2. PWRs [...] Inadvertent operation of high pressure emergency core cooling system (high pressure injection system) or a malfunction of the chemical and volume control system. Other BWR transients that can result in an increase in reactor coolant inventory include feedwater system malfunctions (increasing flow), steam pressure regulator malfunctions (decreasing flow), loss of <b>electrical</b> load, turbine <b>trip,</b> main steam isolation valve (MSIV) closure, and loss of condenser vacuum. These transients are the subject of other SRP sections that conside...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} development of Electricity Storage Systems (ESS) technologies {{has made them}} interesting choices in the utility scale electricity market. Renewable sources intermittency, load management and power quality are the major purposes of ESS investment in grids. Their primary goal is to technically find the best solution for those problems, while the economic profits pass through that. However, in the increasingly competitive market environments, ESS would possibly {{be able to be}} operated simply to maximise profits for the investor, without aiming in a specific technical problem solution. In that sense, ESS follow the simple guideline oftrading wholesale electricity; purchasing cheap and selling expensive electricity. Another characteristic of today's electricity markets is that the load pattern becomes more erratic, having higher peaks and the load factor ofthe generation and grid falls. Utilities use Demand-Side Management (DSM) to control the demand. One of the features of this control is the peak shaving and shifting of load to off-peak hours. This research optimises the operation ofESS; it identifies the best combination ofcharging and discharging operations (duration and timing within a management period) aiming in maximisation of profits, in two options of management periods; one-day and three-day. Three very important elements of the analysis is the extent in which the profitability ofESS is affected by the existence ofDSM programmes in the market, whether the ESS can be granted with emissions allowances and up to which installed capacity of ESS in the electricity network the profits are positive. For this purpose, a dynamic optimisation model has been built, which incorporates a deterministic model as a real case of application with specific values of parameters. The dynamic modelling assesses the point where the investments in power capacity of ESS show their maximum achieved profits per installed MW, in combinations of four main options: DSM, NoDSM, 24 h and 72 h management period. The deterministic model aims at the optimisation ofthe allocation ofthe charge and discharge operations, simulating a real situation with specific data and parameters. The results show that DSM programmes can have substantial impacts on net revenues and profits achieved by ESS, but not such, on variable costs and revenues. Profitability falls and amongst the storage technologies tested, only those with high <b>electrical</b> round <b>trip</b> efficiency and low replacement costs can be viable investment options. So, the extent of DSM application in the market can influence storage profitability in a variable way. High capital costs and low efficiencies are the first factors to work prohibitively, alongside with DSM, to the profitability ofESS. Investigation of extending the management period from one to three days, has given higher net revenues with relatively smaller increase of discharged electricity. The indirect emissions d'le to the charging operation of the ESS depend on the primary source of energy used to generate the electricity which was stored and therefore, the ESS cannot be granted of emissions allowances in the way they are considered in this research. However, if there are bilateral trading agreements between renewable energy generators and the operators of the ESS, then the avoided emissions of ESS would be positive and the profitability would grow from the participation in the ETS. In the case that the regulations could recognise some economic benefits for ESS (like they do for renewable sources) they could stand more easily and quickly in the competitive electricity market. Funding opportunities for covering the capital cost and special rates for selling electricity to the network and for providing ancillary services can be some of them.
