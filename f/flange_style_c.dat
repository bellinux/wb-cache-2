50|$|The art {{historian}} Bernhard Salin {{was the first}} to systematise Germanic animal ornament, dividing it into three styles (I, II and III).

Both Styles D and E developed within a broad Scandinavian context which, although in keeping with north-western European animal ornamentation generally, exhibited little influence from beyond Scandinavia.|$|R
