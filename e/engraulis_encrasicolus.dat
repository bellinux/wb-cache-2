50|$|The Mediterranean horse {{mackerel}} {{is an important}} resource in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea region. It makes up 54% of catches in the Black Sea and 39% in the Sea of Marmara. In the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas it only totals 3-4% of annual catches. Fixed nets and seines are common methods used to catch Mediterranean {{horse mackerel}}. Along with T. trachurus, {{it is one of}} two Trachurus species in the Mediterranean. Because it forms dense schools and lives in shallower waters, the Mediterranean horse mackerel is the more commonly caught species. Along with <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus,</b> it makes up 59% of seafood production in Turkey.|$|E
5000|$|Sphyraena chrysotenia forms large {{schools in}} inshore {{waters in the}} pelagic and {{demersal}} zones {{to a depth of}} 50m. It is piscivorous, catching its food near the bottom and feeds mainly on schooling fish such as Sardinella aurita and <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus,</b> but will also feed on crustaceans. The spawning season in the Mediterranean runs from April to September, or August to November in the central Mediterranean and the eggs and fry are planktonic, the juveniles are often recorded in very shallow waters. [...] S. chrysotaenia is a relatively short-lived species with a maximum age of 5 years old. S. chrysotaenia reaches sexual maturity at a total length of 195mm for females and 197.1mm for males, usually at 2 years old.|$|E
50|$|Recruitment of fish is {{regulated}} by larval fish survival. Survival {{is regulated}} by prey abundance, predation, and hydrology. Fish eggs and larvae are eaten by many marine organisms. For example, {{they may be}} fed upon by marine invertebrates, such as copepods, arrow worms, jellyfish, amphipods, marine snails and krill. Because they are so abundant, marine invertebrates inflict high overall mortality rates. Adult fish also prey on fish eggs and larvae. For example, haddock were observed satiating themselves with herring eggs back in 1922. Another study found cod in a herring spawning area with 20,000 herring eggs in their stomachs, and concluded that they could prey on half of the total egg production. Fish also cannibalise their own eggs. For example, separate studies found northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) were responsible for 28% of the mortality in their own egg population, while Peruvian anchoveta were responsible for 10% and South African anchovy (<b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus)</b> 70%.|$|E

40|$|Morphometric, allozymic, and {{mitochondrial}} DNA variability previously {{indicated that}} the Mediterranean anchovy <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus</b> includes two distinct forms, one of the inshore habitat, {{and the other one}} of the open-sea habitat. Here, we showed that the two forms significantly differ by several morphological characters. To test the hypothesis, proposed previously, that the two forms are distinct biological species, we used length-polymorphic, exon-primed intronic PCR markers from the creatine-kinase multigenic family and genetically characterized anchovy samples collected in the northwestern Mediterranean and in the eastern Atlantic. Large genetic {{differences were found between the}} two forms (Weir and Cockerham's (&# 952;) over cap = 0. 397 to 0. 586). In contrast. geographic variation in the open-sea forin at the scale of the eastern Atlantic/northwestern Mediterranean was weak ((&# 952;) over cap= - 0. 006 to 0. 042).

Interannual differences were found in this study. In 1994, higher salinities were observed at external sites, though in 1995, higher values were observed at intermediate sites. The upper water column was warmer in 1994 and had less fish larvae density. During 1994, Sardinella aurita and <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus</b> were abundant but spatial location was opposite.

40|$|SUMMARY: In some routine {{studies of}} larval {{condition}} based on RNA:DNA ratios, heads and/or guts are removed for fur-ther age and feeding analysis. Also, during capture larvae are often found {{with their eyes}} missing. In this work we analysed tissues effects (muscle, head, eye, gut and the whole larvae) on RNA:DNA ratios from different species (Sardina pilchardus, <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus,</b> Atherina presbyter and Paralichthys orbignyanus) in different developmental stages and from dif-ferent locations. For all species and development phases, it was shown that RNA:DNA ratios in the head were significantly lower than in muscle or gut. The comparison of RNA:DNA ratios of head with or without eyes did not show significant differences. In a comparison of results from muscle from two tail sections, RNA:DNA ratios were higher for the anterior sec-tion in Sardina pilchardus and <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus</b> larvae.

Age and growth of <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus</b> (Linneaus, 1758) were studied in eastern coast of Ivory coast from September 2004 to September 2005. Fishes were caught monthly using seines of beach and purse seines sliding. A sample of 1400 fishes were caught for studies.

The feeding habits of T. lepturus and S. commerson were investigated through stomach content analysis of specimens collected from Abu Qir Bay (Egypt) on a seasonal basis from November 1999 to January 2001 using daytime purse seines. The food content range of T. lepturus was wide, including <b>Engraulis</b> <b>encrasicolus,</b> Gobius spp., Sardinella aurita, Sardina pilchardus, fish eggs, amphipods, copepods and shrimps.
