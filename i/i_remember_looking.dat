500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{aspect of}} Chrissie's {{personality}} is her wardrobe and style, with EastEnders costume designer Di Humphreys noting that [...] "Chrissie's clothes reflect her strong, upfront character." [...] According to Oberman the production team was keen to emphasise {{this in the}} manner of her dress: [...] "For Chrissie's wardrobe, we decided she is dressy and over co-ordinated", explaining how the character's fashion sense was informed by her own observations of British expatriates: [...] "When I heard I had the part of Chrissie I was on holiday in Spain, where she had been living, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at all the ex-pat women, and thinking how co-ordinated they are. Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves." [...] The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's [...] "glamorous, polished look" [...] informs her characterisation and personality: [...] "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance. Even in moments of despair, though her facial expression reflects her turmoil, she never has a hair out of place." [...] The look was part of a desire to represent the character as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure, with one interviewer describing Chrissie as [...] "quite flashy" [...] and [...] "glam". According to Humprehys this is manifested in [...] "Chrissie’s outfits, [...] are a mixture of designer and High Street... Chrissie's got a great sense of style. She makes High Street clothes look made to measure." [...] Oberman felt Chrissie's fashion sensibilities to be a critical element of the character: [...] "she's like Angie with 15 more years of Sex and The City thrown in", referring to an American televisied serial notable for fashion. Even before stepping foot on set Oberman spent eight hours with Humphreys shopping for Chrissie's clothes at Selfridges where they [...] "spent a fortune!" [...] The character's highly stylised representation on-screen earned Oberman the award for best-dressed soap star in 2005, and reflected Chrissie's new-found role as the [...] "voluptuous landlady" [...] of The Queen Vic. In the media the character was widely regarded as the show's ultimate femme fatale and resident [...] "sex symbol", being described by John Dingwall of the Daily Record as Walford's [...] "black widow".|$|E
2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers to mix and match them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. I wanted something with more flair and elegance. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at a lot of old Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered,</b> and <b>looked</b> {{hard at the}} speaker. The last {{sentence}} was justified, but he differed greatly from one's idea of the typical lawyer. He was not even neatly dressed, and his manner singularly lacked the preciseness of the legal practitioner.|$|R
60|$|In {{an instant}} the giant {{creature}} was almost over me. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> up {{at it and}} thinking in a queer sort of a way--perhaps it was some ancestral memory--that I was a little ape-like child about to be slain by a primordial elephant, thrice as big as any that now inhabit the earth. Then something appeared to happen which I only repeat to show how at such moments absurd and impossible things seem real to us.|$|E
6000|$|Of my {{childhood}} in this Olaf life I can regain but little. There come to me, however, recollections of a house, {{surrounded by a}} moat, situated in a great plain near to seas or inland lakes, on which plain stood mounds that I connected with the dead. What the dead were I did not quite understand, but I gathered that they were people who, having once walked about and been awake, now laid themselves down in a bed of earth and slept. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at a big mound which was said to cover a chief known as [...] "The Wanderer," [...] whom Freydisa, the wise woman, my nurse, told me had lived {{hundreds or thousands of}} years before, and thinking that so much earth over him must make him very hot at nights.|$|E
60|$|All {{was work}} {{with us on the}} instant. While the wagons were being dragged and chained into the circle with tongues inside--I saw women and little boys and girls flinging their {{strength}} on the wheel spokes to help--we took toll of our losses. First, and gravest of all, our last animal had been run off. Next, lying about the fires they had been building, were seven of our men. Four were dead, and three were dying. Other men, wounded, were being cared for by the women. Little Rish Hardacre had been struck in the arm by a heavy ball. He was no more than six, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> on with mouth agape while his mother held him on her lap and his father set about bandaging the wound. Little Rish had stopped crying. I could see the tears on his cheeks while he stared wonderingly at a sliver of broken bone sticking out of his forearm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that dress--you <b>looked</b> lovely in it!' Mrs. Mavis broke out. 'You {{must get}} another just like it--on the other side.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{look like}} Mother either. She was tiny and dark--she had a sweet little face and velvet-brown eyes and soft curly dark hair. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> her <b>look</b> so well. I wish I did {{resemble}} her. I loved her so--I {{would have done}} anything to save her suffering and trouble. At least, she died in peace." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} snubbed his {{persistent}} conversation {{but for the}} drawn anxiety of his face. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> now the <b>look</b> of his faded eyes and the lids red-stained--perhaps you know that look.|$|R
60|$|It was at {{the corner}} of the house, <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> <b>looking</b> two ways. On one side to a stable-yard open to a by-road, where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage, and beyond that to the by-road itself, across which the sign was heavily swinging; on the other side to a wood of dark pine-trees. Their {{branches}} were encumbered with snow, and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window. Night was setting in, and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window-pane. As I looked among the stems of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it, I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die.|$|E
60|$|Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey {{up to his}} watchpocket. Long and {{the short}} of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches are always going wrong.

Cat's away, the mice will play. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all arranged.

6000|$|... "Surely not," [...] {{continued}} Clifford; [...] "and it were {{a relief}} to me if that house could be torn down, or burnt up, and so the earth be rid of it, and grass be sown abundantly over its foundation. Not that I should ever visit its site again! for, sir, the farther I get away from it, the more does the joy, the lightsome freshness, the heart-leap, the intellectual dance, the youth, in short,--yes, my youth, my youth!--the more does it come back to me. No longer ago than this morning, I was old. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> in the glass, and wondering at my own gray hair, and the wrinkles, many and deep, right across my brow, and the furrows down my cheeks, and the prodigious trampling of crow's-feet about my temples! It was too soon! I could not bear it! Age {{had no right to}} come! I had not lived! But now do I look old? If so, my aspect belies me strangely; for--a great weight being off my mind--I feel in the very heyday of my youth, with the world and my best days before me!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{the ninth}} inning was at hand. As the sides changed <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> to <b>look</b> at the {{feminine}} group in our box.

Will it never end?" [...] Mrs. Nelson stared wearily.|$|R
6000|$|But this pull on {{the cords}} made him the more resolved; {{he would not be}} turned from his purpose. 'Who is she?' he repeated; 'have I ever seen her before? I am sure <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> that {{innocent}} <b>look</b> of espieglerie.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{made one}} of those remarks ordinarily called [...] "smart things" [...] before that, {{but it was not}} a pun. Still, it came near causing a serious rupture between my father and myself. My father and mother, my uncle Ephraim and his wife, and one or two others were present, and the {{conversation}} turned on a name for me. I was lying there trying some India-rubber rings of various patterns, and endeavoring to make a selection, for I was tired of trying to cut my teeth on people's fingers, and wanted to get hold of something that would enable me to hurry the thing through and get something else. Did you ever notice what a nuisance it was cutting your teeth on your nurse's finger, or how back-breaking and tiresome it was trying to cut them on your big toe? And did you never get out of patience and wish your teeth were in Jerico long before you got them half cut? To me it seems as if these things happened yesterday. And they did, to some children. But I digress. I was lying there trying the India-rubber rings. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at the clock and noticing that in an hour and twenty-five minutes I would be two weeks old, and thinking how little I had done to merit the blessings that were so unsparingly lavished upon me.

50|$|Beki {{worked as}} a {{journalist}} for print, before later moving into television and presented the BBC Television show Top Gear during the 1980s. Speaking of her time presenting the programme, “Back then there were only four television channels and at our height we were getting seven million viewers. <b>I</b> just <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> down the camera lens and thinking I’ve got this huge audience and I’m talking about a car. It felt like such a waste.”.|$|R
60|$|The {{barriers}} being now withdrawn, {{we walked}} adown {{the length of}} the nave, which did not seem to me so dim and vast as the recollection which I have had of it since my visit of a year ago. But my pre-imaginations and my memories are both apt to play me false with all admirable things, and so create disappointments for me, while perhaps the thing itself is really far better than I imagine or remember it. We engaged an old man, one of the attendants pertaining to the cathedral, to be our guide, and he showed us first the stone screen in front of the choir, with its sculptured kings of England; and then the tombs in the north transept,-- one of a modern archbishop, and one of an ancient one, behind which the insane person who set fire to the church a few years ago hid himself at nightfall. Then our guide unlocked a side door, and led us into the chapter-house,--an octagonal hall, with a vaulted roof, a tessellated floor, and seven arched windows of old painted glass, the richest that I ever saw or imagined, each looking like an inestimable treasury of precious stories, with a gleam and glow even in the sullen light of this gray morning. What would they be with the sun shining through them! With all their brilliancy, moreover, they were as soft as rose-leaves. I never saw any piece of human architecture so beautiful as this chapter-house; at least, I thought so while I was looking at it, and think so still; and it owed its beauty in very great measure to the painted windows: <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at these windows from the outside yesterday, and seeing nothing but an opaque old crust of conglomerated panes of glass; but now that gloomy mystery was radiantly solved.|$|E
6000|$|... "I busied {{myself for}} some time in {{fetching}} water from the cistern for the wounded. Afterwards I wandered upstairs, meeting {{some of the first}} ladies of Sulaco, paler than I had ever seen them before, with bandages over their arms. Not all of them had fled to the ships. A good many had taken refuge for the day in the Casa Gould. On the landing a girl, with her hair half down, was kneeling against the wall under the niche where stands a Madonna in blue robes and a gilt crown on her head. I think it was the eldest Miss Lopez; I couldn't see her face, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at the high French heel of her little shoe. She did not make a sound, she did not stir, she was not sobbing; she remained there, perfectly still, all black against the white wall, a silent figure of passionate piety. I am sure she was no more frightened than the other white-faced ladies I met carrying bandages. One was sitting on the top step tearing a piece of linen hastily into strips--the young wife of an elderly man of fortune here. She interrupted herself to wave her hand to my bow, as though she were in her carriage on the Alameda. The women of our country are worth looking at during a revolution. The rouge and pearl powder fall off, together with that passive attitude towards the outer world which education, tradition, custom impose upon them from the earliest infancy. I thought of your face, which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligence instead of that patient and resigned cast which appears when some political commotion tears down the veil of cosmetics and usage.|$|E
60|$|I {{surveyed}} him, askance, as {{we walked}} together; I had already--I had indeed instantly--seen {{that he was a}} delightful creature. His face is so well known that I need n't describe it; he looked to me at once an English gentleman and a man of genius, and I thought that a happy combination. There was just a little of the Bohemian in his appearance; you would easily have guessed that he belonged to the guild of artists and men of letters. He was addicted to velvet jackets, to cigarettes, to loose shirt-collars, to looking a little dishevelled. His features, which were fine, but not perfectly regular, are fairly enough represented in his portraits; but no portrait that I have seen gives any idea of his expression. There were so many things in it, and they chased each other {{in and out of his}} face. I have seen people who were grave and gay in quick alternation; but Mark Ambient was grave and gay at one and the same moment. There were other strange oppositions and contradictions in his slightly faded and fatigued countenance. He seemed both young and old, both anxious and indifferent. He had evidently had an active past, which inspired one with curiosity, and yet it was impossible not to be more curious still about his future. He was just enough above middle height to be spoken of as tall, and rather lean and long in the flank. He had the friendliest, frankest manner possible, and yet I could see that he was shy. He was thirty-eight years old at the time Beltraffio was published. He asked me about his friend in America, about the length of my stay in England, about the last news in London and the people I had seen there; and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> for the signs of genius in the very form of his questions, and thinking I found it. I liked his voice.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> {{him as if}} it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his {{sea-chest}} following {{behind him}} in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> him <b>looking</b> round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was quite}} close by one {{morning when the}} fox, who was smelling about after me, I suppose because it had liked my brother so much, {{got caught in the}} big trap which was covered over artfully with earth and baited with some stuff which stank horribly. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> it <b>looked</b> very like my own hind-legs.

5000|$|Regarding the {{creation}} of Knock Out and how his design and personality developed, lead designer Jose Lopez stated in the art book Transformers: Art of Prime:When we started designing Out, the only directive was {{to make him a}} fast car, a foil for Bumblebee. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>looking</b> at rims and saying [...] "just pimp him out."

50|$|I {{waited while}} her remains were {{extracted}} and wrapped in two army blankets.

60|$|I had not {{closed the}} drawer {{of the cabinet}} while we were talking, and I glanced carelessly, as I {{answered}} him, at the fragments of the broken vase.

6000|$|... "I'm flattered, I assure you. But--let me see--what happened? Well, riding, lessons, sisters.
