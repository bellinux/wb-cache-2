500|$|Although not {{exceptional}} in size at , , Taylor was {{a physical}} fullback. He sought contact on every play, accordant with his philosophy: [...] "Football is a contact sport. You've {{got to make}} them respect you. You've got to punish tacklers. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> out more misery than the tacklers deal out to you." [...] He was widely acknowledged by his peers {{as one of the}} toughest and meanest players in the NFL. Former quarterback Bobby Layne listed him as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke said, [...] "In 15 years with the pros, he's one of the toughest men I ever played against—and we were on the same team. He'd hurt you when you tackled him." [...] He was difficult to tackle, as he fought for every extra yard. Giants linebacker Sam Huff proposed a rule change specifically in Taylor's case; per NFL rules, piling-on after a play invokes an unnecessary roughness penalty, but Huff argued, [...] "You gotta pile on him a little to keep him down." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1930, Hergé {{introduced}} Quick & Flupke (Quick et Flupke), a new {{comic strip}} about two street kids from Brussels, {{in the pages}} of Le Petit Vingtième. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second Tintin adventure, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it would be accused of racism; however, {{at the time it was}} un-controversial and popular, with further publicity stunts held to increase sales.

Although the Adventures of Tintin had been serialised in the French Catholic Cœurs Vaillants ("Brave Hearts") since 1930, he was soon receiving syndication requests from Swiss and Portuguese newspapers too. Though wealthier than most Belgians at his age, and despite increasing success, he remained an unfazed [...] "conservative young man" [...] dedicated to his work.|$|E

500|$|Rater {{noted that}} the balance Meredith had just found in her life, finally having a chance at {{happiness}} with the man she loves, is shaken by her mother's unexpected lucidity, which was stated to have been written in the series in order to remind Meredith about the troubled years of her growing up: [...] "If Meredith {{is ever going to}} be happy, she's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with {{the fact that she had}} a really terrible childhood." [...] In addition, Rater explained that Ellis' [...] "awful, raw, ugly and terrible" [...] statements towards her daughter were intended to make everyone realize the reason behind Meredith's alcoholism in college and her continuous one-night stands with inappropriate men. She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter. She also praised the performances of the cast, by deeming their acting [...] "remarkable". [...] "That is really what it's all about. We have to cherish the time that we have here, and love the people who surround and support us, even if they make us crazy, because things happen. Brain surgery, Alzheimer's and weddings. And the worst thing is to come to the end of your life, and realize, like Ellis, that you should have tried harder", stated Rater, putting the emphasis on the main aspects of the episode, characterizing it as [...] "not ordinary".|$|E

Party president Christopher Moriarty accused Evans of being [...] "piss-weak and gutless" [...] for not backing a business plan aimed at assisting the party out of its parlous financial situation. High-ranking party members were canvassing support for an urgent no-confidence motion in Mr Moriarty, with one senior figure quoted as saying that [...] "Moriarty is to the Liberal Party what Mark Latham was to Labor", but others counselled Evans against challenging Moriarty due to the high chance of failure. By late February, speculation over the opposition leader's future was being reported in the media, although he was expected to survive in the short term due to lack of options with 15 MPs remaining in the lower house. Initial reports suggested previous aspirant Martin Hamilton-Smith might challenge for the position, with Isobel Redmond as deputy.|$|R

2500|$|Idle {{was born}} in Harton Hospital, in South Shields in County Durham, to which {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the north west of England. His mother, Norah Barron (Sanderson), was a health visitor and his father, Ernest Idle, served in the Royal Air Force during World War II, only to be killed in a hitch-hiking accident shortly after the war. His mother had difficulty coping with a full-time job and bringing up a child, so when Idle was seven, she enrolled him in the Royal Wolverhampton School as a boarder. At this time, the school was a charitable foundation dedicated to the education and maintenance of children who had lost one or both parents. Idle is quoted as saying: [...] "It was a physically abusive, bullying, harsh environment for a kid to grow up in.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the social psychology of U. S. pragmatists John Dewey and George Herbert Mead shapes how early U. S. sociology position itself {{on questions of}} U.

It focuses also on how pragmatist thought influences how 1920 s Chicago sociologists Robert Park and Emory Bogardus produced symbolic interactionist theories and studies on U. S. race and international relations. This paper makes several interventions {{in the history of}} U. S. sociological theory. It re-examines the history of U. S. sociology and the philosophy of pragmatism through the lens of empire, rather than simply a myopic looking-glass of the “race problem. ” This re-examination consequently highlights the interrelationships between racialistepistemologies and orientalist knowledges, rather than compartmentalizing empire and race, Asia and Asian America, sociology and philosophy. Further it draws attention to the ways pragmatism <b>got</b> deployed <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with the “Question of the Philippines” in the interests of imperialism, even {{while at the same time}} pragmatism served as one crucial theoretical foundation for early U. S. anti-imperialist campaigns. These interventions are crucial as professional sociology in the U. S. commemorates its centennial beginning and assesses its many strengths...|$|R
