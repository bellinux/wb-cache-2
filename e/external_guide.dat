40|$|The {{dissemination}} of AAC(6 ′) -I-type acetyltransferases have rendered amikacin and other aminoglycosides all but useless {{in some parts}} of the world. Antisense technologies could be an alternative to extend the life of these antibiotics. <b>External</b> <b>guide</b> sequences are short antisense oligoribonucleotides that induce RNase P-mediated cleavage of a target RNA by forming a precursor tRNA-like complex. Thirteen-nucleotide <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences complementary to locations within five regions accessible for interaction with antisense oligonucleotides in the mRNA that encodes AAC(6 ′) -Ib were analyzed. While small variations in the location targeted by different <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences resulted in big changes in efficiency of binding to native aac(6 ′) -Ib mRNA, most of them induced high levels of RNase P-mediated cleavage in vitro. Recombinant plasmids coding for selected <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences were introduced into Escherichia coli harboring aac(6 ′) -Ib, and the transformant strains were tested to determine their resistance to amikacin. The two <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences that showed the strongest binding efficiency to the mRNA in vitro, EGSC 3 and EGSA 2, interfered with expression of the resistance phenotype at different degrees. Growth curve experiments showed that E. coli cells harboring a plasmid coding for EGSC 3, the <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequence with the highest mRNA binding affinity in vitro, did not grow for at least 300 min in the presence of 15 μg of amikacin/ml. EGSA 2, which had a lower mRNA-binding affinity in vitro than EGSC 3, inhibited the expression of amikacin resistance at a lesser level; growth of E. coli harboring a plasmid coding for EGSA 2, in the presence of 15 μg of amikacin/ml was undetectable for 200 min but reached an optical density at 600 nm of 0. 5 after 5 h of incubation. Our results indicate that the use of <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences could be a viable strategy to preserve the efficacy of amikacin...|$|E
40|$|Ribonuclease P from Escherichia coli can cleave RNAs in simple, hydrogen-bonded {{complexes}} of two oligoribonucleotides {{that resemble}} the aminoacyl stem and 5 ' leader sequence of tRNA precursors. RNase P from human (HeLa) cells cannot catalyze the cleavage in vitro of the 5 '-proximal oligoribonucleotide {{that contains the}} leader sequence in such simple complexes but can do so when the 3 '-proximal oligoribonucleotide (<b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequence) is altered to resemble three-quarters of a tRNA molecule. In such a complex, the efficiency of cleavage of the mRNA for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, as the 5 '-proximal oligoribonucleotide, depends on the structural details of the <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequence and on the choice of target site within the mRNA. The presence of the appropriately designed <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequence in cells in tissue culture reduces chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity {{and the level of}} the corresponding intact mRNA in the cells. Thus, it appears that the use of such <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences may provide a general technique for gene inactivation...|$|E

When synthetic genes that express RNAs for <b>external</b> <b>guide</b> sequences targeted to the mRNAs of the PB 2 and NP genes are stably incorporated into mouse cells in tissue culture, infection of these cells with influenza virus is nonproductive.

40|$|Abstract: Respiratory {{diseases}} {{provide an}} attractive target for gene silencing using small nucleic acids since the respiratory epithelium {{can be reached}} by inhalation therapy. Natural surfactant appears to facilitate the uptake and distribution of these types of molecules making aerosolized nucleic acids a possible new class of therapeutics. This article will review the rationale for the use of <b>External</b> <b>Guide</b> Sequence (EGS) in targeting specific mRNA molecules for RNase P-mediated intracellular destruction. Specific destruction of target mRNA results in gene-specific silencing similar to that instigated by siRNA via the RISC complex. The application of EGS molecules specific for influenza genes are discussed as well as the potential for synergy with siRNA. Furthermore, EGS could be adapted to target other respiratory diseases of viral etiology as well as conditions such as asthma. This article will review the use of <b>External</b> <b>Guide</b> Sequence (EGS) directed gene expression silencing which promotes messenger RNA (mRNA) cleavage by RNase P, and the potential applications of this technology to treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory diseases such as post viral exacerbations of asthma (Dreyfus et a...|$|E

Nucleic acid-based gene interference technologies represent promising strategies for specific inhibition of mRNA sequences of choice. Recently, small interfering RNAs have {{been implicated in}} inducing endogenous RNase of the RNA-induced silencing complex in the RNA interference pathway to inhibit gene expression and growth of several human viruses.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the narrator’s role in John Milton’s Paradise Lost. To do so, I compare Milton’s narrator to {{the narrator of}} Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy. I found that both Dante’s and Milton’s narrators have a unique {{relationship}} to their respective Muses that differs from what {{can be found in}} classical epics: Dante replaces the Muse with Beatrice and Virgil —representing Church and State respectively — while Milton’s poem presents an internalised Protestant Muse. I argue that, through this unprecedented relationship to the Muse figures in each poem, both poems re-negotiate how narrative authority is gained: Dante constructs a poem in which his narrator derives his authority from two <b>external</b> <b>guides,</b> whereas Paradise Lost presents a narrator whose authority resides within. I further argue that, while Milton’s narrator partakes in journey that parallels the purification process in Dante’s poem, the replacement of <b>external</b> <b>guides</b> with an internal source of authority encourages a critical reading of Paradise Lost and its narrator. By rejecting the certainty associated with the external sources of authority in previous epics, Milton’s poem urges its readers to actively engage with the poem: like the narrator of Paradise Lost, who is unable to rely on any external figure of absolute authority, the reader is encouraged to use reason and make interpret choices without reference to a central figure of authority...|$|R

40|$|Radiation {{pressure}} acceleration is {{a highly}} efficient mechanism of laser-driven ion acceleration, with the laser energy almost totally transferrable to the ions in the relativistic regime. There is a fundamental limit on the maximum attainable ion energy, which {{is determined by the}} group velocity of the laser. In the case of tightly focused laser pulses, which are utilized to get the highest intensity, another factor limiting the maximum ion energy comes into play, the transverse expansion of the target. Transverse expansion makes the target transparent for radiation, thus reducing the effectiveness of acceleration.

At saturation, this instability generates in the overlapping region magnetic filaments with peak field B_f. In {{the absence of}} an <b>external</b> <b>guiding</b> magnetic field, these filaments can block the incoming flow, initiating the shock formation, if their size is larger than the Larmor radius of the incoming particles in the peak field. Here we show that this results still holds in the presence of an external magnetic field B_ 0, provided it is not too high. Yet, for B_ 0 ≳ B_f/ 2, the filaments become unable to stop any particle, regardless of its initially velocity. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures. To appear in Journal of Plasma Physic...|$|R

40|$|Debt arrears {{occur when}} {{scheduled}} payments (repayment of principal or coupons) {{are not made}} by their due-for-payment date. The current statistical manuals seem to follow two separate bases for time of recording for repayments of debts. I. Current international standards for the statistical treatment of the issue In general, all macroeconomic statistics use the accrual basis for determining time of recording. However, the treatment differs for arrears. The <b>External</b> Debt Statistics: <b>Guide</b> for Compilers and Users (<b>External</b> Debt <b>Guide)</b> defines arrears as amounts that are past due-forpayment and unpaid (paras. 3. 36, 3. 37).

This time of recording basis conforms with the due-for-payment basis as repayments are recorded {{at the time they}} are due.

Using an extended particle-in-cell (PIC) model that takes into account all the relevant physics, we show that such regimes can be implemented with <b>external</b> <b>guiding</b> for a relatively long distance of propagation and allow for the stable transformation of laser energy into other types of energy, including the kinetic energy {{of a large number of}} high energy electrons and their incoherent emission of photons.

40|$|A main {{question}} {{for the study of}} collective motion in living organisms is the origin of orientational polar order, i. e., how organisms align and what are the benefits of such collective behaviour. In the case of micro-organisms swimming at a low Reynolds number, steric repulsion and long-range hydrodynamic interactions are not sufficient to explain a homogeneous polar order state in which the direction of motion is aligned. An <b>external</b> symmetry-breaking <b>guiding</b> field such as a mechanism of taxis appears necessary to understand this phonemonon. We have investigated the onset of polar order in the velocity field induced by phototaxis in a suspension of a motile micro-organism, the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, for density values above the limit provided by the hydrodynamic approximation of a force dipole model. We show that polar order originates from a combination of both the <b>external</b> <b>guiding</b> field intensity and the population density. In particular, we show evidence for a linear dependence of a phototactic guiding field on cell density to determine the polar order for dense suspensions and demonstrate the existence of a density threshold for the origin of polar order. This threshold represents the density value below which cells undergoing phototaxis are not able to maintain a homogeneous polar order state and marks the transition to ordered collective motion. Such a transition is driven by a noise dominated phototactic reorientation where the noise is modelled as a normal distribution with a variance that is inversely proportiona...|$|R
