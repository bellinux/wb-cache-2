40|$|Background: Performing {{endoscopic}} submucosal dissection (ESD) {{by using}} standard endoscopy platforms is technically challenging {{because of the}} equipment's lack of dexterity. Objective: To explore the feasibility of using the Master and Slave Transluminal Endoscopic Robot (MASTER), a novel robotics-enhanced endosurgical system, to perform ESD. Design: ESD was performed on simulated gastric lesions in 5 Erlangen porcine stomach models (ex vivo) and 5 live pigs (in vivo). Performance of ESD by using the MASTER was compared with that using the insulation-tipped (IT) <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife.</b> Setting: SMART Laboratory, Advance Surgical Training Centre, National University Hospital, Singapore. Subjects: Five Erlangen porcine stomach models and 5 pigs, 5 to 7 months old, each weighing about 35 kg. Interventions: ESD. Main Outcome Measurements: Lesion resection time, grasper and hook efficacy grade, completeness of resection, and presence of procedure-related perforation. Results: In the Erlangen stomach models, 15 simulated lesions from the cardia, antrum, and body were removed en bloc (mean dimension, 37. 4 X 26. 5 mm) by electrocautery excision using the MASTER. The mean ESD time was 23. 9 minutes (range 7 - 48 minutes). There {{was no difference in}} the dissection times of lesions at different locations (P =. 449). In the live pigs, the MASTER took a mean of 16. 2 minutes (range 3 - 29 minutes) to complete the ESD of 5 gastric lesions, whereas the IT <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> took 18. 6 minutes (range 9 - 34 minutes). There {{was no significant difference in}} the times taken (P =. 708). All lesions were excised en bloc; the mean dimensions of lesions resected by the MASTER and the IT <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> were 37. 2 X 30. 1 mm and 32. 78 X 25. 6 mm, respectively. The MASTER exhibited good grasping and cutting efficiency throughout. Surgical maneuvers were achieved with ease and precision. There was no incidence of excessive bleeding or stomach wall perforation. Limitations: Exploratory study with limited sample size. Conclusions: Performing ESD by using the MASTER is feasible.

40|$|Background/Aims: Endoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} (ESD) {{was originally}} developed in 1995 using an insulation-tipped <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to achieve en-bloc resection of early gastric cancer (EGC). It {{has been suggested}} that advances in endoscopic devices and medical equipment, such as the high-frequency genera-tor (1999) and hemostatic forceps (2000), and procedural improvements including post-ESD preventive coagula-tion of visible vessels in the resection area (2003) led to further progress of ESD; therefore, we investigated the actual process of technical stabilization of gastric ESD. Materials and Methods: A total of 1, 713 consecutive patients with solitary differentiated-type EGC at initial onset underwent ESD at our hospital from 1995 to 2006. We retrospectively assessed ESD outcomes for all patients b...|$|R
50|$|At present, {{numerous}} electrosurgical knives such as insulation-tipped <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> (IT-knife)-, needle knife, hook knife, flex knife-, triangle-tipped knife, flush knife, mucosectomy, splash {{needle and}} a special device called a small-caliber tip transparent (ST) hood are available for this technique. One or two of these electrosurgical knives are used in combination with a high frequency electrosurgical current (HFEC) generator with an automatically controlled system). New types of endoscopes are available for ESD, such as an endoscope with a water jet system, an endoscope with a multi-bending system to facilitate the ESD procedure-. As another approach to successful ESD, investigations of submucosal injection solutions have been actively done. It was reported that a hyaluronic acid solution makes a better long-lasting submucosal cushion without tissue damage than other available solutions,-. As a further improvement of hyaluronic acid solution, usefulness of a mixture of high-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and sugar has also been reported,.|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to remove a large early gastric cancer (≥ 3 cm) in one-piece resection using conventional endoscopic mucosal resection. We tried to use an insulation-tipped (IT) <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> to dissect these lesions. IT-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed in four aging patients with gastric malignancy. All lesions could be removed in one-piece resection by IT-ESD, although three of them exhibited remarkable fibrosis and ulceration. Three cases experienced curative treatment with IT-ESD after the pathologic evaluation, {{but it was not}} curative in one case because the pathology showed angiolymphatic invasion. This patient refused additional surgery in consideration of existing major systemic diseases. At 3 months to 1 year of follow-up, endoscopy showed no evidence of residual cancer. IT-ESD is effective in the treatment of large early gastric cancer and is an alternative treatment for early gastric cancer patients who are at risk for major operation.

30|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{described}} {{for the treatment of}} severe cohesive IUAs when typical hysteroscopically directed techniques are not possible or safe. Myometrial scoring has been effective {{for the creation of a}} uterine cavity in women with severe IUAs. In this technique, six to eight 4 -mm-deep incisions are created in the myometrium using electrosurgery with a Collins <b>knife</b> <b>electrode</b> from the fundus to the cervix. These incisions enable widening of the uterine cavity. Anatomic success has been reported in 71 % of patients in one small series [67], and 51.6 % in another [53], with pregnancy achieved in 3 of 7 women in the small series (42.9 %) and 12 of 31 women in the other (38.7 %).|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of endoscopic submucosal dissection using an insulation-tipped <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> (IT-ESD) for the treatment of patients with gastric remnant cancer. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with early gastric cancer in the remnant stomach, who underwent distal gastrectomy due to gastric carcinoma, were treated with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or ESD at Sumitomo Besshi Hospital and Shikoku Cancer Center in the 10 -year period from January 1998 to December 2007, including 17 patients treated with IT-ESD. Retrospectively, patient backgrounds, the one-piece resection rate, complete resection (CR) rate, operation time, bleeding rate, and perforation rate were compared between patients treated with conventional EMR and those treated with IT-ESD. RESULTS: The CR rate (40 % in the EMR group vs 82 % in the IT-ESD group) was significantly higher in the IT-ESD group than in the EMR group; however, the operation time was significantly longer for the IT-ESD group (57. 6 ± 31. 9 min vs 21. 1 ± 12. 2 min). No significant differences were found in the rate of underlying cardiopulmonary disease (IT-ESD group, 12 % vs EMR group, 13 %), one-piece resection rate (100 % vs 73 %), bleeding rate (18 % vs 6. 7 %), and perforation rate (0 % vs 0 %) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: IT-ESD appears to be an effective treatment for gastric remnant cancer post distal gastrectomy because of its high CR rate. It is useful for histological confirmation of successful treatment. The long-term outcome needs to be evaluated in the future...|$|R

40|$|Transurethral {{resection}} of bladder tumour (TURB) {{remains the}} gold standard for management of bladder cancer, but there is evidence of a high rate of tumour recurrence after primary resection, and of variation between institutions. Surgical accuracy is paramount to the safety and efficacy of TURB, but technical and procedural considerations may also have an impact on outcomes. A second resection may improve staging and tumour removal, particularly where the primary procedure was affected by multiple tumours, large tumour bulk, bleeding during resec-tion, bladder perforation, patient habitus, or anaesthetic risk, or if the patient has high-risk bladder tumour, T 1 tumour,multiple high-grade Ta tumours, or carcinoma in situ. The piecemeal resection achieved by standard TURB may contribute to tumour recurrence, and technical modifications are being developed to provide en bloc tumour resection.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reproductive outcome of women with history of infertility or recurrent miscarriage following hysteroscopic septum resec-tion. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive study performed on 263 patients, among whom 248 patients were infertile (79 % with primary infertility and 21 % with secondary infertility) and 15 patients presented with histories of recurrent miscarriage (three or more miscarriages) between 2005 and 2009. All participants underwent hysteroscopic septum resection using monopolar <b>knife</b> <b>electrode.</b> The main outcome measure was reproductive outcome after hysteroscopic metroplasty. Results: The septum was completely removed during the first hysteroscopy in 242 (92 %) patients. A residual septum was seen in 21 (8 %) patients who required a second sitting of surgery. Three cases were complicated by minor perforations which required no further interventions. One operation complicated with bleeding which was controlled by a Foley catheter. There were no cases of postoperative Asherman’s syndrome. Postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|Background/PurposeEndoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} (ESD) is {{an advanced}} endoscopic procedure to resect early gastrointestinal neoplasm. It is technically {{more difficult and}} risky when used to treat early esophageal tumors. We report our experiences related to performing ESD for early esophageal neoplasia. The efficacy, complications, and outcome were also analyzed. MethodsFrom December 2007 to April 2010, 22 patients with documented early esophageal neoplasm underwent ESD. All patients completed a meticulous endoscopic examination using conventional endoscopy followed by narrow-band imaging. Lugol’s staining was performed to identify {{the margin of the}} suspicious lesion. Insulation-tipped <b>diathermic</b> <b>knife</b> 2 was used for ESD. ResultsA total of 26 neoplastic lesions (including 13 tumors with high-grade dysplasia, 12 tumors with squamous cell carcinoma, and one tumor with adenocarcinoma) in 22 patients were enrolled. All patients were men. The mean age was 47. 6  ±  8. 6 years (range, 30 – 68 years). The mean size of tumors was 33. 7  ±  21. 7  mm (range, 8 – 80  mm). ESD was performed for 24 lesions in 20 patients. The mean size of resected specimens was 43. 1  ±  19. 2  mm (range, 15 – 90  mm). The mean operation time was 92. 7  ±  69 minutes (range, 30 – 310 minutes). There were three ESD-related complications, including one with delayed bleeding, one with subcutaneous emphysema, and one with perforation. Two patients received additional operations after ESD due to deep submucosal invasion by cancer. Three lesions in two patients (12. 5 %) developed post-ESD esophageal stricture that needed repeated endoscopic bougination. There was no procedure-related mortality. No local recurrence was found during the follow-up period. ConclusionESD is a promising local curative treatment option for early esophageal neoplasia in Taiwan. However, this procedure may result in complications that are worth noting, especially post-ESD esophageal stricture. Education regarding this procedure and more hands-on training will facilitate endoscopists to improve the outcomes of patients undergoing this procedure...|$|R

40|$|Rhinophyma is a proliferative, granulomatous form of acne rosacea, {{which usually}} occurs in male {{patients}} in the 5 th- 6 th decade of life. It is characterized by hyperplasia of sebaceous glands, fibrosis of soft tissues and blood vessels proliferation. The exact cause of rhinophyma is still unknown. There are many factors in etiology that are being considered, such as: infection with Demodex folliculorum, infection with Helicobacter pylori, blood vessel diseases, endocrine disorder, alcohol, digestive tracts problems. Therapeutic methods include conservative and surgical treatment. In advanced stages of this disease the method of choice is surgical treatment. The invasive techniques such as CO 2 laser, Nd: YAG laser, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, radiotherapy, treatment using the Goulian dermatome and conventional method of surgery including full-thickness excision of the changes and covering the wound with the skin graft have been used. The aim {{of this paper is}} to present four cases of patients treated with electrosurgery. Using <b>knife</b> <b>electrode</b> thin layer-by-layer were removed from the hyperplastic tumor and carefully shaped the edges of the nose. Both in physician’s and patient’s opinion satisfactory cosmetic results have been achieved. Electrosurgery procedures are widely used due to the safety of this method and favorable economic factors. Proper use rarely leads to any complications. Most of these are mild and with adequate precautions easy to prevent. Electrosurgery is an effective, simple method, which does not require any complex equipment. Despite the growing popularity of lasers in recent years, electrosurgery is still worth mentioning, alternative method of treatment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Fibrotic scar {{formation}} is a {{main cause of}} recurrent urethral stricture after initial management with direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU). In the present study, we devised a new technique of combined the transurethral resection of fibrotic scar tissue and temporary urethral stenting, using a thermo-expandable urethral stent (MemokathTM 044 TW) in patients with anterior urethral stricture. Materials and Methods As a first step, multiple incisions were made around stricture site with cold-cutting knife and Collins <b>knife</b> <b>electrode</b> to release a stricture band. Fibrotic tissue was then resected with a 13 Fr pediatric resectoscope before deployment of a MemokathTM 044 TW stent (40 – 60 mm) on a pre-mounted sheath using 0 ° cystoscopy. Stents were removed within 12 months after initial placement. Results We performed this technique on 11 consecutive patients with initial (n = 4) and recurrent (n = 7) anterior urethral stricture (April 2009 – February 2013). At 18. 9 months of mean follow-up (12 - 34 months), mean Qmax (7. 8 ± 3. 9 ml/sec vs 16. 8 ± 4. 8 ml/sec, p < 0. 001), IPSS (20. 7 vs 12. 5, p = 0. 001), and QoL score (4. 7 vs 2. 2, p < 0. 001) were significantly improved. There were no significant procedure-related complications except two cases of tissue ingrowth {{at the edge of}} stent, which were amenable by transurethral resection. In 7 patients, an average 1. 4 times (1 - 5 times) of palliative urethral dilatation was carried out and no patients underwent open surgical urethroplasty during the follow-up period. Conclusion Combined transurethral resection and temporary urethral stenting is a effective therapeutic option for anterior urethral stricture. Further investigations to determine the long-term effects, and safety profile of this new technique are warranted...|$|R
