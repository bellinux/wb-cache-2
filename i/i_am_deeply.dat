25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> {{saddened by}} the death of my close friend and colleague, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, whose death today at his home deprives us all of a great artist and an even greater human being. Almost every tribute paid to Sir Alfred in the past by film critics and historians has {{emphasised}} his continuing influence in the world of film. It is that continuing influence, embodied in the magnificent series of films he has given the world, during the last half-century, that will preserve his great spirit, his humour and his wit, not only for us but for succeeding generations of film-goers.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} criticized by filmmaker and {{lecturer}} Claude Lanzmann, {{director of the}} nine-hour Holocaust film Shoah, who called Schindler's List a [...] "kitschy melodrama" [...] and a [...] "deformation" [...] of historical truth. [...] "Fiction is a transgression, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> convinced {{that there is a}} ban on depiction [...] ", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust {{through the eyes of a}} German, saying [...] "it is the world in reverse." [...] He complained, [...] "I sincerely thought that there was a time before Shoah, and a time after Shoah, and that after Shoah certain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway." ...|$|E

[...] Sesame Workshop also released a statement: [...] "Unfortunately, the controversy surrounding Kevin's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want, and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has {{resigned from}} 'Sesame Street.'" [...] They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash's understudy and would take over his roles on the show.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{until her death}} in 2002, Howard {{returned}} to her lifelong fascination with light, night skies, the reflective surface of water. In these last paintings, there is a recurrence of circular elements, an abstraction of natural forms and a balancing of darkness and light. [...] Howard has stated: [...] "In my painting (as in all my work) <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> involved with light as the movement and inter-action of colours; the integrity of colour and form, hence with {{the integrity of the}} total work which has to do with spirit and abstract essence, not representation. I am preoccupied with life's ambiguities and dualities and in my later work I am reaching more and more from the dark toward light, freedom, and a transcending exuberance." ...|$|E
500|$|Malouma Mediah was {{involved}} in a project in 2009, to relocate 9,000 slum-dwelling families from {{the outskirts of the city}} into inner city neighborhoods. She insisted that for health reasons, improvements would first have to be made to the infrastructure. In August 2011, the International Union for Conservation of Nature appointed Malouma as Goodwill Ambassador for Central and West Africa. The position required her to raise awareness of environmental problems with a view to introducing sustainable solutions. On her appointment she commented: [...] "I am delighted at the confidence that IUCN just placed in me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> honored. I will do my best to fulfill this great responsibility." [...] In September 2012, she performed in a concert given during the 2012 IUCN World Conservation Congress held on Jeju Island, South Korea.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{race was}} bitter. Miller called McEwen [...] "Pinocchio," [...] and McEwen said of Miller, [...] "His misrepresentations and falsehoods are gargantuan. I {{tried to be}} his best friend in the delegation. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> {{disappointed}} at the meanness of his effort." [...] Tom Deimer of Cleveland's Plain Dealer wrote that the two candidates were largely identical on the issues: [...] "both are textbook Republican conservatives, opposed to abortion, gun control, high taxes, and costly government programs — unless located in their districts." [...] Miller noted he had no overdrafts at the House bank, saying, [...] "the score is 166 to nothing." [...] McEwen said [...] "every one of my checks was free and clear. Every month's statement had a balance." [...] McEwen ran commercials against Miller claiming the long-time congressman [...] "has fallen {{out of touch with}} Ohio" [...] and [...] "doesn't live in our district and isn't even registered to vote here." [...] Miller struck back in a live-television interview by taking a Wheat Thin, claiming it to be McEwen, and then taking a bite out of it.|$|E

500|$|The {{match was}} the most {{discussed}} sports game ever on Twitter with over 35.6 million tweets, surpassing Super Bowl XLVIII, with 24.9million tweets during the game. At first incentive hashtags such as [...] "#PrayForBrazil" [...] were common, but once Germany built a 50 lead Brazilian users instead lent their frustration into self-deprecatory humor, comparing Germany's goals with the Volkswagen Gol car and stating the Brazilian team looked like [...] "11 Freds". Other Twitter users compared Germany's dominating performance to their military efforts during World War II and The Holocaust, for example, dubbing it the [...] "Goalocaust". Bung Moktar Radin, a member of parliament of Malaysia, came under heavy criticism from the Malaysian public and the German ambassador, Holger Michael, for posting such a comment. The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, stated on Twitter following the match that [...] "like all Brazilians, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> saddened by our loss". The Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yigal Palmor, mentioned the match when countering Brazil's claim that his country was using disproportionate force in the Gaza conflict, saying [...] "This is not football. In football, when a game ends in a draw, {{you think it is}} proportional, but when it finishes 7–1 it's disproportionate".|$|E

And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong." ...|$|E

That’s why I support the thorough vetting of individuals entering our country. However, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> troubled {{by the appearance of}} a religious ban.

2500|$|In early 2013, Applewhite {{admitted}} he was disciplined by the University of Texas for [...] "having an inappropriate {{relationship with a}} student at the 2009 Fiesta Bowl."

2500|$|At {{the time}} of his resignation, Benedict had {{completed}} a draft of a fourth encyclical entitled Lumen fidei ("The Light of Faith"), intended to accompany his first two encyclicals to complete a trilogy on the three theological virtues of faith, hope, and love. [...] Benedict's successor, Pope Francis, completed and published Lumen Fidei in June 2013, four months after Benedict's retirement and Francis' succession. [...] Although the encyclical is officially the work of Pope Francis, paragraph 7 of the encyclical explicitly expresses Francis' debt to Benedict: [...] "These considerations on faith — in continuity with all that the Church's magisterium has pronounced on this theological virtue — are meant to supplement what Benedict XVI had written in his encyclical letters on charity and hope. He himself had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith. For this <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> grateful to him, and as his brother in Christ I have taken up his fine work and added a few contributions of my own." ...|$|E

[...] President Barack Obama said, [...] "His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something I appreciated greatly as a young senator." [...] Senator Jay Rockefeller, who had served with Byrd since 1985, said, [...] "I looked up to him, I fought next to him, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>deeply</b> saddened that he is gone." [...] Former President Jimmy Carter noted, [...] "He was my closest and most valuable adviser while I served as president. I respected him and attempted in every way to remain in his good graces. He was a giant among legislators, and was courageous in espousing controversial issues." ...|$|E

It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness." [...] He offered an indefinite self-suspension without pay. Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC. This is on me, you know.
