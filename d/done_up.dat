25|$|The {{poppy straw}} methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, with the latex method in most common use in India.

25|$|Johnson {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that he pleaded with NACA to do model tests in its wind tunnel. They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested {{and did not want}} to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of Army Air Forces, ordered them to run the tests, which were <b>done</b> <b>up</b> to Mach 0.74. The P-38's dive problem was revealed to be the center of pressure moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35° in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.|$|E

500|$|Reynolds {{said that}} the most {{important}} principle of game design is for the designer to play the game as it is developed; Reynolds claimed that this was how a good artificial intelligence (AI) was built.

The designer also watched what the computer players did, noting [...] "dumb" [...] actions and trying to discover why the computer made them.

[...] "There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face." [...] Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC.

[...] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly assumed the theme of the video were the divergent hairstyles, but acclaimed the video for its fun.

500|$|Records of PTE exist from {{as early}} as 3000 BC. [...] Trepanation, in which a hole is cut in the skull, {{may have been used}} to treat PTE in ancient cultures. [...] In the early 19thcentury, the {{surgeons}} Baron Larrey and WC Wells each reported having performed the operation for PTE. [...] The French-educated American surgeon Benjamin Winslow Dudley (1785–1870) performed six trepanations for PTE between the years of 1819 and 1832 in Kentucky and had good results despite the unavailability of antisepsis. The surgery involved opening the skull at the site of injury, debriding injured tissue, and sometimes draining blood or fluid from under the dura mater. [...] Dudley's work was the largest series of its kind that had been <b>done</b> <b>up</b> to that point, and it encouraged other surgeons to use trepanation for post-traumatic seizures. [...] His reports on the operations came before it was accepted that surgery to relieve excess pressure within the skull was effective in treating epilepsy, but it helped set the stage for trepanation for PTE to become common practice. [...] The procedure became more accepted in the late 19thcentury once antisepsis was available and cerebral localization was a familiar concept. [...] However, in 1890, the prominent German physician Ernest von Bergmann criticized the procedure; he questioned its efficacy (except in particular circumstances) and suggested that operations had been declared successful too soon after the procedures to know whether they would confer a long-term benefit. [...] The late 19thcentury saw the advent of intracranial surgery, operating on brain lesions believed to be causing seizures, a step beyond cranial surgery which involved just the skull and meninges. [...] By 1893, at least 42 intracranial operations had been performed for PTE in the US, with limited success.|$|E
