A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large that it really is novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.|$|E

[...] Melton said that Sony has [...] "encouraged" [...] them to make it {{different}} from other films in the same genre.

In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get that across," [...] but she is hopeful that it can be done. As of [...] , , the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, a release date has not been set, but the script has been [...] "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million USD.|$|E

[...] He is looked upon {{as one of the}} best end rushers now playing. A sure tackler and always well down the field on a punt, he is an invaluable man. [...] He, too, however, has a disabled knee, and if he does not recover in time for the Yale game, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> fill his place.

2500|$|A {{campaign}} was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In {{the words of}} Erwan Le Corre: [...] "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or {{the benefits of a}} few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore." [...] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, [...] "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'" [...] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.|$|E
