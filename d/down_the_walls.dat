5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress waiting until the Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> {{with three or four}} knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E
5|$|In Boone, North Carolina, Wallace (David Denman) and Angela Schiff (Robyn Lively) {{return home}} after a day out hiking in the fields. Angela gets a {{headache}} and, while taking a shower, thinks that she sees images of a yellow substance running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Angela and Wallace head off to bed in one another's arms but as the camera pans out the scene shifts to their skeletal remains {{in the same position}} {{in the middle of a}} field. FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate and after closer examination of the bones, the two find a strange yellow substance covering the underside of the skeletons which was missed in the original examination. Mulder, believing that bodies are a result of the famous Brown Mountain Lights, heads out to the scene of the discovery while Scully stays behind with the coroner (Jim Beaver) to perform more tests.|$|E

The records were subsequently re-engraved on the walls from the book after the rebuilding was finished.|$|E
25|$|Despite the restoration, Thebes never regained {{its former}} prominence. The death of Cassander in 297 BC created a power vacuum {{throughout}} much of Greece, which contributed, in part, to Thebes' besiegement by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 293 BC, and again after a revolt in 292BC. This last siege was difficult and Demetrios was wounded, but finally he managed to break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and to take the city once more, treating it mildly despite its fierce resistance. The city recovered its autonomy from Demetrios in 287BC, and became allied with Lysimachus and the Aetolian League.|$|E
25|$|The siege {{began on}} April 3, 1563, when Ottoman troops massively {{attacked}} {{the tower of}} Todos los Santos, defended by 200 Spanish soldiers. The fierce resistance of the fort's garrison, along with artillery support from Mers El Kébir, inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers. However, once the Ottoman cannons tore <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> the fort was soon taken. Meantime Jafar's galleys blocked Mers El Kébir to prevent the city to be relieved from Oran. Ottoman's main objective was to capture Mers El Kébir, as Hassan was warned by several renegades that the Spanish planned abandon Oran {{to concentrate on the}} defense of the other town. Therefore, he destined most of his troops to take the fort of San Miguel, a key point of the Spanish defense, while only a few troops remained blocking Oran.|$|E

25|$|Once {{inside the}} fort, the Ottoman troops {{surrounded}} the city, digging trenches around and placing artillery to break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> On a nearby hill were also installed several culverins to bombard the inner town. Martín de Córdoba, who {{had less than}} 500 men available to defend the city, prepared for the assault. This one took place on 20 May. Hassan sent ahead to 12,000 alarabs to break {{the resistance of the}} Spanish harquebusiers and facilitate the assault to two columns of regular troops which would attack secondly. Despite the heavy losses they suffered, the alarabs managed to scale the walls and raise the Ottoman flag on the battlements. However, the Spanish expelled them soon. In that attack nearly 2,500 men died, mostly falling into the moat around the town.|$|E
25|$|Porter, enraged by Butler's timorousness, went to U. S. Grant {{and demanded}} that Butler be removed. Grant agreed, and placed Major General Alfred H. Terry {{in charge of a}} second assault on the fort. The second assault began on January 13, 1865, with unopposed {{landings}} and bombardment of the fort by the fleet. Porter imposed new methods of bombardment this time: each ship was assigned a specific target, with intent to destroy the enemy's guns rather than to knock <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> They were also to continue firing after the men ashore started their assault; the ships would shift their aim to points ahead of the advancing troops. The bombardment continued for two more days, while Terry got his men into position. On the 15th, frontal assaults on opposite faces by Terry's soldiers on the land side and 2000 sailors and marines on the beach vanquished the fort. This was the last significant naval operation of the war.|$|E
25|$|After the {{negotiation}} at Zaragoza, Charlemagne heard {{news of a}} Saxon revolt in the North, which forced him to retreat back to his kingdom. But before leaving Spain he decided to further secure his hold on the Vascone territory. Charlemagne first eliminated any possible opposition from the natives of the region (including the Basque tribes), believing {{that many of them}} were allied with the Moors. He gave orders to tear <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the Basque capital Pamplona, possibly fearing that it could be used for future conflicts. Some primary sources suggest that he destroyed the city altogether, and many towns in the region were also razed. Garrisons and military outposts were placed throughout the territory, and there were accounts of the Franks' harsh treatment of the Basques during their occupation. After securing the region, Charlemagne marched for the Pyrenees mountain pass in hopes of returning to France. Many of his notable lords, such as Roland, military governor of the Breton March, and Eggihard, Mayor of the Palace, were placed in the rearguard probably to protect the retreat and the baggage train. Unknown to Charlemagne, the enraged Basques sent their warriors in pursuit of him and his army in retaliation for the destruction of their city, and the Basques' knowledge of the region helped them overtake the Franks.|$|E

500|$|When the castle's {{outer walls}} were {{eventually}} breached, the defenders {{retreated to the}} relative safety of the keep. It too withstood {{the efforts of the}} siege engines, and once again John turned to mining to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> The mine was dug beneath the south-east corner of the keep. A letter sent from Rochester on 25November offers insight into the methods of medieval siegecraft. John ordered Hugh de Burgh to [...] "send to us with all speed by day and night forty of the fattest pigs of the sort least good for eating to bring fire beneath the tower". The wooden props supporting the tunnel dug beneath the keep were set alight to collapse the mine, bringing down one corner of the keep. Still the garrison held out and sought safety behind the stone partition or cross-wall in the keep, abandoning half the building. The Barnwell chronicler remarked that [...] "for such was the structure of the stronghold that a very strong wall separated the half that had fallen from the other".|$|E
500|$|Before the brony fandom arose, Hasbro had {{introduced}} new My Little Pony toys, including convention-exclusives, at the San Diego Comic Con International.

500|$|John FitzAlan {{the father}} had been a {{prominent}} soldier in the Hundred Years' War under King Henry V, and the son followed in his father's footsteps. On 23 April 1430, the younger FitzAlan departed for France in the company of the Earl of Huntingdon. [...] There he soon {{made a name for himself}} as a soldier, under the command of the king's uncle, John, Duke of Bedford. In June he took part in the Siege of Compiègne, where Joan of Arc had recently been captured. Later, he raised the siege of Anglure with the help of the Burgundians. On 17 December 1431, he was present when Henry VI was crowned King of France in Paris, where he distinguished himself at the accompanying tournament. FitzAlan's military success led to several important appointments of command; in November 1431, he was made lieutenant of the Rouen garrison, and shortly after also captain of Vernon. [...] In January 1432 he was appointed captain of Verneuil. [...] On the night of 3 February he was taken by surprise while in bed at the Great Tower of Rouen Castle, when a band of French soldiers from nearby Ricarville managed to take the castle. [...] Arundel was hoisted <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> in a basket; and made his escape.
