The first prototype of the glider, designated GAL.48 and which would receive the service name Hotspur Mk <b>I,</b> <b>flew</b> in November, only four months after General Aircraft Ltd had been given the requirement for the glider. An initial order of 400 Hotspurs was placed with General Aircraft Ltd in September by the Ministry of Aircraft Production, nearly two months before the prototype first flew.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{was an avid}} music lover, most {{interested}} in Baroque and Renaissance music. She sang in choral groups {{for most of her}} life, spending over 50 years in the Philadelphia Chamber Chorus. She was also a hiking and canoeing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, Kay Tobin (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in Rhode Island. Gittings described how they began: [...] "We hit it off, we started courting. <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> to Boston [...] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961." ...|$|E
500|$|Enola Gay {{remained}} at Suitland for many years. By the early 1980s, two {{veterans of the}} 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator Barry Goldwater in their campaign. In 1983, Walter J. Boyne, a former B-52 pilot with the Strategic Air Command, became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the Enola Gays restoration a priority. Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a [...] "sad meeting. [...] fond memories, and I don't mean the dropping of the bomb, were the numerous occasions <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> the airplane... I pushed it very, very hard and it never failed me... It {{was probably the most}} beautiful piece of machinery that any pilot ever flew." ...|$|E

[...] Hiro Ugaya, a Tokyo-based journalist and media commentator, assumed that [...] "images of cultures outside of one's own in mass media are always different from the reality. [...] When you're {{trying to reach the}} majority of consumers, images tend to be lowest common dominator". Nobuyuki Hayashi, also a well-known Tokyo-based tech and social media expert, commented that most of the reactions on Twitter were favorable, adding that people who blamed Lavigne for racism are non-Japanese, but society from Japan did not take it seriously.|$|E

In retrospect, Lazzara called Kahne [...] "a good producer," [...] but didn't think he was [...] "the right fit" [...] for the group. He added that what the group aimed to accomplish was [...] "just different than what he had envisioned both sonically and {{with all of that}} stuff". Reyes said he was [...] "pre-warned about working with him and I didn't listen to that. ... It was kind of very blank.

2500|$|In 1995, he {{returned}} to Los Angeles to record Loup Garou, again with producer John Philip Shenale.

All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, and she loved it. She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years. So <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> to Nashville ... That's got to go down in my book {{as one of the most}} memorable experiences in my career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wild {{was looking}} forward to a fast ride on his first country train journey in many years. In the early days of his youth, in the 1930s, {{railways}} were always pushing to achieve an average speed of 60 miles per hour (97km/h). He had grown up [...] "when speed was regarded as the essential thing on the railway". But disappointment in his trip came when he realised that despite the train's much-publicised but very brief dash at 160 km/h, the journey, over all, had the leisurely features of a branch-line train. ... In the end, the journey took 4 hours and 37 minutes – 20 minutes longer than scheduled, at an average speed of 70.6 kilometres per hour. [...] I was absolutely appalled by the whole thing. After <b>I</b> <b>flew</b> home that night, I looked up an old reference book. [...] I learned that if the train had completed the run in an even four hours – a schedule that was soon to be introduced – it would have travelled at the same average speed of 81.6 km/h as the London to Bristol Express in 1851.|$|E
