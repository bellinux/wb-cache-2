40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the LoMAK {{framework}} which enables non-programmers (e. g., {{people working in}} the Digital Humanities, History, Geography, Geology and Archaeology areas) to generate locative media mobile apps from KML files, a format that these non-programmers are familiar with. The framework has two primary components: a KML processor web application and an Android mobile 'player' app called LoMAK player. The KML processor parses KML files to: (1) extract points of interest (POI) and their associated media, (2) produce <b>geo-fences</b> for the POIs, and (3) render the PoIs and their <b>geo-fences</b> on a map. The framework also supports the editing of <b>geo-fences,</b> i. e., a new <b>geo-fence</b> can be drawn as a polygon. The POIs and their associated media and <b>geo-fences</b> are then saved as a sharc file on a server. The LoMAK player loads this sharc file to operate as a locative media application...|$|R
