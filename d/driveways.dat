5|$|June 5, 2007— Tropical Storm Barry {{produces}} 3.91inches (99mm) {{of rain in}} New York City. The {{heavy rainfall}} leads to flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, washing out roads and <b>driveways.</b> Roads and several <b>driveways</b> were washed out.|$|E
5|$|Access {{routes to}} the estate were also added to and enhanced; there were three <b>driveways</b> giving {{approaches}} from the North Downs, Dorking and from the railway at the west. Cubitt was responsible for building a siding {{on the north side}} of Dorking Town railway station, which was initially used for trains delivering building materials required for the mansion's construction.|$|E
5|$|This highway {{served the}} low traffic {{volumes of the}} day, but {{as the number of}} {{vehicles}} increased over {{the first half of the}} 20thcentury, issues arose with the numerous private <b>driveways</b> along the route. To overcome this issue of abutting properties long-established on the old Highway16 corridor, the DHO began purchasing a new right-of-way between Highway401 and Century Road by late 1967 for a two-lane bypass of the original alignment, avoiding all the built-up areas that the original Highway16 encountered. This route was designed to easily accommodate the eventual upgrade to a freeway when traffic volumes necessitated.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} assumption that plug-in recharging {{will take place}} overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or <b>driveways</b> with available power outlets, and they might {{be less likely to}} buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots, streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, {{and in the case of}} EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety. Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of Buckingham Palace, the improvement plans were revisited. The grand entrance to the park at Hyde Park Corner was designed by Decimus Burton, and was constructed in the 1820s. Burton laid out the paths and <b>driveways</b> and designed a series of lodges, the Screen/Gate at Hyde Park Corner (also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate) in 1825 and the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828. The Screen and the Arch originally formed a single composition, {{designed to provide a}} monumental transition between Hyde Park and Green Park, although the arch was moved in 1883. It originally had a statue of the Duke of Wellington on top; it was moved to Aldershot in 1883 when the arch was re-sited.|$|E
5|$|East Market Street crosses over a {{railroad}} as it leaves Celina. At Grand Lake Road, SR 703 turns south {{to continue as}} East Market Street, and SR 29 continues eastward to a divided highway. SR 703 then travels along the northern banks of the lake, with farmland north of the road. The road intersects multiple <b>driveways</b> and places, including the Wright State University Lake Campus and the Grand Lake St. Marys Lighthouse. Near Mercer–Auglaize County Line Road, the highway enters Auglaize County as Celina Road. The route intersects SR 364 at Koenig Road, which becomes concurrent with SR 703. The concurrency crosses {{a railroad}}, and SR 364 continues southward at East Bank Road. SR 703 enters St. Marys as Jackson Street, and travels {{toward the center of}} the city. The route turns southwards at North Wayne Street, then eastward at West Spring Street. At Main Street and Spring Street, SR 703 and SR 116 reach their termini at SR 29 and SR 66. SR 66 continues as South Main Street after this intersection, and SR 29 continues as East Spring Street.|$|E
40|$|Slow speed run-overs {{represent}} {{a major cause}} of injury and death among Australian children, with higher rates of incidents being reported in Queensland than in the remaining Australian states. Yet, little attention has been given to how caregivers develop their safety behaviour in and around the <b>driveway</b> setting. To address this gap, the current study aimed to develop a conceptual model of <b>driveway</b> child safety behaviours among caregivers of children aged five years or younger. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 caregivers (25 females/ 1 male, mean age, 33. 24 year) from rural and metropolitan Queensland. To enable a comparison and validation of findings from the <b>driveway,</b> the study analysed both <b>driveway</b> and domestic safety behaviours. Domestic safety behaviours were categorised and validated against <b>driveway</b> safety behaviours, uncovering a process of risk appraisal and safety behaviour that was applicable in both settings (the Safety System Model). However, noteworthy differences between the domestic and <b>driveway</b> setting were uncovered. Unlike in the domestic setting, <b>driveway</b> risks were perceived as shifting according the presence of moving vehicles, which resulted in inconsistent safety behaviours. While the findings require further validation, they have implications for the design and implementation of <b>driveway</b> run-over interventions...|$|R

5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Barry produced gusty winds along the Atlantic coastline which peaked at 60mph (97km/h) near Charleston, South Carolina. Around 200houses in Craven County, North Carolina, were without power after winds downed a power line. In North Carolina, adverse conditions {{from the storm}} delayed an elimination baseball game between the East Carolina University and Western Carolina University teams. In southeastern Virginia, the {{remnants of}} Barry caused over 60traffic accidents, which resulted in 10injuries. Rough seas off of Cape Fear left a sailboat containing three people requiring rescue from the Coast Guard. Rainfall extended into the Mid-Atlantic states through New England, with 4.50inches (113mm) reported at Absecon, New Jersey, 3.91inches (99mm) recorded near Central Park, New York, and 3.19inches (81mm) at Taunton, Massachusetts. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry contributed to heavy rainfall and flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State. Roads and several <b>driveways</b> were washed out. Flash flooding was also reported in southeast New York, and high wind gusts caused sporadic tree damage. In New Jersey, northeast onshore flow associated with the remnants of Barry produced high tides and minor coastal flooding.|$|E
5|$|US 46 turns {{east and}} crosses the Passaic River a {{fourth and final}} time, {{entering}} Bergen County in Elmwood Park. Immediately after the river, the route has an interchange for CR 507. Passing through more RIRO-accessed business areas, the road narrows to four lanes and has a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway. Past the parkway, US 46 continues as a road with some jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections (but still largely maintaining RIRO access to <b>driveways</b> and side streets), passing through a small corner of Garfield before crossing into Saddle Brook. Within Saddle Brook, the road turns more to the southeast and crosses over New Jersey Transit’s Bergen County Line. Continuing east, US 46 has an exit for with Outwater Lane and crosses into Lodi. Through this area, there is no access across the median of US 46, as it interchanges with Main Street. The route continues into Hasbrouck Heights, where it turns more south-southeast, interchanging with Boulevard. A short distance later, US 46 reaches an interchange with Route 17 and crosses New Jersey Transit’s Pascack Valley Line near the Teterboro station.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{elements}} of the Middle Road, to which engineers paid particular attention in future highway design, was controlled access. While the section between the Humber River and Highway 27 was built without allowance for private <b>driveways,</b> and was thus controlled-access, many at-grade intersections lie along the Middle Road west of Highway 27, and many adjoining landowners built <b>driveways</b> to the highway for access, an issue that {{led to the creation of}} legislation to allow the designation of a road as 'controlled-access'.|$|E
25|$|Frontage roads {{may be used}} to link <b>driveways</b> that {{currently}} have KY 9 access. This would control the locations of incoming and outgoing traffic on the roadway. Relocation impacts would be minor.|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} medieval times, people have used salt as a {{cleansing}} agent rubbed on household surfaces. It {{is also used}} in many brands of shampoo, toothpaste and popularly to de-ice <b>driveways</b> and patches of ice.|$|E
25|$|For example: Ray sells land to Joe on {{the promise}} that Joe can use Ray's <b>driveway</b> and bridge to the main road at any time, but Ray {{does not include the}} {{easement}} in the deed to the land. Joe, deciding that the land is now worth the price, builds a house and connects a garage to Ray's <b>driveway.</b> If Ray (or his successor) later decides to gate off the <b>driveway</b> and prevent Joe (or Joe's successor) from accessing the <b>driveway,</b> a court would likely find an easement by estoppel.|$|R
2500|$|A {{originally}} had common ownership of both properties. A {{also used the}} <b>driveway</b> during this period. A then severed the land.

Finally, the <b>driveway</b> is reasonably necessary for a residential plot; how else could A get to the street? ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>driveway</b> alarm always {{consists}} of two components, a sensor and receiver. The sensor is used to detected people or vehicles on the <b>driveway</b> and the receiver is the device which alerts the user or owner to this detection. Wireless <b>driveway</b> alarms consist of three components, the sensor, receiver and a transmitter which sends the wireless alert signal to the receiver.|$|R

40|$|A key {{strategy}} for successful access management is {{the adoption of}} <b>driveway</b> spacing guidelines that consider both safety and operations. The goal is to provide sufficient distance from one <b>driveway</b> to the next so that drivers can perceive and react to the conditions at each potential conflict point in succession. State DOTs {{across the country have}} adopted different <b>driveway</b> spacing standards that vary according to the access class and characteristics of the adjacent roadway, such as type of roadway, posted speed limit, and traffic volume. Utilizing the VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation tool and FHWA's Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM), this research examined safety implications of four different <b>driveway</b> spacing policies representing 13 states. The analysis involved calibrating the VISSIM model for an arterial roadway corridor in West Columbia, SC, and then using the calibrated model to simulate various operational changes to the corridor, including speed limits, traffic volumes, and the associated minimum <b>driveway</b> spacing criteria for the four different policies. SSAM was used to analyze vehicle trajectories derived from VISSIM to determine the number of conflict points. Experimental results indicate that posted speed limit and traffic volume are the primary impact factors for <b>driveway</b> safety, and thus, these parameters should be considered in establishing minimum <b>driveway</b> spacing. Findings from this study indicate that there are significant differences in safety impacts between the different <b>driveway</b> spacing policies adopted by various state DOTs...|$|R
50|$|The {{court also}} ruled that intruding into the defendant's <b>driveway</b> {{did not make}} the search any more {{intrusive}} or impermissible, as the <b>driveway</b> “is only a semi-private area”. Since the <b>driveway</b> is visible from the street, and serves as an entrance to the house for those who might, for example, deliver a newspaper to the house, there is no expectation of privacy in the area.|$|R
25|$|The {{gravel bed}} of rivers was an {{important}} source of income for millers and others who owned the rights of extraction. The gravel was sold for various farm and horticultural purposes, such as infilling drainage ditches, the surfacing of field entrances and <b>driveways,</b> road surfaces, horticulture, etc.|$|E
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} thrive in urban areas, especially in backyards, golf courses, parks, recreational areas, school grounds, and street verges, {{in which their}} presence may deter outdoor activities. If they enter homes or properties, they can harm pets if they are either caged, penned, tied or cannot escape. Nests can be built under pavements or even roads, as well as under <b>driveways,</b> foundations, lawns, edges of sidewalks, under patio slabs, in electrical boxes or near power lines. A colony can excavate huge quantities of soil, resulting in structural problems in <b>driveways,</b> pavings and walls, and can also cause the formation of potholes in roads. Additional damage by mounds can be inflicted on trees, yard plants, and pipes; some structures may also collapse. Colonies may migrate into human homes after heavy rain to take refuge from saturated soil.|$|E
25|$|The lawns {{contained}} many sculptural {{pieces in}} bronze, terra cotta, marble and stone. Depicting scenes from mythology, nymphs and cherubs, {{the collection is}} an informal contrast to the strong and robust lines of the French-style château.

50|$|The <b>driveway</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{projects}} of the NCC. The NCC replaced the Federal District Commission (FDC), which had been created in 1927, and the even earlier Ottawa Improvement Commission. The two-lane road replaced the industrial buildings and private boathouses that had stood along the canal. The <b>driveway</b> was lined with trees and gardens, and a series of large houses were built along it. It was originally known as the Government <b>Driveway</b> but was soon renamed the Rideau Canal <b>Driveway.</b> Several decades later it was given its current name. The speed limit for most of its length is 60 km/h (37 mph).|$|R
