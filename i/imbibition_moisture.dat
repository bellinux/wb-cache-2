40|$|The lack of {{irrigation}} in regions prone to drought, and flooding {{due to high}} rainfall or lack of drainage affects seed viability and the subsequent germination and crop establishment. Seed treatment {{in the form of}} coatings shows promise as an effective method to preserve the viability of corn (Zea mays) seeds in drought and flood conditions. Chemical formulations may help improve the seed corn vigor under these stressed conditions. This study examined the efficacy of β-aminobutyric acid [BABA] and N-isopropylacrylamide [NIPA] in inducing drought resistance, as well as the ability of lanolin and linseed oil to provide flood tolerance for seed corn. Germination rates and linear shoot growth measurements were used as indications of seed vigor. Uniform coatings of the treatments were applied to untreated seed corn, and treated seed performance was compared to an uncoated control batch of seeds. Water <b>imbibition,</b> <b>moisture,</b> and temperature were manipulated to replicate drought, flood, and optimal growth conditions. The preliminary results of these experiments indicate that these coatings did not significantly increase the viability during short-terms of stressed conditions. At suboptimal temperatures, uncoated control seeds displayed significantly higher seed vigor and growth rates. Manipulation of coating thickness and/or testing at more intense stress levels may be necessary for coating treatments to exhibit positive effects on corn seed resistance to drought and flood...|$|E
40|$|The {{size of the}} seeds, shape index, {{shape of}} the seeds, 100 -seed-weight, the colour of testa, {{germination}} and emergence tests, {{the values of the}} testa rates, the speed of the <b>imbibition,</b> <b>moisture</b> content of the seeds and electrical conductivity were determined in 13 snap bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). In snap bean cultivars, the seed lengths (12. 0 - 17. 24 mm), the seed width (7. 07 � 9. 17 mm), the seed thickness (4. 66 - 7. 23 mm), shape index (1. 52 - 1. 98), 100 -seed-weight (33. 69 - 67. 21 g), the speed of germination (24. 0 - 98. 0 %), the power of germination (32. 0 - 100. 0 %), emergence time (8. 0 - 14. 0 days), the rate of emergence (37. 8 - 93. 3 %), seed coat rate (6. 5 - 8. 9 %), water imbibition (89. 3 - 122. 5 %), the seed moisture (4. 1 - 9. 8 %) and electrical conductivity (4. 3 - 14. 5 mScmg/seed) were found. There was a significant and negative relation between testa rate and germination power (r = - 0. 7719), electrical conductivity and emergence rate (r = - 0. 8522), imbibition and seed moisture (r = - 0. 8617) in colored cultivars. A significant and positive relation was observed between water imbibition and electrical conductivity (r = 0. 9207) and there was a significant negative relation between seed moisture and electrical conductivity. However, there was no significant relation in white cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{determine}} the extent to which drill water might be expected to be imbibed by core samples taken from densely welded tuff. In a related experimental study conducted in G-Tunnel, drill water imbibition by the core samples was observed to be minimal. Calculations were carried out with the TOUGH code with the intent of corroborating the imbibition observations. Due to the absence of hydrologic data pertaining directly to G-Tunnel welded tuff, it was necessary to apply data from a similar formation. Because the moisture retention curve was not available for imbibition conditions, the drainage curve was applied to the model. The poor agreement between the observed and calculated imbibition data is attributed primarily to the inappropriateness of the drainage curve. Also significant is the value of absolute permeability (k) assumed in the model. Provided that the semi-log plot of the drainage and <b>imbibition</b> <b>moisture</b> retention curves are parallel within the saturation range of interest, a simple relationship exists between the moisture retention curve, k, and porosity ({phi}) which are assumed in the model and their actual values. If k and {phi} are known, we define the hysteresis factor {lambda} to be the ratio of the imbibition and drainage suction pressures for any saturation within the range of interest. If k and {phi} are unknown, {lambda} also accounts for the uncertainties in their values. Both the experimental and modeling studies show that drill water imbibition by the core has a minimal effect on its saturation state. 22 refs., 6 figs., 2 tabs...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} elucidate the physiological factor determining the association of seed size and seed coat quality with varietal differences in seed vigour, and to pursue an alternative on the mechanism of varietal differences in seed resistance to field weathering. Results of this study revealed that seed polymer change (seed volume change minus seed weight change during <b>moisture</b> <b>imbibition)</b> was the physiological factor determining the association of seed size and seed coat quality with varietal differences in seed vigour. The mechanism of varietal differences in seed resistance to field weathering, therefore, seemes to be mainly controlled by seed coat quality (seed coat-seed weight ratio and seed coat colour) through controlling the magnitude of seed polymer change during moisture absorption at postphysiological maturity, which in turn determine the degree of membrane damage in the seed...|$|R
40|$|Were {{evaluated}} some {{seed quality}} parameters of Mexican populations of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Also {{the effect of}} 1 % H 2 O 2 imbibition and different periods of seed stratification at 0 - 2 °C to promote germination were evaluated. Huge variability in seed viability was found with values of 2 to 87 % and {{in the percentage of}} immature embryos, particularly in the populations of central Mexico, which probably is due to a high level of self pollination, crosses with genetically related individuals, or drying cones in improper conditions. Seventeen hours was determined as the minimum period for <b>imbibitions</b> when seed <b>moisture</b> was of 8. 4 %, last value is inside the value recommended for long term storage for the species. Imbibition in H 2 O 2 at 1 % improved seed lots with good viability, but germination increase if cold stratification is used for 31 days. Further studies on seed stratification of Pseudotsuga are needed...|$|R
40|$|Visgueiro is a neo-tropical {{tree species}} with {{economic}} and ecologic importance. This work aimed {{to determine the}} <b>imbibition</b> time and <b>moisture</b> content of P. pendula seeds necessary to activate metabolism and improve their performance by priming. Stored seeds (2 years) and unstored seeds (7 days) were compared. After clipping, the seeds were kept in water at 15 C for periods of 4 to 28 hours to reach the desired imbibition degrees (20, 40, 60, 80 and 90 %). Seeds were then sown immediately in washed sand in the nursery (4 x 25 seeds/treatment) or dried for 7 days (24 +/- 2 degrees C and 68 +/- 3 % R. H.). Unstored and unprimed (control) seeds showed 59 +/- 8. 9 % germination, which was {{less than that of}} stored unprimed seeds (76 +/- 11. 3 %). Submersion periods exceeding 13 hours reduced germination relative to unprimed seeds. After 4 hours of submersion (seed moisture 26 - 31 %), both unstored and stored seeds increased their performance. Even higher improvement was verified when drying followed submersion. Thus, the positive effects of priming occurred in phase I of the imbibition curve. Hydropriming of 4 hours at 15 degrees C was found to be a simple and inexpensive method for P. pendula seeds since it increased seedling development velocity, brought the germination percentage of unstored seeds to a level similar to that of stored seeds and increased germination synchronization of stored seeds...|$|R
