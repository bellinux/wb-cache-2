40|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>supply</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as the key constraint to industrialization and economic development in Nigeria. Recently, the government of Nigeria has initiated a lot of projects aimed at boosting <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> but this effort seems to yield no positive results. This may be attributed to the inability of policy makers to identify the determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> for actual policy formulation and implementation. Hence, this study analyzed the determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Nigeria (from 1970 - 2009), using a parametric econometric methodology of ordinary least squares. The results showed that technology, government funding, and the level of power loss were the statistically significant determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Nigeria and that an average of 40 % of power is lost in transmission per annum. Thus, the government should inject more funds into the power sector to complete power projects with state of the art technology in order to enhance <b>electricity</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Belgian Army was {{stretched}} from Cadzand south to Menen {{on the river}} Leie, and west, from Menin, to Bruges without any sort of reserves. With {{the exception of a}} few RAF sorties, the air was exclusively under the control of the Luftwaffe, and the Belgians reported attacks against all targets considered an objective, with resulting casualties. No natural obstacles remained between the Belgians and the German Army; retreat was not feasible. The Luftwaffe had destroyed most of the rail networks to Dunkirk, just three roads were left: Bruges–Torhout–Dixmude, Bruges–Ghistelles–Nieuport and Bruges–Ostend–Nieuport. Using such axes of retreat was impossible without losses owing to German air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority). Water supplies were damaged and cut off, gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>supplies</b> were also cut. Canals were drained and used as supply dumps for whatever ammunition and food-stuffs were left. The total remaining area covered just 1,700km², and compacted military and civilians alike, of which the latter numbered some 3 million people. Under these circumstances Leopold deemed further resistance useless. On the evening of 27 May, he requested an armistice.|$|E

40|$|Nigeria’s {{economic}} history is coloured with {{various types of}} crises and fluctuations in important macroeconomic variables. These include crises in electricity generation and distribution, domestic and external debt crisis, {{balance of payments disequilibrium}} and fluctuations in key macroeconomic variables such as broad money supply, exchange rate, real GDP growth rate etc. This paper has attempted to investigate the impact of stabilization policies (monetary and fiscal policies) and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> on economic development in Nigeria using the OLS estimation technique. The time series characteristics of the variables were tested using the Ng and Perron (2001) modified unit root test and the (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). The result of the parsimonious estimates showed that broad money supply, government expenditure and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> were important determinants of per capita GDP growth rate in Nigeria. To test for the importance of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the model, we run the regression first without <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> and then with <b>electricity</b> <b>supply,</b> the inclusion of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the regression significantly improved the diagnostic statistics. The findings of this paper showed that albeit demand management is useful for the purpose of economic stabilization in Nigeria, it is equally important for policy makers to address <b>supply</b> issues, especially <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> This is because as the study shows, <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> is important to drive economic growth and development to the desired threshold...|$|R

25|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>supplies</b> can be {{classified}} as either distributed or centralized in nature. Whereas conventional, centralized generation involves few generation facilities connected via high-voltage transmission lines spanning long distances, distributed generation facilities are located close to the load—or in technical speak, on the customer side of the meter—although not necessarily restricted to local uses. In this scheme, distributed energy sources are more numerous and sufficiently smaller than central generating plants so as to allow interconnection at nearly any point in the electricity system.|$|E

Businesses also reopened, benefiting from free trade and voluntary taxation—the city treasury, Pântea claimed, collected some 170 million Reichsmark in revenue. According to historian Mark Mazower, the experiment was largely carried by corrupt practices, but also gave the Soviet-born Odessans a unique experience of capitalism.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. The monopolistic South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> {{industry}} {{is undergoing a}} transformation that would change its ownership and market structure. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether the strategic choice to transform the {{industry is}} indeed appropriate. A qualitative, case based study of the existing and proposed South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry was performed. Various strategic tools and techniques, related to both strategic theory and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry models, formed the basis of the evaluation. It was found that to overcome the critical weaknesses in the industry and to take advantage of the opportunities present in the dynamic and complex <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry the restructuring is appropriate. The restructuring would allow the South African Government to meet its objectives of having an efficient <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry and meet the huge suppressed demand for low cost electrification. South Africa intends adopting the wholesale competition model, however this study recommends that it should implement the single-buyer model. Should the restructuring be successfully implemented, customers in the South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry can expect high quality electricity at a competitive price...|$|R
