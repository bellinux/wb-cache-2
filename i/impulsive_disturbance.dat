Using the Lyapunov-Razumikhin method and stochastic analysis techniques, we obtain sufficient conditions which guarantee the p-moment boundedness of ISDDSs. Two cases are considered, {{one is that}} the stochastic delay differential system (SDDS) may not be bounded, and how an impulsive strategy should be taken to make the SDDS be bounded. The other is that the SDDS is bounded, and an <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbance</b> appears in this SDDS, then what restrictions on the <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbance</b> should be adopted to maintain the boundedness of the SDDS. Our results provide sufficient criteria for these two cases. At last, two examples are given to illustrate the correctness of our results...|$|E

Among the motivating factors {{is the need to}} study control problems related to mechanical systems subject to impulsive forces, e. g. active control of the suspension system of a vehicle, accurate pointing of guns, stabilization of an antenna on the space station subject to impact from space debris, or active damping of vibrations of flexible structures caused by impact forces [1, 2]. A reasonable control objective in all these problems is to design a stabilizing controller to minimize the induced operator norm from the <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbances</b> to the controlled outputs.

40|$|Numerical {{solutions}} of the thin-layer {{approximation of}} the compressible Navier-Stokes equations {{have been obtained}} for flows around an ogive-cylinder body with and without a small fixed disturbance placed upstream of the body tip. Locating the disturbance at positions in the flow field upstream of the tip provokes the same range of behavior of the asymmetric flow that was numerically produced earlier by use of a geometrical disturbance on the body tip. Results remain consistent {{with the presence of}} a convective instability mechanism, and demonstrate the potential for a precise mapping of the body's receptivity to fixed disturbances in the flow field. Numerical solutions were also obtained for the flow-field responses to impulsive upstream disturbances to determine whether there is a growing response to an asymmetric <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbance</b> that is consistent with presence of a convective instability mechanism. Results for surface pressure are interpreted {{with the aid of a}} mathematical model. The model suggests that the observed growth of surface pressure gradient with time and distance along a ray in response to an asymmetnc <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbance</b> is in accord with the solution of a Ginzberg-Landau equation, with distinguishing features of the solution being consistent with the convective instability mode of behavior...|$|E

40|$|While Partial Discharge (PD) {{measurements}} {{are widely used}} in testing power apparatus after manufacture, {{there is now a}} trend to extend them to on-site measurements. The major problem encountered in the latter measurements is the strong coupling of external noises particularly from discrete spectral interferences (DSI) e. g. broadcasting stations as well as <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbances.</b> A critical study of the performance of several digital filters for rejecting DSI is reported. The filters are evaluated with particular reference to distortion introduced on successive PD pulses. A new digital filtering method based on a cascaded 2 nd order IIR lattice notch filter has been proposed. The study showed that, for similar performance, methods based on linear prediction required longer filter orders when compared to cascaded IIR notch filters. The non-adaptive methods were found to be stable against <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbances</b> while adaptive methods were unstable. The new method proposed in this paper gave the best performance, low distortion to a sequence of PD pulses, good stability and fast filtering time. The performance at higher sampling rates, even with PD pulses of long widths was also found to be superior. Further, the method is implementable using fixed-point arithmetic leading to faster processing. Hence, the proposed method can be suggested for on-site PD measurements...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{designed}} {{properties of}} the transmitted signal, the out-of-band emissions can be partially mitigated by additional filtering. For example, one can apply additional high-order low-pass filtering to the modulating signal or band-pass filtering to the modulated carrier. However, the bandwidth of those additional filters must be sufficiently large {{in comparison with the}} bandwidth of the pulse shaping filter in the modulator in order to not significantly affect the designed signal. Within that bandwidth, the above analysis still generally holds, and the <b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbances</b> may significantly exceed the thermal noise level in the receiver [3] even when the average power of the interference remains below that level.|$|R

In particular, the attitude-pointing performance of the TOPEX spacecraft, when subjected to the TES disturbance, is analyzed using a three-axis nonlinear time-domain simulation. Results indicate that the TOPEX spacecraft could exceed its roll-axis attitude-control requirement during penumbral transitions, and remain in violation for approximately 150 sec each orbit until the umbra collapses.

Removing of specific disturbances, having form of separate pulses (<b>impulsive</b> <b>disturbances),</b> requires specific algorithms because of very wide spectra of such pulses. The use of median procedures, especially of weighted medians, is particularly effective in such filtering procedures.

The optimum weights of median filter depend on signal shape of deterministic signals. An analysis of frequency responses of medians is given in the contribution...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for noise reduction is presented. The method {{is capable of}} reducing noise of Gaussian, supergaussian and impulsive characteristics in degraded high-quality audio signals.
