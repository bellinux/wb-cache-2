25|$|The sterile insect {{technique}} was proposed by scientists Edward F. Knipling and Raymond C. Bushland, and was rapidly {{adopted by the}} United States Department of Agriculture in 1958. The technique centers on a unique reproductive handicap that prevents female C. hominivorax flies from mating more than once. The scientists reasoned that if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> to clinically sterilize and release huge numbers of males as breeding time approached, fertile males might be outcompeted {{and the majority of}} female flies would lay sterile eggs. Irradiating the males was used for sterilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} cooling {{involves}} removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the null point of the thermodynamic temperature scale, also called absolute temperature. If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease {{and they would be}} at complete rest in this classical sense. Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate about}} the nature of the mind is {{relevant}} to the development of artificial intelligence. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.|$|E

25|$|If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> for {{the working}} classes, by {{combining}} among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said {{that this would be}} a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.|$|E
25|$|The {{interval}} AC in {{the diagram}} is 'space-like'; i.e., {{there is a}} frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in which C precedes A. If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events A and C, then paradoxes of causality would result. For example, if A was the cause, and C the effect, {{then there would be}} frames of reference in which the effect preceded the cause. Although this in itself won't give rise to a paradox, one can show that faster than light signals can be sent back into one's own past. A causal paradox can then be constructed by sending the signal if and only if no signal was received previously.|$|E

[...] At Roosevelt's instigation, Shaw had the Mint (part of the Department of the Treasury) hire Saint-Gaudens to redesign five denominations of US coinage that could be changed without an Act of Congress: the cent and the four gold pieces (the quarter eagle, half eagle, eagle and double eagle).

500|$|For {{fifteen years}} Nolan {{had wanted to}} shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for [...] "quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting." [...] The use of IMAX cameras {{provided}} many new challenges for the filmmakers: the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras, and produced noise which made recording dialogue difficult. In addition, the cameras had short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes {{and the cost of}} the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. Nevertheless, Nolan said that he wished that <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> to shoot the entire film in IMAX: [...] "if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie." [...] In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating generation loss, raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18 thousand lines.|$|E
500|$|There are {{different}} views {{about when the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration came to an end. Shackleton's Endurance expedition is {{sometimes referred to as}} the last Antarctic expedition of the Heroic Age. Other chroniclers extend the era to the date of Shackleton's death, 5 January 1922, treating the Shackleton–Rowett, or Quest expedition, during which Shackleton died, as the final chapter of the Age. According to Margery and James Fisher, Shackleton's biographers: [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> to draw a distinct dividing line between what has been called the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration and the Mechanical Age, the Shackleton–Rowett expedition might make as good a point as any at which to draw such a line".

500|$|The Schiffbau-Kommission {{recommended}} {{building a}} ship with heavy armor {{to protect it}} from enemy fire, one or two [...] guns in the bow, deck-mounted launchers for the Whitehead torpedoes, and towed torpedoes to be used defensively against ramming. The launchers would be supplied with six torpedoes each. The ship would be capable of a speed of at least [...] from a twin-screw propulsion system, and it would not be equipped with a sailing rig. They also created an alternate proposal for a smaller, unarmored ship with just two to four light guns, in the event that their preferred vessel could not reach the desired speed. The Artillerie-Kommission proposed a smaller design with sufficient armor and a high speed but no guns. They argued that an attempt to build what they described as a [...] "universal battle-ship" [...] (i.e., the Schiffbau-Kommissions first proposal) was ill-advised, since torpedoes were still in the developmental phase and a vessel of that type would be expensive and risky, considering the limited budgets of the time. The Torpedoversuchs-Kommission recommended a vessel with submerged torpedo tubes, a ram bow, deck and waterline belt armor, and two heavy gun turrets if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>possible</b> to install them without compromising the ability of the ship to use its torpedoes effectively. Alternatively, if submerged tubes could not be made to work on the broad side, the ship should include two deck-mounted launchers with at least five torpedoes apiece, four heavy guns, and a speed sufficient just {{to keep pace with the}} ironclads of the main fleet.|$|E
