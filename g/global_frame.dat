30|$|In this study, all the nodes {{undergoing}} {{the proposed}} MSA process employ the initial frame length Linit. Linit is calculated as the upper bound of the affordable frame length. After the proposed MSA process is completed, the frame length {{of all the}} nodes may be less than Linit because of slot reuse in the TDMA system [22]. Therefore, Linitneeds to be reduced for efficiency. In the proposed MSA process, the slots are always allocated from each source-node side in a flow. Therefore, the slot index allocated by the destination node is the highest one in the flow. After the proposed MSA process is completed, all the destination nodes broadcast that slot index. If a destination node is related to multiple flows, the highest slot index among the slot indices allocated by the destination is broadcast. If a node hears a higher slot index than the one it currently knows, it rebroadcasts the new index. After some predetermined dissemination time, all the nodes calculate the <b>global</b> <b>frame</b> length {{on the basis of}} the highest slot index they learns, i.e., the <b>global</b> <b>frame</b> length Lproposed=the highest slot index.

40|$|Purpose: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} retinal adaptive responses {{in concert with}} the modulation of forward and backward adaptation induced by periodic global flashes using the global flash multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). Methods: Six normal subjects were recruited for global flash mfERG measurements, which consisted of 103 scaled hexagonal elements followed by a <b>global</b> flash <b>frame.</b> In experiments I and II, with constant luminance maintained in both local and <b>global</b> flash <b>frames,</b> the number of dark frames was independently varied and these frames were either inserted prior to or following the <b>global</b> flash <b>frame</b> to investigate the forward or backward adaptive effect of the global flash on the mfERG. In experiment III, the number of dark frames was fixed but the luminance of the <b>global</b> flash <b>frame</b> was varied with constant luminance of the focal flash. This was used to demonstrate that the adaptive effect related not to time but to variation of luminance. Results: All the central, para-central and peripheral direct component amplitudes were found to be significantly influenced by variation of the number of dark frames (p < 0. 01). Reducing the forward adaptive effect of the global flash enhanced the direct component response and it became steady after five dark frames were inserted following the global flash. Reducing the backward adaptive effect of the global flash also enhanced the direct component response but it started reducing after four dark frames were inserted prior to the <b>global</b> flash <b>frame.</b> These changes were different with luminance modulation of the global flash intensity with fixed dark frames, while the direct component amplitude grew approximately linearly with decreasing mean luminance of the global flash stimulation. Conclusion: The retina {{plays a major role in}} visual adaptation. Both forward and backward adaptive effects of the global flash on the direct component have been illustrated in this study. The results show that the forward and backward adaptive phenomena in the global flash mfERG are different and demonstrate that backward adaptation is found at the retinal level.
