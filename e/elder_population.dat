40|$|Background & Objective : Added {{to human}} life and {{achievements}} of the 21 st century {{is one of the}} elderly population. Age increase is not disease it is a normal change that affect everybody. Elders should be support due to aging, decrease their abilities and high risk conditions. Their needs will be asses and evaluate in physical, social and spiritual aspects. Therefore this study was done for assess quality of life and related factors in <b>elders</b> <b>population</b> in Bushehr. Methods & Materials: This is descript - analytic study that was done on 360 elders in Bushehr. Method of sampling was cluster random sampling. In this study use of two questionnaires include demographic data questionnaire and SF- 36 questionnaire for assess QOL. Data collected through client interview. Data were collected, recoding and analysis by SPSS 13 and descript - analytical statistic tests. Results: Results showed that mean scores of physical and mental health of Bushehr,s elders is below 50. So, results showed that physical and mental health aspects of quality of life have significant statistical correlation with economic status (p< 0. 001), employment (p< 0. 001), chronic illness (p< 0. 001), educational level (p< 0, 001), insurance service (p< 0. 001) and owner house (p< 0. 001) and no significant interrelation with sex, activity daily living and life condition. No significant interrelation between men and women in quality of life aspects. Conclusion: According to mean score of QOL in this study was 0 - 100, results showed that mean score of Bushehr,s <b>elders</b> <b>population</b> is below 50, and this is need to pay attention.

40|$|Introduction: The elders' {{hearing loss}} {{has been studied}} {{not only by the}} {{biological}} context, but also by the negative impact on the life quality of this population. The auditory prothetization is a basic part in the auditory rehabilitation. Objective: To evaluate the subjective impact of an auditory rehabilitation program in elders through the application of the HHIE-S questionnaire before and 30 days after rehabilitating therapy. Method: 47 elder individuals were evaluated and 25 were male. The HHIE-S questionnaire was applied before and 30 days after auditory rehabilitation therapy. Result: The mean age of the sample was 75 years of age. 57 % of the sample presented moderate hearing loss. The average score obtained passed from 24. 2 to 1. 8 points after the phonoaudiologic therapy period (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The average scores were significantly reduced after 30 days of auditory prothetization and phonoaudiologic therapy. However, such results may be overestimated.

40|$|International audienceOwing to {{a similar}} {{cerebral}} neuro-anatomy, non-human primates are viewed as the most valid models for understanding cognitive deficits. This study evaluated psychomotor and mnesic functions of 41 young to old mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). Psychomotor capacities and anxiety-related behaviors decreased abruptly from middle to late adulthood. However, mnesic functions were not affected {{in the same way}} with increasing age. While results of the spontaneous alternation task point to a progressive and widespread age-related decline of spatial working memory, both spatial reference and novel object recognition (NOR) memory tasks did not reveal any tendency due to large inter-individual variability in the middle-aged and old animals. Indeed, some of the aged animals performed as well as younger ones, whereas some others had bad performances in the Barnes maze and in the object recognition test. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that declarative-like memory was strongly impaired only in 7 out of 25 middle-aged/old animals. These results suggest that this analysis allows to distinguish <b>elder</b> <b>populations</b> of good and bad performers in this non-human primate model and to closely compare this to human aging...|$|R
40|$|With {{ever-increasing}} <b>elder</b> <b>populations,</b> age-related cognitive decline, {{which is}} {{characterized as a}} gradual decline in cognitive capacity in the aging process, {{has turned out to}} be a mammoth public health concern. Since genetic information has become increasingly important to explore the biological mechanisms of cognitive decline, the search for genetic biomarkers of cognitive aging has received much attention. There is growing evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ADAMTS 9, BDNF, CASS 4, COMT, CR 1, DNMT 3 A, DTNBP 1, REST, SRR, TOMM 40, circadian clock, and Alzheimer’s diseases-associated genes may contribute to susceptibility to cognitive aging. In this review, we first illustrated evidence of the genetic contribution to disease susceptibility to age-related cognitive decline in recent studies ranging from approaches of candidate genes to genome-wide association studies. We then surveyed a variety of association studies regarding age-related cognitive decline with consideration of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions. Finally, we highlighted their limitations and future directions. In light of advances in precision medicine and multi-omics technologies, future research in genomic medicine promises to lead to innovative ideas that are relevant to disease prevention and novel drugs for cognitive aging...|$|R

50|$|Folic acid food {{fortification}} became mandatory in Canada in 1998, with the fortification of 150 µg of folic acid per 100 grams of enriched flour and uncooked cereal grains. The purpose of fortification was {{to decrease the}} risk of neural tube defects in newborns. It is important to fortify grains {{because it is a}} widely eaten food and the neural tube closes in the first four weeks of gestation, often before many women even know they are pregnant.Canada's fortification program has been successful with a decrease of neural tube defects by 19% since its introduction. A seven-province study from 1993 to 2002 showed a reduction of 46% in the overall rate of neural tube defects after folic acid fortification was introduced in Canada.The fortification program was estimated to raise a person’s folic acid intake level by 70-130 µg/day; however, an increase of almost double that amount was actually observed. This could be from the fact that many foods are over fortified by 160-175% the predicted value. In addition, much of the <b>elder</b> <b>population</b> take supplements that adds 400 µg to their daily folic acid intake.

Methods: The investigators created the Farsi version of the CES-D- 10 by translation and back translation. Two hundred and four cases aged 59 and above completed the questionnaire. The reliability and validity of the translated CES-D- 10 was established through comparison with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a recognized gold standard method for diagnosing major depressive disorder.

Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48 h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} (P > 0. 05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads.
