25|$|Vaughan {{had a large}} vocal {{range of}} soprano through a female baritone, {{exceptional}} body, volume, a variety of vocal textures, and superb and highly personal vocal control. <b>Her</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> sense of pitch were just about perfect, {{and there were no}} difficult intervals.|$|E
500|$|Vermeer {{channels}} Griet's sexual awakening {{into his}} painting, with the piercing of <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> his directives to her posing being inherently sexual. In {{the opinion of}} psychologist Rosemary Rizq, the pearl Griet dons is a metaphor, something which normally would convey wealth and status. But, when worn by Griet the pearl is also a directive to the audience {{to look at the}} [...] "... psychological potential within ..." [...] her erotic, unconsummated bond with Vermeer, unclear up to that point if it is real or not.|$|E

500|$|In The Virgin Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was {{the third}} song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, {{revealing}} her characteristic black bra. She had lacy leggings and crucifixes around <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> her neck. Her hair was tied {{at the top and}} fell in unkempt manner around her ears. She had a tambourine in her hand like her two male dancers, and together they sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone, in tandem. The performance was included on the video release titled , shot in Detroit. She also performed it on her Live Aid concert on July 13, 1985.|$|E
500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} [...] "Dress You Up" [...] on four of her world tours, namely The Virgin Tour in 1985, the Who's That Girl World Tour in 1987, the 2009 {{leg of the}} Sticky & Sweet Tour, and Rebel Heart Tour in 2015–16. On The Virgin Tour, [...] "Dress You Up" [...] was the opening song of the set. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> her neck. As {{the beat of the}} song started, Madonna entered the stage and posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing the track. A performance of the song from the Virgin Tour was included on the VHS release [...]|$|E
500|$|In his {{decade in}} charge of the National, Olivier acted in {{thirteen}} plays and directed eight. Several of the roles he played were minor characters, including a crazed butler in Feydeau's A Flea in <b>Her</b> <b>Ear</b> <b>and</b> a pompous solicitor in Maugham's Home and Beauty; the vulgar soldier Captain Brazen in Farquhar's 1706 comedy The Recruiting Officer was a larger role but not the leading one. Apart from his Astrov in the Uncle Vanya, familiar from Chichester, his first leading role for the National was Othello, directed by Dexter in 1964. The production was a box-office success and was revived regularly over the next five seasons. His performance divided opinion. Most of the reviewers and theatrical colleagues praised it highly; Franco Zeffirelli called it [...] "an anthology of everything that has been discovered about acting in the past three centuries." [...] Dissenting voices included The Sunday Telegraph, which called it [...] "the kind of bad acting of which only a great actor is capable... near the frontiers of self-parody"; the director Jonathan Miller thought it [...] "a condescending view of an Afro Caribbean person". The burden of playing this demanding part {{at the same time as}} managing the new company and planning for the move to the new theatre took its toll on Olivier. To add to his load, he felt obliged to take over as Solness in The Master Builder when the ailing Redgrave withdrew from the role in November 1964. For the first time Olivier began to suffer from stage fright, which plagued him for several years. The National Theatre production of Othello was released as a film in 1965, which earned four Academy Award nominations, including another for Best Actor for Olivier.|$|E

500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who scratched the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change.|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> <b>and</b> Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really great year.|$|E

After she is proven innocent, Gibbs angrily states that Ziva is [...] "off limits" [...] to Eli. They reconcile, with Ziva relaying the rest of what happened up to being taken captive.
