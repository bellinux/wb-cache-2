Using the universal phytoplasma <b>primers</b> <b>P</b> 1 /P 7 and R 16 F 2 /R 16 R 2, we amplified the 1. 8 kb frag-ment extending from the 5 ’-end of the 16 S rRNA gene to the 5 ’-region of the 23 S rDNA, and a 1. 2 kb fragment from the 16 S rRNA gene. The specific aster yellows <b>primers</b> <b>P</b> 1 /AYint were also used and the expected am-plified fragment of 1. 5 kb was obtained. The P 1 /P 7 and R 16 F 2 /R 16 R 2 fragments were digested with 9 and 10 re-striction endonucleases respectively. The RFLP analysis revealed, {{for most of the}} enzymes assayed, identical pat-terns to those of members of the aster yellows group (16 SrI), subgroup B, except for Rsa I and Hae III, which generated profiles similar to those presented by phyto-plasmas from subgroup C. These differences could be explained by sequence heterogeneity of the two rRNA operons that are present in all phytoplasmas. Confirma-tion of the ACLL phytoplasma in Argentina expands southwards the already wide geographical distribution and diversity of the 16 SrI-B (Aster Yellows) group.

A band with the expected size (1. 8 kbp) was obtained from samples collected from symptomatic trees only. PCR products were used for restriction frag-ment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis after diges-tion with the endonucleases AluI, RsaI and SspI. RFLP patterns obtained were consistent with those reported for Candidatus Phytoplasma pyri, thus providing evi-dence of the occurrence in Tunisia of this hitherto un-recorded pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) {{were used}} to search genetic {{diversity}} and markers associated with drought tolerance in 20 bread wheat cultivars. These cultivars are extensively being used by farmers in Iran, 6 of them are known as drought tolerant. Initial screens involved growing 10 cultivars at seedling stage under drought conditions (- 5 and - 8 bar) exerted by PEG 6000 in a hydroponic experiment. These tests confirmed the tolerance of the 6 above mentioned cultivars. Thirty 10 -mer RAPD primers were used for fingerprinting of the cultivars of which <b>primers</b> <b>P</b> 6 (TCGGCGGTTC) and P 7 (CTGCATCGTG) produced respectively a 920 and a 750 bp band present in drought tolerant (absent in others) cultivars. These bands {{may be associated with}} drought tolerance in bread wheat...|$|R

The entire DNA fingerprint profiles were analyzed using unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). The 51 P. syringae pv. strains could be divided into five clusters based on 65 % similarity by Rep-PCR using BOX, ERIC, and REP <b>primers.</b> <b>P.</b> syringe pv. tomato cluster was well separated from other 31 P. syringae pathovars. P. syringae pv. tomato cluster included only P. syringae pv. maculicola and P. syringae pv. tomato. P. syringae pv. tomato strains could {{be divided into two}} genetic groups.
