60|$|In {{answer to}} a {{question}} which you put to me long ago on the subject of books of theology, I will confess to you that, although <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> rather widely <b>the</b> divinity of the Greek Fathers, Gregory, Chrysostom, and so forth, and have of course informed myself in the works generally of our old English divines, Hooker, Jeremy Taylor, and so forth, I am not by any means a frequent reader of books of theology as such, and as the men of our times have made them. I have looked into the 'Tracts' from curiosity and to hear what the world was talking of, and I was disappointed even in the degree of intellectual power displayed in them. From motives of a desire of theological instruction <b>I</b> very seldom <b>read</b> any book except God's own. The minds of persons are differently constituted; and it is no praise to mine to admit that I am apt to receive less of what is called edification from human discourses on divine subjects, than disturbance and hindrance. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>Scriptures</b> every day, and in as simple a spirit as I can; thinking as little as possible of the controversies engendered in that great sunshine, and as much as possible of the heat and glory belonging to it. It is a sure fact in my eyes that we do not require so much more knowledge, as a stronger apprehension, by the faith and affections, of what we already know.|$|R

It is to open and shut, and so, consequently, to let in or to keep out; and to do both these at the season; as he said, [...] "Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot"; and again, [...] "I {{commanded}} that the gates should be shut, and charged {{that they should not}} be opened till after the Sabbath." [...] (Neh 7:3, 13:19,20) And so you find of this gate of heaven, when the five wise virgins came, the gate was opened; but afterwards came the other virgins, and the door was shut. (Matt 25) So then, the entrance into heaven is called a gate, to show there is a time when there may be entrance, and there will come a time when there shall be none; and, indeed, this is a chief truth contained in the text--"Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able." [...] <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Scriptures</b> of two gates or doors, through which they that go to heaven must enter. 2 ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of his}} {{analysis}} of the [...] "crowd", Kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence. Kierkegaard stated Christendom had [...] "lost its way" [...] by recognizing [...] "the crowd", as the many who are moved by newspaper stories, as the court of last resort in relation to [...] "the truth". Truth comes to a single individual, not all people at one and the same time. Just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love. One doesn't love the crowd but does love their neighbor, who is a single individual. He says, [...] "never have <b>I</b> <b>read</b> in <b>the</b> Holy <b>Scriptures</b> this command: You shall love the crowd; even less: You shall, ethico-religiously, recognize in the crowd the court of last resort in relation to 'the truth.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Brenda Putnam, a {{well-known}} sculptor, {{was engaged to}} design the coin. On May 1, even before Roosevelt signed the legislation, the Director of the Mint, Nellie Tayloe Ross, sent sketches that had been submitted by Putnam to the Commission of Fine Arts. That commission had been charged by President Warren G. Harding's 1921 executive order with rendering advisory opinions on the designs of public artworks, including coins. On May 2, commission chairman Charles Moore responded to Ross, giving preliminary approval, and stating {{that one of its}} members would work with Putnam as she prepared the necessary plaster models. That representative was Lee Lawrie, who suggested to Putnam that she use stars to represent the cities of the Great Lakes region. Putnam had placed, on the map on the reverse, sketches of buildings to represent the sites of Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Toronto. When Lawrie wrote to Moore to report this and other progress, Moore joked about the coin having an enlarged star for Cleveland, At funerals <b>I</b> hear <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>Scriptures</b> to <b>the</b> effect that [...] "one star differeth from another in glory". So I suppose Miss Putnam's big star for Cleveland refers to the glory rather than the size of the city. Well, as a voter in Detroit I don't mind, and probably no Chicago person will ever see one of the coins. I am convinced that the whole movement is a coin-collector's racket that is going on all over the country.|$|R

Thy parent, I know, less nice in thy behalf than I am, countenances the addresses of that fierce and riotous reveller whom they call Henry of the Wynd.
