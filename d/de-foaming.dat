50|$|Sodium lignosulfonate (lignosulfonic acid, sodium salt) {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} as a <b>de-foaming</b> agent for paper production and in adhesives for items that come in contact with food. It has antimicrobial and preservative properties, and is used as an ingredient in animal feeds. It is also used for construction, ceramics, mineral powder, chemical industry, textile industry (leather), metallurgical industry, petroleum industry, fire-retardant materials, rubber vulcanization, organic polymerization.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the rapid}} release of {{hydrogen}} during the reaction {{and the presence of}} bubbling nitrogen gas, significant foam was formed upon reduction of the copper salt/surfactant solution. To counteract this foaming, octyl aldehyde (98 %, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), a known <b>de-foaming</b> agent, was added as needed throughout the process.|$|E
40|$|Most of {{industrial}} materials are made originally from powder as a raw material and are shaped into a desired shape, {{which is called}} powder forming process. The powder forming {{is a series of}} operations that transform particulate materials into a bulk body having a certain external shape and internal structure, and is related to unit operations such as size reduction, classification, mixing, kneading, <b>de-foaming</b> and granulation. The powder forming processes are very important since properties of greed body such as packing structure and density distribution of particles in the body dominate qualities of final products after sintering process. In this paper, we will review representative methods of ceramics powder forming such as pressing, extrusion molding, injection molding, slip casting and tape casting with a special focus on tasks in each method to be overcome for a better processing in the ceramics powder forming in the future...|$|E
