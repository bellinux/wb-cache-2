5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, {{most of whom were}} arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire took control. While the London Fire Brigade were <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson.|$|E
25|$|The fire {{continued}} to burn on the tower's upper floors. It was not {{brought under control}} until 01:14 BST (UTC+1) on 15 June and firefighters were still <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> pockets of fire when the Brigade issued an update on 16 June. Although fears were expressed that the building could collapse, structural engineers determined {{that it was not}} in danger and that rescue teams could enter it to search for survivors and casualties.|$|E
25|$|Fletchings {{are found}} {{at the back of}} the arrow and act as {{airfoils}} to provide a small amount of force used to stabilize the flight of the arrow. They are designed to keep the arrow pointed in the direction of travel by strongly <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> any tendency to pitch or yaw. Some cultures, for example most in New Guinea, did not use fletching on their arrows. Also, arrows without fletching (called bare shaft) are used for training purposes, because they make certain errors by the archer more visible.|$|E

Why, yes; the rugged Ramsay MacDonald, scarred with a hundred savage fights against the capitalist parties, still lifts up his horny hand for peace. What further need have we of witnesses? I, for my part, am quite satisfied, and do not doubt that Mr. MacDonald will be as industrious in <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> democracy in this form as in every other.|$|E

50|$|Limewash {{relies on}} being {{drawn into a}} {{substrate}} unlike a modern paint that adheres to the surface. The process of being drawn in needs {{to be controlled by}} <b>damping</b> <b>down.</b> If a wall is not damped, it can leave the lime and pigments on the surface powdery; if the wall is saturated, then there is no surface tension and this can result in failure of the limewash. <b>Damping</b> <b>down</b> is not difficult but it does need to be considered before application of the limewash.|$|E

50|$|Eight further pumps were {{requested}} at 05:56 {{to relieve}} the initial crews and to assist in <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> operations. As was the practice, the fire was also attended by the London Salvage Corps, whose principal task was damage control and to limit damage to property. This insurance industry funded organisation was abolished in 1984.|$|E
50|$|Both the Tyne and Wear Metro {{light rail}} system, between Tynemouth and North Shields, and the Tyne road tunnel beneath the River Tyne were closed down while {{the fire was}} active. A 5-mile (8 km) no-fly zone was also placed over nearby Newcastle International Airport. It took 25 fire {{appliances}} 5 hours to bring the fire under control, and <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> continued through the following day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. If {{the beam}} is {{injected}} into the ring with an offset a, it undergoes betatron oscillation. After the oscillation decoheres, the beam transverse emittance increases by ∆ε. To avoid this emittance increase one typically uses a feedback (or damper) that takes out the oscillation before it <b>damps</b> <b>down.</b> We show that using echo one can recover a fraction of ∆ε long after the beam oscillation decoheres...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{one should}} choose a {{catalyzer}} with small radius, but sufficient length as to completely <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> {{the concentration of}} the noxious gas. However, such devices would be characterized by high temperatures. For instance, the first catalyzer in Table  4, has r 1 = 0.021 m (that is the radius of the pipe connecting the various parts). This was the best result we obtained, but the average and maximum temperatures are higher in such case.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{attendance}} involved 30 pumping appliances, 3 turntable ladders, 3 emergency tenders {{and other}} specialist vehicles such as hose layers for relaying water long distances, including the nearby Regents Canal at Little Venice. The [...] "stop" [...] message (= [...] "incident under control") was despatched at 08:02 that morning, but <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> and standby attendance {{went on for}} some days. The incident {{proved to be the}} largest fire in Central London that year, and resulted in one of the largest number of fire brigade bravery commendations from a single incident. Four of the firemen later received awards from the Queen.|$|E
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 June 1979 at 8:27 pm, smoke was seen coming from the Priory. The London Fire Brigade {{fortunately}} arrived in good time and tried to fight the fire. Several teams went inside {{and tried to get}} the fire under control. Unfortunately, the electricity had not been switched off and as the firemen advanced to the seat of the fire, they were surrounded by great sparks and had to beat a hasty retreat. The firemen spent the next morning <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> the smouldering remains and looking for the cause. It was quickly established that the fire was an accident and not arson.|$|E
50|$|His {{opposition}} to Parliamentary reform continued and intensified {{due to the}} French Revolution of 1789; he spoke against Thomas Paine's doctrines and supported the repressive legislation aimed at <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> revolutionary sentiment in Britain. He supported moves to abolish slavery and campaigned for a reduction of duty on horses (suggesting a heavy tax on the employment of foreign servants be used to replace the revenue). He bestowed all of his significant land holdings in Exuma, Bahamas, to his slaves, in gratitude for which a number of towns on Great Exuma have been named after him, such as Rolleville and Rolletown. A {{large proportion of the}} inhabitants today are surnamed Rolle, some of the famous ones amongst whom are Esther Rolle, actress; Myron Rolle and Magnum Rolle, American football and basketball players respectively.|$|E
40|$|A design {{method is}} {{proposed}} to suppress stationary random vibration in flexible structures using a hybrid vibration absorber (HVA). While the traditional vibration absorber can <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> the vibration mainly at the pre-tuned mode {{of the primary}} structure, active damping is generated by the proposed HVA to <b>damp</b> <b>down</b> all resonant modes of interest of the vibrating structure and the spatial average mean square motion of the vibrating structure can be minimized. Only one absorber and one feedback signal are required to achieve global vibration suppression of a flexible structure under stationary random excitation. A special pole-placement controller is designed such that all vibration modes of the flexible structures become critically damped. It is proved analytically that the proposed HVA damps the vibration of the entire structure instead of just the attachment point of the absorber. The proposed optimized HVA is tested on a beam structure and it shows a superior performance on global suppression of broadband vibration in comparison to other published designs of passive and hybrid vibration absorbers.

50|$|Lithium was {{discovered}} in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was {{the origin of the}} drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.|$|E
50|$|Without treatment, {{raw water}} {{can be used for}} farming, {{construction}} or cleaning purposes. Farmers use it for watering their crops or give to livestock to drink, storing it in man-made lakes or reservoirs for long periods of time. Construction industries can use raw water for making cement or for <b>damping</b> <b>down</b> unsealed roads to prevent dust rising. Raw water can also be used for flushing toilets and washing cars, as well as any other purpose that do not require it to be consumed by humans. Water in this form is considered raw, as opposed to water which has been treated before consumption, such as drinking water or water which has been used in an industrial process, such as waste water. Contaminants usually make raw water unsafe for drinking by humans without treatment. However, millions of people in developing countries rely on untreated raw water for their water supply, sometimes purifying it by boiling.|$|E
40|$|T-Burner {{tests of}} an Al/HTPB {{propellant}} {{in conjunction with}} a Pulsed DB/AB Method were conducted to find an acoustic amplification factor. Aluminum-free and aluminum-heavy propellants were examined. Instant surface ignition was successfully made by the use of a supplementary propellant of fractionally higher reaction rate. With the presence of higher aluminum concentration in the propellants, the pressure perturbations were promptly <b>damped</b> <b>down</b> and the pressure fluctuations were no longer dispersive.
