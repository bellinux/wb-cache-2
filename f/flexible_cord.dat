50|$|A network {{analyzer}} system {{was essentially a}} scale model of the electrical properties of a specific power system.

2500|$|As {{electricity}} {{became a}} common method of operating labour-saving appliances, a safe means of {{connection to the}} electric system other than using a light socket was needed. Thomas Tayler Smith of London, England received British patent 4162 in 1882 for an [...] "Electric-Circuit Connection" [...] to [...] "enable the electric conductors conveying the current {{to one or more}} lamps, or along a <b>flexible</b> <b>cord,</b> to be rapidly and safely brought into connection with the line or main wires". [...] Smith subsequently received US patent 311,616 for the same device in 1885. [...] According to British Author John Mellanby there were British patents for plug and sockets granted to T.T. Smith in 1883 (No. 3883) and W. B. Sayers & G. Hookham in 1884, (No. 16655). [...] Mellanby also writes that there were two-pin designs by 1885, one of which appears in the (British) General Electric Company Ltd. catalogue of 1889. Gustav Binswanger, a German immigrant who founded the (British) General Electric Company Ltd, obtained a patent (GB189516898) in 1895 for a plug and socket using a concentric (co-axial) contact system.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two common}} misconceptions about {{the purpose of}} the fuse in a BS 1363 plug, one is that it protects the {{appliance}} connected to the plug, and the other is that it protects against overloading. [...] In fact the fuse is there to protect the <b>flexible</b> <b>cord</b> between the plug and the appliance under fault conditions (typical British ring circuits can deliver more current than appliance flexible power cords can handle). BS1363 plugs are required to carry a cartridge fuse, which must conform to BS1362. [...] Post-War Building Studies No. 11, Electrical Installations included the recommendation that Provision should be made in the plug for the accommodation of a cartridge type of fuse for 13amps., and alternatively, for 3amps. Fuses of these ratings should be interchangeable and be readily identified. [...] The original BS1363:1947 specified fuse ratings of 3A, 7A and 13A. The current version of the fuse standard, BS1362:1973, allows any fuse rating up to 13A, with 3A (coloured red) and 13A (coloured brown) as the preferred (but not mandated) values when used in a plug. [...] All other ratings are to be coloured black.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring circuit system (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance <b>flexible</b> <b>cord</b> fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated fuse. The ring circuit in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|E

5000|$|All {{electrical}} cables {{are somewhat}} flexible, {{allowing them to}} be shipped to installation sites wound on reels or drums. Where applications require a cable to be moved repeatedly, such as for portable equipment, more flexible cables called [...] "cords" [...] or [...] "flex" [...] are used. <b>Flexible</b> <b>cords</b> contain fine stranded conductors, not solid core conductors, and have insulation and sheaths to withstand the forces of repeated flexing and abrasion.

50|$|Pre-World War II {{practice}} {{was to use}} various sizes of plugs and sockets to suit the current requirement of the appliance, and these were connected to suitably fused radial circuits, the ratings of those fuses were appropriate to protect both the fixed wiring and the <b>flexible</b> <b>cord</b> attached to the plug.|$|E
40|$|The common {{electrical}} equipment as laptops, printers, refrigerators, table lights, televisions, etc., are supplied by electrical power cables, <b>flexible</b> <b>cords</b> and extension cords, generally of low cross section, constituted by stranded bare conductors. <b>Flexible</b> <b>cords</b> and extension cords {{are exposed to}} mechanical damages and other insulation stresses and so can be involved in overheating, arcing and burning. Mechanical damages of the stranded bare conductors can degrade locally the effective sizing of the cross section and cause anomalous local conditions and/or electric shock hazard. The circuit protective devices can be unfit to detect the faults of cords that remain so energized and available to electric shock and fire hazards. A series of simulating tests have confirmed how some fire ignitions of nearby flammable materials result caused from these types of faults. It appears necessary wiring the cords and extension cords with a grounding protection conductor also supplying Class II equipment. In fact involving the ground in every faults allows in AC systems a fast protection by residual current protective devices (RCDs or GFPDs). At this aim the use of special cables, Ground-Fault-Forced Cables (GFFCs), is recommended, particularly for cords and extension cords...|$|R
50|$|In type NM cable, {{conductor}} insulation is color-coded for identification, typically one black, one white, and a bare grounding conductor. The National Electrical Code (NEC) specifies {{that the black}} conductor represent the hot conductor, with significant voltage to earth ground; the white conductor represent the identified or neutral conductor, near ground potential; and the bare/green conductor, the safety grounding conductor not normally used to carry circuit current. Wires may be re-colored, so these rules are commonly excepted. In 240-volt applications not requiring a neutral conductor, the white wire {{may be used as}} the second hot conductor, but must be recolored with tape or by some other method.

50|$|The IEC 60906-1 system {{features}} some of {{the advantages}} of the BS 1363 plug. It is smaller than a BS 1363 plug, and is rated for 16 amperes instead of 13.

50|$|In {{electricity}} supply design, a ring final circuit or ring circuit (often incorrectly called a ring main or informally a ring) is an electrical wiring technique developed and primarily {{used in the}} United Kingdom. This design {{enables the use of}} smaller-diameter wire than would be used in a radial circuit of equivalent total current. The reduced diameter conductors in the <b>flexible</b> <b>cords</b> connecting an appliance to the plug intended for use with sockets on a ring circuit are individually protected by a fuse in the plug.

50|$|The use of <b>flexible</b> <b>cords</b> with plugs {{at their}} ends and sockets (jacks) to make {{temporary}} connections {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits).

These became known as patch cords, and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use patch cords.|$|R
50|$|An online {{demonstration}} {{is available}} to show the principle of operation of a 7-component version of a tide-predicting machine otherwise like Thomson's (Kelvin's) original design.

Not shown in the animation {{is the way in which}} the individual motions were generated in the machine at the correct relative frequencies, by gearing in the correct ratios, or how the amplitudes and starting phase angles for each motion were set in an adjustable way. These amplitudes and starting phase angles represented the local tidal constants, separately reset, and different for each place for which predictions were to be made. Also, in the real Thomson machines, to save on motion and wear of the other parts, the shaft and pulley with the largest expected motion (for the M2 tide component at twice per lunar day) was mounted nearest to the pen, and the shaft and pulley representing the smallest component was at the other end, nearest to the point of fixing of the <b>flexible</b> <b>cord</b> or chain, to minimize unnecessary motion in the most part of the <b>flexible</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E

50|$|Another example: Imagine a {{long cord}} that is {{slightly}} flexible. At short distance scales, the cord will basically be rigid. If {{you look at}} the direction the cord is pointing at two points that are very close together, the cord will likely be pointing in the same direction at those two points (i.e. the angles of the tangent vectors are highly correlated). If you choose two points on this <b>flexible</b> <b>cord</b> (imagine a piece of cooked spaghetti that you've just tossed on your plate) that are very far apart, however, the tangent to the cords at those locations will likely be pointing in different directions (i.e. the angles will be uncorrelated).
