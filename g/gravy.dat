5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in an oven and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and <b>gravy.</b> It is somewhat similar to a bagel.

50|$|In 1796, Bertrand <b>Gravier</b> helped enlarge Faubourg by {{including}} Phillipa St., {{which is now}} called Poydress Street. Years later, in 1997, <b>Gravier</b> died and Jean <b>Gravier,</b> his brother, was appointed {{to be the new}} owner of this prosperous estate. He continued in his brother’s footsteps by further extending the Faubourg to Circus Street, which is currently regarded to as Rampart Street. As Jean <b>Gravier</b> continued to expand the Faubourg region, he included land that was located near Poydras St., and approximately 40 feet in width, for a Canal. This canal linked with an agency in Bayou St. John, and flowed into an area which was called Hagan Avenue; although, this region between the canal is now noted as Jefferson Davis Parkway. In addition, to these expansions, Jean <b>Gravier</b> also designated a tract for a basin that linked to Canal St. During this time, the basin was an uninhabited district of land which was allocated for the community. He later called this Basin “Place Gravier”.|$|R
5000|$|The Exchange had its 1871 {{opening in}} a series of rented rooms in an {{existing}} building at <b>Gravier</b> and Carondelet streets. Although they moved several times, the Exchange did not leave this intersection until its closing in 1964. After constructing and then outgrowing a small building nearby on <b>Gravier,</b> the Exchange built a palatial Second Empire building in 1883, at the northern corner of <b>Gravier</b> and Carondelet. Noted for its lavish interiors, the building soon became a landmark in the city.|$|R

5|$|Traditional {{examples}} of English food include the Sunday roast, featuring a roasted joint (usually beef, lamb, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, and <b>gravy.</b> Other prominent meals include {{fish and chips}} and the full English breakfast (generally consisting of bacon, sausages, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, and eggs). Various meat pies are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, steak and ale pie, cottage pie, pork pie (the latter usually eaten cold) and the Cornish Pasty.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick <b>gravy,</b> mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura can also be the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E
5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make <b>gravy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Brown gravy: Traditionally a {{light and}} thin chicken, veal, or turkey <b>gravy,</b> {{somewhat}} salty and mildly spiced {{with a hint of}} pepper, or a sauce brune which is a combination of beef and chicken stock, a variant originating in Quebec. The <b>gravy</b> should be substantial, but still thin enough to easily filter down into the mass of fries and cheese curds. These sauces typically also contain vinegar or a sour flavouring to balance the richness of the cheese and fries. Traditional poutine sauces (mélange à sauce poutine) are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains like Sobeys even offer their own house brand versions.

40|$|The {{effects and}} {{desirability}} of utilizing dried whey in pie crust, muffins, and beef <b>gravies</b> were studied using taste panel evaluations and objective testings. In pas try {{the addition of}} whey caused significant changes. As the whey level increased to 10 percent of the flour weight, the crust became browner during baking and the shortometer recorded an increase in tenderness. The taste panel noted as whey levels increased to 10 percent and above that the color became yellow instead of creamy white; the flavor became undesirable; and pastry became less tender and flaky. Whey significantly increased the desirability of muffins by enhancing the golden brown color, producing a more desirable flavor and increasing the tenderness of the muffins. Whey enhanced the flavor of fresh <b>gravies.</b> The consistency and mouth feel rated undesirable in milk <b>gravies</b> when whey was added. However it was more acceptable in <b>gravies</b> using water as the liquid. High whey levels prevented excessive retrogradation, but had adverse flavor effects...|$|R
