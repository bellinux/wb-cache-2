40|$|This is a {{follow-up}} to the recent paper by Lazar Babu et al. [V. L. Lazar Babu, R. Batta, L. Lin, Passenger grouping under constant threat probability in an airport security system, European Journal of Operational Research 168 (2006) 633 - 644] which investigated the benefit of classifying passengers into different groups, {{with the idea that}} the number of checks and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> may vary for different groups. A basic assumption in that paper was that the threat probability is constant across all passengers. In this paper, we relax this assumption and consider the case where passenger risk levels are incorporated. We assume that passengers are classified into several risk classes via some passenger prescreening system, for example, Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II (CAPPS II). We consider the separate grouping of every class of passengers such that the overall false alarm probability is minimized while maintaining the overall false clear probability within specifications set by a security authority. Meanwhile, we consider the staffing needs at each check station. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. An illustrative example of the model is presented with comparisons to the model in Lazar Babu et al. (2006) using two performance measures: probability of false alarm and total number of screeners needed. Our conclusion is that incorporation of risk levels through passenger grouping strategies leads to a more efficient security check system.

40|$|It {{can be a}} {{hard and}} time {{consuming}} task for a decision maker to decide which parts of a network to reinvest in. There {{are a lot of}} parameters to take into consideration regarding reinvestments, for example age, number of outages, number of inspection remarks and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> remarks. Without any visualization, it is difficult to detect patterns in the data. Therefor, the decision maker is required to really know the network he/she is working with and to have a gut feeling of where to reinvest. The purpose of this thesis is to show that the decision making process can be much simpler and better supported when using GIS tools for analysis and visualization. This is done by designing a prototype of a web application that can produce multicriteria decision analysis on the parameters of interest for reinvestments in a power network. Traditionally, heavy desktop clients are for expert users while web-based clients are better for layman users. One of the greatest advantages of a web-based client over a desktop client is that it can be reached externally from any device that has access to internet. Because of this, the prototype is developed as a web-based client. Customer data can be sensitive information, this means that the data needs to be secure and directly accessible for the users of the application. Therefor, a 3 -tier architecture with client, server and database is used. The result is visualized in a map, which makes it easy for anyone to interpret the result. Since the prototype is developed to be used by none GIS experts, the weighted linear combination method is used for the analysis. The prototype is not fully automated and does not deliver an absolute decision, the goal is rather for it to function as an aid for the decision maker when deciding on the final reinvestment area. The prototype is evaluated by the prospective users of the application through a questionnaire and the results show that a tool like this would be very useful for reinvestments decisions. Since the prototype does not rely on topology or network structure, it can be adapted to other spatial decision problems than just reinvestments in power networks...|$|E

To test the best conditions for neural networks to determine the right TIS, we downloaded positive and negative TIS patterns from the database RefSeq (NCBI) [3] of five different organisms: Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio and Rattus norvegicus and used these to feed the network. RefSeq sequences used exist under three different levels of checking: reviewed, provisional and predicted, which reflects decreasing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspection.</b> Patterns {{to be used in the}} network have been selected using scripts for parsing sequence files which allowed selecting positive patterns by selecting 13 bases around anottated ATG start codons (9 bases before and 1 base after the start codon) and negative patterns by using non-start ones. The Multilayer Perceptron network has been chosen to perform the tests, as preliminary tests have shown a better performance of this network over others under the conditions used in our experiments. Inputs were presented to the networks by encoding the DNA sequence into a binary string, using a coding scheme where each nucleotide is represented by 4 binary digits: A= 0001, C= 0010, G= 0100, and T= 1000 (sparse encoding). We evaluated at first if the number of neurons in the hidden layer would affect the generalization capacity. We observed that for the five organisms tested and the three sets of sequences used, validation has not varied significantly using up to 30 neurons. Thus, we decided to work with the mean of determinations varying the number of hidden layer sequentially from 2 to 10 neurons.

Optimizing the panoramic algorithm is another goal of that project. By having the panorama images from the other project (which are fused image of the three camera images) in this project we are going to send the panorama images using wireless to an IPhone. One of the goals of the project is to find a real time transferring solution. As far as hardware solutions for wireless data transferring has difficulty to be in real time other solutions such as compressive sampling (or compressed sensing) is examined.

40|$|Summary form only {{given as}} follows. The goal of {{achieving}} better software depends on improvements in software development processes. This paper provides a nonparametric, quantitative methodology for evaluating alternative software development process configurations {{as a tool}} for process improvement. The methodology uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) for comparing the impact <b>of</b> varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> software <b>inspection</b> on project schedule, cost and quality. Since every phase of the development process can be inspected at varying levels, a large number of process combinations become possible. Thus a manager 2 Ì 7 s job to compare and select an efficient process configuration can become tedious. This is especially the case when several process configurations are being evaluated by comparing several productivity measures. Fortunately, data envelopment analysis (DEA) can be applied as a method to reduce the long list of candidates for best practices to a selected few process options for further analysis. In this study, 257 different process options were compared against each other. The input and output values for each process option were estimated and compared using DEA. Of this quantity, 7 models were identified as candidates for best practices.

This report discusses how a simplified POD curve, such as a step curve, could be used as the target for inspection qualification, or as an output from it. Work to investigate the sensitivity of relative risk reduction to the details of the POD curve is described from which it is concluded that use of a simplified POD curve could be justified. Two methods for quantifying the outcome from inspection qualification are described. The first method is a relatively simple process based on direct expert judgement. The second method is based on a more rigorous structured process employing Bayesian statistics, in which the subjective <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> belief in <b>inspection</b> capability derived from a Technical Justification (TJ) is expressed in probabilistic terms, and combined with data from practical trials results.
