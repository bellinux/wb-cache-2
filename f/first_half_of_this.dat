5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld {{was not alone in}} writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, he certainly had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E

25|$|In 1812, Laplace issued his Théorie analytique des probabilités {{in which}} he laid down many {{fundamental}} results in statistics. The <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> treatise was concerned with probability methods and problems, the second half with statistical methods and applications. Laplace's proofs are not always rigorous according {{to the standards of}} a later day, and his perspective slides {{back and forth between the}} Bayesian and non-Bayesian views with an ease that makes some of his investigations difficult to follow, but his conclusions remain basically sound even in those few situations where his analysis goes astray. In 1819, he published a popular account of his work on probability. This book bears the same relation to the Théorie des probabilités that the Système du monde does to the Méchanique céleste.|$|E

By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II. He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost, which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballet Russes conductor Pierre Monteux in April 1912. He also made a four-hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of The Rite; he and the composer Claude Debussy played the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> together, in June 1912.|$|E

He wrote that [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> episode was extremely witty and fast-paced." [...] However, he thought that the Max-Chelsea storyline should have ended earlier in the episode, and that [...] "love sick, mopey Logan has gotten very old." [...] However, he was complimentary towards Keith's plotline. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed feelings towards the episode, being critical of the case of the week while enjoying some of the secondary storylines. While stating that the episode suffered from [...] "the lack of exploration of Max's character" [...] and Wendy being underdeveloped, he elaborated that [...] "those are generally minor quibbles with a decent standalone episode, however." [...] He went on to praise the Logan-Veronica dynamic and Keith's investigation into the Dean's death.|$|E

She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. Way too much coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had no complaints at all about this episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not quite sure how to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E
500|$|For {{the second}} season, 83% of 22 critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were positive, {{with an average}} score of 8.09/10.

[...] Of 22 Metacritic critic reviews, 18 were positive, four were mixed, and none were negative; their average score was 80/100. Early criticism of the show focused on {{the slow pace of}} the second season, particularly the first half. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly, described the series as [...] "a nighttime soap", comparing it to [...] "a parody of a Samuel Beckett play" [...] that had very little sense of direction and few appearances of walkers. Nate Rawlings of Times online entertainment section noted that [...] "the pace during the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> season has been brutally slow. [...] They've tried to develop individual characters, but each subplot meant to add a layer to a character has been quickly resolved." [...] Later reviews from other critics, such as Scott Wampler of Collider.com, recognized the increased quality of the second half, stating it [...] "seemed far more intense, more interesting, better written". Recognizing the overall season, Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant offered praise saying [...] "the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show".|$|E

500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray {{gave the}} second part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was [...] "the {{difficult}} middle chapter of the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> crossover" [...] and that [...] "the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold." [...] He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a Justice League issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in Justice League 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the [...] "heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made [...] "Trinity War" [...] feel less like the big event DC has been building towards {{since the start of the}} New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil," [...] but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the Justice League of America series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and nothing really moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein.|$|E

The Roaring Twenties, often called [...] "The Jazz Age", saw an exposition of social, artistic, and cultural dynamism. 'Normalcy' returned to politics, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, Art Deco peaked. The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to {{a large part of the}} population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle.|$|E

[...] Berardinelli also said [...] "Dark City appears to be New York during the <b>first</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century, but, using a style that is part science fiction, part noir thriller, and part gothic horror, he has embellished it to create a surreal place unlike no other."

[...] Vice however was quick to admit, [...] "The special effects and set designs are dazzling", but ultimately believed [...] "Proyas makes a crucial error in treating the subject even more seriously than The Crow, and the dialogue (co-written by Proyas and The Crow: City of Angels scriptwriter David S.
