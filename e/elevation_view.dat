50|$|Water was {{sucked in}} through two {{rectangular}} intakes {{in the side}} of the chain steamer's hull. It then flowed through the turbine inside the hull. The turbine accelerated the water and forced it through the rear-facing outlets {{in the side of}} the hull. The outflowing jets of water propelled the boat forwards (upper diagram of the <b>elevation</b> <b>view).</b> To reverse the direction of travel, the reversing element was swung around so that water was forced in the opposite direction (lower diagram of the <b>elevation</b> <b>view).</b> The pump direction of the turbine was always the same, regardless.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the past}} when plots were {{completely}} hand drafted, a lighting designer would sometimes plot the lighting instruments on a transparent overlay which could be placed over the plan, section and/or <b>elevation</b> <b>views,</b> therefore allowing the [...] "blank" [...] views (containing only architectural information) to be re-used for other lighting configurations. The advent of CAD-based lighting design has made this practice obsolete, though occasionally useful.|$|R

50|$|A {{developed}} elevation is {{a variant}} of a regular <b>elevation</b> <b>view</b> in which several adjacent non-parallel sides may be shown together, {{as if they have}} been unfolded. For example, the north and west views may be shown side-by-side, sharing an edge, even though this does not represent a proper orthographic projection.|$|E
50|$|At the knuckle end, single {{ball joints}} are {{typically}} used, {{in which case}} the steering loads have to be taken via a steering arm, and the wishbones look A- or L-shaped. An L-shaped arm is generally preferred on passenger vehicles because it allows a better compromise of handling and comfort to be tuned in. The bushing in line with the wheel can be kept relatively stiff to effectively handle cornering loads while the off-line joint can be softer to allow the wheel to recess under fore-aft impact loads. For a rear suspension, a pair of joints can be used {{at both ends of the}} arm, making them more H-shaped in plan view. Alternatively, a fixed-length driveshaft can perform the function of a wishbone as long as the shape of the other wishbone provides control of the upright. This arrangement has been successfully used in the Jaguar IRS. In <b>elevation</b> <b>view,</b> the suspension is a 4-bar link, and it is easy to work out the camber gain (see camber angle) and other parameters for a given set of bushing or ball-joint locations. The various bushings or ball joints do not have to be on horizontal axes, parallel to the vehicle centre line. If they are set at an angle, then anti-dive and anti-squat geometry can be dialled in.|$|E
50|$|The TV camera {{consisted}} of a vidicon tube, 25 and 100 mm focal length lenses, shutters, polarizing filters (as opposed to color filters used on the previous Surveyor cameras), and iris mounted nearly vertically and surmounted by a mirror that could be adjusted by stepping motors to move in both azimuth and elevation. The polarizing filters served as analyzers {{for the detection of}} measurement of the linearly polarized component of light scattered from the lunar surface. An auxiliary mirror was used for viewing the lunar surface beneath the spacecraft. The frame by frame coverage of the lunar surface provided a 360 deg azimuth view and an <b>elevation</b> <b>view</b> from approximately +90 deg above the plane normal to the camera z axis to −60 deg below this same plane. Both 600 line and 200 line modes of operation were used. The 200 line mode transmitted over an omnidirectional antenna and scanned one frame each 61.8 seconds. A complete video transmission of each 200 line picture required 20 seconds and utilized a bandwidth of 1.2 kHz. Most transmissions {{consisted of}} the 600 line pictures, which were telemetered by a directional antenna. The frames were scanned each 3.6 seconds. Each frame required nominally one second to be read from the vidicon and utilized a 220 kHz bandwidth for transmission. The optical surfaces were the cleanest of any mission because of a redesigned mirror hood. The television images were displayed on a slow scan monitor coated with a long persistence phosphor. The persistence was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame and was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder and on 70 mm film. The camera performance was excellent in terms of both {{the quantity and quality of}} pictures. Between lunar landing, lunar 'second' landing, and the lunar first day sunset on November 24, 1967, 29,914 pictures were taken and transmitted.|$|E

The dynamic range and sensitivity of this camera were slightly less than those on the Surveyor 6 camera. Resolution and quality were excellent. The television images were displayed on a slow scan monitor coated with a long persistency phosphor. The persistency was selected to optimally match the nominal maximum frame rate. One frame of TV identification was received for each incoming TV frame and was displayed in real time at a rate compatible with that of the incoming image. These data were recorded on a video magnetic tape recorder and on 70 mm film. The camera transmitted 20,961 pictures during the first lunar day, January 10 to January 22, 1968. From February 12 to February 14, the camera was operated in the 200 line mode because of loss of horizontal sweep in the 600 line mode. During the second lunar day, 45 pictures were transmitted before loss of power caused suspension of camera operation.|$|E

A 1 μm radius microbubble stimulated using positive and inverted 2. 4 MHz pulses produced radius-time curves that matched (error < 10 %) with the experimental observation. A bound 2. 3 μm radius microbubble insonated using 2. 25 MHz 6 cycle pulse was observed to oscillate with max∕min oscillations 45 % {{lower than that}} of the free microbubble, this correlated (∼ 10 % error) with the observations of Garbin et al.

The result is a 3 D model whose geo-referenced, for this model I extract orthophotos and <b>elevation</b> <b>view</b> from the quarry, because it has a considerable size, 200 meters long and 70 meters high, and the aim is to visualize both in the model and in the finally, the cracks and faults wall, to study the risk of release.

40|$|Gemiler Island {{is located}} in southwestern Turkey and {{is known as the}} “Island of St. Nicholas”. This saint was the origin of our present-day Santa Claus. The island itself is small and {{measures}} 1000 by 400 m but it still contains an entire medieval city with antiquated structures such as churches, houses and so on. According to the style of architecture and decoration of the churches, the city is thought to have been built during the early Byzantine era. We started the Digital Gemiler Island project that was aimed at recording the topography of the whole island as well as the historical sites scattered widely throughout it in the form of 3 D models. During {{the first year of the}} project, we measured two churches in 3 D jointly with the Research Group for Byzantine Lycia. To show the preliminary results, we have developed an integrated presentation system for the project. The system has pictures with captions as well as 3 D models of the churches. Users can retrieve images from the image database of past excavations by pointing to an interesting part of the floor plan or <b>elevation</b> <b>view</b> of the buildings, while at the same time they can see and operate the 3 D models. ...|$|E
