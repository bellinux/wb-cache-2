The experiment was performed on board ship. Increasing concentrations of 4 -HR delayed the occurrence of melanosis during storage. However, 4 -HR could not prevent {{the appearance of a}} yellow-greenish colouration in the cephalothorax that diminishes the consumer acceptability of shrimps. The incorporation of protease inhibitors (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, <b>disodium</b> dihydrogen <b>pyrophosphate,</b> iodoacetic acid, egg white and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) into the 4 -HR-based mixtures improved the acceptability after storage, suggesting that protease activity post-mortem contributes to the reduction in the final acceptability of crustaceans. © 2008 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the effect on melanosis, {{biochemical}} indexes, and microbial growth in tiger prawns (Marsupenaeus japonicus) from aquaculture, using a formulation containing 4 -hexylresorcinol (0. 1 % and 0. 05 %) in combination with organic acids (citric, ascorbic, and acetic) and chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] and <b>disodium</b> dihydrogen <b>pyrophosphate</b> [PPi]). In vivo and postmortem application of treatment was evaluated. Prawns with no additives or treated with 4 % of a commercial formula based on sulfites were used to compare with 4 -hexylresorcinol. The formulations based on 4 -hexylresorcinol or sulfites inhibited the polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity under 0. 2 (Δoptical density [OD]/min/mL), instead of 1 (ΔOD/min/mL) achieved by prawns without additives, with the consequent delay in the appearance of melanosis during the 1 st wk of storage. Prawns treated with sulfites showed initially better protection; however 4 -hexylresorcinol proved to be more effective at the end of storage. The formulation based on 4 -hexylresorcinol at 0. 1 % concentration, provided in vivo, inhibited the microbial growth (total bacteria count, H 2 S-producer microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria, and pseudomonads), whereas the commercial sulfites inhibited the luminescent bacteria growth. © 2005 Institute of Food Technologists.

The incorporation of macropores with sizes of 100 - 300 µm {{has been shown}} to increase the resorption rate of the implant and speed up bone ingrowth. In this work, macroporous brushite cements were fabricated through foaming of the cement paste, using two different synthetic surfactants, Tween® 80 and Pluronic® F- 127. The macropores formed in the Pluronic samples were both smaller and less homogeneously distributed compared with the pores formed in the Tween samples. The porosity and compressive strength (CS) were comparable to previously developed hydroxyapatite foams. The cement foam containing Tween, 0. 5 M citric acid in the liquid, 1 mass% of <b>disodium</b> dihydrogen <b>pyrophosphate</b> mixed in the powder and a liquid to powder ratio of 0. 43 mL/g, showed the highest porosity values (76 % total and 56 % macroporosity), while the CS was > 1 MPa, that is, the hardened cement could be handled without rupture of the foamed structure.

40|$|AbstractDue to a {{fast setting}} reaction, good {{biological}} properties, and easily available starting materials, {{there has been}} extensive research {{within the field of}} brushite cements as bone replacing material. However, the fast setting of brushite cement gives them intrinsically low mechanical properties due to the poor crystal compaction during setting. To improve this, many additives such as citric acid, pyrophosphates, and glycolic acid {{have been added to the}} cement paste to retard the crystal growth. Furthermore, the incorporation of a filler material could improve the mechanical properties when used in the correct amounts. In this study, the effect of the addition of the two retardants, <b>disodium</b> dihydrogen <b>pyrophosphate</b> and citric acid, together with the addition of β-TCP filler particles, on the mechanical properties of a brushite cement was investigated. The results showed that the addition of low amounts of a filler (up to 10 %) can have large effects on the mechanical properties. Furthermore, the addition of citric acid to the liquid phase makes it possible to use lower liquid-to-powder ratios (L/P), which strongly affects the strength of the cements. The maximal compressive strength (41. 8 MPa) was found for a composition with a molar ratio of 45 : 55 between monocalcium phosphate monohydrate and beta-tricalcium phosphate, an L/P of 0. 25 ml/g and a citric acid concentration of 0. 5 M in the liquid phase...|$|R
40|$|The gold {{standard}} for bone replacement today, autologous bone, suffers from several disadvantages, such as the increased risk of infection due {{to the need for}} two surgeries. Degradable synthetic materials with properties similar to bone, such as calcium phosphate cements, are a promising alternative. Calcium phosphate cements are suited for a limited amount of applications and improving their physical properties could extend their use into areas previously not considered possible. For example, cement with increased strength could be used as load bearing support in selected applications. The focus of this thesis is, therefore, on how the physical properties of acidic calcium phosphate cements (brushite cements) are affected by compositional variations, with the ultimate aim of making it possible to formulate brushite cements with desired properties. In this thesis a method to measure the porosity of a cement was developed. This method is advantageous over existing methods as it is easy to use, requiring no advanced equipment. A model estimating the porosity of the hardened cement from the initial chemical composition was further formulated and the accuracy affirmed. Utilization of this model allows the porosity to be optimized by calculations rather than extensive laboratory work. The effect on strength and porosity of several compositional variations were also assessed and {{it was found that the}} optimal composition to achieve a high strength was: monocalcium phosphate particles in sizes < 75 µm, 10 mol% excess of beta-tricalcium phosphate, 1 wt% <b>disodium</b> dihydrogen <b>pyrophosphate,</b> and 0. 5 M citric acid in a liquid-to-powder ratio of 0. 22 ml/g. This composition gave the highest compressive strength historically measured for this type of cement, i. e., 74. 4 (± 10. 7)  MPa. Although such a high strength may not be necessary for all applications, it allows for the use of brushite cements in new applications. Furthermore, a high strength of the bulk allows for alterations to the cement that cause a decrease in strength. One application is fast degrading materials, allowing rapid bone ingrowth. A fast degradation is obtained with a high macroporosity, which would reduce strength. The high strength composition was therefore utilized to achieve brushite cement with a high macroporosity...|$|R
40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids {{deals with the}} safety evaluation of an iron based oxygen absorber, comprising polyethyleneglycol, <b>disodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> monosodium phosphate and sodium chloride. This mixture is incorporated in polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) articles intended to be in contact with foodstuffs for hot fill/pasteurisation and/or long term storage at room temperature. For dried and fatty foods, {{direct contact with the}} materials is envisaged whereas other food types will be separated from the active material by a layer that does not contain the active components. All the substances constituting the oxygen absorber system have been evaluated and authorised for use as plastic food contact materials, as food additives or as food supplements. Based on migration results, the specific migration limits for iron, polyethyleneglycol, pyrophosphoric acid salts, phosphoric acid salts and sodium chloride, and the tolerable intake of phosphorus (phosphate) are not expected to be exceeded when the oxygen absorber system is used under the intended conditions of use, notably behind a layer not containing the active substance for contact with aqueous or acidic foods. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the substances, iron, polyethyleneglycol, <b>disodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate,</b> monosodium phosphate and sodium chloride do not raise a safety concern when used as oxygen absorbers incorporated in polyethylene and in polypropylene articles used for long time storage and/or hot fill up to 95 °C for several minutes in i) direct contact with dry and fatty foods and ii) indirect contact with aqueous or acidic foods, separated from the active material by a layer of at least 10 µm polyethylene or polypropylene that does not contain the oxygen absorber formulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and investigate novel layered materials with potential as biomaterials. This study has concentrated on layered calcium phosphate phases and their analogues due to their obvious biocompatibility and potential for resorption. Materials were prepared using a range of synthetic techniques including ceramic methods, acid flux and hydrothermal synthesis. Some of the layered phases prepared were then modified using intercalation and exfoliation. Characterisation was performed mainly using powder X ray diffraction with thermogravimetric and fourier transform infrared providing further means of analysis. When possible, single crystal X ray diffraction was also utilised. Investigations were performed on metal alkyl phosphates with strontium pentyl and phenyl phosphate phases being fully characterised by single crystal X ray diffraction. To our knowledge, this represented a rare family of inorganic/organic hybrid materials whose structures have been characterised in any detail. These structures show inorganic metal phosphate layers separated by organic layers containing alkyl chains displaying an unexpected cooperative ordering. The intercalation and exfoliation properties of monocalcium phosphate monohydrate [MCPM] were studied and a monoamine intercalated version of this MCPM was successfully prepared. These materials were investigated as a component of a calcium phosphate bone cement system, whereby, the inclusion of this amine intercalated MCPM species had a potentially useful retarding effect upon the setting of the cement. Layered calcium pyrophosphates were investigated due to their similar lamellar structure and slower dissolution rates compared with MCPM. Two previously known layered calcium pyrophosphate phases were successfully synthesised, namely calcium pyrophosphate tetrahydrate (Ca 2 P 2 O 7 • 4 H 2 O) and calcium <b>disodium</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> tetrahydrate (CaNa 2 P 2 O 7 • 4 H 2 O) and their intercalation, ion exchange and exfoliation reactions were studied to determine whether it was possible to exploit their layered structures.

40|$|Four {{batches of}} pasteurized process cheese were {{prepared}} {{from the same}} Cheddar cheese by cooking to 82 C {{in the presence of}} sodium citrate, <b>disodium</b> phosphate, tetrasodium <b>pyrophosphate</b> or sodium aluminum phosphate. Each batch contained the same moisture (40. 6 %) and emulsifying salt concentration (2. 5 %). The process cheese was sampled for microstructural and rheological examination after 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 min in the cooker at 82 C. Even though each emulsifying salt affected the physical properties of the process cheese differently, the cheese generally became firmer, stiffer, more elastic and less meltable as cooking time increased from 0 to 40 min. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the dimension of fat masses and an increase in the degree of emulsification as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The degree of emulsification (fineness of fat particles) seemed directly related to firmness, poor meltability, toughness, breaking force, apparent stiffness modulus, degree of elasticity, apparent ultimate stress and inversely related to hysteresis and apparent ultimate strain. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate produced the most rapid emulsification of the fat in the cheese and sodium aluminum phosphate the slowest. The effect of the other salts was intermediate. The softest most meltable cheese was poorly emulsified while the firmest most sliceable was well emulsified. Sodium citrate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate crystals remained undissolved in the cheese after 40 min in the cooker while sodium aluminum phosphate crystals were still undissolved after 10 min. There was a close statistical relationship among several of the rheological measurements viz. meltability and firmness, toughness and breaking force, and meltability and breaking force. Future rheological studies on process cheese should not require all of the above measurements. An increase in the fineness of the fat emulsion as determined by scanning electron microscopy was generally accompanied by increased firmness, poorer meltability and increased toughness...|$|R
