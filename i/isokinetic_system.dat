Method Thirty normal persons without any disease involving the central or {{peripheral nervous system}} were enrolled in this study. The portable hand-driven <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system</b> is able to measure the joint angle, angular velocity, electromyographic (EMG) signals, and torque during elbow passive extension-flexion. One set of 10 passive elbow extension and flexion movements was performed for data acquisition at each angular velocity, including 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 degrees per second (o/sec). Electromyographic {{data were collected from}} the biceps brachii and the triceps brachii. Torque data were collected from sensors around the wrist. Results We were able to detect EMG activity and torque in all subjects by using the new portable hand-driven <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system.</b> EMG activity and torque increased with incremental increase of angular velocities. Th e joint angle of maximal EMG activity according to diff erent angular velocities did not show any signifi cant diff erence (116 o- 127 o in elbow extension and 37 o- 66 o in elbow flexion). The joint angles of maximal torque according to diff erent angular velocities were not signifi cantly diff erent either. Conclusion Using the portable hand-driven <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system</b> on the elbows of normal subjects, we were able to obtain expected results.

40|$|Objective: Evaluation of {{proprioception}} of {{the wrist}} in cases of hemiplegia after a Cerebro Vascular Event (CVE) using <b>isokinetic</b> <b>systems</b> and improving the proprioception {{with the aid of}} these systems. Materials and Methods: Seventy-five patients with hemiplegia after CVE and 50 healthy control subjects were included in this study. Assessments were made in the affected hand of the patient group and in the dominant hand of the control group by using a computed isokinetic dynamometer. Passive joint position sensation in the wrist was measured by using computerised isokinetic dynamometer as target angle 15 ° extension with 2 °/sec angular velocity, 15 ° flexion with 2 °/sec angular velocity and 20 ° extension with 45 °/sec angular velocity. Three measurements were made for each target position in the patient and control groups. The average of three measurements were obtained (test 1, 2, 3). Results: There were statistically significant differences between groups in test 1, test 2 and test 3 with respect to failure rate of joint position sensation (p< 0, 05). Conclusion: Proprioception, especially sense of joint position,is necessary in daily activities such as grasping and releasing. The diagnosis of loss of proprioception is important for both the clinician and the patient, because this affects rehabilitation programme and can explain the failure of the patient’s response to treatment.

40|$|The term Adaptive Force (AF) {{describes}} {{the capability of}} adaptation of the nerve-muscle-system to externally applied forces during isometric and eccentric muscle action. This ability {{plays an important role}} in real life motions as well as in sports. The focus of this paper is on the specific measurement method of this neuromuscular action, which can be seen as innovative. A measuring system based on the use of compressed air was constructed and evaluated for this neuromuscular function. It depends on the physical conditions of the subject, at which force level it deviates from the quasi isometric position and merges into eccentric muscle action. The device enables – in contrast to the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>systems</b> – a measure of strength without forced motion. Evaluation of the scientific quality criteria of the devices was done by measurements regarding the intra- and interrater-, the test-retest-reliability and fatiguing measurements. Comparisons of the pneumatic device with a dynamometer were also done. Looking at the mechanical evaluation, the results show a high level of consistency (r²= 0. 94 to 0. 96). The parallel test reliability delivers a very high and significant correlation (ρ= 0. 976; p= 0. 000). Including the biological system, the concordance of three different raters is very high (p= 0. 001, Cronbachs alpha α= 0. 987). The test retest with 4 subjects over five weeks speaks for the reliability of the device in showing no statistically significant differences. These evaluations indicate that the scientific evaluation criteria are fulfilled. The specific feature of this system is that an isometric position can be maintained while the externally impacting force rises. Moreover, the device can capture concentric, static and eccentric strength values. Fields of application are performance diagnostics in sports and medicine...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate muscular performance and proprioception at the ankle in diabetic neuropathic patients with quantitative and standardized tools and correlate these findings with those of sural nerve conduction velocity (sural NCV) and amplitude. Methods: Fifteen male patients with diabetic neuropathy participated in this study, with age ranged from 40 to 55 years, and fifteen age-matched healthy subjects participated as a control group. Biodex <b>Isokinetic</b> <b>System</b> was used to assess the strength of ankle dorsiflexors and planter flexors and ankle reposition accuracy. Berg balance test was used to assess balance. Sural nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and amplitude were examined by diabetic polyneuropathy check (DPN-check) device. Results: The results showed a significant decrease in the mean peak torque values of the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors and a significant increase in the reposition error in the diabetic neuropathic group (p= 0. 0001). The results also revealed a significant decrease in the mean values of the Berg balance scores in diabetic neuropathy group (p= 0. 0001).

One of the common ways to reduce fatigue is passive recovering or using massage and cryotherapy after exercise. The present study aimed to compare the effects of massage and cryotherapy on muscles fatigue and isokinetic parameters. Methods: This study was conducted on 54 healthy athletes aged 20 - 30 years who were randomly divided into three groups: cooling (ice therapy), massage, and control (resting). Each of the volunteers was evaluated in two sessions. The first session was to familiarize the participants with isokinetic contraction. The second session started with a brief warm up subsequently, using Biodex <b>Isokinetic</b> <b>System</b> Average Peak Torque (APTQ), Average Power (AP), and Total Work (TW) were measured. Then, the fatigue protocol was applied. Afterwards, interventions were performed for 15 minutes. After the intervention, isokinetic parameters were evaluated again. Also, perceived fatigue and Fatigue Index (FI) were recorded before and after the intervention. Results: APTQ, AP, and TW significantly increased in massage and cryotherapy groups after the intervention, while perceived fatigue and FI decreased significantly in both conditions (P 0. 05), but perceived fatigue and FI decreased significantly (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Massage and cryotherapy could increase isokinetic parameters and decrease FI and perceived fatigue.

40|$|Introduction: The {{most common}} cause of {{mortality}} and morbidity among osteoporotic individuals is bone fracture which in many cases {{is a direct result of}} falls. Individual factors contributing to the risk of fall are poor postural balance and lack of muscle strength. Our aims were to assess postural dynamic balance in osteoporotic women and to describe the effective factors on the balance performance. Methods: Twenty osteoporotic women with kyphosis, 50 osteoporotic women without kyphosis, and 30 healthy women were included in the study. Anterior/Posterior (AP), Medial/Lateral (ML) and Overall (OA) stability indices were obtained using Biodex Stability System (Biodex Medical System, Shirley, NY). Subjects were tested both with eyes open and eyes closed. Quadriceps-hamstring muscles’ strength were measured with <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system</b> at angular speeds of 60 - 180 - 300 °/sec. Results: OA, AP, ML stability indices in the group with osteoporosis were found to be statistically significantly higher in the open-eyed balance test. When a correlation analysis was performed on all osteoporotic patients, a negative correlation was detected between balance stability indices and knee flexion-extension strength at 60 °/sec and knee flexion strength at 300 °/sec. Multivariable regression analysis revealed knee extension strength at 60 °/sec to be the most effective factor contributing to balance in osteoporotic patients. Conclusion: Postural balance in osteoporotic women presenting is significantly worse than in the healthy women and the factor exerting the greatest influence on balance is quadriceps muscle strength. Therefore, particular importance must be given to balance and quadriceps strengthening exercises in order to prevent falls in osteoporotic patients.

Nineteen healthy male university students were enrolled. The wrist-taping method involved winding a rigid tape around wrist joint thrice. A qualified athletic trainer adjusted taping pressures using a pressure measuring system, whose sensor was on the palmaris longus muscle tendon of the dominant wrist. Isokinetic dorsal and palmar flexion strength was measured by an <b>isokinetic</b> dynamometer <b>system.</b> Taping pressure [5, 30, 60, and 90 hPa and control (no tape) ] and angular velocity [slow (60 °/sec), moderate (180 °/sec), and fast (300 °/sec) ] were considered independent variables. Peak torque (Nm) of isokinetic strength exertion was considered the dependent variable. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (taping pressure × angular velocity) was used to calculate the mean differences for peak torque conditions. A significant difference was found only in the main effect of angular velocity. Multiple comparison tests showed that the isokinetic strength exertion was largest in fast flexion in all taping pressure conditions for dorsal flexion, whereas it was largestin slow flexion in the control and 5 -hPa conditions for palmar flexion. For palmar flexion, it was larger in slow flexion for 30 -hPa. The effects of taping pressure and flexion speed on isokinetic strength exertion may diffe...|$|R

40|$|Context: Stretching is {{commonly}} used as a technique for injury prevention in the training and clinical setting. Recently, stretching in the warm-up {{has been shown to}} decrease several muscular performance variables, but the dose-response of this effect is unknown and moreover these stretching bouts are not representative of athletes during warm up procedures, as they are usually time consuming. Our findings may improve the understanding of the neuromuscular responses to stretching and help sportsmen, coaches, physiotherapist and clinicians make decisions for integrating stretching as a part of warm up or rehabilitation treatment plan. Purpose: The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine whether acute static stretching is responsible for losses in isokinetic peak torque production and if it does, than which time of stretching effect muscle peak torque?Design: Randomized, counterbalanced, within-subjects experimental design. Setting: A university human project laboratory. Methods: Twenty (n= 20) light to moderate young exercisers, male and female, from University of Limerick community, with an average age of 22. 1 ± 3. 6 years, height of 175. 6 ± 5 cm, and weight of 73. 1 ± 9. 9 kg, were randomly selected to take part in the study. Prior to the main study, volunteers attended the lab on two occasions to be familiarized with the knee extension protocol on the Con - trex <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system</b> and with the static stretching protocol. All participants than performed five additional static stretching protocols randomly, in non-consecutive training session. The stretching protocols were 0, 60, 120, 180 and 180 with alternative pattern. Results: The results of the statistical analysis (P > 0. 05) indicated that peak torque remained unchanged following the static stretching for 0 - 180 sec at 60 & 180 ° s− 1 angular velocities. Conclusion: The findings suggest that an athletic stretching (shorter duration) ranging from 0 - 180 sec does not produce decreases in peak torque.

Method As part of a prospective, controlled study 43 patients with osteoarthritic changes of both knees (radiographic Kellgren stage II–III) were followed in a right/left comparison. The influence of intraarticularly injected hyaluronic acid (20 mg hyaluronic acid/ 2 ml Hyalart®) on functional and clinical parameters was analysed. We used the <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system</b> Cybex 600 for measuring maximal isokinetic muscle strength and total work. A total of 20 males and 23 females fulfilled the inclusion criteria with an age between 55 – 78 years and underwent five injections of hyaluronic acid (one injection per week). The injected knee represented the treatment group, while the contralateral knee served as the control. Results The maximum peak torque of the knee extensors in the treatment group was measured between 57 ± 26. 15 / 32. 33 ± 19. 63 Nm prior to the injections and 77. 17 ± 32. 54 / 47. 83 ± 21. 43 Nm following the hyaluronic acid therapy (P< 0. 01). The analysis of the knee flexors at angular velocities of 60 °/s and 180 °/s revealed values of 40. 44 ± 21. 58 / 22. 89 ± 16. 64 Nm and 53. 55 ± 24. 26 / 34. 05 ± 17. 37 Nm (P< 0. 01) respectively. The evaluation of the total work of the knee flexors and extensors revealed a significant difference (P< 0. 01) between the treatment and control group. The Lequesne score was reduced from 13. 57 ± 1. 88 prior to the injections to 7. 94 ± 2. 53 after the treatment (P< 0. 01). The pain score was documented with the help of a visual analog scale. The VAS values were reduced at rest from 3. 83 ± 1. 72 cm to 1. 36 ± 1. 42 cm and during weight bearing from 7. 57 ± 1. 34 cm to 3. 75 ± 1. 32 cm in the treatment group (P< 0. 01). Conclusions This controlled prospective clinical trial confirmed that 5 weekly intraarticular injections of HA (Hyalart®) in patients with OA of the knee provide pain relief and functional improvements.

40|$|SOMATOSENSORY DYSFUNCTION IN FIBROMYALGIA. IMPLICATIONS FOR PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. Eva KosekDissertation {{from the}} Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Karolinska Institure/Hospital, Stoclcholm, Sweden Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain {{syndrome}} characterized by generalized pain, tenderness,disturbed sleep and pronounced fatigue. The pathophysiology is unknown but peripheralmechanisms (i. e., muscle ischemia) {{as well as}} central mechanisms (dysfunction in endogenouspain modulation) have been implicated. The aim of this thesis was to increase theunderstanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in fibromyalgia by studying the location oftenderness, the perception of somatosensory stimuli, the relationship between ongoing pain andperception of somatosensory stimuli and, furthermore by studying the modulation ofsomatosensory perception during isometric muscular contraction, vibratory stimulation andheterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation. Methods: Thirty-one female fibromyalgia patients, all meeting the classification criteriaproposed by the American College of Rheumatology, and 26 healthy females participated inthe study. Von Frey filaments were used to test low-threshold mechanoreceptive function. Pressure pain sensitivity was assessed with a pressure algometer and thermal sensitivity with aThermotest. A computerized <b>isokinetic</b> <b>system</b> was used for determination of maximalisometric strength and force registration during contraction. Vibratory stimulation (lOOHz) was delivered by an electromechanical vibrator and a submaximal effort tourniquet test wasused for heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation. Skin hypoesthesia was induced by alocal anesthetic cream (EMLA). Results: Fibromyalgia patients exhibited a generalized, non-modality specific increase in painsensitivity and a further increase in sensitivity to pressure pain and innocuous warmth in areaswith high intensity of spontaneous ongoing pain. The increased pressure pain sensitivity infibromyalgia patients was located deep to the skin but not restricted to muscle tissue. Anabnormal increase in pressure pain sensitivity over the contracting muscle during and followingisometric contraction was demonstrated in fibromyalgia patients, {{as opposed to a}} decrease insensitivity in healthy controls. No abnormalities were found in the endogenous modulation ofsomatosensory perception by activity in large myelinated fibers set up by vibratory stimulation. Decreased sensitivity to innocuous thermal stimulation was seen during and following thetourniquet test in both groups alike, but no modulation of pressure pain sensitivity was foundin fibromyalgia patients during the tourniquet test, as opposed to healthy controls, suggesting adysfunction of 'diffuse noxious inhibitory controls'. Conclusions: The lack of normal modulation of pressure pain sensitivity in fibromyalgiapatients during isometric contraction could be explained by peripheral as well as centralmechanisms. However, the findings that fibromyalgia patients had a generalized, non-modalityspecific increase in pain sensitivity, only partially related to the intensity of ongoing pain in theassessed area, and that the increased pressure pain sensitivity was not restricted to muscletissue support central mechanisms. The absence of normal inhibition of pressure pain sensitivityduring heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation in fibromyalgia patients can only beexplained by a central nervous system dysfunction.

The {{purpose of this study}} is toinvestigate the difference in bilateral midback and low-back paraspinal muscle(PSM) activities during performance of different resistance isokineticexercises in healthy subjects and those with scoliosis. Methods: Forty-one healthy subjects and thirty-three subjects with adolescent idiopathicscoliosis (AIS) were enrolled. An <b>isokinetic</b> back <b>system</b> in combinationwith quantitative surface EMG was used to evaluate the dominant and nondominantPSM activities by analyzing the root mean square (RMS) duringisokinetic extension and flexion exercise at velocities of 30 °/s and 90 °/s. Results: Significantly higher RMS of EMG were found in the dominant medial andlateral PSM of the lumbar region than the non-dominant muscles in thehealthy control group and in those with AIS with smaller curves (< 20 degrees) during isokinetic flexion and extension exercises. In AIS patientswith larger curves (20 to 50 degrees), shifting of muscle activities from thedominant to the non-dominant side occurred during isokinetic exercises, andthe EMG activities of the thoracic muscle were significantly higher on thenon-dominant (concave) side than on the dominant (convex) side. Conclusions: The bilateral PSM do not act symmetrically during isokinetic back exercises. The dominant lumbar PSM supply the major action in healthy subjects andpatients with small curve scoliosis. For larger curve scoliosis, compensatedmuscle activity is needed in the midback when doing resistance exercises.

Material and Methods: In Samsun, 19 males (sport age, 3. 42 ± 1. 64 years) and 12 females (3. 00 ± 1. 28 years) active badminton players were voluntarily participated in who are in 9 - 14 ages range. Agility was measured by “T” test, CSMI-Tecnobody Pk- 252 <b>isokinetic</b> balance <b>system</b> measuring instrument was used to test static balance and dynamic balance and Mozart Lafayette reaction measuring instrument was used to test visual and auditory reaction times of players. Spearman correlation analysis was applied so as to correlation analysis. The level of significance was taken as p< 0. 05. Results: For female athletes, a positive relation was determined between the agility and the perimeter (mm) used (r= 0. 727; p< 0. 01) through the static balance measure double foot and eyes are open. For male athletes, a positive relation was determined between the visual reaction time and the perimeter (mm) used (r= 0. 725; p< 0. 01) through the static balance measure dominant foot and eyes are open. For male and female athletes were not found any correlation between reaction time and dynamic balance. Conclusion: It was determined that audio (ears) and visual (eyes) reaction time was effective on balance.

40|$|The <b>isokinetic</b> <b>systems</b> {{developed}} {{in the present study}} can measure torque in maximal voluntary and passive movements. The torque recordings may be combined with surface EMG recordings from pairs of antagonistic muscles involved in the movement. Healthy subjects and patients with spastic paresis have been examined. The recordings have been performed on the knee joint. In Paper I, a previously improved Cybex II dynamometer (Knutsson and Mårtensson, 1980) is used to enable concentric recordings of maximal voluntary movements and passive movements. A report is given of additional improvements of the dynamometer and the EMG systems. The paper describes the computer programmed examination procedure, the signal characteristics and some clinical applications. The Cybex II dynamometer allows the limb attached to the instrument to move freely at velocities below the pre-set speed. When the speed is reached, artefacts will be induced which may disturb the torque record over {{a large part of the}} movement range. In Paper II, a computer-controlled dynamometer is developed that reduces or eliminates the artefacts described in Paper I. It allows the muscles to reach a high level of tension prior to the start of movement and to put load on the dynamometer's lever arm during acceleration. The amount of pre-load and the acceleration rate are set to give the individual subject optimum condition to reach the pre-set speed at shortest possible movement range. In Paper III, the concept of pre-load and resisted acceleration is used when a new computerised control system is developed for the Kin-Com isokinetic dynamometer; a dynamometer that enables concentric as well as eccentric actions. Different rates of acceleration are tested in both types of actions in knee extension in moderately trained subjects and in athletes. It is shown that the measurements are affected by the selected acceleration rate, and when it is too high, the records of torque will fluctuate and distort the assessment of muscle force. In Paper IV, muscle force and activation pattems in voluntary concentric and eccentric knee actions in patients with spastic paraparesis and in healthy subjects are studied using the system {{developed in}} Paper III. Force-velocity relationships as well as prime mover and antagonist activations are compared between the two groups. Isokinetic dynamometry is an instrument well-fitted to the study of muscle force and activation pattems in single joint actions. To study joint movements and muscle activation pattems in more complex actions, computerised systems for gait analysis, with registration of concomitant EMG, are developed. In Papers V and VI, specific interest is focused on the development of the motion analysis. In previous systems for gait analysis, it had been difficult to determine when a muscle lengthens or shortens during the stride, since some movements - particularly rotational movements - were missing or lacked accuracy. Paper V describes a computerised system for three-dimensional gait analysis based on three potentiometers orthogonally connected and optimally centred at the joints, interconnected by a modified exoskeleton. The system automatically identifies individual strides in a gait record. Identified strides are then normalised and averaged. The reliability and validity of the system is determined, comparing it with other quantitative methods and using test-retest. In Paper VI, a system for gait analysis based on electromagnetic tracking is developed. This gait analysis system can measure, in addition to leg movements, pelvis and trunk movements. It can also measure the positions of the different body segments. Miniature sensors are placed on appropriate body segments without bulky fixation apparatus. This allows the system to be used with small children as well as adults. The sensors track the movements to give position and orientation relative to a transmitter by means of the magnetic fields generated by the transmitter. The vulnerability to interference from external magnetic fields is a specific problem associated with electromagnetic tracking. Thus, methods for automatic error correction are included with the analysis of the signals. After correction, the instrument gives records of three-dimensional joint movements and body positions with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Knee joint has a {{major role}} in various lower {{extremity}} activities. Among different elements of knee joint complex; more interest was seen to anterior cruciate ligament because of its alignment, structural complications, more nerve receptors and susceptibility to injury. After injury of this ligament, knee extensor torque decreases but it is believed that this decrease compensated for by muscles of hip and ankle joints. This suggestion has not investigated by isokinetic studies. Therefore, the aim of this research was that if quadriceps muscle torque decreases in spite of rehabilitation process and if this decrease compensated for by hip extensors and ankle plantar flexors? Materials and methods: 10 healthy men (age: 22 - 35 years old) and 10 patients with ACL deficiency (age: 23 - 42 years old) participated in this study. Plantar flexor muscle strength, quadriceps muscle strength and hip extensor muscle strength were tested by <b>Isokinetic</b> Biodex <b>System</b> 3 at 60 and 180 degrees of angular velocities. Also functional vertical jump test was done for each lower extremity. Results: Will coxson test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used. Results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between mean strength of gastrosoleus, hip extensors and sum of mean strength of gastrosoleus, quadriceps and hip extensors of patients injured and sound limbs (P> 0. 05). Results showed that there was significant difference between mean strength of quadriceps of injured and sound limbs (P> 0. 01). There was no relationship between gastrosoleus, quadriceps and hip extensor summation and vertical jump functional test in the patients and normal subjects (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: The results show that compensation occurs in the ankle plantar flexors and hip extensors of injured lower extremity. Thus in spite of significant decrease in quadriceps strength in the injured limb, sum of mean strength of gastrosoleus, quadriceps and hip extensor muscles between injured and sound limbs was not statistically significant. Also there was no relationship between functional test and isokinetic parameters. Thus functional vertical jump test can not be used instead of isokinetic tes...|$|R

Research completed at the Department of Human Performance Studies, College of EducationThe {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of whole body vibration on knee extensor muscle strength. METHODS: Male college students (n= 7) were recruited for the research study. Subjects performed baseline measurements on the <b>isokinetic</b> dynamometer (BIODEX®; <b>System</b> 4 Pro, New York, NY, USA) to test for peak torque output of the knee extensor muscles. The subjects then were exposed to three 60 -second bouts of whole-body vibration (WBV) with 60 -second rest periods between. Immediately after WBV exposure the subjects were then placed back in isokinetic dynamometer to test peak torque of the knee extensor muscles two minutes after treatment. The highest peak torque value of the baseline testing will be compared to the highest post-WBV peak torque value. RESULTS: Test results are still pending. Data collection is expected to be complete by the end of Fall 2011 with anticipated outcomes of no significant difference between baseline and post-WBV values.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the effect of multidirectional soccer-specific fatigue on hamstring muscle strength and angle of peak torque. Sixteen male semi-professional soccer players (mean ± S. D. : age: 21. 3 ± 2. 9 years; height 185. 0 ± 8. 7 cm; body mass 81. 6 ± 6. 7 kg) completed the SAFT 90, a multidirectional, intermittent 90 -min exercise protocol based on data from English Championship soccer matches. Prior to exercise (t 0), at half-time (t 45) and post-exercise (t 105), subjects performed three maximal dominant limb <b>isokinetic</b> contractions (Biodex, <b>System</b> 3) at 120 ° s− 1 through a 90 ° range for concentric and eccentric knee flexors and concentric knee extensors. Analysis of variance revealed significant time dependant reductions in gravity corrected eccentric hamstring peak torque, and consequently in the functional hamstring:quadriceps ratio (P 0. 05). Data analysis also revealed significant differences for Angle of Peak Torque for eccentric hamstrings (P < 0. 05) which was significantly higher {{at the end of each}} half (t 45 : 37 ± 15; t 105 : 38 ± 18 °) than the pre-exercise value (t 0 : 28 ± 12 °).

40|$|Background: Coverage of {{soft tissue}} defects {{at the lower}} {{extremity}} may necessitate microsurgical tissue transfer, such as by fasciocutaneous anterolateral thigh (ALT) or myocutaneous musculus latissimus dorsi (MLD) flaps. Hitherto, these two flaps have not been compared systematically in terms of patient satisfaction and functional outcome. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare patients’ satisfaction and functional outcome following ALT vs. MLD transfer. Methods: Thirty-six patients were divided into an ALT group (n= 22, mean age: 42. 0 years) and a MLD group (n= 14, mean age: 55. 5 years). Both groups were compared concerning <b>isokinetic</b> analysis (Biodex <b>System</b> III), circumference measurement, flap volume, scar size, complication rates, patients’ satisfaction, and functional outcome (SF- 36 questionnaire, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS)), hospital stay and duration of surgery. Results: Isokinetic force measurements showed a higher mean maximum force for dorsiflexion in the MLD group at an angular velocity of 60 °/sec. (ALT 17. 5 ± 7. 9 Nm, MLD 18. 5 ± 16. 3 Nm; p 0. 05) in quality of life and functional outcome. Average hospital stay and duration of operation showed no differences between groups. Conclusion: In the present study, no significant differences in quality of life and functional outcome were found between ALT and MLD group. Only in isokinetic force measurement isolated significant differences with advantages of MLD group were detected.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{execution of}} swimming techniques may cause muscle imbalances in shoulder rotators leading to injury. However, {{there is a}} lack of published research studies on this topic. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of a competitive swim period on the shoulder rotator–cuff balance in young swimmers. A randomized controlled pretest–posttest design was used, with two measurements performed during the first macrocycle of the swimming season (baseline and 16 weeks). Twenty-seven young male swimmers (experimental group) and 22 male students who were not involved in swim training (control group) with the same characteristics were evaluated. Peak torque of shoulder internal and external rotators was assessed. Concentric action at 1. 04 rad s! 1 (3 repetitions) and 3. 14 rad s! 1 (20 repetitions) was measured using an <b>isokinetic</b> dynamometer (Biodex <b>System</b> 3). External/internal rotators strength ratios were also obtained. For both protocols, there were significant training effects on internal rotator strength and external/internal rotator ratios (p à. 05). This trend was the same for both shoulders. Within-group analysis showed significant changes from baseline to 16 weeks for internal rotators strength and unilateral ratios of the experimental group. Swimmers’ internal rotator strength levels increased significantly. In contrast, a significant decrease of the unilateral ratios was observed. Findings suggest that a competitive swim macrocycle leads to an increase in muscular imbalances in the shoulder rotators of young competitive swimmers. Swimming coaches should consider implementing a compensatory strength-training progra...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Assessment of {{shoulder}} mobility {{is essential}} for clinical follow-up of shoulder treatment. Only a few high sophisticated instruments for objective measurements of shoulder mobility are available. The interobserver dependency of conventional goniometer measurements is high. In the 1990 s an <b>isokinetic</b> measuring <b>system</b> of BIODEX Inc. was introduced, {{which is a very}} complex but valid instrument. Since 2008 a new user-friendly system called DynaPort MiniMod TriGyro ShoulderTest-System (DP) is available. Aim of this study is the validation of this measuring instrument using the BIODEX-System. Methods The BIODEX is a computerized robotic dynamometer used for isokinetic testing and training of athletes. Because of its size the system needs to be installed in a separated room. The DP is a small, light-weighted three-dimensional gyroscope that is fixed on the distal upper patient arm, recording abduction, flexion and rotation. For direct comparison we fixed the DP on the lever arm of the BIODEX. The accuracy of measurement was determined at different positions, angles and distances from the centre of rotation (COR) as well as different velocities in a radius between 0 ° - 180 ° in steps of 20 °. All measurements were repeated 10 times. As satisfactory accuracy a difference between both systems below 5 ° was defined. The statistical analysis was performed with a linear regression model. Results The evaluation shows very high accuracy of measurements. The maximum average deviation is below 2. 1 °. For a small range of motion the DP is slightly underestimating comparing the BIODEX, whereas for higher angles increasing positive differences are observed. The distance to the COR as well as the position of the DP on the lever arm have no significant influence. Concerning different motion speeds significant but not relevant influence is detected. Unfortunately device related effects are observed, leading to differences between repeated measurements with any two different devices up to 8 ° at maximal range of motion (180 °). Conclusions In summary the results shows high correlation and good reproducibility of measurements. All deviations are inside the tolerance interval of 5 °, if one device is used. An unlikely systematic device effect is detected. These laboratory trials are promising for the validation of this system in humans. The challenge for both systems will be the changing of the COR in the shoulder joint at elevations higher than 90 °. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare Kendo {{players with}} active elderly adults {{in terms of}} quality of life, {{functional}} aspects (muscle strength, postural balance) and body composition. METHODS: This was a controlled cross-sectional study. Twenty elderly individuals {{were divided into two}} groups: the Kendo group, with an average age of 71. 8 (5. 4) years, and the Control group, with an average age of 73. 1 (4. 8) years. Quality of life was evaluated using a questionnaire (WHOQOL-bref and WHOQOL-old); body composition was evaluated with a bioimpedance scale (InBody 230); hand-grip strength was assessed with a portable manual dynamometer (Jamar SH 5001); flexor and extensor muscle strength of the knees was evaluated with an <b>isokinetic</b> device (Biode® <b>System</b> 3 model Biodex Multi Joint System, BIODEX); and dynamic balance was assessed using a force platform (Balance Master System, Neurocom International, Inc.,® Clackamas County, Oregon, USA). RESULTS: The groups were statistically homogeneous in terms of socio-demographic characterization, body composition, muscle strength, and dynamic balance, but the Control group was faster in the sit-to-stand test (p= 0. 03). The Kendo group had a statistically significantly better quality of life; in the WHOQOL-bref, these differences were present in the physical (p≤ 0. 001) and environment (p= 0. 004) domains, and in the WHOQOL-old, these differences were present in social participation (p= 0. 001) and in past, present, and future activities (p= 0. 019).

40|$|AbstractIntroduction The {{isokinetic}} dynamometer enables accurate {{assessment of}} muscle function. In Brazil, {{few studies have}} assessed the isokinetic muscle performance in older adults making interpretation and comparison of results with other studies. Objectives To conduct a descriptive analysis {{of the performance of}} the muscle flexor and extensor muscles of the knee joint in elderly community and compare the performance between the age groups 65 - 74 years and 75 years or more. Methods This is a cross sectional observational study with a convenience sample of 229 elderly community. For the analysis of muscle performance was used <b>isokinetic</b> dynamometer (Biodex <b>System</b> 3 Pro&# 8482;) in the angular velocities of 60 °/s and 180 °/s. The variables evaluated were peak torque, peak torque normalized by body weight, total work normalized by body mass, total work, average power and agonist/antagonist ratio. Descriptive analysis was used to characterize the sample. For comparison between age groups was used Student's t-test with &# 945; = 0. 05. Results The elderly women with older age showed a statistically significant decrease in most of the variables (p < 0. 05) except for the agonist and antagonist knee (p = 0. 398). Conclusions The isokinetic was a sensitive tool to characterize the modifications caused by aging on muscle function. Elderly with results below the lower limits of the confidence intervals for all variables certainly has a decreased strength for the age group evaluated and must be addressed therapeutically.

Methods: Initially, the literature review was carried out to {{identify the}} tools used in scientific research. The search was conducted in the following databases: Virtual Health Library (VHL), Pedro, and PubMed. Studies published between 1990 and 2016 were considered and selected, depicting an evaluation of muscle strength as an endpoint or for characterization of the sample. Next, a survey was carried out with physiotherapists to identify the instruments used for evaluation in clinical practice, and the degree of satisfaction of professionals with respect to them. Results: 495 studies were found; 93 were included for qualitative evaluation. In the studies, we verified the use of manual muscle test with different graduation <b>systems,</b> <b>isokinetic</b> dynamometer, hand-held dynamometer, and manual dynamometer. In clinical practice, the manual muscle test using the motor score recommended by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association was the most used method, despite the limitations highlighted by the physiotherapists interviewed. Conclusion: In scientific research, there is great variation in the methods and tools used to evaluate muscle strength in individuals with spinal cord injury, differently from clinical practice. The tools available and currently used have important limitations, which were highlighted by the professionals interviewed.
