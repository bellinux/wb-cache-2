5|$|During the U.S. {{withdrawal}} from the battle area towards Espiritu Santo and New Caledonia, while taking <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> from a Japanese submarine, South Dakota collided with destroyer , heavily damaging the destroyer.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and <b>evasive</b> <b>action,</b> rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E

5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from rear wheel hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take <b>evasive</b> <b>action.</b> Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from looking at his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of the war, Johnson's {{squadron}} flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson's squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, but took <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> and retreated back to German held territory but Johnson's pilots shot it down. On another occasion, Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson's unit escorted them to an RAF airfield.|$|E

5|$|In 1902, Macartney joined North Sydney Cricket Club in {{the first}} {{division}} of Sydney Grade Cricket and then moved to the Gordon club in the outer northern suburbs when it was formed during the 1905–06 season. He played regularly for Gordon until 1933–34 when he was 47, amassing 7648 runs {{at an average of}} 54.62. He was known for his dominant status at the Chatswood Oval. In one match, he lofted a ball out of the ground, over a railway line and onto an adjacent lawn bowling green, forcing the players to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 19 September he {{attacked}} a Rumpler C.IV which he {{drove down to}} 1,000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates fall from the machine as it took violent <b>evasive</b> <b>action.</b> He abandoned the chase and spotted another. This time {{he attacked}} {{from the sun and}} from behind and below. His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed behind enemy lines. Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill. A DFW C.V followed on 23 September—his 13th victory.|$|E
5|$|Oxford won the toss {{and elected}} {{to start from}} the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. At the time of the race, which {{commenced}} at 10.40am, there was a strong easterly wind. With a higher stroke rate than their opponents, the Light Blues took the lead from the start and by Craven Steps were almost clear. At the Mile Post, Oxford had cut the lead to half a length, but were forced to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> to avoid a collision with river traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{battlefield}} {{has multiple}} levels. Initially, the player can only access three planes of battle: a foreplane, a middle plane, and a back plane. These planes can be switched between in set sequence, {{or at the}} player's choosing based on which button is pressed. Often, <b>evasive</b> <b>actions</b> can be taken by switching a plane.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June 1975, the FIA {{formed the}} Immigration Wing (IW) to help NARA agents and {{officials}} to conduct probes against illegal immigration to Pakistan.

In 1975, another special team, the Technical Wing, was formed to tackle financial crimes.|$|R
50|$|The ship's crew saw a periscope {{approaching}} the vessel {{but as the}} ship was a hospital ship and protected by the Hague conventions no <b>evasive</b> <b>actions</b> were taken. Without warning the submarine fired a torpedo which missed. The U-boat, U-33, came around again fired a torpedo {{from a distance of}} 30 feet, which hit near the engine room, breaking the ship into two pieces.|$|R
5|$|The {{start of}} the {{operation}} was a disaster. Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down, or were damaged and turned back, due to both friendly fire and enemy action. The <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area, and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces, the British paratroops captured the bridge. Resisting attacks {{from the north and}} south, they held out against increasing odds until nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and enable it to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action.</b> It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action.</b> Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

Hansu and Kana land close enough to Prime that they can get there in a jopper stolen from an automated agricultural depot. They infer, correctly, that they are being hunted by highly placed authorities and they take appropriate <b>evasive</b> <b>actions,</b> even entering Prime through one of the old subway tunnels from before the nuclear wars. In spite of their caution, they are captured.|$|R
5000|$|Xuan Ji Bu is {{rendered}} as the “false” or “tricky leg” stance, associated with kicking attacks. Popular alternative labels include the [...] "empty stance" [...] (Xu Bu) or [...] "cat stance” (Mao Bu). Xuan Ji Bu is assumed by placing one’s entire body weight {{on a single}} leg and extending the other leg in front to lightly touch the ground. Since the frontal leg has no weight placed on it, {{it can be used}} to launch fast kicks. It is sometimes used in conjunction with other stances for <b>evasive</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Armidale {{undertook}} <b>evasive</b> <b>action,</b> manoeuvring frantically {{to avoid}} the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two air-launched torpedoes, one hitting her port side and the other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded aft. Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship. As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft. Sheean—after assisting to free a life-raft—was hit by two bullets {{from one of the}} aircraft, wounding him in the chest and back. Scrambling across the deck, he strapped himself into the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began shooting at the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea. Subject to the fire from Sheean's Oerlikon, the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had skidded off the course and crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete {{despite a lack of}} experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action.</b> The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in {{the bottom half of the}} field. Milne's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom.|$|E
5|$|A Joint RAN-USN Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the incident, and was in session over June and July 1969. The Board found Evans partially at fault for the collision, but also faulted Melbourne for not taking <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> sooner, even though international sea regulations dictated that in the lead up to a collision, the larger ship was required to maintain course and speed. It was learned during the inquiry that Evans commanding officer was asleep in his quarters {{at the time of}} the incident, and charge of the vessel was held by Lieutenants Ronald Ramsey and James Hopson; the former had failed the qualification exam to stand watch, while the latter was at sea for the first time. Subsequent to the inquiry, the three USN officers and Stevenson were court-martialled by their respective navies on charges of negligence, with the three USN officers found guilty and Stevenson 'Honourably Acquitted'. Despite the findings, Stevenson's next posting was as a minor flag officer's chief of staff, seen by him as a demotion in all but name. In a repeat of the aftermath of the Voyager collision, Melbournes captain resigned amid accusations of scapegoating. In December 2012, Stevenson announced that he had received a letter from the Minister for Defence, apologising for his treatment by the RAN and the government of the day.|$|E

5|$|Jamie McMurray {{took the}} lead by the 53rd lap, when a third caution was {{deployed}} after Reutimann's right-rear tire blew on the backstretch, causing Gordon to take <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> by turning right and heavily damaged the nose of his car when he collided with the outside wall. Reutimann's tire broke Johnson's front splitter brace. All drivers, including McMurray, chose to make pit stops. Vickers elected {{to stay on the}} track and led the field at the restart on lap 58, ahead of Kvapil and Skinner. Two laps later, Hamlin used the draft to take over the lead, with Labonte moving into second. Kahne used the outside lane to claim first position, before Reed Sorenson also drove on the outside lane to claim first place on the next lap. The pack drove three abreast on lap 63, as Truex moved into first place on the 64th lap. McMurray reclaimed the first position when he got ahead of Truex at the start-finish line on lap 65, and Kahne dropped to 26th position by the same lap.

5|$|No. 100 Group {{were searching}} for intruders in force by 01:30, at which time the intruders had already spent 90 minutes over England. Several Ju 88s were chased out to sea and two were claimed as shot down. Three Ju 88s crashed while making ground attacks on targets of opportunity. Leo Zimmermann of NJG 5 {{attempted}} to attack an Air Transport Command B-24 using his Schräge Musik but was spotted. <b>Evasive</b> <b>action</b> by the pilot avoided an attack and the Ju 88 was seen to crash into the ground after its wing tip made contact with the runway. Eight minutes later Heinrich Conze, also of NJG 5, attempted to attack a car driven by Royal Observer Corps member Mr J P Kelway. The Ju 88 struck power lines as it attacked and crashed into the car killing Kelway and the German crew. Over Pocklington Johann Dreher and his crew attempted to attack a landing Halifax and then a taxi that had its headlights on and was travelling along a parallel road near the airfield. Dreher hit some trees as he dived to low-level and all aboard were killed. The crews had {{the distinction of being}} the last German airmen to crash on British soil during the war.|$|E
5|$|On 3/4 June 1942 MacLachlan {{infiltrated}} a {{group of}} Do 217s from KG 2 as they orbited in preparation for landing at Saint-André-sur-Orne. Within 14 seconds he had shot down two bombers and damaged two more (victories 12–13) before German defences were alerted and began returning fire. Flying with Kuttelwascher, they trailed a formation of 15 German bombers that had raided Poole. Sighting them over their own airfield he destroyed one and then was detected by searchlights. Taking <b>evasive</b> <b>action</b> he latched onto another and shot it down. A third and fourth were damaged. Kuttelwascher arrived and as MacLachlan left and claimed another He 111 and Do 217. MacLachlan saw two flashes on the ground denoting a crashed aircraft after he attacked. German records show two Do 217s shot down one crash-landed and one severely damaged. MacLachlan's first victim {{appears to have been}} Unteroffizier Gerhard Wagner's Wrk Nr. 5392 Do 217 from 3./KG 2. Wagner, Feldwebel Wilhelm Oberwohr, Unteroffizier Josef Maier and Oberfledwebel Anton Lamm were killed. Another II./KG 2 Do 217 crashed there while another was severely damaged. Another Do 217 fell 40 miles south of Cherbourg but this machine—Wrk nr. 5331 piloted by Feldwebel Hans Koch of 7./KG 2—was likely a victim of Kuttelwascher. All of the crew were killed in action. It was MacLachlan's last victory with the squadron. He flew five more intruder sorties during which he returned via Antwerp and Ostend at near-zero feet after his map had blown out the side-canopy window on 26 June and chased a Ju 88 45 miles south of Selsey Bill without result on 2 July.|$|E
