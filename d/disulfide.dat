Reaction of benzyl and alkyl <b>disulfides</b> gave unsymmetrical beta-sulfonamido <b>disulfides</b> as the only product in very good yields. From the Study, it has been observed that aryl <b>disulfides</b> containing p-NO 2, p-Cl, and p-CN {{led to the formation of}} the corresponding beta-aminosulfides as the exclusive products.

40|$|International audienceYajL is {{the closest}} Escherichia coli homolog of the Parkinsonism-associated protein DJ- 1, a {{multifunctional}} oxidative stress response protein whose biochemical function remains unclear. We recently described the oxidative-stress-dependent aggregation of proteins in yajL mutants and the oxidative-stress-dependent formation of mixed <b>disulfides</b> between YajL {{and members of the}} thiol proteome. We report here that yajL mutants display increased protein sulfenic acids levels and that formation of mixed <b>disulfides</b> between YajL and its protein substrates in vivo is inhibited by the sulfenic acid reactant dimedone, suggesting that YajL preferentially forms <b>disulfides</b> with sulfenylated proteins. YajL (but not YajL(C 106 A)) also forms mixed <b>disulfides</b> in vitro with the sulfenylated form of bovine serum albumin. The YajL-serum albumin <b>disulfides</b> can be subsequently reduced by glutathione or dihydrolipoic acid. We also show that DJ- 1 can form mixed <b>disulfides</b> with sulfenylated E. coli proteins and with sulfenylated serum albumin. These results suggest that YajL and possibly DJ- 1 function as covalent chaperones involved in the detection of sulfenylated proteins by forming mixed <b>disulfides</b> with them and that these <b>disulfides</b> are subsequently reduced by low-molecular-weight thiols...|$|R

40|$|The {{irreversible}} binding {{of selected}} sulfur-containing flavor compounds to proteins {{was investigated in}} aqueous solutions containing ovalbumin and a mixture of <b>disulfides</b> (diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, diallyl, and 2 -furfuryl methyl) using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME). In systems which had not been heated, the recovery of <b>disulfides</b> from the headspace above the protein at the native pH (6. 7) {{was similar to that}} from an aqueous blank. However, significant losses were observed when the pH of the solution was increased to 8. 0. When the protein was denatured by heating, much greater losses were observed and some free thiols were produced. In similar heat-denatured systems at pH 2. 0, no losses of <b>disulfides</b> were observed. <b>Disulfides</b> containing allyl or furfuryl groups were more reactive than saturated alkyl <b>disulfides.</b> Interchange reactions between protein sulfhydryl groups and the <b>disulfides</b> are believed to be responsible for the loss of the <b>disulfides...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to explore the potential of ring tension in cyclic <b>disulfides</b> for thiol-mediated cellular uptake. Fluorescent probes that cannot enter cells were equipped with cyclic <b>disulfides</b> of gradually increasing ring tension. As demonstrated by flow cytometry experiments, uptake into HeLa Kyoto cells increased with increasing tension. Differences in carbon-sulfur-sulfur-carbon (CSSC) dihedral angles as small as 8 ° caused significant changes in uptake efficiency. Uptake with high ring tension was better than with inactivated or activated linear <b>disulfides</b> or with thiols. Conversion of thiols on the cell surface into sulfides and <b>disulfides</b> decreased the uptake. Reduction of exofacial <b>disulfides</b> into thiols increased the uptake of transporters with <b>disulfides</b> and inactivated controls with thiols. These results confirm the occurrence of dynamic covalent disulfide-exchange chemistry on cell surfaces. Mechanistic and colocalization studies indicate that endocytosis does not fully account for this cellular uptake with ring tension...|$|R
40|$|The thiuram mix used in patch testing {{originally}} contains 4 compounds. However, {{chemical analysis}} of the test preparation revealed that several new compounds are spontaneously formed during storage.

After a few hours, a large amount of mixed <b>disulfides</b> are formed in solutions originally containing only symmetric <b>disulfides.</b> The impact on the test result of the formation of asymmetric <b>disulfides</b> has been investigated by testing on thiuram-sensitive volunteers with different preparations of mixed thiuram <b>disulfides.</b> In our study, the formation of new asymmetric thiuram <b>disulfides</b> from the original symmetric thiuram <b>disulfides</b> in the test preparation had no influence on the result of the patch testing. However, as the chemical analysis showed that the mix composition changes during the period when the preparations are used, and differs between suppliers, the question is raised as to whether it is acceptable to use test preparations with a composition that is different from that labelled on the protocol...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic seleninate esters {{function}} as mimetics of the antioxidant selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase. They catalyze {{the reduction of}} harmful peroxides with thiols, which are converted to <b>disulfides</b> in the process. The possibility that the seleninate esters could also catalyze the further oxidation of <b>disulfides</b> to thiolsulfinates and other overoxidation products under these conditions was investigated. This has ramifications in potential medicinal applications of seleninate esters because {{of the possibility of}} catalyzing the unwanted oxidation of disulfide-containing spectator peptides and proteins. A variety of aryl and alkyl <b>disulfides</b> underwent facile oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of catalytic benzo- 1, 2 -oxaselenolane Se-oxide affording the corresponding thiolsulfinates as the principal products. Unsymmetrical <b>disulfides</b> typically afforded mixtures of regioisomers. Lipoic acid and N,N′-dibenzoylcystine dimethyl ester were oxidized readily under similar conditions. Although isolated yields of the product thiolsulfinates were generally modest, these experiments demonstrate that the method nevertheless has preparative value because of its mild conditions.

5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead <b>disulfide</b> and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow crystalline powder, is stable, but less so than the difluoride.

Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).

5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as <b>disulfide</b> bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, either at the protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E
