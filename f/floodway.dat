5|$|In January1929, Fred C. Elliott {{explained}} {{during a}} Congressional hearing that because no state funds were available and state law {{did not allow}} {{for the construction of}} a dike, Congress was petitioned for funding and authorization. Bror G. Dahlberg, Congressmen Herbert J. Drane and William J. Sears of Florida's 1st and 4th congressional districts respectively, Fred Henry Davis, former Congressman Walter F. Lineberger from California, and U.S. Senator Park Trammell of Florida also testified. Drane stated that he had attempted since 1924 to bring about flood control. After President Herbert Hoover's visit to the area in February 1929, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of <b>floodway</b> channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. Congress approved the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930, signed into law by President Hoover on July3, 1930.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg {{has four}} major rivers: the Red, Assiniboine, La Salle and Seine. The city {{was subject to}} severe {{flooding}} in the past. The Red River reached its greatest flood height in 1826. Another large flood occurred in 1950, which caused {{millions of dollars in}} damage and mass evacuations. This flood prompted Duff Roblin's provincial government to build the Red River <b>Floodway</b> to protect the city; the project began in 1962 and was completed in 1968. In the 1997 flood, flood control dikes were reinforced and raised using sandbags; Winnipeg suffered very limited damage compared to the flood's impact on cities without such structures, such as Grand Forks, North Dakota. The generally flat terrain and the poor drainage of the Red River Valley's clay-based soil also results in many mosquitoes during wetter years.|$|E
25|$|A 1990 Corps of Engineers {{study of}} {{alternatives}} to the <b>floodway</b> recommended a number of improvements in the <b>floodway,</b> but these were not authorized by Congress.|$|E
5000|$|Levees, {{known as}} dikes in Europe, may be built to prevent river water from flowing on {{floodplains}} or <b>floodways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two other <b>floodways</b> {{were built}} on the Mississippi River downstream: the Bonnet Carré Spillway and the Morganza Spillway, {{both of which have}} gates that can be opened for flood control.|$|R
50|$|M. adenostyla {{occurs in}} the Avon Wheatbelt and Mallee biogeographic regions of Western Australia from Dumbleyung east to the Hyden-Newdegate region of Western Australia. It grows in white or gravelly sand in saline <b>floodways</b> and depressions.|$|R
25|$|The <b>floodway</b> {{has been}} the focus of legal {{opposition}} by residents and landowners since its inception.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Reclamation {{undertook}} extensive work on {{the river}} channel, straightening and strengthening the banks and clearing the <b>floodway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{came after}} environmentalist groups {{argued that the}} Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act were being violated {{in the name of}} agrarian prosperity; and that the <b>Floodway</b> project would create no possible human benefit.|$|E
50|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} L longitudinale is freshwater {{areas such as}} swamps, lake edges, <b>floodways,</b> creekbanks and seeps. The plant tends to spread with its creeping rhizomes to form new stems to form dense monoculture colonies.|$|R
50|$|Flood {{insurance}} {{denotes the}} specific insurance coverage against property loss from flooding. To determine {{risk factors for}} specific properties, insurers will often refer to topographical maps that denote lowlands, floodplains and <b>floodways</b> that are susceptible to flooding.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} {{along the south}} coast on river valleys, river banks, <b>floodways,</b> {{seasonally}} wet sites and estuaries in the South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it grows in sandy-loamy soils over granite.|$|R
25|$|The {{state of}} Missouri {{attempted}} {{to halt the}} activation of the <b>floodway</b> by litigation (Missouri v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), because of the disparate impact of the action upon affected Missouri residents and property owners, but {{were not able to}} halt the action.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} of Manitoba asked the International Joint Commission (IJC) {{to provide a}} report on the flood event and to recommend measures to ensure further flood protection for the city of Winnipeg. Largely {{as a result of this}} study, the province widened the <b>floodway</b> between 2004 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|Originally the {{engineer}} planned {{and built a}} third reservoir, the Naurouze, but it was abandoned in 1680 due to its excessive silting. Pierre-Paul Riquet had dreamed {{of the construction of}} a new city around this basin that never saw the day. A <b>floodway</b> was quickly dug to drain the Naurouze basin from the south.|$|E
40|$|Large {{freshwater}} floods on Earth {{in recent}} times and in the Quaternary have often been associated with catastrophic out-bursts of water from lakes impounded by glacial-ice or debris (such as moraine). In either case, large-scale depositional sedimentary landforms are found along the courses of the floodwaters. On Mars, similar floods {{are believed to have}} resulted from catastrophic efflux of water from within the Martian surface. Within the Martian flood tracts, landforms have been imaged that appear similar to those identified on Earth. These are primarily suites of giant bars – “streamlined forms” – of varying morphology that occur primarily as longitudinal features within the <b>floodways</b> and along the margins as well as in areas of the <b>floodways</b> that were sheltered from the main flow. In addition, flow-transverse bedforms within the <b>floodways</b> have been identified as giant sedimentary dunes or antidunes. Information concerning the flood hydraulics that created these forms may be deduced from their location and plan view morphology. Some other fluvial landforms which have been associated with megafloods on Earth have yet to be identified on Mars. The examples from Earth are described, so as to spur the search for further water-lain landforms on Mar...|$|R
50|$|They are {{designed}} to be submerged under water, but withstand such conditions. Typically <b>floodways</b> are used when the flood frequency or time span is minimal, traffic volumes are low, and the cost of a bridge is uneconomic - in most cases, in rural areas.|$|R
5000|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{currently}} oversees all {{the responsibilities}} of making sure the rivers are best maintained to avoid more flooding. They abide by their goals of to [...] "straighten, channelize, regularize and shackle the Mississippi." [...] In order to subside the potential of more flooding, the Corps created levees, divided by a mile each, to restrict the river and control the flooding. Due to {{the manner in which}} the levees were paved, the river is unable to erode the shore. There are several <b>floodways</b> throughout the system to prevent a large amount of water from amassing. Instead, the buildup of water goes through these <b>floodways.</b> While they help prevent flooding, they also inhibit agriculture from prospering in some of the surrounding areas.|$|R
25|$|After the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the {{engineering}} {{policy on the}} Mississippi River changed from building levees high enough to withstand the greatest recorded flood to include floodways. The Flood Control Act of 1928 authorized the United States Army Corps of Engineers to construct the Birds Point-New Madrid <b>Floodway</b> in Missouri and the Morganza Spillway and Bonnet Carre Spillway in Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|The Forks {{is located}} in the flood plain of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. Before the <b>floodway</b> was built in 1968, the {{location}} of the Forks was prone to flooding when accumulated winter snow rapidly melted in the spring. One of the largest of these floods, in 1826, destroyed the original Fort Garry. The Red River rose three metres (over nine feet) in one day. It created a lake that remained for months and washed away nearly every building in the settlement. Due to recurring flooding, the Forks site was used as a transitional camp.|$|E
25|$|Benbrook Dam and Lake {{were built}} by the Galveston District of the Corps of Engineers. During the decade of active civil works {{construction}} following World War II, the U.S. Congress provided {{for the construction of}} Benbrook Lake, Grapevine Lake, Lavon Lake and Ray Roberts Lake as well as modifications to the existing Garza Dam for the construction of Lewisville Lake. The River & Harbors Act of 1945 authorized these projects for the purposes of both flood control and navigation. These lakes and others, along with an extensive <b>floodway</b> system of levees, are operated in a coordinated manner to minimize flooding along the Trinity River floodplain corridor in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.|$|E
50|$|The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was {{the most}} {{destructive}} river flood {{in the history of}} the United States, with 27000 sq mi inundated up to a depth of 30 ft. To try to prevent future floods, the federal government built the world's longest system of levees and <b>floodways.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} 20th century, {{tools such as}} the {{earthmover}} made it cheaper to construct a high fill directly instead of first constructing a trestle from which to dump the fill. Timber trestles remain common in some applications, most notably for bridge approaches crossing <b>floodways,</b> where earth fill would dangerously obstruct floodwater.|$|R
5|$|In 2013 {{work began}} {{on a project}} to seal the highway's {{shoulders}} from Yannarie River at Barradale to the Onslow turn-off; {{it is expected to}} be completed by mid-2015. Further work to widen the highway between Minilya and Barradale, including replacing two <b>floodways</b> with bridges, is expected to be completed by the end of 2017.|$|R
25|$|Some of the Corps of Engineers' {{civil works}} {{projects}} have been characterized in the press as being pork barrel or boondoggles such as the New Madrid <b>Floodway</b> Project and the New Orleans flood protection. Projects have allegedly been justified based on flawed or manipulated analyses during the planning phase. Some projects {{are said to have}} created profound detrimental environmental effects or provided questionable economic benefit such as the Mississippi River– Gulf Outlet in southeast Louisiana. Faulty design and substandard construction have been cited in the failure of levees in the wake of Hurricane Katrina that caused flooding of 80% of the city of New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} deadly tornado {{outbreaks}} in U.S. history combined with spring snowmelt cause the Mississippi to swell to record levels. Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana were affected, and the western counties of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mississippi were declared federal disaster areas. The Birds Point-New Madrid <b>Floodway</b> was put into use {{for the first time}} since 1937. Nine floodgates of the Morganza Spillway were opened, marking the first use of the gates since the 1973 flood. 330 of the Bonnet Carré Spillway's gates were opened to save the levees protecting New Orleans. There was concern that if the Old River Control Structure, the Morganza Spillway, or the Bonnet Carré Spillway failed, the Mississippi River could change its course, flowing either into the Atchafalaya Basin or Lake Pontchartrain.|$|E
500|$|The {{preference}} {{of this species}} for riparian habitats is consistent across its known range. At the type locality in northern South Australia the bristle-faced free-tailed bat was captured on a <b>floodway</b> in Acacia cambagei low woodland with emergent Eucalyptus coolabah. At Idalia National Park in western Queensland bristle-faced free-tailed bats (n=2) were captured in riparian woodland near open water, [...] with canopy species [...] including Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus populnea. At a site in north-eastern NSW (Kwiambal National Park) the bristle-faced free-tailed bat was captured on a riparian terrace adjacent to a river, with canopy trees at the location including Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Eucalyptus blakelyi and Angophora floribunda.|$|E
50|$|S. turbinatum {{was first}} {{formally}} described by Allen Lowrie and Kevin F. Kenneally in 1997, with most specimens having been collected and {{examined in the}} mid-1990s with one early specimen from 1990. S. turbinatum grows in sandy soils {{at the margins of}} creeks and <b>floodways</b> and is closely associated with wet season herb fields.|$|R
50|$|The Morganza Spillway {{provides}} {{a method of}} diverting water from the Mississippi River when a river flood threatens New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other major cities on the lower Mississippi. It is the largest {{of a system of}} spillways and <b>floodways</b> along the Mississippi. Completed in 1954, the spillway has been opened twice, in 1973 and in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Some {{methods of}} flood control have been practiced since ancient times. These methods include {{planting}} vegetation to retain extra water, terracing hillsides to slow flow downhill, {{and the construction}} of <b>floodways</b> (man-made channels to divert floodwater). Other techniques include the construction of levees, lakes, dams, reservoirs, retention ponds to hold extra water during times of flooding.|$|R
500|$|Winnipeg was {{inundated}} {{during the}} 1950 Red River Flood {{and had to}} be partially evacuated. In that year, the Red River reached its highest level since 1861 and flooded most of the Red River Valley. The damage caused by the flood led then-Premier Duff Roblin to advocate for the construction of the Red River Floodway; it was completed in 1968 after six years of excavation. Permanent dikes were erected in eight towns south of Winnipeg, and clay dikes and diversion dams were built in the Winnipeg area. In 1997, the [...] "Flood of the Century" [...] caused over [...] in damages in Manitoba, but the <b>floodway</b> prevented Winnipeg from flooding.|$|E
500|$|A {{range of}} {{projects}} {{were carried out}} across {{the length of the}} highway between 1996 and 2006. By 1998, a [...] section between the Sandfire Roadhouse and Victoria Highway had been improved at a cost of $1.1million, and another [...] north of Meekatharra was improved for $12million in 1999. Two bridges were constructed in the vicinity of Halls Creek in 2000, and another four in 2004/05, replacing floodways so that the highway would remain open during floods. Similarly, [...] north of Halls Creek, the [...] Jarlalu Bridge over the Ord River was constructed to replace a single-lane <b>floodway,</b> and was opened in January 2003. That same year, the bridges over the Fortescue and Gascoyne Rivers were strengthened to increase the highway's load capacity. Modifications were made to the steep ascent of the Darling Scarp at Bindoon Hill between February 2002 and April 2003, and Great Northern Highway was realigned to bypass the Dalwallinu town centre.|$|E
500|$|To {{prevent a}} {{recurrence}} of disasters like this one and the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926, the Florida State Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District, which was authorized {{to cooperate with the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in flood control undertakings. After a personal inspection of the area by President Herbert Hoover, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of <b>floodway</b> channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. One of the solutions was the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike. Today, concerns related to the dike's stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with [...] "piping" [...] and erosion. Leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events. Proposed solutions to the dike's problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike, with the first stage costing approximately $67million (US$).|$|E
5000|$|During the 2011 floods, the Army Corps of Engineers {{decided to}} open the Morganza Spillway at 1/4 of its {{capacity}} to allow [...] flood the Morganza and Atchafalaya <b>floodways.</b> In addition to reducing the 2011 flood crest downstream, this reduced {{the chances of a}} channel change by reducing stress on the other elements of the control system.|$|R
50|$|The ancient bridge {{had nine}} arches with spans of 10-12 m. The roadway rested on wide piers, which were {{protected}} {{on both sides}} by arched <b>floodways</b> and large cutwaters. The original length of the structure is estimated as 150 m, its road width as 4 m. The missing spans {{are known to have}} been destroyed by flood some time before 1536.|$|R
50|$|The Atchafalaya River meanders {{south as}} a channel of the Mississippi, through {{extensive}} levees and <b>floodways,</b> past Morgan City, and empties into the Gulf in Atchafalaya Bay approximately 15 mi south of Morgan City. Since the late 20th century, the river has been forming a new delta in the bay, {{the only place}} on the Louisiana coastline that is gaining ground rather than eroding.|$|R
