40|$|The present article {{deals with}} the {{viscosity}} <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> {{and its relation to}} hydrogen ion concentration. The viscosity <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> gradually becomes inversely proportional to the freshness <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> though its relation to pH is complicated. The viscosity <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> will change according to not only the quantity of actomyosin in the meat but also the sorts and quantity of electrolytes. The viscosity <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> was able to be increased by adding electrolytes and adjusting pH. In the cases when the pH value was adjusted to 4. 9 by adding lactic acid or to 8. 2 by adding sodium carbonate, the viscosity of horse-flesh turned out to be 28. 3 and 94. 2 respectively.
