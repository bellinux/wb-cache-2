5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court.

Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to <b>his</b> <b>silver</b> medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E

5|$|On 19 February 1917, in {{a tribute}} {{from his native}} city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later {{reported}} his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No.60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying coat that they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore <b>his</b> <b>silver</b> identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.|$|E

He was also supposed to have boasted that he measured <b>his</b> <b>silver</b> coinage by the peck, not having time to count the individual coins.|$|E
5|$|Vasil Levski's hanging is {{observed}} annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, {{due to the}} erroneous calculation of 19th-century Julian calendar dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski's grave has not been determined, some of his hair is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved.

5|$|When his men {{finally took}} the hill, 15 Germans {{had been killed}} and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for <b>his</b> <b>Silver</b> Star. He was awarded a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and {{kept him out of}} combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, {{one of them}} a medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Davide Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Stefan Schumacher, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after testing positive in the 2008 Tour de France, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned <b>his</b> <b>silver</b> medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.|$|E

5|$|The trio are {{captured}} by Snatchers {{and taken to}} Malfoy Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione to learn how the three acquired the sword, which she had believed was in her vault at Gringotts. With the help of Dobby the house-elf they escape along with fellow prisoners Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. Peter Pettigrew emerges and begins to strangle Harry, but Harry reminds him that he owes him a life debt. When Pettigrew hesitates, his brief moment of mercy causes <b>his</b> <b>silver</b> hand to turn on him, strangling and killing him, despite Harry and Ron's best efforts to restrain it. During the escape Harry steals Draco Malfoy's wand and Dobby dies. Bellatrix' terror in interrogating Hermione suggests to Harry some exceptional object is in her vault, and when questioned, Griphook confirms a gold cup is indeed in her vault. With Griphook's help, they break into the vault at Gringotts, retrieve the cup, and escape on a dragon, but in the chaos they lose the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry has a vision of Voldemort and sees he now understands their plan, and intends to make his remaining horcruxes even safer. The vision also confirms the unidentified horcrux is at Hogwarts.|$|E
