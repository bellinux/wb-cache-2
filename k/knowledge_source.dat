The breadth of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> refers to the amount of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> used within the firm. The depth of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> is the amount of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> intensively used by the firm. This study is aimed at answering the following questions. a) What <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> are mainly used? b) What type of innovation is frequently conducted? c) What are the effects of the breadth and the depth of <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> on the innovation capabilities among Indonesian restaurants and cafés? The resource-based view and resource dependency theory are used to understand the role of internal and external knowledge on innovation within a firm. We distributed a semi-structured questionnaire to 101 owners/managers, using a purposive, in several cities in Indonesia, such as Bandung, Denpasar Bogor, Malang, Yogyakarta and other cities in East Java. The results show that the Indonesian restaurants and cafés utilised external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> more often than internal ones. The firms produce more incremental product innovations than radical ones. The depth of the internal <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> has a positive significant impact on the firms 2 ̆ 7 innovation capabilities, which supports the previous studies.

40|$|There {{have been}} few results {{regarding}} unique issues of verification and validation of blackboard-based systems. This paper attempts to mitigate this limitation in the literature by focusing on a particular blackboard architecture. In solution-based focusing blackboard systems, problem solving starts by specifying {{that one of the}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> be instantiated and then iteratively different <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources,</b> typically based on order, are chosen for assistance in developing a solution.

As a result, this paper is concerned with a priori ordering of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> so that better initial solutions will be generated.

40|$|Firms {{continuously}} {{search for}} external knowledge that {{can contribute to}} product innovation, which may ultimately increase market performance. The relationship between external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> and market performance is not well-documented. The extant literature primarily examines the causal relationship between external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> and product innovation performance or to identify factors which moderates the relationship between external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> and product innovation. Non-technological innovations, such as organization and marketing innovations, intervene {{in the process of}} external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> to product innovation to market performance but has not been extensively examined. This study addresses two research questions: does external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> lead to market performance and how does external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> interact with a firm's different innovation activities to enhance market performance. This study proposes a comprehensive model to capture the causal mechanism from external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> to market performance. The research model was tested using survey data from manufacturing firms in South Korea and the results demonstrate a strong statistical relationship in the path of external <b>knowledge</b> <b>sourcing</b> (EKS) to product innovation performance (PIP) to market performance (MP). Organizational innovation is an antecedent to EKS while marketing innovation is a consequence of EKS, which significantly influences PIP and MP.

Information about the system’s context is contained within different <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> and must be elicited and negotiated during embedded systems development. Examples for such <b>knowledge</b> <b>sources</b> may be: laws, standards, internal process specification, systems in operation as well as stakeholders.
