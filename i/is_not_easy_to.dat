5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem because it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps {{have been used to}} monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, {{not so much a}} logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} the visual dimension, {{distinction}} between aggressive mimicry and camouflage is not always clear. Authors such as Wickler have emphasized {{the significance of the}} signal to its receiver as delineating mimicry from camouflage. However, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> assess how 'significant' a signal may be for the dupe, and the distinction between the two can thus be rather fuzzy. Mixed signals may also be employed. Aggressive mimics often have a specific part of the body sending a deceptive signal, with the rest being hidden or camouflaged.|$|E
5|$|Male {{cocks-of-the-rock}} are polygamous, {{and have}} nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male’s energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{assess the}} {{importance}} of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little hinterland. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the Arabs in the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were {{an essential part of the}} Byzantine effort against the Arabs in a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.|$|E

25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although agreeable people can be less disruptive in teams {{and are more likely}} to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers. Less agreeable people tend to make more effective managers, perhaps because it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of them.|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{relationship}} between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the a priori/a posteriori distinction is epistemological, the analytic/synthetic distinction is linguistic, and the necessary/contingent distinction is metaphysical.|$|E
25|$|Some autistic {{activists say}} it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} {{between high and}} low functioning. Some autistic individuals, in contrast, are supportive of the distinction between the low and high functioning labels as well as autism and Asperger syndrome, and believe it is important in helping individuals get proper consultation and treatment.|$|E

25|$|Incorporating a gag into a neck corset {{presents}} a few safety issues: should the wearer begin to choke, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> remove the gag quickly. For this reason, most mouth corsets use a simple muzzle gag that merely covers {{the mouth and}} does not force anything into the mouth, thus minimising the risk.|$|E
25|$|A ballpoint {{tip that}} can write comfortably {{for a long}} period of time <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> produce as it {{requires}} high-precision machinery and thin high grade steel alloy plates. China that currently (2017) produces about 80 percent of the world's ballpoint pens relied up to 2017 on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from water}} vapor, {{which has a}} {{residence}} time of about nine days, major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the atmosphere.

25|$|An {{algebraic}} {{curve is}} an algebraic variety of dimension one. This implies that an affine curve in an affine space of dimension n is defined by, at least, n−1 polynomials in n variables. To define a curve, these polynomials must generate a prime ideal of Krull dimension 1. This condition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> test in practice. Therefore, {{the following way}} to represent non-plane curves may be preferred.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} the family <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} as many species live in the Amazon Basin or {{the far reaches of}} the Andes and attract little attention, even from ornithologists. Moreover, their cryptic coloration and behavior means that their presence often remains unnoticed. A large proportion of the species are Amazonian, with the majority of these decreasing in range. Most, however, are surviving well enough so far to avoid being classified as threatened.|$|E

Walther is confused by the complicated rules, but is determined to try for {{a place in the}} guild anyway.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{difficult}} to build large physical molecules, and all-atom physical models of even simple proteins could take weeks or months to build. Moreover, physical models are not robust and they decay over time.

Graphics can also be animated to represent molecular processes and chemical reactions, a feat that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> reproduce physically.|$|E
