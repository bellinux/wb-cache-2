40|$|Abstract The {{robustness}} {{of steel}} joints in fire {{is important for}} steel building structures {{because of the need}} to prevent progressive collapse. Stainless steel is widely used in building construction mainly because of its corrosion resis-tance, but it also possesses improved fire resistance com-pared with conventional non-alloy, fine grain structural steels. Extensive research performed on the robustness of steel joints in fire has revealed that failure at elevated tem-perature may be controlled by bolt shear for <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> and web cleat connections. Hence, this study focussed on the use of stainless steel in experimental tests conducted on <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> and web cleat connections at high temperatures.

40|$|Steel joints {{have always}} been {{considered}} as important parts of any structural steel building because they provide the strong links between the principal structural members. The properties and behaviour of joints in both steel and composite structures have been widely studied for some time. The focus has recently been on improving the design of structural frames {{by taking advantage of}} realistic connection moment-rotation response. This has necessitated the development of an effective and practicable methodology to describe steel connection behaviour, despite its inherent complexity. Although, the evaluation of steel connections' performance at ambient temperature has been a continuous research topic, the investigation of steel connections at elevated temperatures has only recently been tackled by researchers. However, the determination of the behaviour, available strength and stiffness of moment connections in fire conditions has been a dominant theme in these research works. Moreover, {{over a number of years}} the Component Method has been developed to describe the moment-rotation characteristics of end-plate connections, and the method is now included in Eurocode 3. To date, most of the research conducted on steel connections using the component method has focused on relatively stiff and strong connections - flush end-plates and extended end-plates. The modelling of more flexible ("pinned") connections using the Component Method has not received much attention, since the benefits arising from consideration of their behaviour in overall frame response are usually modest. However, in fire conditions connections are subject to complex force combinations of moment and tying forces, as well as vertical shear forces, and the real behaviour, even of nominally pinned connections, can have a significant effect on the overall response of the frame. To date very little information on the behaviour and the resistance of simple shear connections in fire conditions has been generated. <b>Fin</b> <b>plate</b> shear connections, which are economic to fabricate and easy to use in erection, are among these shear connections which are assumed to act as pins in normal service conditions In this research, the behaviour and robustness of simple <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> beam-to-column connections has been investigated, under the conditions of catenary tension from highly deflected beams which occurs in fire. In addition, detailed investigations have been made on applying the component method approach to this connection at both ambient and elevated temperatures. ABAQUS software has been selected to create a very detailed 3 D finite element model. This is a complex model accounting for material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behaviour. The connection model has been analysed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. Bolt shear and bending, plate and web bearing have been observed as failure modes. A comparison between available experimental data at ambient and elevated temperatures and FEA results shows that the model has a high level of accuracy. However, by implementing the FE model the opportunity was then available to explore the connection tying resistance and the application of the Component Method to the <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connection. An intensive investigation has been conducted to develop a representation of this connection type via a simplified component model, enabling prediction of the connection response at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The three main components of a fin-plate connection have been identified as plate bearing, bolt shearing and web-to-plate friction. These components have been described in detail at ambient and elevated temperatures via intensive parametric FE analyses, leading to a simplified component model of a <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connection. This model has been evaluated against FE models of complete <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> joints. Eventually, a <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connection spring model is proposed and successfully evaluated for tying, rotation, and shear actions. The Component Model presented in this research offers an opportunity to explore complicated behaviour of <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> shear joints, and can be incorporated into frame analysis in fire conditions.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the design}} of shiploader box truss booms, Connell Wagner has often used CHS {{sections}} for both chord and web members. To achieve satisfactory static and fatigue performance, the connection between these members has used a relatively complex detail including both annular and <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> stiffeners. This design was initially developed relatively empirically over 30 years ago using the Detailing Category method based on nominal stresses to assess fatigue performance. The connection has performed well on the numerous shiploaders {{where it has been}} applied. Since the development of this connection system there have been considerable advances in the understanding and modelling of the static and fatigue performance of hollow section connections. This paper explores the feasibility of achieving adequate performance for hollow section connections typical of those in a shiploader boom using a detail that does not involve the use of stiffeners. Ongoing investigations for proposed new shiploaders have identified this as potentially providing a significant reduction in fabrication costs particularly with a change from CHS to RHS and SHS sections. This paper applies the Hot Spot Stress (HSS) method to assess and compare the fatigue performance of typical shiploader boom connections comprising CHS members both with and without stiffeners...|$|E

The dimensions of the <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> of a commercially available combi boiler apparatus heat exchanger are taken as basic dimensions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accurate}} {{analyses for}} a <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> heat sink {{with the ability}} to control the temperature of the avionics devices within a pre-set controllable temperature range are required both in the process of circuit design and for the real-time temperature monitoring purposes. In order to provide an insight into the behavior of the temperature of a <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> heat sink subjected non-uniform heat density on the surfaces, it is necessary to obtain accurate analytical solutions yielding explicit formulas relating the dissipated power to the temperature rise at any point of avionics devices.

40|$|The {{companion}} paper {{presents the}} principles of a new design-oriented methodology for progressive collapse assessment of multi-storey buildings. The proposed procedure, which can be implemented at various levels of structural idealisation, determines ductility demand and supply in assessing the potential for progressive collapse initiated by instantaneous loss of a vertical support member. This paper demonstrates {{the applicability of the}} proposed approach by means of a case study, which considers sudden removal of a ground floor column in a typical steel-framed composite building. In line with current progressive collapse guidelines for buildings with a relatively simple and repetitive layout, the two principal scenarios investigated include removal of a peripheral column and a corner column. The study shows that such structures can be prone to progressive collapse, especially due to failure of the internal secondary beam support joints to safely transfer the gravity loads to the surrounding undamaged members if a flexible <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> joint detail is employed. The provision of additional reinforcement in the slab over the hogging moment regions can generally have a beneficial effect on both the dynamic load carrying and deformation capacities.

An experimental study was conducted to investigate heat transfer by natural convection in a rectangular <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> with circular perforations as heat sinks. The patterns of the perforations included 24 circular perforations (holes) for the first fin; the number of perforations increased by eight for each fin to 56 in the fifth fin. These perforations were distributed in 6 - 14 rows and four columns. Experiments were carried out in an experimental facility that was specifically designed and constructed for this purpose. It was observed that the temperature along the non-perforated fin dropped from 30 to 25 °C, but the temperature drop for the perforated fins was from 30 to 23. 7 °C at low power (6 W). The drop in temperature between the fin base and the tip increased as the diameter of the perforations increased. The temperature drop at the highest power (220 W) was from 250 to 49 °C for the non-perforated fin and from 250 to 36 °C for the perforated fins.

40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of load bearing members (one or more columns, or load bearing walls) causes localized structural damage which leads to further loss of load bearing members and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure. The accidental load, carried by the removed column can be transferred to nearby columns either by beam action or by catenary action. Simple connections such as <b>fin</b> <b>plate,</b> double angle web cleat and flexible end plate connections are routinely assumed to be com-pliant with the tying force design method, which aims to ensure that column loads are redistributed via cate-nary action in the event of damage. This is feasible only if the joints have sufficient ductility as well as tensile strength. Semi-rigid and rigid connections redistribute the column loads through beam action, provided that the connections have sufficient rotation capacity. This investigation demonstrates that the beam-column joints (simple and semi-rigid connections) in many designs have insufficient ductility to successfully bridge dam-aged columns. In simple (nominally pinned) connections, a couple can develop between beam flange and col-umn due to insufficient joint ductility. The resulting prying action is shown to cause early joint fracture and subsequently to lead to progressive failure. In semi-rigid connections, the beam remains elastic and the con-nections plastify, leading to early joint failure...|$|E

40|$|Steel frames can be {{designed}} as simple, semi-continuous, and continuous construction. However, these types of constructions depend {{on the type of}} connections used. Connections are usually classified in design as pinned which is associated with simple construction or rigid which is associated with continuous construction.

The semi-rigid connections usually associated with the stiffness of the connection while the strength of this connection usually associated with partial strength. The use of semi-rigid connection has been encouraged by Euro-code 3 and studies on the matter known as semi-continuous construction have proven that substantial savings in steel weight of the overall construction.

Minimizing heat loss in cavity receivers {{is seen as an}} effective way to enhance the thermal performance and the use of <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> has been proposed as a low cost means to minimize heat loss. Firstly, the influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on the total heat loss from the receiver was investigated. It was observed that convective heat loss is largely affected by the angle of inclination of the receiver, the presence of fins and the number of fins in the receiver. As for the radiation heat loss it was observed that it is mainly influenced by the properties of the cavity receiver surface. The radiation heat loss was found to be constant at all the angles of the receiver. Significant reduction in natural convection heat loss from the cavity receiver was accomplished by using the <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> whereas radiation heat loss was marginally reduced by about 5 %. Secondly, the optimization was conducted to obtain the optimal fin geometry and lastly, the overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was presented at different operating temperatures. The overall cavity efficiency marginally increased by approximately 2 % with the insertion of <b>fin</b> <b>plates</b> although the convective heat loss was suppressed by about 20 %.

The main objective of these tests {{was to investigate the}} effects of three practical fire-protection schemes as alternatives to full fire protection of the entire joint assembly. The three alternative methods of fire protection were: (1) protecting a segment, instead of the entire length, of the beams; (2) unprotected bolts and (3) protecting the columns only.

The bolt temperatures were higher if they were not protected than if they were protected, but the unprotected bolt temperatures in a joint with fire protection to other steelwork were much lower than bolt temperatures in a totally unprotected joint; (2) as far as joint temperatures are concerned, protecting a segment of 400 mm of the beam was sufficient to achieve full protection and (3) if only the column was protected, only the joint components that were in the immediate vicinity of the column (such as welds) developed noticeably lower temperatures than if the joint assembly was unprotected, but due to heat conduction from the unprotected steel beams, these temperature values were much higher than if the joint assembly was protected.

40|$|Given {{its high}} efficiency, low {{emissions}} and multiple fuelling options, the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) offer a promising alternative for stationary power generators, especially while engaged in micro-combined heat and power (μ-CHP) units. Despite {{the fact that}} the fuel cells are a key component in such power systems, other auxiliaries of the system can play a critical role and therefore require a significant attention. Since SOFC uses a ceramic material as an electrolyte, the high operating temperature (typically of the order of 700 – 900 °C) is required to achieve sufficient performance. For that reason both the fuel and the oxidant have to be preheated before entering the SOFC stack. Hot gases exiting the fuel cell stack transport substantial amount of energy which has to be partly recovered for preheating streams entering the stack and for heating purposes. Effective thermal integration of the μ-CHP can be achieved only when proper technical measures are used. The ability of efficiently preheating the streams of oxidant and fuel relies on heat exchangers which are present in all possible configurations of power system with solid oxide fuel cells. In this work a compact, <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchanger operating in the high temperature regime was under consideration. Dynamic model was proposed for investigation of its performance under the transitional states of the fuel cell system. Heat exchanger was simulated using commercial modeling software. The model includes key geometrical and functional parameters.

These issues affect parameters of the incoming streams to the heat exchanger. The mathematical model of the heat exchanger is based on a set of equations which are simultaneously solved in the iterative process. It enables to define conditions in the outlets of both the hot and the cold sides. Additionally, model can be used for simulating the stand-alone heat exchanger or for investigations of a semiadiabatic unit located in the hotbox of the μ-CHP unit...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of polymer and liquid silicon {{infiltrated}} carbon/silicon-carbide composite (C-SiC) materials {{for the development of}} inexpensive compact heat exchangers, as part of efforts for thermochemical hydrogen production. These heat exchangers will be capable of operating in the temperature range of 500 to 1400 °C with high-pressure helium, liquid fluoride salts (a potential intermediate heat transfer fluid), or other corrosive gases such as SO 3 and HI. C-SiC composites have several potentially attractive features, including ability to maintain nearly full mechanical strength to temperatures approaching 1400 °C, inexpensive and commercially available fabrication materials, and the capability for simple forming, machining and joining of carbon-carbon performs, allowing the fabrication of highly complex component geometries. To meet cost goal, candidate materials must have relatively low bulk costs, and fabrication methods must extrapolate to low-cost mass manufacturing. Composite compact offset <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> heat exchangers concept has been developed to meet the above functional and cost goals, which will serve as the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) to transfer high temperature heat from a helium-cooled high temperature nuclear reactor to a liquid salt intermediate loop which couples to hydrogen production loops. The IHX uses offset fin structures with fin width and height at 1 mm scale. The detailed local and global thermal mechanical stress analyses show that the designed composite plate heat exchanger can tolerate pressure difference up to 9 MPa and large temperature difference from two fluid sides. Two potential low cost methods to fabricate C-SiC are liquid silicon (melt) infiltration (MI) and Polymer Infiltration and Pyrolization (PIP). Mechanical strength tests on MI coupons show above 200 MPa failure stress. Leak-tight pyrolytic carbon coatings have been successfully applied on MI C-SiC coupons and excellent helium hermeticity were obtained under high pressure and stress after coating. PIP plates with high-quality millimeter-scale fins formed using teflon molds have been successfully demonstrated. The teflon molds were proven to be reusable, so that the process could be extrapolated to inexpensive mass fabrication of compact ceramic heat exchangers. Prototype test heat exchangers are being fabricated basing on both MI and PIP methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of joint}} in global frames subjected to fire is greatly affected by combination of forces and moments, originating from restraint to thermal expansion {{as well as}} large vertical deflection of structural members. In order to facilitate the design process of achieving robustness in simple beam-to-column connection, a componentbased model has been developed for fin-plate connections in this research. The new model represents the realistic behaviour of such connections {{under the influence of}} combined forces, together with the high rotations which can occur at the ends of beams, during building fires. The key aspect of the component method is that it characterises the force-displacement properties of each active component at any temperature, as a nonlinear "spring". The temperature-dependent characteristics of each individual component in each bolt row are defined, including the failure mechanism of the weakest component, based on experimental and analytical findings. Primary failure modes adopted for <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connections are bearing/block shear of the plates and bolt shear. A major additional complication is force reversal in components, which may occur simply because of temperature change, without any physical reversal of displacement. The Massing Rule has been adopted to incorporate the effect of permanent deformations at any temperature when force reversal occurs. To account for the bolt slip phases, force transitions between tensile and compressive quadrants take place only when positive contact between a bolt and the edge of its bolt hole is re-established. The results of high-temperature tests on the fin-plate connections have been used to verifY the model for isolated joints at ambient and elevated temperatures. The developed component model for the fin-plate connection has been extended for the application of moment-resisting beam splice connection, also known as the "column-tree" system. The component-based connection model has also been used to study joint behaviour in structural sub-frame analyses. Incorporating it into non-linear finite element software will enable engineers to generate the global structural interactions for steel and composite structures in fire scenarios, up to and including connection failure. The new connection element has been validated with reasonable agreement with the available experimental data, showing its capability of capturing the key features of the overall connection interaction in a realistic manner, based on the underlying mechanics, coupled with evidence from experimental data.

40|$|Eleotris oxcephala TEMMINCK et SCHLEGEL is a Eleotrid goby. It is {{distributed}} in the south-eastern Asia. The full grown fish attains to over 270 mm in total lenth and 230 g. in body-weight. In the southern Japan it lives a bottom life in pools situated in {{the lower part of}} river. It is nocturnal fish and feeds on small fishes, shrimps and crabs. The sexes easily distingushed by the from of urogenital papilla and the second dorsal <b>fin</b> (<b>Plate</b> XVIII, Fig. 1, 2). The number of ripe ovarian eggs was enumerated as 56, 206 and 15, 000 in two small size specimens, 172 mm and 94 mm in total length respectively. The spawning period seemed to extend from July to August in Kyushu. The spawning occurred in a shallow pool, the ordinary habitat of the adult (Plate XVI, 3, 4). A egg-mass was collected from an old vacant bamboo lying on sandy mud bottom of the pool. The eggs were deposited in one layer mass to the inner wall of the bamboo-nest. The parent, female 152 mm in total length and male 157 mm, stayed in the nest when the just spawned eggs were found. The fertilized egg is demersal and adhesive one with adhesive filaments at basal end. It is an electric bulb shaped, 0. 37 ～ 0. 43 mm in long axis and 0. 31 ～ 0. 34 mm in short axis. This is one of the smallest teleostean eggs. The incubution-period of the egg is about ten hours at temperature 25 ～ 28 ℃. This is the shortest one of the incubation-period of teleostean eggs published (Fig. 1, A, B, C, D). The newly hatched larva is tiny one, 0. 94 ～ 1. 11 mm in total length, with the less developed body-features than thats of Gobiid larvae described generally (Fig. 1, E). This larva is similar in form to the Gobiid larva hatched out from the small eggs, smaller than 0. 4 mm in egg-diameter, as thats of Ctenogobius stigmatus (Kuntz 1916), Mir ogobius lacustris (Blanco 1947), Sicyopterus extraneus (Mancop 1953) and Sicyopterus japonicus (Dôtu and Mito 1955). The larva metamorphosed remarkably in yolk-sack stage, and attained to l. 87 ～ 2. 04 mm in total elngth in about 85 hours after hatching (Fig. 1, F, G H). The juvenile, 13. 0 mm in total length, was collected in August from a estuary in the Koshiki Islands, Kagoshima Pref., Kyushu. It entered already into a bottom life (Fig. 1, I). The form of this juvenile {{is similar to that of}} the juvenile of Eleotris melanosoma described (Blanco 1958). The young, 24 ～ 82 mm in total length, were collected in December from the estuary of the River Ooyodo, Miyazaki City, Kyushu. The young concealed themselves in a bundle of leaves set there for eel-capture...|$|E

40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is an {{emerging}} technology for environmental-friendly power generation. Almost all existing CSP plants currently use Water Cooled Condensers, but an {{increasing use of}} Air Cooled Condensers is predictable, because of limited water supplies and high costs of cooling water; furthermore, there are several projects to develop CSP plant in desert areas. The MACCSol research project (Development and verification of a novel modular air cooled condenser for enhanced concentrated solar power generation), funded under the EU 7 th Framework Programme, provides an innovative modular dry cooling approach. During the design phase, that is currently undergone, a typical Modular Air Cooled Condenser (MACC) module 2 X 2 m has been defined; it uses fans of 1 m in diameter {{and it could be}} equipped with three different kinds of tube bundle geometries: circular <b>finned,</b> <b>plate</b> <b>finned</b> and continuous finned. This paper describes how the Life Cycle Assessment can be used as an eco-design tool to identify the optimum tube bundle among the above mentioned geometries. The analysis was performed supposing the MACC operating in a reference CSP plant, for 15 years, considering a total of seventeen different tube bundle geometries, eight different MACC sizes and two transportation scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This study {{details the}} {{numerical}} modelling and optimization of natural convection heat suppression in a solar cavity receiver with <b>plate</b> <b>fins.</b> The use of <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> {{attached to the}} inner aperture surface {{is presented as a}} possible low cost means of suppressing natural convection heat loss in a cavity receiver. In {{the first part of the}} study a three-dimensional numerical model that captures the heat transfer and flow processes in the cavity receiver is analyzed, and the possibilities of optimization were then established. The model is laminar in the range of Rayleigh number, inclination angle, plate height and thickness considered. In the second part of the study, the geometric parameters considered were optimized using optimization programme with search algorithm. The results indicate that significant reduction on the natural convection heat loss can be achieved from cavity receivers by using <b>plate</b> <b>fins,</b> and an optimal <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> configuration exit for minimal natural convection heat loss for a given range of Rayleigh number. Reduction of up to a maximum of 20 % at 0 receiver inclination was observed. The results obtained provide a novel approach for improving design of cavity receiver for optimal performance.
