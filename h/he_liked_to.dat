5|$|During filming, {{after the}} strike ended, Forster read a spec script by Joshua Zetumer, which he liked, and {{hired him to}} reshape scenes for the later parts of the shoot, which the {{director}} was still unsatisfied with. Forster had the actors rehearse their scenes, as <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> film scenes continually. Zetumer rewrote dialogue depending on the actors' ideas each day.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have friends throw ping-pong balls at him {{to see if he could}} catch them.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the season}} 4 premiere [...] "Scarlet Ribbons", Patrick Jane says that Red John's victims are [...] "nearly all women, late at night, in their homes. He wakes them first, because <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> see {{the fear in}} their eyes. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> hear them beg for mercy as he cuts them open." ...|$|R
5|$|Olivier's stage {{roles in}} 1934 {{included}} Bothwell in Gordon Daviot's Queen of Scots, {{which was only}} a moderate success for him and for the play, but led to an important engagement for the same management (Bronson Albery) shortly afterwards. In the interim {{he had a great}} success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor John Barrymore in Edna Ferber's Theatre Royal. His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run, in one of the athletic, acrobatic stunts with which <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> enliven his performances.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island. As far as Vizzini was concerned, <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> boast about his excellent contacts with the Americans, and underlined {{their support for the}} separatist movement. Vizzini would become an important player {{in the midst of the}} separatist crisis later on. The Americans seem to have treated Vizzini as the Mafia’s overall boss. The OSS relied on the Mafia, and in particular on Vizzini, for its intelligence. His codename was ‘Bull Frog’ in secret communications. For a while, the chief of the OSS Palermo office, Joseph Russo, met him and other Mafia bosses ‘at least once a month’.|$|E

5000|$|Nicias warns about Socrates' {{philosophical}} {{methods of}} getting the interlocuter to examine their own conscience. Laches states that <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> hear discussions that are [...] "musical", when a person's discourse is in tune with their actions. Paraphrasing Solon, Laches agrees to participate in Socrates' inquiry because <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> learn from good men.|$|R
5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed the same way <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> harm people.|$|E
5|$|Temeraire now resumed her {{previous}} duties blockading the French at Brest. Heavy weather took its toll, {{forcing her to}} put into Torbay for extensive repairs after her long patrols, repairs which eventually amounted to £9,143. During this time Harvey was often absent from his command, usually attending to his duties as Member of Parliament for Essex. He was temporarily replaced by Captain William Kelly on 27 August 1804, and he in turn was succeeded by Captain George Fawke on 6 April 1805. Harvey returned to his ship on 9 July 1805, and it was {{while he was in}} command that the reinforced Rochefort squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder intercepted and attacked a Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre. The French commander, Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, was thwarted in his attempt to join the French forces at Brest, and instead sailed south to Ferrol, and then to Cadiz. When news of the Franco-Spanish fleet's location reached the Admiralty, they appointed Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson to take command of the blockading force at Cadiz, which at the time was being commanded by Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Nelson was told to pick whichever ships <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> serve under him, and one of those he specifically chose was Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, a loner with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> mix with middle-class people, spending money {{he did not}} really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that he had to do well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E
60|$|The stage peasant {{is fond of}} drinking, {{and when}} <b>he</b> drinks <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> let you know he is drinking.

25|$|In his madrigals he uses chromaticism creatively, and <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> write both madrigals and motets in groups, as did {{the other}} Medici composers (such as Corteccia and Striggio). Much of his music is {{intended}} to be accompanied by instruments, another characteristic of Florentine polyphony of the period.|$|E
25|$|He is {{described}} as a dark-skinned man with a lot of wavy hair, a handsome face and a narrow nose. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> wear saffron-dyed clothes and musk. He walked swiftly and, when nervous, he would toy with his ring, which was of gold and set with a ruby.|$|E

25|$|Abdullah Yusuf Azzam {{was born}} in 1941 in the Palestinian village of Silat al-Harithiya, about eight {{kilometres}} northwest {{of the city of}} Jenin in the West Bank, then administered under the Mandatory Palestine. Azzam is described by most of his biographers as being exceptionally intelligent as a child. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> read, excelled in class, and studied topics above his grade level.|$|E

25|$|Following his 1989 {{retirement}} from the Crane School of Music, Tyra relocated to Atlanta, Georgia {{where he would}} spend his remaining years living nearby his daughters and their families. He died on July 7, 1995 of complications arising from leukemia.

60|$|Man likes {{personal}} distinction--there in {{the monastery}} it is obliterated. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> delicious food--there <b>he</b> gets beans and bread and tea, {{and not enough}} of it. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> lie softly--there <b>he</b> lies on a sand mattress, and has a pillow and a blanket, but no sheet. When he is dining, in a great company of friends, <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> laugh and chat--there a monk reads a holy book aloud during meals, and nobody speaks or laughs. When a man has a hundred friends about him, evenings, <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> {{have a good time}} and run late--there he and the rest go silently to bed at 8; and in the dark, too; there is but a loose brown robe to discard, there are no night-clothes to put on, a light is not needed. Man <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> lie abed late--there he gets up once or twice in the night to perform some religious office, and gets up finally for the day at two in the morning. Man likes light work or none at all--there he labors all day in the field, or in the blacksmith shop or the other shops devoted to the mechanical trades, such as shoemaking, saddlery, carpentry, and so on. Man likes the society of girls and women--there he never has it. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> have his children about him, and pet them and play with them --there he has none. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> billiards--there is no table there. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> outdoor sports and indoor dramatic and musical and social entertainments--there are none there. <b>He</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> bet on things--I was told that betting is forbidden there.

A man likes a pretty house, and pretty furniture, and pretty things, and pretty colors--there he has nothing but naked aridity and sombre colors. A man likes--name it yourself: whatever it is, it is absent from that place.|$|R

25|$|Constantijn Huygens was {{a diplomat}} and {{advisor to the}} House of Orange, and also a poet and musician. His friends {{included}} Galileo Galilei, Marin Mersenne and René Descartes.

25|$|In retirement, White {{settled in}} Asheville, North Carolina, where <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> hunt and fish, and pursued his hobby of carpentry. He {{subsequently}} moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1971.

25|$|Taylor {{was careful}} with his fitness, {{following}} an ankle injury in 1964 {{kept him from}} the first seven games of the season. Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut away all the padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome. This can be contrasted with Knott who preferred plenty of padding on his palms.|$|E
