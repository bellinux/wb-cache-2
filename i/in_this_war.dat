5|$|The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as Prince Rupert's Land) {{were not}} {{significantly}} fought over <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>war.</b> They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} aims to (1) {{identify the}} politeness strategies of criticism {{employed by the}} characters <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie, (2) find out the politeness principles underlying the use of politeness strategies of criticism by the characters <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie, and (3) investigate the factors influencing the choice of politeness strategies of criticism <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie. <b>This</b> research used qualitative approach. However, quantitative method was also employed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> research to obtain {{the frequency of the}} data occurrences in order to support the qualitative interpretation. The data were in the form of utterances containing criticism uttered by the characters <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie. The context of the data was the dialogues between the characters <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie. The source of the data was divided into two, i. e. primary and secondary sources. The primary source of the data was a movie entitled <b>This</b> Means <b>War.</b> The secondary source of the data was the dialogue transcript of <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie. The researcher was the main instrument of this research, and she was supported by the data sheet as the secondary instrument. The data were collected and analyzed by categorizing the utterances containing criticism into the data sheet based on the classification of the objectives of the research. The trustworthiness of the data was gained through triangulation. The results of the research show three points. First, there are three types of politeness strategies of criticism occur <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie. The strategies are bald on record strategy, positive politeness strategy, and off record strategy. Off record strategy places the highest rank because the characters prefer to choose the most indirect way to perform criticism since it is an act which is highly potential to threaten another person’s face. Second, there are five types of politeness principles which underlie the characters’ preference to use a certain politeness strategy. They are tact maxim, generosity maxim, approbation maxim, modesty maxim, and agreement maxim. Agreement maxim becomes the most dominant type as in criticizing others, the characters usually focus on either maximizing agreement or minimizing disagreement between themselves and the hearer. It is done {{in order to make the}} hearer agree and accept the criticism they said. Third, two factors are influencing the choice of politeness strategy <b>in</b> <b>This</b> Means <b>War</b> movie. They are payoff and circumstances: relative power, social distance and rank of imposition. Payoff always becomes one of the considerations in every chosen strategy as the characters will get advantages in any strategies they applied...|$|R

5|$|During late 1990 {{and early}} 1991 the Australian {{government}} considered deploying F-111Cs {{to expand the}} Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group. The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) preferred option if the government decided to expand Australia's commitment was to deploy at least two RF-111s, though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> zone. Due to {{the small size of}} the RF-111 force, the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy blow on Australia's reconnaissance capability. The second preference in the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of four to eight F-111Cs, though Defence did not support this. In the event, the government decided to not expand the Australian force. As a result, the F-111Cs' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this Declaration of Pilnitz threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>War</b> of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.

5|$|Louis {{joined a}} crusade against the pagan Lithuanians in December 1344. The crusadersincluding John of Bohemia, Charles of Moravia, Peter of Bourbon, and William of Hainaut and Holland laid siege to Vilnius. However, a Lithuanian {{invasion}} of the lands of the Teutonic Knights forced them to lift the siege. Louis returned to Hungary in late February 1345. He dispatched Andrew Lackfi to invade the lands of the Golden Horde {{in retaliation for the}} Tatars' earlier plundering raids against Transylvania and the Szepesség (now Spiš in Slovakia). Lackfi and his army of mainly Székely warriors inflicted a defeat on a large Tatar army. Thereafter the Golden Horde's control of the lands between the Eastern Carpathians and the Black Sea weakened. A conflict between Louis's uncle and father-in-law (Casimir III of Poland and Charles of Moravia) led to a war between Poland and Bohemia in April. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>war</b> Louis supported his uncle with reinforcements in accordance with the agreement of 1339.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 1668, the Venetians were victorious in a hard-fought night battle off {{the island}} of St Pelagia, where 2,000 Ottoman troops and 12 galleys {{attempted}} to seize a small Venetian galley squadron. Forewarned of their intentions Morosini reinforced it, and won a costly victory, {{which was to be}} Venice's last victory at sea <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>war.</b> Reinforced again with Papal and Hospitaller ships, the Venetians maintained a blockade of Canea, the Ottomans' main supply base, during summer. To secure their anchorage off St Todero island, the allied forces seized the fortress island of St Marina, a minor success which did not in the end prevent the Kapudan pasha's fleet, bearing fresh troops and supplies, from reaching Canea in September, after the Maltese–Papal squadron had departed.|$|E

Indians who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>war.</b> This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina's viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina.
