In the village {{there was a}} <b>flax</b> <b>weaving</b> mill and a gun powder mill where gunpowder was manufactured from local brimstone and saltpeter.During this period number of population in Kandava reached 1000 people. Further development was stopped by Second Northern War when swedes sacked and destroyed Kandava Castle.During Great Northern War swedes again destroyed the castle in 1703. In 1710 plague epidemic started and from 600 residents only several craftsman survived.During the 18th century Kandava Castle lost its military significance.

Whangateau is on the northern shore of Whangateau Harbour which is fed by the Omaha River and separated from Omaha Bay by the Maungatawhiri sandspit. The settlement is in two parts of 20 to 30 houses each. The main settlement includes a large public reserve with sports fields and a campground.

40|$|Composites {{composed}} of polylactide (PLA), <b>woven</b> <b>flax</b> fiber textiles (<b>weave</b> style of 2 2 twill and 4 4 hopsack) and boehmite alumina were produced by hot press. The spraying technique served for the pre-dispersion of the alumina nanoparticles. The aqueous alumina slurry {{was produced by}} mixing the water with water dispersible alumina. The dispersion of the flax structures and alumina particles in the composites was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The polylactide composites were subjected to water absorption and instrumented falling weight impact tests. The creep and thermomechanical properties of the composites were determined in short-time creep tests (performed at various temperatures), thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis, respectively. It {{was found that the}} incorporation of alumina particles reduced the water uptake compared to the polylactide/flax blends. The impact energy and stiffness value of polylactide/flax blends was markedly higher than that of PLA but reflected the effects of composite structures. Incorporation of alumina particles enhanced storage modulus and the creep resistance compared to the polylactide/flax blends but slightly incremented thermal resistance at high temperature. No clear trend in the <b>flax</b> <b>weave</b> style-effect was found in the thermal behavior. The creep master curves were constructed by applying the time–temperature superposition principle. The Findley power law could satisfactorily describe the creep compliance versus time traces for all systems studied...|$|R

5000|$|The {{village was}} first {{mentioned}} in [...] "letter of protection" [...] by the archbishop Siegfried II. von Eppstein as [...] "castra Holzhusin" [...] back in 1222. In 1537 the [...] "Eppsteiner Weistum" [...] (a list of properties {{owned by the}} Lords of Eppstein) lists [...] "Holtzhusen" [...] as a village with 51 farmsteads and a fortification consisting of a double trench and two gates.From the Middle Ages to the German Mediatisation Holzhausen - {{as it was called}} then - was a [...] "Reichsdorf" [...] (village of the empire) with a 2/3 status of imperial immediacy, but apart from that was subordinated to a multitude of lords. After the introduction of the rule [...] "Cuius regio, eius religio" [...] by the [...] "Peace of Augsburg" [...] treaty this led to a convoluted separation of religious affiliations. Starting with the 16th century <b>flax</b> <b>weaving</b> mills became the main economic base for Burgholzhausen. Alongside the village's population lived on the processing of loam from their own quarries to produce pavers, oven- and wall-tiles. Later on in the 17th century fruit growing was introduced. In 1716 a catholic church of baroque style was erected.In the 17th century the Earls of Ingelheim owned the village. In 1741 the village became part of the Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel. Because of this a legal case was heard at the Imperial Chamber Court. The Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel - William VIII - based his title and the alleged purchase of the village in 1595 by the Earl of Stolberg-Königstein. With the extinction of the family line of the Earl of Hanau-Münzenberg due to the death of Johann Reinhard III. of Hanau in 1736, who was the last heir of the Stolberg family line, William VIII argued to be the rightful inheritor of the village. The Imperial Chamber Court awarded a compensation payment to Baron Franz Adolph Dietrich von Ingelheim and confirmed the reign over the village to William VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel. As a result, Holzhausen became part of the Office of RodheimAt the time of the German Mediatisation in 1803 Burgholzhausen {{was one of the few}} last free villages of Holy Roman Empire. Between 1806 and 1810 Burgholzhausen was occupied by French troops and then became part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. In 1832 Burgholzhausen became part of the district Friedberg.On 19 July 1939 Holzhausen was officially renamed to Burgholzhausen. After the World War II, the township grew considerably due to the influx of refuges. As part of the local government reform in 1972 Burgholzhausen became a suburb of Friedrichsdorf and now belongs to the district Hochtaunuskreis.|$|E
40|$|The Nagoya Protocol is {{a recent}} binding {{international}} instrument that articulates the need to recognise the rights of indigenous peoples regarding their biological resources and cultural knowledge and strengthens the mechanisms to do so. New Zealand has not signed this protocol because of the overriding importance of the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand’s domestic affairs, {{and the need to}} ensure that government options are not limited concerning the development of domestic policy on access to biological resources. In particular, policy makers and legislators are waiting for the government response to a 2011 Waitangi Tribunal report (Ko Aotearoa Tēnei) on a far-reaching and complex claim (WAI 262) concerning the place of Māori traditional knowledge, culture and identity in contemporary New Zealand law and government policies and practice. Especially pertinent to this paper is the report’s section on Māori rights relating to biological and genetic resources. In accordance with the recommendation within Ko Aotearoa Tēnei, the principle of partnership, built on the explicit Treaty premise of Crown and Māori as formal equals, is presented here as the overarching framework and mechanism by which government agencies and Māori can work together to safeguard such resources. Core concepts and values are elucidated that underpin the Māori relationship to indigenous flora and fauna and are integral to the protection of cultural knowledge of seeds and plants. Examples are given of plant species regarded as taonga (treasures) and how they are conserved, and a case study is presented of institutional stewardship of harakeke (New Zealand <b>flax)</b> <b>weaving</b> varieties. Seed bank facilities are also evaluated regarding their incorporation of Māori values and rights under the Treaty of Waitangi...|$|E

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} concrete (FRC) {{has become increasingly}} applied in civil engineering in the last decades. Natural fiber fabric reinforced cement composites are considered to prevent damage resulting from an impact loading on the cementite plate. <b>Flax</b> <b>woven</b> fabric that has a high energy absorption capability was chosen. To increase the interfacial shear properties, the fabric was pultruded with different matrix properties that affect the strength and toughness of the pultruded fabric. In this study, three fabric structures are used to increase the anchoring of the cement in the fabric. The compressive strength and the impact energy were measured. The results revealed that pultruded fabric reinforced cement composite (PFRC) absorbs much more impact energy. PFRC under impact loading has more micro cracks, while plain cement specimen shows brittle failure. The compressive test results of PFRC indicate that flax fiber fabric polymer enhanced compressive strength remarkably. Fiber reinforcement is a very effective in improving the impact resistance of PFRC. The study defines the influence factors that control the energy dissipation of the composite, which are the hardness of the polymer and the fabric cover factor. Significant correlation between impact energy and compressive strength was proved...|$|R
