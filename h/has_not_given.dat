5|$|After 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Black {{can avoid}} the {{immediate}} exchange of his Bb4 against the Nd2 in several ways. The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmaster Pavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This can be achieved via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight on the good square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and {{should be able to}} gradually equalize.|$|E

Section 49 of the Act provides that a civil partnership is void on grounds of ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as {{to the formation of}} the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for nullity orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.|$|E

25|$|The {{three-dimensional}} (3D) {{structure of}} SERT {{is not known}} and has been the main obstacle for elucidation of the structural mechanism of the human SERT. Comparative molecular modeling {{have been used in}} research to create structural models of human SERT in complex with its ligand but <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> good results because of low phylogenetic and functional similarity between human SERT and available template proteins. However the 3D structure of some bacterial homologous transporters like the leucine transporter (LeuT) is known. The human SERT, NET and DAT are all members of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) protein family. SERT contains approximately 630 amino acids that are predicted to form 12 transmembrane alpha-helixes (TMs) which are connected with intra- and extracellular loops (ILs and ELs). LeuT, which {{is also a member of}} the NSS family that functions as an amino acid transporter, was crystallized from Aquifex aeolicus by Yamashita et al., and shares 20-25% identity in primary structure with the human neurotransmitter transporters. Therefore, the crystal structure of LeuT and its transport mechanism have been proven to be a good model system for the study of NSS proteins. Although detailed transport mechanism of the NSS proteins is not fully understood, it is clear that in order for transport to occur a rearrangement of large proteins needs to take place.|$|E

500|$|The {{geographer}} Thomas Krabacher of the University of California {{undertook a}} review of The Man-Eating Myth for the journal Human Ecology. Believing that a critical study of cannibal claims has been long needed, he was nevertheless perturbed that Arens' work failed to be either comprehensive or objective. Although concurring that reports of cannibalism have been all too readily accepted without being properly scrutinized, Krabacher nonetheless argues that he has used a [...] "careless and selective" [...] approach to the literary sources. He also sees problems in Arens' approach {{to the nature of}} the evidence, stating that the anthropologist <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> sufficient thought to what would constitute reliable testimony in the case of cannibalism. Drawing comparisons with sexual behaviour, he notes that it would not always be possible for a western anthropologist to directly view cannibalism, which would likely be hidden from their view by many practitioners, and that as such, second-hand accounts would have to do. He then critiques Arens' writing style, believing it to be [...] "contentious and possibly offensive", and highlighting a number of typological errors.|$|E

500|$|... "Looking Down the Cross" [...] was penned by Mustaine in 1983 {{under the}} working title [...] "Speak No Evil". The song tells about {{the temptation of}} Jesus Christ, using {{religious}} metaphors and imagery. [...] "Chosen Ones" [...] was partially inspired by Tim the Enchanter from the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. [...] "Mechanix" [...] was originally written by Mustaine during his tenure in Metallica; lyrically, it talks about having sex at a gas station. The album features {{the first of many}} covers performed by Megadeth: a speed metal version of Nancy Sinatra's classic [...] "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", with lyrics altered by Mustaine. The song sparked controversy in later years when the song's original author, Lee Hazlewood, deemed Mustaine's changes to be [...] "vile and offensive" [...] and demanded that the song be removed from the album. Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from all pressings released after 1995. In 2002, the album was re-released with {{a modified version of the}} song; the altered lyrics were censored because Hazlewood <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>given</b> permission to the band to release the cover in its original version. In the liner notes of the album's reissue, Mustaine was strongly critical of Hazlewood, noting that he received royalties for almost 10 years before objecting to the altered version.|$|E
