40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the oxidative stability of argan oils by using peroxides and conjugated diene hydroperoxides measurements as analytical indicators. Both food and cosmetic argan oils were investigated. Their oxidative stability was also determined by monitoring the relative changes of their fatty acid profiles by 1 H NMR. In addition, valuable information regarding minor components as well as the acyl positional distribution, were obtained for both grades by high field 1 H and 13 C NMR, respectively. Given that the cosmetic and <b>food</b> <b>grades</b> have a similar profile and content of phenolic antioxidants, vitamers, and squalene, it appears that the ratio of fatty acid aliphatic to bisallylic CH 2 groups, much higher in argan oils than in other vegetable oils, is responsible for their higher thermal stability...|$|R

2500|$|In {{some regions}} where iodized salt is not available, iodized poppyseed oil is the {{standard}} for preventing iodine deficiency and its complications including goiter. [...] It may be given by mouth or by injection, injection being markedly more effective. [...] The origin of this use is attributed to Paulo Campos. [...] Usually it is given to adults and children by intramuscular injection, one injection delivering enough iodine to last 2 or 3 years. [...] Poppyseed oil is used because it is already manufactured and it very rarely causes an allergic reaction. [...] Also, injections are more expensive {{and more difficult to}} administer than oral medications, thus there is interest in giving iodized oil by mouth. [...] Use by mouth requires only <b>food</b> <b>grade,</b> not medical grade, quality control. [...] A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial on giving infants iodized poppyseed oil together with an oral polio vaccine had good results. [...] A randomized, double-blind, fully controlled trial in which lipiodol was given by mouth to children had disappointing results. [...] A recent clinical trial in which iodized oil was given by mouth found that the amount of iodine taken up (see bioavailability) varied with the amount of oleic acid in the oil. [...] Poppyseed oil has relatively little oleic acid. [...] Peanut oil and rapeseed oil have far more oleic acid and are less expensive, and may be superior to poppyseed oil for giving iodine by mouth.|$|E

40|$|Microwave {{resonators}} {{are widely}} used for numerous applications including communication, biomedical and chemical applications, material testing, and <b>food</b> <b>grading.</b> Split-ring resonators in both planar and nonplanar forms are a simple structure {{which has been in}} use for several decades. This type of resonator is characterized with low cost, ease of fabrication, moderate quality factor, low external noise interference, high stability, and so forth. Due to these attractive features and ease in handling, nonplanar form of structure has been utilized for material characterization in 1 – 5 [*]GHz range. Resonant frequency and quality factor are two important parameters for determination of material properties utilizing perturbation theory. Shield made of conducting material is utilized to enclose split-ring resonator which enhances quality factor. This work presents a novel technique to develop shield around a predesigned nonplanar split-ring resonator to yield optimized quality factor. Based on this technique and statistical analysis regression equations have also been formulated for resonant frequency and quality factor which is a major outcome of this work. These equations quantify dependence of output parameters on various factors of shield made of different materials. Such analysis is instrumental in development of devices/designs where improved/optimum result is required...|$|R

In developing countries companies become integrated into geographically dispersed supply networks that link producers, traders and processors from the South with retailers and consumers in urban centres and in the North. Globalization of trade and integration of supply chains lead to new demands regarding food quality, safety and health. Companies involved in global food and agri-business chains and networks face fast changes in their market and business environment.
