40|$|Despite the {{numerous}} {{studies in the}} area of urban climatology, there is still a relevant gap in this area corresponding to the demarcation of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> area on a variable.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{ecological}} <b>footprint</b> is {{a measure}} of the resources necessary to produce the goods that an individual or population consumes. It is also used as a measure of sustainability, though evidence suggests that it falls short. <b>The</b> assumptions behind <b>footprint</b> calculations have been extensively criticized; I present here further evidence that it fails to satisfy simple economic principles because the basic assumptions are contradicted by both theory and historical data. Specifically, I argue that <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> arbitrarily assumes both zero greenhouse gas emissions, which may not be ex ante optimal, and national boundaries, which makes extrapolating from <b>the</b> average ecological <b>footprint</b> problematic. <b>The</b> <b>footprint</b> also cannot take into account intensive production, and so comparisons to biocapacity are erroneous. Using only the assumptions of <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> then, one could argue that the Earth can sustain greatly increased production, though there are important limitations that <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> cannot address, such as land degradation. Finally, the lack of correlation between land degradation and <b>the</b> ecological <b>footprint</b> obscures <b>the</b> effects of a larger sustainability problem. Better measures of sustainability would address these issues directly. Ecological footprint Land degradation Greenhouse gases Technological change O 13 Q 17 Q 27 Q 53 Q 56...|$|R

40|$|A {{reconfigurable}} {{mechanism for}} varying <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> of a four-wheeled omnidirectional vehicle is developed {{and applied to}} wheelchairs. <b>The</b> variable <b>footprint</b> mechanism consists {{of a pair of}} beams intersecting at a pivotal point in the middle. Two pairs of ball wheels at the diagonal positions of the vehicle chassis are mounted, respectively, on the two beams intersecting in the middle. The angle between the two beams varies actively so that the ratio of the wheel base to the tread may change. Four independent servomotors driving the four ball wheels allow the vehicle to move in an arbitrary direction from an arbitrary configuration as well as to change the angle between the two beams and thereby change <b>the</b> <b>footprint.</b> <b>The</b> objective of controlling the beam angle is threefold. One is to augment static stability by varying <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> so that <b>the</b> mass centroid of the vehicle may be kept within <b>the</b> <b>footprint</b> at all times. The second is to reduce the width of the vehicle when going through a narrow doorway. The third is to apparently change the gear ratio relating the vehicle speed to individual actuator speeds.
