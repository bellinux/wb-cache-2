25|$|Applied {{behavior}} analysis, a research-based science utilizing behavioral {{principles of}} operant conditioning, {{is effective in}} a range of educational settings. For example, teachers can alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of self-determination theory, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation.</b> There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> to perform the goal behavior. But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation.</b> Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including pivotal response therapy which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.|$|E

Despite the growing theoretical understanding of the distinction between functions and mecha-nisms of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations,</b> the implications of the distinc-tion have not been exploited in specific models. In particular, knowledge-based mechanisms are widely used to implement <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> signals for the acquisition of competences, leading to inappropriate learning signals. In this paper we analyse and compare, with the support of simple grid-world simulations, different mechanisms {{that can be used to}} implement competence acquisition through <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations,</b> describing their limits and strengths and highlighting which features are best suited for the acquisition of competence.

25|$|The {{aspect of}} {{motivation}} within a person's personality may predict creativity {{levels in the}} person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest {{as a result of}} personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a person and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people.|$|E
25|$|Extrinsic {{motivation}} {{refers to}} the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation.</b> Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation.</b> Common extrinsic motivations are rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior. Competition is an extrinsic motivator because it encourages the performer to win and to beat others, not simply to enjoy the intrinsic rewards of the activity. A cheering crowd and the desire to win a trophy are also extrinsic incentives.|$|E

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation,</b> the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of shame and embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E
25|$|Self-perception is a {{specialized}} form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists {{have found that}} too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as overjustification. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered. This is an important exception to reinforcement theory.|$|E
25|$|Promoting <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> {{and problem}} solving are two areas where {{educators}} can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E
40|$|The {{concepts}} {{of attention and}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> are of great interest within adaptive robotic systems, and can be exploited in order to guide, activate, and coordinate multiple concurrent behaviors. Attention allocation strategies represent key capabilities of human beings, which are strictly connected with action selection and execution mechanisms, while <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> directly affect the allocation of attentional resources. In this {{paper we propose a}} model of Reinforcement Learning (RL), where both these capabilities are involved. RL is deployed to learn how to allocate attentional resources in a behavior-based robotic system, while action selection is obtained as a side effect of the resulting motivated attentional behaviors. Moreover, the influence of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> in attention orientation is obtained by introducing rewards associated with curiosity drives. In this way, the learning process is affected not only by goal-specific rewards, but also by <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations...</b>|$|R

The present paper increases understanding {{on the effect of}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> by studying the role that different motivations to volunteer have on the creation of volunteers’ social capital which is intended as networks of cooperative relations. Our empirical analysis considers three indices of social capital, aimed at measuring both the quantitative (number) and the qualitative (degree of familiarity and cooperation) character of social relations, and <b>intrinsic</b> and extrinsic <b>motivations</b> to volunteer (ideal motivations, the desire to feel useful to others, the pursuit of social recognition and the desire {{to increase the number of}} acquaintances or friends). We find that the creation of social capital through participation in voluntary associations is not indifferent to the motivations which induced the volunteer to start his/her unpaid activity. In particular, we show that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> enable people to extend their social networks by creating relations characterized by a significant degree of familiarity. By contrast, extrinsic motivations, and in particular the decision to join an association in order to increase the number of acquaintances or friends, promote the creation of networks from a quantitative point of view, but they do not facilitate the creation of relations based on a particular degree of confidence. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>Motivations,</b> Social Capital, Volunteer Work, Social Networks...|$|R
25|$|Academic {{motivation}} orientation {{may also}} be tied with one's ability to detect and process errors.

40|$|For {{representative}} democracy to work, legislators {{need to be}} responsive {{to the concerns of}} citizens. One way in which this can be achieved is through constituency service. Two factors drive constituency service: extrinsic and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations.</b> Research to date suggests that extrinsic motivations are crucial for constituency service. Yet, this evidence stems primarily from the US context characterized by a personal ballot structure and campaign content which may bias findings in favor of extrinsic motivations. We present evidence from the first ever field experiment conducted in the European Parliament (EP) in which we vary both the extrinsic and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> of legislators. What is more, we are able to examine the way in which <b>intrinsic</b> and extrinsic <b>motivations</b> interact, an aspect largely ignored in the literature.

40|$|Abstract This chapter {{introduces}} {{the field of}} intrinsically motivated learning systems and illustrates the content, objectives, and organisation of the book. The chapter first expands the concept of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations,</b> then introduces a taxonomy of three classes of intrinsic-motivation mechanisms (based on predictors, on novelty detection, and on competence), and finally introduces and reviews the various contributions of the book. The contributions are organised into six parts. The contributions of the first part provide general overviews {{on the concept of}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations,</b> the possible mechanisms that may implement them, and the functions that they can play. The contributions of the second, third, and fourth parts focus on the three classes of the aforementioned intrinsic-motivation mechanisms. The contributions of the fifth part discuss mechanisms that are complementary to <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations.</b> The contributions of the sixth part introduce tools and experimental paradigms {{that can be used to}} investigate <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations.</b> 1 Intrinsically Motivated Learning The capacity to learn autonomously and in a cumulative fashion is one of the hallmarks of intelligence. Higher mammals, especially when young, engage in a number of exploratory activities with the environment (e. g. think about children at play; von Hofsten 2007). These activities are not directed to pursue goals that are directly relevant for the survival and reproduction of the organism, but are driven by <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations,</b> that is, motivations such as curiosity, interest in novel stimuli or surprising events, and interest in learning new behaviours. The adaptive value of intrinsically motivated activities is that they allow the cumulative acquisition...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} various {{studies on the}} {{connection}} between motivation and games. One particular study was on Taiwanese adolescents and their drive of addiction to games. Two studies {{by the same people}} were conducted. The first study revealed that addicted players showed higher intrinsic than extrinsic motivation and more <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation</b> than the non-addicted players. It can then be said that addicted players, according to the studies findings, are more internally motivated to play games. They enjoy the reward of playing. There are studies that also show that motivation gives these players more to look for in the future such as long-lasting experience that they may keep later on in life.|$|E
25|$|Motivational {{theories}} {{also explain}} how learners' goals {{affect the way}} they engage with academic tasks. Those who have mastery goals strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have performance approach goals strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have performance avoidance goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence {{in the face of}} failure, preference for challenging tasks, creativity and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation.</b> Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.|$|E
25|$|According to the JCT, an {{organization}} that provides workers with sufficient levels of skill variety (using different skills and talents in performing work), task identity (contributing to a clearly identifiable larger project), and task significance (impacting the lives or work of other people) {{is likely to have}} workers who feel their work has meaning and value. Sufficiently high levels of autonomy (independence, freedom and discretion in carrying out the job) will inspire the worker to feel responsibility for the work; and sufficiently high levels of Task Feedback (receiving timely, clear, specific, detailed, actionable information about the effectiveness of his or her job performance) will inspire the worker to feel the organization is authentically interested in helping to foster his/her professional development and growth. The combined effect of these psychological states results in desired personal and work outcomes: <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivation,</b> job satisfaction, performance quality, low absenteeism, and low turnover rate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Novelty {{detection}} is {{an inherent}} part of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> and constitutes an important research {{issue for the}} effective and long-term operation of intelligent robots designed to learn, act and {{make decisions based on}} their cumulative knowledge and experience. Our approach to novelty detection is from the perspective that the robot ignores perceptions that are already known, but is able to identify anything different. This is achieved by developing biologically inspired novelty detectors based on habituation. Habituation is a type of non-associative learning used to describe the behavioural phenomenon of decreased responsiveness of a cognitive organism to a recently and frequently presented stimulus, and it has been observed in a number of biological organisms. This chapter first considers the relationship between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations</b> and novelty detection and outlines some works on <b>intrinsic</b> <b>motivations.</b> It then presents a critical review of the methods of novelty detection published by the authors. A brief summary of some key recent surveys in the field is then provided.
