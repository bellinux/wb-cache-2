5000|$|The {{engine was}} the GM Diesel 6-71 (426 cubic inches, 220 {{horsepower}} @ 2000 r.p.m.). Mounted transversely {{at the rear}} with three rubber mounts, it connected via angle drive to the rear axle through a 4-speed transmission. During the testing time, Greyhound added a two-speed clutch which {{became part of the}} original PD-4501 in 1954. The diesel also drove the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>pump,</b> the alternator and a cooling fan. The hydraulic system operated the steering gear, but unlike the 4501 to come, it also worked the brakes and the six [...] windshield wipers. The seven gallons of fluid were pumped at a rate of 11 gallons per minute and generated a maximum pressure of 1500 PSI, with 900 PSI the norm. The muffler was mounted behind the rear bumper and the radiator was on the left rear side.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the Brake By Wire is replacing the traditional mechanical control systems with ECUs and it is raising the need to reproduce feelings of eliminated static mechanical components (i. e. <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluids,</b> <b>pumps</b> and cylinders). Thanks to electromechanical actuators and human-machine interfaces (i. e. active pedal) {{it is possible to}} reproduce such feelings and, therefore, arbitrarily change their features. In this way {{it will be possible to}} customize the pedal feelings and the vehicle deceleration needed depending on several factors (i. e. surrounding braking scenario, driver characteristics, race vs day-by-day driving condition). Since braking maneuvers are typically critical and involve the driver, the design and development of brake by wire system must start from the consideration of human factors in order to increase acceptance and braking effectiveness. The objective of this research was to redesign the pedal feelings, making them adaptable to the surrounding. Driver acceptance and braking effectiveness could be highly improved by means of adaptive pedal feelings. The starting points of this research were humans factors in the braking domain. Literature and relevant studies have been taken into consideration to put into evidence human mechanisms and behaviors during braking phases. On such basis, two main results have been found out: braking use cases and pedal feeling curves. With regard to the pedal feelings curves, 4 different pedal curves which describe both force on brake pedal travel and acceleration on brake pedal travel are designed. The pedal feeling depends on several factors like the pedal travel, the pedal idle travel, the effort, responsiveness, deceleration perceived, ease of balance (i. e. ease of modulation), gradual braking and so on. Regarding braking use cases, they are described by vehicle data as speed, acceleration, angles and relevant rates, engine rpm, gas and brake pedal position/speed and so on. These use cases have been clustered in order to meet the 4 pedal curves. The research continued on the implementation of a Matlab/Simulink/Stateflow model for the use case recognition. Basing on the vehicle data, the model is able to find out in which use case the vehicle is (parking, low speed maneuvers, emergency, downhill, and so on). Once it finds out the scenario, the model applies the most appropriate pedal feeling curve (both force feedback and deceleration needed). In the end, the model commands an EC brushless motor which is responsible of the changing of static springs force feedback of the pedal. The scenario recognition model has been validated through vehicle data on real road whereas the pedal feeling and relevant motor behaviors have been validate on bench tests...|$|R

When cavitation occurs {{close to the surface}} of a solid, it causes localized damage due to the high impact pressures that exceed the yield strength of the material and/or {{as a consequence of the}} fluctuating stresses that promote surface fatigue. In many systems like <b>hydraulic</b> equipment, <b>fluid</b> <b>pump</b> impellers, ship propellers and steam turbines, etc. mechanical erosion can be a great problem. For this reason, a growing interest in polymer coatings for tribological applications has emerged in the last years, being epoxy resins are good candidates. This work focused on the analysis of surface damage of nanocomposites as epoxy-based coating. The epoxy resin used was a commercial resin, the fillers were boron and silicon carbides with particle size of 60 and 100 nm respectively, and they were used in two percentage (6 and 12 wt. %). Pin on disk test were carried out to evaluate wear. Cavitation test were performed on aluminium specimens coated with the nanoparticles/epoxy composites, to evaluate their effectiveness as wear-resistance coating. Wear tracks and cavitation samples were studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The results showed higher wear resistance of nanocomposites than clear epoxy resin, and also better cavitation resistance. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|An area in float {{design that}} has gained {{interest}} {{is the ability to}} transport large payloads in an efficient and persistent manner, on the orders of one ton over a period of many months. Traditional thrusters are unable to perform this mission for a long duration because of their high continuous energy usage. Additionally, the large scientific measurement payloads are traditionally repositioned using a ship. The project 2 ̆ 7 s proposed solution is to design, build and test a variable buoyancy system integrated onto a float whose purpose is to use the oceans currents as its main transport mechanism. ^ The buoyancy system was based on a closed pump-bladder configuration, where <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> is <b>pumped</b> from a flexible bladder to rigid pressure tanks to control its buoyancy. After design and construction, initial bench testing was conducted, followed by tank testing in the OCE Acoustics tank and a final bay test in the west passage of Narragansett Bay. Performance characteristics of the float were found to draw an average of 4. 6 W over a 12 hour submergence-surfacing cycle and was able to change its buoyancy by 25 lbs over a 15 minute period. The float was also able to travel approximately 5 nautical miles during the bay test over one ebb tidal cycle. The tank and bay test were successful in proving the concept of the design, though additional work is needed to for the float to overcome its current problems and failures as well as to achieve its longer term goals of obstacle avoidance, persistent operation, and global communications. ...|$|R

40|$|Todays {{concern of}} {{protecting}} the environment has encouraged the research {{and the use of}} environmental friendly products. This project initiates the experimental investigation of using palm based oil as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid.</b> This research was aimed at obtaining a better understanding of short term performance and long term durability of palm based oil working as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid.</b> A vane <b>pump</b> test rig was designed and built. The instantaneous data were recorded in a computer using an analog-to-digital data acquisition system. The rig was integrated with LabVIEW software version 6. 1. Among the data stored are reservoir and return line temperatures, suction and delivery pressures, instantaneous flow rate, total flow, total running time and torque. Test rig performance running on palm oil was determined and monitored. In order to predict the oil performance in the test rig operation, bench tests were also conducted in evaluating the thermal and rheological performance of the oil. The bench tests gave useful insight to the performance of the actual test rig. Some improvement of the oil was made and tested on the hydraulic test rig. The results indicate that ageing process was significantly improved by the additived oil. The investigation also indicates that flow slip, viscous friction, and coulomb friction coefficients were affected by oil and hydraulic component conditions. Non-Newtonian behavior of the oil had been analyzed using five rheological models. It was found that Cross and Carreau rheological models provided best correlation coefficient (R 2 > 0. 999) to the oil under investigation. The palm oil had relatively strong shear thinning behavior with flow behavior index (n) lower than 0. 8 compared to mineral hydraulic oil (n> 0. 9). However this effect was less pronounced at high temperatures. Modified power law and generalized models were proposed to study variation of Newtonian level of the oil with temperature and shear rate. Thermal stability of the oils was also investigated using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). Based on thermodynamic activation energy (Ea), onset temperature and acid value, the recommended treat level for F 10 additive is between 1. 5 % to 2 % (wt/wt) while for L 135 additive is 1. 5 % (wt/wt). In the aspect of tribology, more than 60 % wear occurred during the first 500 hours of operation.

The reason for poor sales figures {{was due to}} unattractive styling and poor ergonomics, with the cab sitting much higher than previous MF tractors. Although the cab did give excellent visibility and a flat floor, being high off the ground meant it was best suited to field operations instead of livestock work. The 600 series {{was one of the}} first tractors to offer the user an option to control where the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>fluid</b> should be <b>pumped.</b> By moving a switch situated near the floor of the cab, the user could block off flow to the rear hydraulics and link arms, concentrating the full force of the pump on the front loader if equipped. In the late 1980s, one of the greatest selling tractors of all time was released- the 300 series Massey Ferguson. Excellent power, simplicity of cab, high range of gears and components made the MF 300 series a success especially in Europe. The range included the MF 350, 362, 375, 383, 390, 390T, 393, 394, 395, 398, and the most powerful and popular Massey Ferguson 399 with horsepower ranging from 52HP to 104HP.
