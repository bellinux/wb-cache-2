5|$|J.E.B. Stuart {{deprived}} Lee of cavalry intelligence {{during a}} <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campaign by taking his three best brigades {{on a path}} away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the meeting engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent {{for the failure of}} the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.|$|E

While a <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board's work consisted of paper studies, the Field Test Group had wide authority to conduct exercises and tests of concepts developed by the other groups.

25|$|The {{motif of}} the hand, with no body attached, {{provides}} {{a problem for}} the artist in how to terminate it.

25|$|In retrospect, Ellsworth's role {{in helping}} to {{establish}} the United States as a viable sovereign nation was important but could be easily overlooked. A <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reason for this {{was that he did}} not distinguish himself as an orator but worked as much as possible behind the scenes. He was said to have been dominant in his eloquence at the January 1788, Connecticut Ratifying Convention, but later as the de facto Senate majority leader he seems to have kept his arguments relatively short and to the point. His written prose could on occasion be tortuous, as best illustrated by the operative sentence in Section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the first of only two sentences). Over three hundred words long, this sentence is almost impossible to decipher as an explanation how state courts were answerable to federal authority. But perhaps this opacity was intentional, since the expansion of federal power specified by Section 25 was mostly overlooked in debate both in the Senate and House of Representatives despite having been the most important and potentially controversial portion of the Judiciary Act.|$|E

25|$|Soil conditions, {{which did}} not permit easy cultivation, did allow the growth of grape fields in the lower parts of the parish and {{intermediary}} orchards. Although the area was humid, and not adequate for wine production, the cultivation of large tracts between Canada do Rolo and Boa Hora, and by manors around the Canada and Caminho de Belém persisted. The presence of vineyards explains the structure of lands (their preponderance in small parcels and limited by hedgerows) {{and the existence of}} small buildings that acted as wine cellars. The decline of the wine culture began in {{the first decades of the}} 19th century, in part caused by problems in preserving plants infected by powdery mildew, but also by the growth in the lucrative exportation of oranges to the United Kingdom. A <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vineyards were transformed into orange orchards. This transformation, and the resulting prosperity, gave origin to the construction of opulent manors.

Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against India. The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, Sid Barnes, Bill Brown and Lindsay Hassett while new talent, including Ian Johnson, Don Tallon, Arthur Morris, Neil Harvey, Bill Johnston and the fast bowling pair of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next decade. The team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948 gained the moniker The Invincibles, after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five-match Test series 4–0, with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the Fourth Test of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest run chase in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.|$|E
500|$|A <b>good</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{commercial}} success of Randolph {{can be attributed}} to the use of slaves working the cotton fields of the area for their owners. Slavery was common in the Southern States in the time before and during the Civil War. Landowners who ran plantations on their lands, bought slaves to work their fields, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves they owned. For the capture and return of runaway slaves, plantation owners offered monetary incentives between $10 and $100. Rewards up to $300 were offered for the return of a stolen slave if the thief of the slave could be convicted of the theft. The Tipton County jail also published [...] "jailer's notices" [...] in the Randolph Recorder to inform owners of a slave of their incarceration.|$|E
