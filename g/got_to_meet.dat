25|$|To this day, the {{mastering}} of the Beethoven {{double bass}} symphonic parts {{are considered a}} basic standard for all orchestral double bass players.

500|$|Todd McCarthy {{was more}} mixed in his {{reaction}} to the film in its present form, describing it as [...] "too big a roll of the dice to pass off as an experiment, as it's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> high standards both commercially and artistically. The demanding running time forces comparison to such rare works as Lawrence of Arabia, Reds and other biohistorical epics. Unfortunately, Che doesn't feel epic—just long". Anne Thompson wrote that Benicio del Toro [...] "gives a great performance", but predicted that [...] "it will not be released stateside as it was seen here". Glenn Kenny wrote, [...] "Che benefits greatly from certain Soderberghian qualities that don't always serve his other films well, e.g., detachment, formalism, and intellectual curiosity".|$|E

During the following year they performed at various Australian festivals and at venues across the country. A proposed appearance at the 2003 Shanghai Spring International Music Festival in May was postponed to the following year due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to know where we are coming from and the older generation to see if we are moving in the right direction".|$|E
