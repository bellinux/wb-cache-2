50|$|TADKOM is {{classified}} for Nato Secret and National Secret without any additional <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Besides <b>encryption</b> <b>devices,</b> {{systems that}} can require key fill include IFF, GPS and {{frequency}} hopping radios such as Have Quick and SINCGARS.|$|R
5000|$|OMNI is an <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> {{manufactured}} by L-3 Communications. It adds secure voice and secure data to any standard analog telephone or modem connected computer.|$|E
50|$|In 1993, the National Security Agency (NSA) {{introduced}} the Clipper chip, an <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> with an acknowledged backdoor for government access, that NSA proposed {{be used for}} phone encryption. The proposal touched off a public debate, known as the Crypto Wars, and the Clipper chip was never adopted.|$|E
50|$|The BDK {{is usually}} stored inside a Tamper-Resistant {{security}} module (TRSM), or Hardware Security Module (HSM). It must remain {{clear that this}} key {{is not the one}} used to initialize the <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> that will participate in DUKPT operations. See below for the actual encryption key generation process.|$|E
50|$|Security of {{the network}} is critical, and the {{architecture}} can utilize standard web security protocols, from Public-key cryptography to embedded hardware <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1968 Jacobs co-founded Linkabit Corporation with Andrew Viterbi {{to develop}} {{satellite}} <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b> That company merged with M/A-COM in 1980, becoming M/A-COM Linkabit.|$|R
50|$|SAVILLE is a {{classified}} NSA Type 1 encryption algorithm. It is used broadly, often for voice encryption, and implemented {{in a large}} number of <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|The AN/PRC 77 {{consists}} of the RT-841 transceiver and minor components. It can provide secure voice (X-mode) transmission with the TSEC/KY-57 VINSON voice <b>encryption</b> <b>device,</b> but is not compatible with the SINCGARS frequency hopping mode. During the Vietnam War, the PRC-77 used the earlier TSEC/KY-38 NESTOR voice encryption system.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{signature}} and encryption must {{be applied}} to the ciphertext when it is created (typically on the same device used to compose the message) to avoid tampering; otherwise any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it. Encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> itself has not been tampered with.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} network layer <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> was the Motorola Network Encryption System (NES). The system used the SP3 and KMP protocols {{defined by the}} NSA Secure Data Network System (SDNS) and were the direct precursors to IPsec. The NES was built in a three part architecture that used a small cryptographic security kernel to separate the trusted and untrusted network protocol stacks.|$|E
50|$|Playfair is {{no longer}} used by {{military}} forces because of the advent of digital <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b> This cipher is now regarded as insecure for any purpose, because modern computers could easily break it within seconds.|$|R
50|$|In NSA jargon, <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> {{are often}} called blackers, because they convert red signals to black. TEMPEST {{standards}} {{spelled out in}} NSTISSAM Tempest/2-95 specify shielding or a minimum physical distance between wires or equipment carrying or processing red and black signals.|$|R
50|$|VINSON is {{a family}} of voice <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> used by U.S. and allied {{military}} and law enforcement, based on the NSA's classified Suite A SAVILLE encryption algorithm and 16 kbit/s CVSD audio compression. It replaces the Vietnam War-era NESTOR (KY-8/KY-28|28/KY-38|38) family.|$|R
50|$|CryptoBuddy is {{a simple}} {{software}} application for the encryption and compression of computer files to make them safe and secure. The application uses a 64-bit block cipher algorithm for encryption and a proprietary compression algorithm. The CryptoBuddy software is also used {{as part of the}} CryptoStick <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> from Research Triangle Software, Inc. The software was released for public use on June 12, 2002.|$|E
50|$|Baker {{stayed with}} Steptoe & Johnson LLP until {{appointed}} in 1992 by President George H. W. Bush {{to serve as}} General Counsel to the National Security Agency (NSA). Baker served at the NSA during {{the time when the}} agency was defending the controversial Clipper Chip, an electronic <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> that was equipped with a decoding key for use by the US government. Baker was awarded the Defense Medal for Meritorious Civilian Service in 1994.|$|E
50|$|An Enterprise Encryption Gateway (EEG) is a layer 2 <b>encryption</b> <b>device,</b> {{similar to}} VPN, {{that allows for}} strong {{authentication}} and encryption for data across a wireless medium. The client devices have client-side authentication/encryption software, and the EEGs are the encryption termination point in the network. Benefits of these devices include offloading the encryption duties from the access points. Autonomous access points are placed downstream from the EEGs and may act as an 802.1x authenticator.|$|E
50|$|The WALBURN family (KG-81, KG-94/194, KG-94A/194A, KG-95) of {{equipment}} consists of high-speed bulk <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> used primarily for microwave trunks, high-speed land-line circuits, video teleconferencing, and T-1 satellite channels. Another {{example is the}} KG-189, which support SONET optical standards up to 2.5 Gbit/s.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989: IRE {{listed in}} Nasdaq. IRE rapidly becomes {{the leader in}} banking {{communications}} security with seven of the top ten U.S. banks as customers and <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> used by SWIFT (global interbank transfer system). IREs Zurich based subsidiary provided security for UBS and Swiss Canton interbank network.|$|R
50|$|In cryptography, {{blinding}} is {{a technique}} by which an agent can provide a service to (i.e., compute a function for) a client in an encoded form without knowing either the real input or the real output. Blinding techniques also have applications to preventing side-channel attacks on <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hamel {{was born}} in Düren, Rhenish Prussia. He studied at Aachen, Berlin, Göttingen, and Karlsruhe. His {{doctoral}} adviser was David Hilbert. He taught at Brünn in 1905, Aachen in 1912, and at the Technical University of Berlin in 1919. In 1927, Hamel studied {{the size of the}} key space for the Kryha <b>encryption</b> <b>device.</b> He {{became a member of the}} Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1938 and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1953. He died in Landshut, Bavaria.|$|E
50|$|Two {{major factors}} in the STU-III's success were the Electronic Key Management System (EKMS) {{and the use of}} a {{removable}} memory module in a plastic package {{in the shape of a}} house key, called a KSD-64A. The EKMS is believed to be one of the first widespread applications of asymmetric cryptography. It greatly reduced the complex logistics and bookkeeping associated with ensuring each <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> has the right keys and that all keying material is protected and accounted for.|$|E
50|$|A HAIPE is an IP <b>encryption</b> <b>device,</b> {{looking up}} the {{destination}} IP address of a packet in its internal Security Association Database (SAD) and picking the encrypted tunnel {{based on the}} appropriate entry. For new communications, HAIPEs use the internal Security Policy Database (SPD) to set up new tunnels with the appropriate algorithms and settings. By not supporting routing protocols the HAIPEs must be preprogrammed with static routes and cannot adjust to changing network topology. While manufacturers support centralized management of their devices through proprietary software, the current devices offer no management functionality through open protocols or standards.|$|E
50|$|The KIV-7 is a National Security Agency Type-1, single-channel {{encryptor}} {{originally designed}} in the mid-1990s by AlliedSignal Corporation {{to meet the demand}} for secure data communications from personal computers (PC), workstations, and FAXs. It has data rates up to 512 kbit/s and is interoperable with the KG-84, KG-84A, and KG-84C data <b>encryption</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{attacks on}} {{cryptographic}} systems {{were conducted on}} the math of the system, for example, differential and linear cryptanalysis. These methods relied upon the cipher text or cipher text and plain text. In the present day world, it has been proved that <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> reveal {{more information about the}} cipher than the cipher text itself...|$|R
50|$|A rack case is {{a transit}} case with {{provision}} for mounting rackmount equipment such as amplifiers, computers, displays, radios, <b>encryption</b> <b>devices,</b> and so forth. In many cases, the internal 19-inch rack is mounted to the transit case via shock absorbing mounts giving the rack sway space to attenuate shocks and bumps that might be seen during shipment and handling.|$|R
50|$|JREAP A uses an Announced Token Passing {{protocol}} for half-duplex communications. This protocol {{may be used}} when several terminals share the same JRE media and take turns transmitting or in a broadcast situation when one transmits and the rest receive. It is targeted to data rates down to 2400 bits per second (bps) on a serial data interface with a TSEC/KG-84A/KIV-7 or a compatible <b>encryption</b> <b>device</b> used for data security. It is designed for use with media such as: 25-kHz UHF TDMA/DAMA SATCOM, EHF Low Data Rate (LDR) Forced Mode Network Operations and 5 and 25 kHz UHF non-DAMA SATCOM.|$|E
50|$|Polish cryptanalysts first {{were reading}} German Enigma ciphers in 1932, {{although}} the commercial version {{may have been}} broken by the British cryptanalyst, Dilwyn Knox, in the 1920s. Poland gave critical information to the French and British in 1939, and production British cryptanalysis was well underway in 1940. The Enigma, with German military enhancements, was quite powerful for a mechanical <b>encryption</b> <b>device,</b> and {{it might not have}} been broken as easily had the Germans been more careful about operating procedures. Throughout the war, Germany introduced enhancements, but never realized the British were reading the traffic almost as fast as the Germans.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{at the height}} of the [...] "crypto war", Blaze was a {{participant}} in the Cypherpunks mailing list and in 1994, he found a critical weakness in the wiretapping mechanisms of the Clipper chip. His paper, Protocol Failure in the Escrowed Encryption Standard, pointed out that the Clipper's escrow system had a serious vulnerability: a brute-force attack could allow the Clipper chip to be used as an <b>encryption</b> <b>device,</b> while disabling the key escrow capability. Later during this time, he was one of the authors of a seminal paper on calculating secure key lengths.|$|E
50|$|By itself, {{frequency}} hopping provides only limited protection against eavesdropping and jamming. Most modern military {{frequency hopping}} radios also employ separate <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> {{such as the}} KY-57 Speech Security Equipment. U.S. military radios that use frequency hopping include the JTIDS/MIDS family, the HAVE QUICK Aeronautical Mobile (OR) communications system, and the SINCGARS Combat Net Radio, Link-16.|$|R
50|$|Rainbow Technologies was an {{encryption}} {{and information}} security {{company based in}} Orange County, California, that was acquired by SafeNet, Inc. in 2003. Through its acquisition of Mykotronx, Rainbow Technologies was responsible for developing and supporting top secret <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> used by the NSA, NRO, and other government agencies. The company also had a line of commercial security and identity management products like the iKey USB authentication token.|$|R
50|$|Scramblers {{were used}} to secure voice traffic during World War II, but were often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's {{inherent}} insecurity. The first true secure telephone was SIGSALY, a massive device that weighed over 50 tons. NSA, formed after World War II, developed a series of secure telephones, including the STU I, STU II and STU-III, as well as voice <b>encryption</b> <b>devices</b> for military telephones.|$|R
