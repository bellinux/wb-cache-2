First-term freshmen may only join if an exception is made by that chapter's sponsor or director of bands.

5|$|A second {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} triggering a TypeIa supernova is {{the merger of}} two white dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The resulting merger is called a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> case, the total mass would not be constrained by the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E

5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur is {{constructed}} <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{way that it}} reveals various levels of terraces, showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas-reliefs to being plain in Arupadhatu circular terraces. The first four terrace walls are showcases for bas-relief sculptures. These are exquisite, {{considered to be the}} most elegant and graceful in the ancient Buddhist world.|$|E
5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR {{to work through}} (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way that it only operates {{through one of the}} two main possible pathways.|$|E

5|$|Dave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, {{their first}} time <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> role. The pair carried over {{a limited number}} of {{elements}} from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine.|$|E
5|$|In {{interviews}} for the 1993 documentary The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, Riefenstahl adamantly denied any deliberate {{attempt to create}} Nazi propaganda {{and said she was}} disgusted that Triumph des Willens was used <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{emotional}} {{part of the}} collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a group, will inevitably act <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way that a society is formed.|$|E

5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} cells, {{such as the}} protist Euglena, {{also have}} flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way that {{the tip of the}} flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a cilium or undulipodium, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.|$|E
5|$|Some site opponents assert that, {{after the}} {{predicted}} containment {{failure of the}} waste containers, these cracks may provide a route for movement of radioactive waste that dissolves in the water flowing downward from the desert surface. Officials state that the waste containers will be stored <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> way as to minimize or even nearly eliminate this possibility.|$|E
30|$|In view of {{the above}} discussion, we {{investigate}} the stability of impulsive stochastic delay differential equations driven by fBms with Hurst parameter H∈(1 / 2, 1). Firstly, {{we assume that the}} impulse <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> equation depends on the current states and give mean-square exponential stability conditions. Secondly, we assume that the impulse <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> equation depends on the historical states and give mean-square asymptotic stability conditions.|$|R

5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels. Though {{the stars}} and other visible material contained <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond the visible component, {{as demonstrated by the}} universal rotation curve concept.|$|E
5|$|The Gardiner {{section was}} <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> state of {{disrepair}} in 2004 that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it. Gardiner received a $100,000 {{grant from the}} New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in December 2006, and the purchase was completed in 2007. The state provided an additional $5,000 to maintain the trail.|$|E

5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E
