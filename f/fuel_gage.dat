Models based on equations that approximate observable characteristics of battery electrochemistry. Uses linear equations, easier to simulate on computer, and gives smooth transitions between charge, discharge, and recuperation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} years of sensor system development and application for aerospace systems. The emphasis of this work is on developing advanced capabilities for measurement and control of aeropropulsion and crew vehicle systems as well as monitoring the safety of those systems. Specific areas of work include chemical species sensors, thin film thermocouples and strain gages, heat flux <b>gages,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>gages,</b> SiC based electronic devices and sensors, space qualified electronics, and MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) as well as integrated and multifunctional sensor systems. Each sensor type has its own technical challenges related to integration and reliability in a given application. The general approach has been to develop base sensor technology using microfabrication techniques, integrate sensors with "smart" hardware and software, and demonstrate those systems {{in a range of}} aerospace applications. Descriptions of the sensor elements, their integration into sensors systems, and examples of sensor system applications will be discussed. Finally, suggestions related to the future of sensor technology will be given. It is concluded that smart micro/nano sensor technology can revolutionize aerospace applications, but significant challenges exist in maturing the technology and demonstrating its value in real-life applications...|$|R
40|$|This report {{supersedes}} NACA-TR- 129 {{which is}} now obsolete. Aircraft power-plant instruments include tachometers, engine thermometers, pressure <b>gages,</b> fuel-quantity <b>gages,</b> <b>fuel</b> flow meters and indicators, and manifold pressure gages. The report includes {{a description of the}} commonly used types and some others, the underlying principle utilized in the design, and some design data. The inherent errors of the instrument, the methods of making laboratory tests, descriptions of the test apparatus, and data in considerable detail in the performance of commonly used instruments are presented. Standard instruments and, in cases where it appears to be of interest, those used as secondary standards are described. A bibliography of important articles is included...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of the LM- 11 descent propulsion system during the Apollo 16 missions was evaluated and found satisfactory. The average engine effective specific impulse was 0. 1 second higher than predicted, but well within the predicted one sigma uncertainty of 0. 2 seconds. Several flight measurement discrepancies existed during the flight as follows: (1) the chamber pressure transducer had a noticeable drift, exhibiting a maximum error of about 1. 5 psi at approximately 130 seconds after engine ignition, (2) the fuel and oxidizer interface pressure measurements appeared to be low during the entire flight, and (3) the <b>fuel</b> propellant quantity <b>gaging</b> system did not perform within expected accuracies...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{program was}} divided into two parts. The first part evaluated stress corrosion cracking in 2219 -T 87 aluminum and 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn (ELI) titanium alloy plate and weld metal. Both uniform height double cantilever beam and surface flawed specimens were tested in environments normally encountered during the fabrication and operation of pressure vessels in spacecraft and booster systems. The second part studied compatibility of material-environment combinations suitable for high energy upper stage propulsion systems. Surface flawed specimens having thicknesses representative of minimum <b>gage</b> <b>fuel</b> and oxidizer tanks were tested. Titanium alloys 5 Al- 2. 5 Sn (ELI), 6 Al- 4 V annealed, and 6 Al- 4 V STA were tested in both liquid and gaseous methane. Aluminum alloy 2219 in the T 87 and T 6 E 46 condition was tested in fluorine, a fluorine-oxygen mixture, and methane. Results were evaluated using modified linear elastic fracture mechanics parameters...|$|R
