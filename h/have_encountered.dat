5|$|In {{addition}} to his French chansons, he wrote at least three pieces {{in the manner of}} the Italian frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> during his years in Milan. These songs include Scaramella, El grillo, and In te domine speravi. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.|$|E

The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, {{and most of these}} characters <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> him in the past or have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{encounters}} are {{not very}} common in the disk of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, but in the dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently.

5|$|Tucker's {{effectiveness}} in the lecture hall is not objectively certain, {{and he may}} well <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> difficulty with public speaking as {{he had in the}} courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the Virginia Literary Museum (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings; and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Phlox {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart, Doctor Jeremy Lucas, who is serving a term on Denobula. He begins to compose a letter back, describing his experiences with the crew, {{and the ways in}} which humans are different. Meanwhile, on the Bridge, the crew are discussing a pre-warp vessel they <b>have</b> <b>encountered.</b> The alien they speak with, a Valakian, begs them to assist with a medical emergency their species is facing. Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans are unaware of the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them. Phlox continues his letter, describing the challenges of treating the disease – with over fifty million lives at stake.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there was}} damage to two Spanish frigates: the Sabina {{was struck by}} cannon fire during the night killing one man and {{wounding}} five, {{although it was not}} determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112-gun ships in a case of friendly fire. In addition, the Spanish 34-gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July, sinking later in the day due to severe damage. How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained. The ship was not part of Moreno's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> the battle and become caught in the cross-fire, suffering fatal damage.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their own {{thoughts}} and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} The Well of Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E
5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the motion}} of intracluster {{planetary}} nebulae between M87 and M86 suggest that these two galaxies are moving toward each other {{and this may be}} their first encounter. M87 may <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

Willaumez eventually returned to France, although without many of his squadron who were destroyed by British operations or Atlantic gales. Linois, despite the criticism levelled at him for his failures in the Indian Ocean, was considered to have fought hard and been unlucky to <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> such an overwhelming force. Made a prisoner of war, Linois was not exchanged by Napoleon, who criticised his behaviour during the campaign and refused to employ him at sea again.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round of star formation. This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|The season {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Scully's former partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), {{who work on}} X-Filescases linked to the paranormal.

In his 2003 history of Civil War Missouri, Bruce Nichols stated that Reed led the gang until mid-July of that year. William Quantrill, a Confederate guerrilla leader, later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> them in July and rebuked them for robbing Confederate sympathizers; in their biography of Anderson, Albert Castel and Tom Goodrich speculate that this rebuke may have resulted in a deep resentment of Quantrill by Anderson. Anderson and his gang subsequently traveled east of Jackson County, Missouri, avoiding territory where Quantrill operated and continuing to support themselves by robbery. They also attacked Union soldiers, killing seven by early 1863.|$|E
5|$|After a one-month {{hospital}} stay, Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{was promoted}} to Major and made Geschwaderkommodore of Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG5) on 20 February 1944. He and his crew, Oberfeldwebel Josef Renette and Unteroffizier Kurt Röber, {{were killed in a}} flying accident on 12 March 1944 on a routine flight from Parchim to Athies-sous-Laon. Above Belgium, they seem to <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> a bad weather zone with low clouds and a dense snowstorm and it was assumed that the aircraft hit the high Ardennes ground after being forced to fly lower because of ice forming on the wings. The exact circumstances of this flight may never be known, the Bf 110 G-4 C9+CD (Werknummer 720 010—factory number) crashed into the Ardennes mountains near St. Hubert where the completely burned-out wreck was found the following day. The funeral service was held in the city church of Linz on 15 March 1944. Prinz Egmont zur Lippe-Weißenfeld and Prinz Heinrich zu Sayn-Wittgenstein are buried side by side at Ysselsteyn in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son is said to <b>have</b> <b>encountered</b> the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, was armed. The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
