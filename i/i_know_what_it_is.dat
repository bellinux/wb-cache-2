2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E

5000|$|Basquiat was {{the first}} {{commercial}} feature film about a painter made by a painter. Schnabel said:"I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be attacked as an artist. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be judged as an artist. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to arrive {{as an artist and}} have fame and notoriety. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be accused of things that you never said or did. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be described as a piece of hype. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> like to be appreciated as well as degraded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Conolly, relaxing. [...] "Come now, I {{can tell}} you that easily enough. <b>I</b> dont <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> does, and <b>I</b> can lay traps to catch it. Here now, for instance----" ...|$|R

6000|$|The girl shuddered. [...] "Even {{now that}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{it makes me}} creep," [...] she whispered, as the faint clanking of a distant chain came to their ears.|$|E
6000|$|Jane: [...] "Go where, ma'am? I don't {{know what}} you want me to do. I'm willing enough to do {{anything}} if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but it's pretty hard to do things if you don't." ...|$|E
60|$|FRUST. Well, I {{liked that}} little pocket piece fine. But I'm blamed if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> all about.|$|R

25|$|Would {{you ask me}} how I dare {{to compare}} the civil rights {{struggle}} with the struggle for lesbian and gay rights? I can compare them and I do compare them, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be called a 'nigger' and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be called a 'faggot,' and I understand the differences in the marrow of my bones. And I can sum up that difference in one word: none.|$|R
60|$|PRINCE PAUL (calmly). I {{see your}} Highness does want change of air. But I {{have been an}} eldest son myself. (Lights a cigarette.) <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> when a father won't die to please one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absurd, minstrel," [...] cried Mohi. [...] "Hark ye; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> All other {{authorities}} to the contrary, amber {{is nothing more}} than gold-fishes' brains, made waxy, then firm, by the action of the sea." ...|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to sit enthroned {{amid the}} clouds of sunset as the spirits sit in Blake's pictures. Giddiness took away all {{sensation}} of touch or form, but the sense of blinding color remained.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! 'tis too late, Pa,' {{said his}} daughter, calmly 'to {{talk to me}} like this. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means, and <b>what</b> its value is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I went to bed, {{and waited}} for the next thing to happen.

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to forgive. I'll {{sit down for a}} moment. It was my own fault because I was so stupid,--and it does not in the least signify. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now; I've sprained my ankle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} be quite happy," [...] she resumed, [...] "till <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that you kept from {{me on that}} memorable day. I don't like having a secret from my husband--though {{it is not my}} secret." ...|$|E

60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{was that}} <b>I</b> saw. It {{was a message}} from Bertha. Mary Phillips had devised the means of sending it. Bertha had sent it.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was writing}} {{to me and}} she put this under cover. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> contains. She wants {{you to go to}} her at Cheltenham for a month." ...|$|R
60|$|G.S. (With a soft {{reminiscent}} sigh {{suggestive of}} bygone joys {{that may be}} tasted in their freshness but once.) Ah, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to you. A first visit!--ah, the romance of it! I wish I could feel it again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What else? You {{can tell}} me. Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{that he has}} come to. I don't blind myself to it, Mr. Caldigate, even though I am his mother. But I am his mother; and if I could comfort him, just a little----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{trying for}} your nerves. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> We're {{different}} from the last generation; they thought nothing of it.

6000|$|... "No, no, lad. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> {{when the}} family are at home. It will be, 'Here, Oswald, ride with such a message;' or Hotspur, himself, may be going out with a train, {{and you will have}} to {{accompany}} him. There will always be something.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because--because you're on top, you've {{always been}} successful, you're pretty much your own master--and {{that makes it}} different. I'm not blaming you--in your place I'd be the same, I'm sure. But this man, Siddons, made me think.

6000|$|Oh, bless you, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to be engaged. I don't want {{to disturb}} you canary-birds. Me and 'Alliwell 'll {{go and have}} a gargle round the corner.

6000|$|... “That may be, or it mayn’t,” said I. “It’s the {{practice}} where I was before. You can bet <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it’s</b> like; and <b>I</b> tell it {{you for a}} fact, I’m tabooed.” ...|$|R
