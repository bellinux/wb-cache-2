40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} enhance {{external}} hardness and strength, a large-scale hydraulic <b>gate</b> <b>track</b> should go through heat treatment. The current design method of hydraulic gate wheels and tracks {{is based on}} Hertz contact linear elastic theory, and {{does not take into}} account the changes in mechanical properties of materials caused by heat treatment. In this study, the heat treatment parameters were designed and analyzed according to the bearing mechanisms of the wheel and track. The quenching process of the track was simulated by the ANSYS program, and the temperature variation, residual stress, and deformation were obtained and analyzed. The metallurgical structure field after heat treatment was predicted by the method based on time-temperature-transformation (TTT) curves. The results show that the analysis method and designed track heat treatment process are feasible, and can provide a reference for practical projects...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the latest respiratory motion-management strategies, namely the internal-target-volume (ITV) concept, the mid-ventilation (MidV) principle, respiratory gating and dynamic couch tracking. MATERIALS AND METHODS An anthropomorphic, deformable and dynamic lung phantom was used for the dosimetric validation of these techniques. Stereotactic treatments were adapted to match the techniques and five distinct respiration patterns, and delivered to the phantom while radiographic film measurements were taken inside the tumor. To report on tumor coverage, these dose distributions were used to calculate mean doses (Dmean), changes in homogeneity indices (ΔH 2 - 98), gamma agreement, and areas covered by the planned minimum dose (A>Dmin). RESULTS All techniques achieved good tumor coverage (A>Dmin> 99. 0 %) and minor changes in Dmean (± 3. 2 %). <b>Gating</b> and <b>tracking</b> strategies showed superior results in gamma agreement and ΔH 2 - 98 compared to ITV and MidV concepts, which seem to be more influenced by the interplay and the gradient effect. For lung, heart and spinal cord, significant dose differences between the four techniques were found (p< 0. 05), with lowest doses for <b>gating</b> and <b>tracking</b> strategies. CONCLUSION Active motion-management techniques, such as <b>gating</b> or <b>tracking,</b> showed superior tumor dose coverage and better organ dose sparing than the passive techniques based on tumor margins...|$|R

This deficiency is a major road-block for Internet and Application Service Providers who want to multiplex server resources among their business clients. To insulate applications from each other, we introduce Virtual Services (VSs). Besides providing per-service resource budgets, VSs drastically reduce cross-service interference in the presence of shared backend services, such as databases and name services. VSs provide dynamic per-service resource partitioning and management in a manner completely transparent to applications.

30|$|In {{the image}} target {{tracking}} process, the wave <b>gate</b> <b>tracking</b> method is adopted, that is, the target wave gate image is extracted at the corresponding {{position of the}} image, and only the target in the wave gate is calculated and processed to extract the miss distance. This method can effectively remove {{the impact of the}} wave outside the interference target. Improve the stability and rapidity of target tracking. When the target gray level changes greatly, the target will lose instantaneously. Therefore, trajectory prediction on the target is an indispensable part of the tracking process. Trajectory prediction means that when a target in a wave gate is lost, the position of the next target should be predicted based on the information on the positions, speeds, and directions of the previous frames, so as to drive the servo system to follow the target according to the predicted value. A stable tracking of the target occurs.|$|R

50|$|Although parking demand at Salem is high, {{approximately}} half of riders walk or bike to the station from nearby neighborhoods. Existing access via the footbridge at Washington Street is inconvenient {{for many of these}} passengers, particularly those coming from areas northwest of the station via North Street and southwest via Bridge Street. Reaching the station from these areas or an off-street lot along Bridge Street often involves crossing at an unsignalised crosswalk with poor visibility around a curve. Unofficial trails paralleling the two streets from the parking lot entrance are used by many pedestrians, but these routes are not handicapped accessible and involve trespassing on private land and/or the lightly used freight tracks. In April 2013, the City released a study that recommended constructing sidewalks and <b>gated</b> <b>track</b> crossings along these desire lines to enhance pedestrian access. However, an official pedestrian route following the unofficial path north of the platform to the nearby Jefferson at Salem Station development was ruled out in March 2013 due to safety concerns. The route would have crossed the mainline tracks, where there may be as little as three minutes between trains at rush hour.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design and testing of {{a model of the}} Synchronization and Video Conversion Unit (SVCU), a subsystem of the tracking radar (TR) at Denel Overberg Test Range (OTR). The SVCU synchronizes all the radar sub-systems and also converts the returned RF target signals to digital numbers. The technology within the SVCU is outdated and spares are scarce if not unattainable. This study forms {{the first phase of the}} development of a new SVCU and will determine the specifications of the hardware needed to build the replacement. Models of the transmit and receive chain of the radar were first developed in SystemVueTM. A comprehensive literature review was then done, yielding an accurate model of the current SVCU. The radar model was run, with simulated target and scene parameters, and its output fed into the SVCU model. The output of the SVCU was then processed by a CFAR detector and <b>gated</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms implemented in MathLang and Python. The simulated target was correctly identified in the range-Doppler plane. The <b>tracking</b> <b>gates</b> (used to measure range and Doppler) were then corrupted with jitter, rise- time and offsets. A statistical analysis was done on the effect of these impurities on the radar measurements. A new SVCU architecture, utilizing high speed ADCs and digital integrators, was then tested. The effects of non-linearities (DNL and INL) in the ADC and phase noise on the ADC sample clock on the radar measurements were analysed. The jitter on the transmit sync (TX), the ADC sample clock and <b>tracking</b> <b>gates</b> were found to be the most critical aspects of the SVCU. To meet the specified measurement accuracy of the radar, the root-sum-square of the jitter on these syncs (jitter budget) must not exceed 30 nanoseconds. A case study was then done to determine the jitter budget achievable in an FPGA-centric SVCU design. The study concluded that a jitter budget of 30 ns is achievable. Moreover, in an FPGA based design the jitter introduced by the interface sending the TX sync from the FPGA (SVCU) to the transmitter assembly will, almost entirely, determine the range accuracy of the TR. From these findings, a new SVCU, based on the RHINO board from the UCT RRSG, was recommended and the future work outlined...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced Roller <b>Track</b> <b>Gate</b> (RTG) for the gravity type Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS), called the Multi-functional Roller <b>Track</b> <b>Gate</b> (MRG). Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS) are specialized types of dry bulk carrier vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the discharging operations of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for offsetting the gate weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present Roller <b>Track</b> <b>Gate</b> with the Multi-functional Roller <b>Track</b> <b>Gate,</b> the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.

40|$|For ultra-wideband (UWB) communications, {{acquisition}} is challenging. The {{reason is}} from the ultra short pulse shape and ultra dense multipath interference. Ultra short pulse indicates the acquisition region is very narrow. Sampling is another challenge for UWB design due {{to the need for}} ultra high speed analog-to digital converter. A sub-optimum and under-sampling scheme using pilot codes as transmitted reference is proposed here for acquisition. The sampling rate for the receiver is at the symbol rate. A new architecture, the reference aided matched filter is studied in this project. The reference aided matched filter method avoids using complex rake receiver to estimate channel parameters and high sampling rate for interpolation. A limited number of matched filters are used as a filter bank to search for the strongest path. Timing offset for acquisition is then estimated and passed to an advanced verification algorithm. For optimum performance of acquisition, the adaptive post detection integration is proposed to solve the problem from dense inter-symbol interference during the acquisition. A low-complex early-late <b>gate</b> <b>tracking</b> loop is one element of the adaptive post detection integration. This tracking scheme assists in improving acquisition accuracy. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Matlab Simulink simulations in term of mean acquisition time, system performance and false alarm. Simulation results show proposed algorithm is very effective in ultra dense multipath channels. This research proves reference aided acquisition with tracking loop is promising in UWB application...|$|R
