40|$|Abstract. <b>Infilling</b> rock joints widely {{exist in}} natural rock masses, and the shear failure of <b>infilling</b> rock joints plays an {{important}} role in the instability of rock masses. In order to study the shear failure mechanism of <b>infilling</b> rock joints, Particle Flow Code is used to simulate the direct shear test of <b>infilling</b> rock joints. The PFC models with different <b>infilling</b> thickness are established firstly, and then the procedures of PFC simulation are described. In the end, the shear failure process of <b>infilling</b> rock joints with different <b>infilling</b> thickness is simulated. Based on the PFC simulation results, it can be concluded that the shear failure mode changes with increasing <b>infilling</b> thickness, and the shearing of the <b>infilling</b> rock joint rarely gives birth to microcracks in rock due to the existence of the <b>infilling</b> material...|$|R
40|$|Use of {{unreinforced}} masonry <b>infills</b> as partitions, {{in frame}} buildings {{is a common}} practice in India and {{many parts of the}} worlds. The <b>infills</b> are, generally, not considered in the design and the buildings are designed as bare frames. This study investigates the effect of masonry <b>infills</b> on the seismic performance of RC frame buildings. For this purpose, three buildings, 4 storey, 8 storey and 16 storey tall, having identical plan, have been considered. Linear analysis and design of each bare frame building has been performed as per the relevant Indian codes of practice. The effect of <b>infills</b> on dynamic characteristics, yield patterns and seismic performance has been studied with the help of Non-Linear Push-Over Analysis. It has been observed that <b>infills</b> contribute to a large increase in the stiffness and strength of the structure while the deformation capacity of the structure gets reduced. In case of uniformly <b>infilled</b> frame buildings designed as per codes, it has been observed that <b>infills</b> fail before frame elements. It has also been observed that due to strut action of <b>infills,</b> high axial forces get generated in columns of uniformly <b>infilled</b> frame buildings and as a result, columns fail earlier than those of bare frame buildings...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{performance}} of a ductile four-storey R/C structure with masonry <b>infills</b> was analyzed through nonlinear static and dynamic analyses {{and the effects of}} <b>infills</b> on the structural response were investigated. On the basis of results obtained from experimental tests carried out at the JRC Elsa Laboratory, numerical models were developed in order to properly simulate the seismic response of the R/C structure. A simplified approach based on nonlinear static analyses was applied for the seismic performance assessment of the R/C structure, comparing deformation capacity and demand. The expected contribution of masonry <b>infills</b> in terms of both strength and stiffness was evident when comparing the response of the different structural configurations under nonlinear static analyses. The increase of stiffness provided by the masonry <b>infills</b> led to anticipate, in terms of drift, the attainment of the different Limit States in the <b>infilled</b> structure compared to the bare counterpart. The presence of uniformly distributed <b>infills</b> considerably changed the distribution of damage throughout the structure. The maximum drift demand on the bare structure was registered at the second storey. On the contrary, the drift demand on the uniformly <b>infilled</b> structure concentrated at the first storey without excessive demands at the upper storeys. The influence of uniformly distributed <b>infills</b> on the seismic response of the investigated structure was beneficial according to the simplified assessment procedure. The effects of masonry openings on the structural response were investigated and different types of <b>infills</b> were considered in the numerical analyses. The presence of openings and the mechanical properties of the <b>infills</b> significantly affected the seismic response of the structure. The sudden drop of strength due to the failure of the <b>infills</b> led to damage concentration at the first storey in case of strong <b>infills</b> for severe seismic input motions...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} procedure, {{which can}} be used by practicing engineers, for the seismicdesign of masonry-infilled frames is presented. The analysis procedure, based on the experimental and analytical studies reported in the literature, accounts for the effect of <b>infills</b> in all three stages, namely, in computing seismic loading, in predicting response of the <b>infilled</b> frame, and in determining the strength of the <b>infilled</b> frame. Seismic loading is computed using the dynamic properties of the structure rather than arbitrary empirical relationships as recommended in design codes.

A second model which is basically a macro-modeling technique which uses the stiffness matrix method to analyze an equivalent one-strut model used to replace the <b>infilled</b> panel is also used in this work, and results obtained validated against that of the micro-modeling procedure. It was observed that the stiffness matrix method for macro-modeling of <b>infilled</b> frames can quickly and effectively model the shear strength response of <b>infilled</b> frames with openings up to a failure load...|$|R

A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds.

Regarding the behavior of framed structures, special attention has to be devoted to <b>infills</b> because of the key role they play in modifying overall stiffness, strength and ductility under seismic excitation. Pointing out the attention on this topic the paper discusses a criteria for modeling the structural behavior of <b>infills</b> based on a macromodeling approach, that is to say on the substitution of <b>infills</b> with diagonal pin jointed struts.
