Economic activities that manage raw materials, semi-finished materials with a high value to users, including the design of an industry, the {{furniture industry}} in Indonesia is spread almost throughout the province, both in the island of Java and outside Java. Technology has an important influence in fostering excellence in competition among companies, Hence the method technometric is a method {{that can be used}} by the industry in determining the standard of its technology, in this study the level of technology in the review only of the four components of the technology are: technoware, humanware, infoware, organware. Based on the calculation of the contribution of technology components, obtained under technoware value of 0. 314, humanware amounted to 0. 387, infoware amounted to 0. 668, and the value orgaware 0. 75. The smallest contribution component is the technology component technoware. This is because the technology used is still manual and traditional. The contribution technoware intensity value is 0, 199, the intensity contributions humanware is 0, 384, the intensity contributions infoware is 0, 299, and the intensity contributions orgaware is 0. 116. The results of the research that has been conducted almost all production processes still use manual equipment, but nothing has been using technology to facilitate the production process, such as nail <b>firing</b> <b>tools,</b> welding tools and compressors, technometric obtained from the calculation that the TCC is 0. 47233 so tesebut seemingly value indicates the level of technology that has been applied in the furniture industry PT.

40|$|Fire mission planning, {{either in}} support of own troops under attack or a strike mission {{to take out a}} high value target, becomes {{increasingly}} more complex especially at long ranges. In modern combat many aspects have to be considered like the Rules of Engagement (RoE), the time to effect, the available assets and munitions. Especially when operating in a coalition, these requirements can be very stressing. The battlefield becomes more and more digitized but getting all the right information at {{the right place at the}} right time to make the right decisions, both effective, safe and affordable, still is a difficult if not almost impossible task. Currently there are already <b>fire</b> mission planning <b>tools</b> available operationally that will help the mission planner choosing the right available assets and munitions for a particular mission, like the TNO <b>Fire</b> Support <b>Tool</b> (FIST) [1] and the NATO Indirect Fire Appreciation Kernel (NIFAK) part of the NAAG/LCG 3 /SG 2 S 4 suite of software tools [2].

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify how uncertainty in fire safety system effectiveness should be considered in a new risk-informed design <b>fire</b> <b>tool,</b> B-RISK. Specific objectives were to collect the available data on fire safety system effectiveness from the literature, investigate methods to improve fire safety system effectiveness data collection, develop the risk-informed design <b>fire</b> <b>tool</b> to propagate the uncertainties, and recommend methods to rank the sources of uncertainty for fire safety system effectiveness for appropriate model selection. The scope of the research is limited to the effects of systems on fire development and smoke spread and does not include the effects of the fire on systems (such as loss of structural integrity) or interactions with occupants. Sprinkler effectiveness data from recent New Zealand Fire Service data is included with a discussion of the uncertainty in this type of data and recommendations for improving data collection. The ability of the model to predict multiple sprinkler activations is developed in conjunction with a hydraulic submodel in B-RISK to include water supply pressure effects on sprinkler effectiveness. A new method of collecting reliability data on passive fire protection elements such as doors was developed. Data collected on the probability for doors in shared means of escape to be open and the time doors are open during occupant evacuation using this method is presented. Available data on smoke management system effectiveness is listed, along with a discussion of why there is more uncertainty associated with these systems compared with sprinkler systems. The capabilities of B-RISK for considering fire safety system effectiveness are demonstrated using Australasian case studies...|$|R

It is also through these episodes that the animosity, verging on hatred, between the Others and the Clan (whom they refer to derogatorily as [...] "flatheads") is introduced.

30|$|Several kinds. There is <b>fire</b> as a <b>tool,</b> <b>fire</b> as a tamed “species,” {{and fire}} as a {{captured}} ecological process, {{or at least}} {{these are the most}} common conceptions. Consider each in turn. Tool-fire embraces “tool” in its everyday meaning. Flame sits on a candle as a claw hammer sits on a handle. It applies concentrated heat and light. Of course one has to feed it wax and assure it has ample oxygen, whereas a hammer does not consume the wood of its handle or demand air; but there are good reasons to treat such <b>fires</b> as a <b>tool</b> in the vernacular sense. What one wants is the heat and light. It is thus possible to substitute another tool for this one, to use heated coils and electric lights, for example, instead of flame; or to put the “flame” into a chamber that disaggregates it into the most elemental parts of combustion and then apply its heat to power prime movers.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} by Sandia National Laboratories for the Federal Aviation Administration. The technical {{issues involved in}} fire modeling for aircraft fire research are identified, as well as computational <b>fire</b> <b>tools</b> for addressing those issues, and the research which is needed to advance those tools {{in order to address}} long-range needs. Fire field models are briefly reviewed, and the VULCAN model is selected for further evaluation. Calculations are performed with VULCAN to demonstrate its applicability to aircraft fire problems, and also to gain insight into the complex problem of fires involving aircraft. Simulations are conducted to investigate the influence of fire on an aircraft in a cross-wind. The interaction of the fuselage, wind, fire, and ground plane is investigated. Calculations are also performed utilizing a large eddy simulation (LES) capability to describe the large- scale turbulence instead of the more common k-{epsilon} turbulence model. Additional simulations are performed to investigate the static pressure and velocity distributions around a fuselage in a cross-wind, with and without fire. The results of these simulations provide qualitative insight into the complex interaction of a fuselage, fire, wind, and ground plane. Reasonable quantitative agreement is obtained in the few cases for which data or other modeling results exist Finally, VULCAN is used to quantify the impact of simplifying assumptions inherent in a risk assessment compatible fire model developed for open pool fire environments. The assumptions are seen to be of minor importance for the particular problem analyzed. This work demonstrates the utility of using a fire field model for assessing the limitations of simplified fire models. In conclusion, the application of computational <b>fire</b> modeling <b>tools</b> herein provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into the complex problem of aircraft in fires...|$|R

40|$|Fire is an {{intrinsic}} element of many forest ecosystems; it shapes their ecological processes, determines species composition and influences landscape structure. However, wildfires may: {{have undesirable effects on}} biodiversity and vegetation coverage; produce carbon emissions to the atmosphere; release smoke affecting human health; and cause loss of lives and property. There have been increasing {{concerns about the}} potential impacts of climate variability and change on forest fires. Climate change can alter factors that influence the occurrence of fire ignitions, fuel availability and fuel flammability. This review paper aims to identify tools and methods used for gathering information about the impacts of climate variability and change on forest fires, forest fuels and the probability of <b>fires.</b> <b>Tools</b> to assess the impacts of climate variability and change on forest fires include: remote sensing, dynamic global vegetation and landscape models, integrated fire-vegetation models, fire danger rating systems, empirical models and fire behavior models.
