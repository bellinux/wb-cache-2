5|$|Great feats {{were made}} during the third century in both the {{digestive}} and reproductive systems. Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver. He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes. <b>He</b> <b>recognized</b> that spermatozoa were produced by the testes {{and was the first}} to identify the prostate gland.|$|E

Kabandha requested that Rama perform his cremation rites, offered him what information he could, and died.|$|E
5|$|The last taxonomic {{delineation}} of the jaguar subspecies {{was performed}} by Pocock in 1939. Based on geographic origins and skull morphology, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> eight subspecies. However, {{he did not have}} access to sufficient specimens to critically evaluate all subspecies, and he expressed doubt about the status of several. Later consideration of his work suggested only three subspecies should be recognized.|$|E

5|$|Washington assumed {{command of}} the Continental Army in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts in July 1775 during the ongoing siege of Boston. <b>He</b> <b>recognized</b> his army's desperate {{shortage}} of gunpowder and sought new sources. American troops raided British arsenals, including some in the Caribbean, and some manufacturing was attempted.

5|$|When Johnny Carson, {{a fan of}} jazz music, was {{preparing}} to take over as the permanent host of The Tonight Show starting in October 1962, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> that he would need a theme song. Carson and Anka had worked together in England on the television special An Evening with Paul Anka in 1961; when they happened to meet up again in New York City the following year, Carson manager Al Bruno mentioned needing a theme.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, the Indians torched {{the house}} and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back to bury the dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack. After staying at the {{settlement}} for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave had heard the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.|$|E

5|$|Fries himself {{declined}} {{to keep the}} genus separate, instead classifying Gomphus as a tribus (subgenus) within the genus Cantharellus in his 1821 work Systema Mycologicum, the species becoming Cantharellus clavatus. <b>He</b> <b>recognized</b> four varieties: violaceo-spadiceus, carneus, purpurascens and umbrinus. Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan described three taxa—Merulius clavatus carneus, M.clavatus violaceus and M.clavatus purpurascens—in his 1833 work Mycographie Suisse. Many of his names have been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan had a narrow species concept, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum, placing it in a series—Deformes—in the genus Craterellus.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} the University of Virginia, {{where he played}} basketball and baseball; {{he was a member}} of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. His brother Bill also played baseball for Virginia. During the off-season, umpire Cy Rigler worked as an assistant coach for the University. <b>He</b> <b>recognized</b> Rixey's talent and tried to sign him to the Philadelphia Phillies. Rixey originally declined, saying he wanted to be a chemist, but Rigler insisted, even offering a substantial portion of the bonus he received for signing a player. With his family in financial trouble, Rixey accepted the deal. The National League, upon hearing of the deal, created a rule that prohibits umpires from signing players. Neither Rixey nor Rigler received any signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in Webster County. He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it was covered with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} initial and final states. When Born read the paper, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Ford {{published}} a complete description of ankylosaurian osteoderms, in which <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> the group Struthiosaurinae. Ford's description of Struthiosaurinae {{was based on}} the genus Struthiosaurus. Ford found that Struthiosaurus transylvanicus lacked any remains of the jugal, which makes a jugal scute unknown. The skull roof of T. transylvanicus is large and bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind the orbits. Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the cranium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{identified}} the hieroglyphic script on the Rosetta stone as being {{written in a}} mixture of ideograms and phonetic signs, just as Young had argued for Demotic. He reasoned that if the script was entirely ideographic the hieroglyphic text would require as many separate signs as there were separate words in the Greek text. But there were in fact fewer, suggesting that the script mixed ideographic and phonetic signs. This realization finally made it possible for him to detach himself from the idea that the different scripts had to be either fully ideographic or fully phonetic, and <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> it as being much more complex mixture of sign types. This realization gave him a distinct advantage.|$|E

5|$|Mindaugas and his {{antagonist}} Daniel {{reached a}} reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands {{were transferred to}} Roman, Daniel's son. Afterwards Mindaugas's son Vaišvilkas received baptism {{as a member of}} the Orthodox faith, becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery. Tautvilas's antagonism was temporarily resolved when <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> Mindaugas's superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom. A direct confrontation with the Mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259, when Berke Khan sent his general Burundai to challenge Lithuanian rule, ordering Daniel and other regional princes to participate. The Novgorod Chronicle describes the following action as a defeat of the Lithuanians, but it has also been seen as a net gain for Mindaugas.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of Siletzia began in 1906 with Arnold's description and naming {{of a small}} exposure {{on the north side}} of the Olympic Peninsula near Port Crescent. Though this exposure is small, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> as very likely that much more of it was buried under younger deposits. With recognition that similar rock exposed at other outcrops is part of the same formation, the name Crescent Formation is now generally applied to all early and middle Eocene basalts on the Olympic Peninsula and Puget Lowland.|$|E
5|$|There {{are only}} three stars in the {{constellation}} brighter than magnitude 4.5, and 37stars with a magnitude brighter than 6.5. Leo Minor {{does not have a}} star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give 46Leonis Minoris a Bayer designation, as <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> Beta and 46Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.|$|E

5|$|When Barnhart {{revised the}} family Lentibulariaceae in 1916, <b>he</b> <b>recognized</b> six {{species in the}} section Orcheosanthus, admitting however that this number was likely to change as others studied the section in the future. Sprague in 1928 {{proposed}} that the species joined by Hemsley were probably distinct, but that they were likely so interrelated that distinguishing between them would require observing characteristics that were usually or always indistinct in dried specimens. Sprague recognized eight species in the section: P. moranensis H.B.K, P. caudata Schltdl., P. oblongiloba, P. flos-mulionis, P. bakeriana, a P. moranensis-like P. rosei described by Watson in 1911, and the very distinct P. gypsicola.|$|E
