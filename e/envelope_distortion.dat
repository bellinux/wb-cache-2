40|$|In species-rich assemblages, {{differential}} {{utilization of}} vertical space can {{be driven by}} resource availability. For animals that communicate acoustically over long distances under habitat-induced constraints, access to an effective transmission channel is a valuable resource. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis suggests that habitat acoustics imposes a selective pressure that drives the evolution of both signal structure and choice of calling sites by signalers. This predicts that species-specific signals transmit best in native habitats. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that vertical stratification of calling heights of acoustically communicating species is driven by acoustic adaptation. This was tested in an assemblage of 12 coexisting species of crickets and katydids in a tropical wet evergreen forest. We carried out transmission experiments using natural calls at different heights from the forest floor to the canopy. We measured signal degradation using 3 different measures: total attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion.</b> Different sets of species supported the hypothesis depending on which attribute of signal degradation was examined. The hypothesis was upheld by 5 species for attenuation and by 3 species each for SNR and <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion.</b> Only 1 species of 12 provided support for the hypothesis by all 3 measures of signal degradation. The results thus provided no overall support for acoustic adaptation as a driver of vertical stratification of coexisting cricket and katydid species...|$|E

In this paper the influence of non-linear output capacitance of the transistor in the class-E amplifier on its Vo(VDD) characteristic is analyzed using PSPICE simulations of the amplifiers operating at frequencies 0. 5 MHz, 5 MHz and 7 MHz. These simulations have proven that distortions of the Vo(VDD) characteristic caused by non-linear output capacitance of the transistor are only slight for all analyzed amplifiers, even for the 7 MHz amplifier without the external (linear) shunt capacitance.

40|$|Vocoder {{simulation}} {{studies have}} suggested that the carrier signal type employed affects the intelligibility of vocoded speech. The present work further assessed how carrier signal type interacts with additional signal processing, namely, single-channel noise suppression and envelope dynamic range compression, in determining the intelligibility of vocoder simulations. In Experiment 1, Mandarin sentences that had been corrupted by speech spectrum-shaped noise (SSN) or two-talker babble (2 TB) were processed by one of four single-channel noise-suppression algorithms before undergoing tone-vocoded (TV) or noise-vocoded (NV) processing. In Experiment 2, dynamic ranges of multiband envelope waveforms were compressed by scaling of the mean-removed envelope waveforms with a compression factor before undergoing TV or NV processing. TV Mandarin sentences yielded higher intelligibility scores with normal-hearing (NH) listeners than did noise-vocoded sentences. The intelligibility advantage of noise-suppressed vocoded speech depended on the masker type (SSN vs 2 TB). NV speech was more negatively influenced by envelope dynamic range compression than was TV speech. These findings suggest that an interactional effect exists between the carrier signal type employed in the vocoding process and <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion</b> caused by signal processing...|$|E
40|$|Double-sideband {{amplitude-modulation}} {{is widely}} used because of its simplicity in transmission and reception, but {{in a number of}} applications the inclusion of a data channel has become an additional requirement. An additional data signal, transmitted with a normal AM broadcast signal, can be used by a specially-equipped receiver to provide for display and control functions. The data signals should not impair the main broadcast signals, and should be imperceptible to listeners with ordinary radio receivers. The principles of a new modulation scheme, which permits an additional data channel to be superimposed on conventional DSB-AM signals without any bandwidth increase or <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion,</b> are described in this thesis. The proposed system uses combined amplitude/frequency modulation to provide for the additional data channel. It is shown that bandlimitation may be preserved by frequency modulating the carrier with frequency-modulating functions related to the complex zeros of the amplitude-modulating signal. The performance of the new modulation technique is assessed by computer simulation. The cross-talk between the two channels due to multipath propagation {{is considered to be a}} limiting factor.

40|$|Speech {{reception}} depends critically on temporalmodulations in the amplitude {{envelope of}} the speech signal. Reverberation encountered in everyday environments can substantially attenuate these modulations. To assess the effect of reverberation on the neural coding of amplitude envelope, we recorded from single units in the inferior colliculus (IC) of unanesthetized rabbit using sinusoidally amplitude modulated (AM) broadband noise stimuli presented in simulated anechoic and reverberant environments. Although reverberation degraded both rate and temporal coding of AM in IC neurons, inmost neurons, the degradation in temporal coding was smaller than the AM attenuation in the stimulus. This compensation could largely {{be accounted for by}} the compressive shape of the modulation input– output function (MIOF), which describes the nonlinear transformation ofmodulation depth fromacoustic stimuli into neural responses. Additionally, in a subset of neurons, the temporal coding of AM was better for reverberant stimuli than for anechoic stimuli having the same modulation depth at the ear. Using hybrid anechoic stimuli that selectively possess certain properties of reverberant sounds, we show that this reverberant advantage is not caused by <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion,</b> static interaural decorrelation, or spectral coloration. Overall, our results suggest that the auditory systemmay possess dualmechanisms thatmake the coding of amplitude envelope relatively robust in reverberation: one general mechanism operating for all stimuli with small modulation depths, and anothermechanism dependent on very specific properties of reverberant stimuli, possibly the periodic fluctuations in interaural correlation at the modulation frequency.

Every imperfection in the CROW structure is modeled as an impedance discontinuity, and the related backreflection is evaluated by using well-known reflection rules. We demonstrate that backreflections induced by disorder scale with the square of the slowing factor and the square of the disorder parameter, both independently of the specific structure. The method is simple and accurate, holds even when the slowing factor of the CROW is modified by disorder, and can be applied to any slow-light structure where the characteristic impedance can be defined. Theoretical and numerical results are supported by an experimental investigation showing the effects of increasing disorder on both frequency and time domain responses of a ring resonator CROW.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{shows the}} use of {{consistent}} variational modelling to obtain and verify an accurate model for uni-directional surface water waves. Starting from Luke’s variational principle for inviscid irrotational water flow, Zakharov’s Hamiltonian formulation is derived to obtain a description in surface variables only. Keeping the exact dispersion properties of infinitesimal waves, the kinetic energy is approximated. Invoking a uni-directionalization constraint leads to the recently proposed AB-equation, a KdV-type of equation that is also valid on infinitely deep water, that is exact in dispersion for infinitesimal waves, and that is second order accurate in the wave height. The accuracy of the model is illustrated for two different cases. One concerns the formulation of steady periodic waves as relative equilibria; the resulting wave profiles and the speed are good approximations of Stokes waves, even for the Highest Stokes Wave on deep water.

The unwanted phase modulation {{is assumed to be}} present equally on either FSK tone and is modeled as a sample function of a Gaussian random process. Results are derived based on a standard type FSK system employing bandpass filters, square law envelope detectors, a subtractor, and a post detection lowpass data filter. The degradation was found to depend on the mark-space filter bandwidths, the doppler frequency of the received tones, the nominal SNR and the post detection filter bandwidths. The degradation is minimal for small doppler shifts; however, once the tones, in the predetection filters were displaced to within the post detection filter bandwidth of the predetection filter band edge, the degradation increased dramatically. This was {{due to the fact that}} the filtering of the phase noise caused the envelope detectors to produce self noise. In fact, at high SNR's the degradation is primarily due to self noise or <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion</b> due to filtering of the phase jitter spectrum. It is important to point out that the degradation found here is due only to phase noise effects and not sin χ/χ losses. The results derived here are accurate for phase jitter variances ≲ 0. 1.

40|$|Plasma-based {{particle}} acceleration holds {{the promise to}} make the applications that revolve around accelerators more affordable. The central unifying theme of this dissertation is the modeling of certain non-linear and relativistic phenomena in plasma dynamics to devise mechanisms that benefit plasma-accelerators. Plasma acceleration presented here has two distinct flavors depending upon the accelerated particle mass which dictates the acceleration structure velocity and potential. The first deals with ion acceleration, where acceleration structure velocities are a significant fraction {{of the speed of}} light, with major applications in medicine. The second focusses on the acceleration of electrons and positrons for light-sources and colliders where the acceleration structures are wakefields with phase-velocities near the speed of light. The increasing Lorentz factor of the laser-driven electron quiver momentum forms the basis of Relativistically Induced Transparency Acceleration (RITA) scheme of ion acceleration. Lighter ions are accelerated by reflecting off a propagating acceleration structure, referred to as a snowplow, formed by the compression of ponderomotively driven critical layer electrons excited in front of a high intensity laser pulse in a fixed-ion plasma. Its velocity is controlled by tailoring the laser pulse rise-time and rising density gradient scale-length. We analytically model its induced transparency driven propagation with a 1 -D model based on the linearized dispersion relation. The model is shown to be in good agreement with the weakly non-linear simulations. As the density compression rises into the strongly non-linear regime, the scaling law predictions remain accurate but the model does not exactly predict the RITA velocity or the accelerated ion-energy. Multi-dimensional plasma effects modify the laser radial envelope by self-focussing in the rising density gradient which can be integrated into our model and filamentation which is mitigated by a matched laser focal spot-size. We show that the critical layer motion in RITA compares favorably to the bulk-plasma motion driven by radiation pressure or collision-less shocks. Non-linear mixing of the laser, incident on and reflected off the propagating critical layer modulates its envelope affecting the acceleration structure velocity and potential, in the process setting up a feedback loop. For long pulses the <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion</b> grows with time, disrupting the accelerated ion-beam spectral shape. We model the Chirp Induced Transparency Acceleration (ChITA) mechanism that over- comes this effect by introducing decoherence through a frequency chirp in the laser. In a rising density gradient, the non-linearity of electron trajectories leads to the phase-mixing self-injection of electrons into high phase-velocity plasma wakefields. The onset of trapping depends upon the wake amplitude and the density gradient scale-length. This self-injection mechanism is also applicable to controlling the spuriously accelerated electrons that affect the beam-quality. Non-linear ion dynamics behind a train of asymmetric electron-wake excites a cylindrical ion-soliton similar to the solution of the cylindrical Korteweg-de Vries (cKdV) equation. This non-linear ion-wake establishes an upper limit on the repetition rate of the future plasma colliders. The soliton is excited at the non-linear electron wake radius due to the time-asymmetry of its radial fields. In a non-equilibrium wake heated plasma the radial electron temperature gradient drives the soliton. Its radially outwards propagation leaves behind a partially-filled ion-wake channel. We show positron-beam driven wakefield acceleration in the ion-wake channel. Optimal positron-wakefield acceleration with linear focussing fields is shown to require a matched hollow-plasma channel of a radius that depends upon the beam properties. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|Several animals, both {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate, communicate using {{sound and}} they {{do so in a}} non-ideal medium, the habitat in which they live. As acoustic signals pass through the habitat, they suffer loss of information due to signal degradation, which is often determined by the acoustic properties of the habitat. Understanding the influence of habitat-induced constraints on signaling is vital to the understanding of evolution of signal structure. Over time signals can evolve their temporal and/or spectral characteristics so as to resist or reduce degradation. Conversely, signalers may modify their behaviour so as to improve transmission for effective communication. The Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis (AAH) predicts that given the properties of the habitat in which animals communicate, signals should evolve so as to maximize their broadcast range and the number of potential receivers. The prediction of the hypothesis is that signal transmission is best in the native habitat as compared to non-native habitats. Since its inception, the idea of acoustic adaptation has been tested in several vertebrate species including birds, mammals and frogs but rarely in invertebrates. Moreover, most of these studies have been carried out at the macrohabitat level, such as transmission in forests versus grasslands. For animals with limited mobility such as invertebrates, a finer level of investigation at the microhabitat level is more relevant. Only one study on cicadas has investigated the predictions of the AAH at the microhabitat level. Besides, investigations done at the community level are largely missing in the literature. The effect of height on signal transmission is well documented, however, only one study on birds has investigated the AAH with respect to vertical stratification of coexisting species. Among invertebrates, crickets are well known for their calling songs which males use to attract conspecific females over long distances. No study so far has tested the prediction of the AAH in these acoustically communicating invertebrates. The central focus {{of this study was to}} test the predictions of the AAH in a natural assemblage of ensiferan (cricket) species. I examined the prediction of the hypothesis at the microhabitat level with respect to the vertical stratification of co-existing ensiferan species. The study was carried out on an assemblage of crickets in the wet evergreen forests of Kudremukh National Park in the Western Ghats in Southern India. For this purpose, it was important to examine calling height and microhabitat selection in these animals because if the use of calling height and microhabitat was random, then there would not be any native height/microhabitat and the question of acoustic adaption would not arise. Therefore, I first standardized methods to characterize the habitat of the crickets. Using resource selection functions, I then quantified microhabitat selection in 13 ensiferan species. I also examined the calling heights of these species. My results suggest that these species are microhabitat specialists and also distribute vertically within the forest with respect to calling height. Based on the knowledge of the vertical distribution of these animals in the forest I then carried out playback experiments using natural calls of 12 species of Ensifera in their natural habitat. The transmission experiments were carried out at five heights in the forest, including the ground, different parts of the understorey as well as in the canopy. The study aimed to examine whether vertical stratification in the ensiferan species of Kudremukh is driven by selection for maximizing transmission range. I examined the effect of different heights on signal degradation. The investigation was carried out with respect to three different measures of signal degradation, namely, total attenuation, signal to noise ratio as well as <b>envelope</b> <b>distortion.</b> The results indicate a lack of overall support for the AAH with respect to vertical stratification of crickets in Kudremukh. However, a strong, independent effect of height of calling on signal degradation was found, with the ground being the worst layer for transmission and the mid-understorey (2 m) emerging to be good for all species with respect to all three measures of signal degradation. I then analysed the transmission data from a different point of view, exploring the possibility of evolution of signal structures that may confer some advantages in terms of signal transmission, given the habitat-induced constrains on signal propagation. The idea was to examine why certain species perform better than others in terms of signal transmission. This investigation was aimed at characterizing the effect of call features on signal attenuation. I found that temporal features of calls did not have a strong effect on height-specific signal attenuation. While call duration had no effect on signal attenuation, duty cycle did influence attenuation profiles of the calls, with high duty cycle calls performing better than low duty cycle calls. However, there was no interaction of height with the temporal features of calls, eliminating the possibility of these features being shaped by microhabitat or height dependent transmission characteristics. Spectral features of calls, on the other hand, affected signal attenuation very strongly. As expected, low frequency calls performed better than high frequency calls and pure tone calls fared much better than the broadband calls, especially on the ground and the canopy. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to carry out a rigorous quantification of microhabitat selection in Ensifera. This is also the first detailed examination of the Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis at the microhabitat level, tested in a natural assemblage of coexisting invertebrate species...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedMost {{currently}} available cochlear implant devices {{are designed to}} reflect the tonotopic representation of acoustic frequencies within the cochlea. Unfortunately, the electrode array cannot cover the entire cochlea due to physical limitations or patient-related factors. Therefore, CI patients generally listen to spectrally up-shifted and/or distorted speech. Acute studies suggest that speech performance is best when the acoustic input is spectrally matched to the cochlear place of stimulation; performance deteriorates as the spectral mismatch is increased. However, many CI users are able to somewhat adapt to spectrally shifted and distorted speech as they gain experience with their device. Motivated by both the theoretical and clinical implications of CI users’ perceptual adaptation, the present study explores perceptual adaptation to spectrally shifted vowels using behavioral studies and an acoustic analysis framework. Normal-hearing subjects are tested while listening to acoustic simulations of CI processing. These experiments are designed to address several issues related to perceptual adaptation to spectrally shifted speech. The first issue addressed by an experiment in this project is whether and where along the cochlea the lexically meaningful feedback is necessary for improving recognition performance of spectrally shifted vowels. Secondly, the effects of spectral shift extent on perceptual adaptation to spectrally shifted vowels are systematically investigated using an unsupervised learning protocol, including the effect of linearly spectral shift, the effect of different spectral <b>envelope</b> <b>distortions,</b> {{and the effect of}} spectral resolution on perceptual adaptation to severely-shifted vowels with and without concurrent exposures to moderately-shifted vowels. Finally, an acoustic analysis framework is developed to interpret experimental findings.; This framework is used to explore mechanisms that may underlie perceptual adaptation to spectrally shifted speech, as well as to functionally model speech recognition performance for spectrally shifted and/or degraded vowels in CI users. In terms of clinical relevance, the present study provides important guidelines for the development and refinement of fitting procedures and training protocols for post-lingually deafened CI users. In terms of theoretical relevance, the present study introduces some new perspectives regarding speech perception and adaptation. The result of the present study may also benefit {{currently available}} engineering techniques for automatic speech recognition...|$|R

After non-linear amplification has been done, signal modulation schemes having constant or quasi-constant envelopes {{are not as}} susceptible to spectral regrowth as those with non-constant <b>envelopes.</b> Since such <b>distortion</b> generates interference in the adjacent channels, the power operation of the amplifier in non-constant envelope modulations is typically backed off, resulting in systems with reduced power efficiency. On the other hand, constant envelope modulation may have different bandwidth spectra.

40|$|Amplification {{of signals}} with {{fluctuating}} <b>envelopes</b> leads to <b>distortion</b> because of non-linear {{behavior of the}} Power Amplifier (PA). Digital Predistortion can counteract these non-linear effects. A crosscorrelation predistorter is a digital predistorter, based on the calculation of crosscorrelation functions using coarsely quantized signals. The crosscorrelation functions are transformed to the frequency domain and the spectra are {{used to calculate the}} coefficients of the predistorter memory polynomial. This method has reduced complexity and equivalent performance in comparison with existing schemes. In this paper, four alternative schemes to implement a crosscorrelation predistorter are analyzed. The PA characteristics can be determined either directly or indirectly using ’normal’ or orthogonal polynomials giving four alternatives. All four alternatives give significant reduction of Adjacent Channel Interference...|$|R
40|$|In [1] a new {{formulation}} for quantifying the linearizing baseband voltage signal, injected at {{the output}} bias port, to linearize a device behaviour was introduced. A key {{feature of this}} approach is that since it is formulated in the envelope domain the number of linearization coefficient required is independent of the envelope shape, complexity. This property is validated by performing baseband linearization investigations on a 10 W Cree GaN HEMT device. Modulated signals with increasing complexity 3, 5, and 9 -tone modulated stimulus, at 1. 5 dB of compression, were utilized. In all cases just two-linearization coefficients needed to be determined in order to compute the output baseband signal <b>envelope</b> necessary. Intermodulation <b>distortion</b> was reduced to around - 50 dBc, a value very close to the dynamic range limit of the measurement system...|$|R

This paper discusses a method to limit the slew-rate (and consequently the bandwidth) of the signal’s envelope. Moreover, since the envelope tracking (ET) technique using a slower version of the original <b>envelope</b> introduces nonlinear <b>distortion,</b> slow <b>envelope</b> dependent predistortion has to be also incorporated in the design of ET PAs. Experimental results showed {{that it is possible to}} find a compromise between the bandwidth and slew-rate reduction (necessary to cope with the specific envelope amplifier requirements) and the amount of drain efficiency degradation suffered due to the use of a slower version of the original envelope.

40|$|In this paper, {{advantage}} {{is taken from}} the particular characteristics of Enhancement-mode Pseudomorphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (E-pHEMT) devices {{for the design of}} synchronous rectifiers with an unbiased gate. Based on one of them, the design of a class E synchronous rectifier working in the 900 MHz frequency band, is proposed. A lumped-element multi-harmonic class E amplifier was first designed, exploiting the time-reversal dualily, to then introduce a drain-to-gate feedback and operate it in the desired synchronous rectifying mode. Competitive efficiency figures are demonstrated over a significant input power, frequency and load resistance range. An efficiency peak of 83 % has been measured at 17 dBm, staying above 70 % for a 14 dB input power range, a distinguishing characteristic when compared to Schottky diode based alternatives. The verified AM-AM conversion linearity would also allow using the rectifier for the efficient extraction of a time-varying excitation <b>envelope</b> without significant <b>distortion...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{problems}} faced in magnetic resonance imaging and angiography are due to hardware limitations of the scanners used. The use of multidimensional excitation pulses, and new, fast acquisition sequences such as echo-planar and spiral imaging, put demands on the gradient systems and although technology is progressing in these areas, performance must be carefully monitored to ensure artefact-free images. This thesis deals with four distinct aspects of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A simple hardware modification to decrease the minimum achievable echo-time of our MRI scanner was designed, built, programmed and tested and was found {{to improve the quality}} of inflow angiograms significantly. Further improvements were demonstrated with the use of on-resonance (binomial) magnetization transfer saturation contrast enhancement pulses. A method for measuring the k-space trajectories of gradient waveforms was adopted, modified, validated and used to measure the k-space trajectories of gradient waveforms used for selective excitation and spiral image acquisition. Distortion was observed even when gradient waveforms were designed within specifications of the manufacturer. The literature reports the application of the k-space model, usually associated with image acquisition, to the design of multidimensional selective excitation pulses. This thesis demonstrates theoretically and experimentally the modification of the design procedure to compensate RF <b>envelopes</b> for <b>distortion</b> of the k-space trajectories of the accompanying gradient waveforms by using measured k-space data. The correction of spiral image reconstruction algorithms to compensate for k-space trajectory distortion was also demonstrated theoretically and experimentally...|$|R
