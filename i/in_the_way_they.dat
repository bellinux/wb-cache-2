5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E

Some simulators estimate the time of collision by linear interpolation, roll back the simulation, and calculate the collision by the more abstract methods of conservation laws.|$|E

Therefore, this thesis seeks to conceive of a process of community formation that would act <b>in</b> cooperation with <b>the</b> formal process of education to constructively model the community structure that the educational vision aims to promote. The author aims to develop a holistic understanding of the development of community from sociological, anthropological, and educational perspectives. Questions addressed include: Why do communities develop and how do certain systems of values come to lie at the foundation of these communities? How are these value systems taught? Why are some neglected? Methodology includes a case study at Swarthmore College...|$|R
