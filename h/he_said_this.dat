5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} in Motor Cycle {{magazine}} in 1914, Alfred Scott wrote that {{he was drawn to}} the two-stroke engine because he was trained on high speed steam and marine engines, and when turning his attention to gas and petrol engines the regular power strokes of the two-stroke (or Day cycle as he sometimes called it), seemed preferable to the one power stroke in four of the Otto cycle. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> attraction to the two stroke was further enhanced by the reliable and excellent service from a two stroke engine designed by his brother (A. F. Scott M.I.M.E) and used to drive machinery in his experimental workshop.|$|E

500|$|Sylvester Carrier was {{reported}} in the New York Times saying that the attack on Fannie Taylor was an [...] "example of what negroes could do without interference". Whether or not <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> is debated, but a group of 20 to 30 white men, inflamed by the reported statement, went to the Carrier house. [...] They believed that the black community in Rosewood was hiding escaped prisoner Jesse Hunter.|$|E
500|$|Kenji Yoshino, a New York University School of Law professor, in his [...] (2006), criticizes social {{pressures}} {{to conform to}} mainstream white culture. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> violated African Americans' civil rights, and they can uphold their own social distinctions. He said {{they should be able}} to freely choose to identify with white culture if they wish. Anne Arnett Ferguson, a professor at Smith College, wrote in 2001 that white culture [...] "ruthlessly excludes African American cultural modes as relevant and meaningful". She highlighted the insistence in schools of standard English over Black Vernacular English as an example.|$|E

500|$|On 22 September 2012 Fowler {{announced}} that he is [...] "all but retired from professional football." [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> on the television show Soccer AM. In an interview in March 2013, {{he said that he}} was [...] "not officially retired" [...] and would [...] "jump at the opportunity to play again." [...] Fowler has also stated in other interviews that he is currently completing his coaching licences. Fowler was on a six-man shortlist and interviewed for the vacant manager's job at Conference side Macclesfield Town in May 2013, but caretaker manager John Askey was eventually appointed on a full-time basis.|$|E
500|$|In {{the liner}} notes to the 2003 remastered {{version of the}} album, lead singer Ian McCulloch said that he {{constantly}} had the American rock band The Velvet Underground's song [...] "What Goes On" [...] {{in the back of}} his mind. He also stated that the band wanted to record a soul album. In the same liner notes, bassist Les Pattinson said that the band was often lazy and hence had hired rehearsal space at the Ministry in Liverpool. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> made them work harder and develop [...] "language" [...] in the rhythm. According to guitarist Will Sergeant, McCulloch considers Heaven Up Here to be Sergeant's album because he was bossy and a control freak during the recording.|$|E
500|$|Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' {{decision}} not to use this opportunity to directly address the [...] "deep and foundational" [...] differences between the historic Christian faith {{and that of the}} LDS church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but [...] "graciously build {{one step at a time}} in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias had nothing to do with editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment.|$|E

500|$|In the British House of Lords on 26 July, Brockway pressed Lord Taylor, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, on Rhodesia's claims, {{arguing that}} failure {{to block the}} Lisbon {{appointment}} would amount to conceding de facto recognition to Rhodesia as an independent state. Taylor's response was that Britain remained committed to upholding its ultimate purview over Rhodesian overseas relations. Brockway then asked how Rhodesia had attained its independent office in Pretoria; surely, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>this</b> provided [...] "a precedent which was rather dangerous?" [...] Taylor replied that Pretoria and Salisbury had exchanged High Commissioners before South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961, and that Britain had granted Rhodesia special dispensation to retain the Pretoria mission thereafter. He stressed that in Britain's eyes this was no precedent for Lisbon.|$|E
500|$|When Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 3 September 1939, following the invasion of Poland, Southern Rhodesia issued its own declaration of war almost immediately, before any of the dominions did. Huggins backed full military mobilisation and [...] "a war to the finish", telling parliament that the conflict was one of national survival for Southern Rhodesia {{as well as for}} Britain—the mother country's defeat would leave little hope for the colony in the post-war world, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>This</b> stand was almost unanimously supported by the white populace, as well as most of the coloured community, though with World War I a recent memory this was more {{out of a sense of}} patriotic duty than enthusiasm for war in itself. The majority of the black population paid little attention to the outbreak of war.|$|E
500|$|In August, {{the band}} {{announced}} {{the recording of}} its fourteenth album with producer Johnny K. At the start of 2013, Megadeth left Roadrunner Records for Mustaine's newly founded label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. The album, Super Collider, was released in June and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position since 1994's Youthanasia. Critical reaction to the album, however, was largely negative. Shortly {{after the release of}} Super Collider, Mustaine stated that he had already started thinking about a fifteenth Megadeth album. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> had been spurred by the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman, which gave him a sense of mortality. Mustaine elaborated: [...] "You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they're gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can." ...|$|E

500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
500|$|Burger's Daughter was {{generally}} well-received by critics. Anthony Sampson, a British writer, journalist and {{former editor of}} Drum, a magazine in Johannesburg in the 1950s, wrote in The New York Times that this is Gordimer's [...] "most political and most moving novel". He said that its [...] "political authenticity" [...] set in the [...] "historical background of real people" [...] makes it [...] "harshly realistic", and added that the blending of people, landscapes and politics remind {{one of the great}} Russian pre-revolutionary novels. In The New York Review of Books, Irish politician, writer and historian Conor Cruise O'Brien compared Gordimer's writing to that of Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, and described Burger's Daughter as [...] "elegant" [...] and [...] "fastidious" [...] and belonging to a [...] "cultivated upper class". <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> style is not at odds with {{the subject matter of the}} story because Rosa Burger, daughter of a revolutionary, believes herself to be an [...] "aristocrat of the revolution".|$|E
500|$|... "You Can't Win" [...] {{has been}} {{referenced}} and performed on several occasions. In the 1982 blockbuster film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, a snippet {{of the song}} is heard on a car radio. In 2001 Jill Scott performed the song during the [...] celebration. In 2003, during the second season of American Idol, contestant Charles Grigsby sang [...] "You Can't Win" [...] for a movie theme night. An Entertainment Weekly writer said that the song choice was [...] "oddly appropriate", as the hopeful was eliminated from the competition after the performance. Decades {{after the release of}} [...] "You Can't Win", William F. Brown stated that the song had been dropped from his theater productions of The Wiz. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was because the musical was not a black message show, but a show for everybody to enjoy. He expressed the opinion that [...] "You Can't Win" [...] was no longer relevant, stating, [...] " [...] all changed. Black people can win." ...|$|E
