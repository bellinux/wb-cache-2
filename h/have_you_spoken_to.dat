6000|$|... "And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> your grandson, old Mr. Scott?" [...] I said. [...] "It is {{but right}} {{that you should}} make {{yourself}} known to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will I, with joy," [...] {{answered}} the Hebrew with kindling eye; [...] "but your ambition soars high, prince. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Branwen on these subjects?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, sir. Don't {{talk to me}} in that way. As if I didn't {{know where}} your heart was. What right <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> an L. D. down in the country?" ...|$|R
40|$|Mabel R. Leonard (Heads of Department Association of the Borough of Brooklyn), 1069 Prospect Place, New York, New York, USA, letter, 1922 January 17, to Hamlin Garland, 71 East 92 nd Street, New York Manhattan, New York, USA. "It {{will be a}} {{pleasure}} {{as well as a}} great privilege <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> us at our luncheon…" [...] first line...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} talk with you, sir. What right <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me? I {{do not know}} you. One would know you came from a land {{where there are no}} gentlemen. No GENTLEMAN would treat a lady as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> treated me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gently, gently, Mr. Graham. Let {{us have a}} {{few more}} words before we accede to the {{necessity}} of anything so sudden. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Madeline on this subject?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Just a woman's wiles. At {{this moment}} she can't hear us, {{but she knows}} pretty nearly what we are saying by the way our lips are going. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of the letter which mentions Miss Jethro's strange visit. Emily was so puzzled and so surprised that she showed it to me--and we both consulted my father. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Emily about Miss Jethro?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] {{said the}} girl indignantly. [...] "I have not come back to walk with you!" [...] She waited a moment; then she burst out with, [...] "How dare you {{say such a thing}} to me? What right <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me so? What have I done to make you think that I would come back to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hamel, I {{told you}} about Aunt Emmeline. She will not allow it. I ought not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> let <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me like this, while I am staying here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, uncle, why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> me? Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> {{not told}} me what to do? Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> not advised me? Why are you always so silent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing could please us better," [...] she said. [...] "We {{have long}} {{regarded}} you almost as our son, {{and we need}} have no fear that Aline will thwart our wishes and yours. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> your father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unworthy of her, my dear fellow!" [...] exclaimed Charley, {{grasping}} {{his hand}} and wringing it violently; [...] "no doubt you are, and so is everybody, but you shall have her for all that, my boy. But tell me, Harry, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Kate herself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Men are {{sometimes}} romantic without being geese," [...] returned Ian; [...] "but I have not {{time to discuss}} that point just now. Tell me, for I am anxious about it, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> your father about selling the field with the knoll to my father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exact it!" [...] exclaimed Mr Whittlestaff. [...] "There is no {{question}} of exacting!" [...] John Gordon shrugged his shoulders. [...] "I say there is {{no question}} of exacting. The words should not have been used. She has my full permission to choose as she may think fit, and she knows that she has it. What right <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me of exacting?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Those {{who help}} others {{deserve to be}} helped,' she answered; 'your eyes are still red because that miser Barbaik <b>has</b> {{forbidden}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> the young man from Plover. But cheer up, {{you are a good}} girl, and I will give you something that will enable you to see him once every day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am answered," [...] was the prompt acknowledgment. [...] "One {{thing in}} your country I have at least learnt to appreciate, and that is your love of candour. What is your errand with me to-day? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> come <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me as an {{ambassador}} from your cousin, or in any way on her behalf?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor dear,' {{continued}} Albinia, 'what {{a commotion}} {{there will be}} in her head; but she has behaved so well hitherto, that I hope we may steer her safely through, above all, {{if one of the}} six cousins will but catch him in the rebound! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Jo, mothers {{may differ}} in their management, but the hope is the same in all--the desire to see their {{children}} happy. Meg is so, and I am content with her success. You I leave to enjoy your liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you find {{that there is something}} sweeter. Amy is my chief care now, but her good sense will help her. For Beth, I indulge no hopes except that she may be well. By the way, she seems brighter this last day or two. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Here he {{fell over}} a little camel-colt that was {{sleeping}} in the Serai where the horse-traders {{and the best of}} the blackguards from Central Asia live; and, because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark, he could not rise again till I helped him. That was the beginning of my acquaintance with McIntosh Jellaludin. When a loafer, and drunk, sings The Song of the Bower, he must be worth cultivating. He got off the camel's back and said, rather thickly:--"I--I--I'm a bit screwed, but a dip in Loggerhead will put me right again; and I say, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Symonds about the mare's knees?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Clive," [...] {{she said}} softly, though {{her voice was}} shaken by a prescience, [...] "won't {{you tell me what}} <b>has</b> happened? Won't <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me--Antoinette?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't exactly know, Miss Hannay, but I <b>have</b> noticed <b>you</b> are {{the only}} lady who does not chat with him. I don't think I <b>have</b> seen <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him since we have come in here. I am sorry, because I like him very much, and I don't care for Forster at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't do that either. You {{sleep on}} it, {{and then make}} up your mind. You can't suppose that I have any curiosity about it. The girl is fond of you, and I suppose that you are fond of her. Don't quarrel for nothing. If I <b>have</b> {{offended}} <b>you,</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Lady Chiltern about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say is it dawn, is it dusk in thy Bower, Thou whom I long for, who longest for me? Oh, be it night--be it"--Here he {{fell over}} a little camel-colt that was {{sleeping}} in the Serai where the horse-traders {{and the best of}} the blackguards from Central Asia live; and, because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark, he could not rise again till I helped him. That was the beginning of my acquaintance with McIntosh Jellaludin, When a loafer, and drunk, sings [...] "The Song of the Bower," [...] he must be worth cultivating. He got off the camel's back and said, rather thickly, [...] "I--I--I'm a bit screwed, but a dip in Loggerhead will put me right again; and, I say, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Symonds about the mare's knees?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Lamb since then?"No, I never have. I {{have never}} bumped into him. I {{have to say}} I respect him as a footballer. I don’t know him as a person, but by all {{accounts}} {{he is a good}} guy. Let me be clear that I have no malice towards him, none at all, regardless of the incident being deliberate or accidental." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What 'I' say?" [...] Ida slowly rose, {{keeping her}} eyes on her child, and the hand that had busied itself in her purse {{conformed}} at her side and amid {{the folds of her}} dress to a certain stiffening of the arm. [...] "I say you're a precious idiot, and I won't <b>have</b> <b>you</b> put words into my mouth!" [...] This was much more peremptory than a mere contradiction. Maisie could only feel on the spot that everything had broken short off and that their communication had abruptly ceased. That was presently proved. [...] "What business <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> me of him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me tell my story, father, {{and then}} you shall judge. Before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> me at all, Marie had given me her troth.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say that you forgot my {{existence}} so completely till then? <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> me on board the yacht, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did hear}} {{something}} about some sum of money--that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Miss Baker about it, I believe; but I quite forget the particulars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From you, Mr. Arabin," [...] she continued, [...] "I {{would have}} listened to advice because I should have {{expected}} it to have been given as one friend may advise another--not as a schoolmaster gives an order to a pupil. I might have differed from you--on this matter I should have done so--but <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> me in your usual manner and with your usual freedom, I {{should not have been}} angry. But now--was it manly of <b>you,</b> Mr. Arabin, <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> of me in this way--so disrespectful--so--? I cannot bring myself to repeat what you said. You must understand what I feel. Was it just of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> of me in such a way and to advise my sister's husband to turn me out of my sister's house because I chose to know a man of whose doctrine you disapprove?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Marika, your Cornish friend may <b>have</b> taught <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> English," [...] said I, in my native tongue, {{turning to}} the woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{an insult}} to our house," [...] she murmured. [...] "I am glad that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> me of this, Nicholas. It is unbearable!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what matters}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> anent, then?" [...] said his master, whom {{circumstances}} had inured to tolerate {{a good deal}} of freedom from his attendant.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not that, Miles," [...] {{my sister}} answered; [...] "every honest calling is respectable. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> and Rupert <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Hardinge on this subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} {{a shame that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>spoken</b> <b>to</b> your wife for fifteen years. How do you explain it? How do you justify it?" ...|$|R
