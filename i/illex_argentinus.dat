The material studied comes from commercial fishing done in in two sectors: one ranging from 36 ~' to 37 ~' S, and the other from 39 ~' to 42 ~' S in latitude, while both extend from 55 ~' to 62 ~' W in longitude. The fishing area varies during the years, being located more towards the North in summer and more towards the South in winter, following the fishing of hake. The number of individuals studied was 186. Their total length ranged from 195 mm to 670 mm for both sexes. The sampling showed that the males had lesser length and weight than the females: that is, a secondary sexual dimorphism was observed. At the length of 240 mm the squid reaches its sexual maturity. Sexual activity is observed the year around, but not simultaneously for the whole population, that is to say, spawning does not take place en masse but, on the contrary, it occurs during a prolonged period. In summer, from December to March, the greatest spawning period is observed. This {{takes place in the}} same habitat for the whole squid population.

Spatially referenced fishery data and satellite-derived advanced very high resolu-tion radiometry (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data were examined using geographic informa-tion system (GIS) techniques. The distribution and relative abundance of I. argentinus in the Falkland Islands fishery was examined for the period 1989 – 96. Three consistent areas of high abundance were observed to the north-east (shelf-break region) and north-west (shelf region) of the islands, and close to the northern coast of East Falkland. Areas of high sea surface temperature gradients (thermal gradients) extracted from remotely sensed satellite images were used as an indicator of mesoscale oceanographic activity and compared with the location of the fishery. I. argentinus were found to be associated with areas of thermal gradients, commonly seen at the interface of Falkland Current and Patagonian shelf waters.

A great diversity of microorganisms was identified on the mucus cover, on the proboscis suckers and in the digestive tracts of the rhynchoteuthions, including dinoflagellates, flagellates, ciliates, cysts and bacteria. Among the digestive tracts of <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> rhynchoteuthions examined, 55. 6 % were empty, 9. 7 % contained unrecognizable food and 34. 7 % contained recognizable food, which included microorganisms on mucus as well as copepod appendages.

40|$|Traditionally, it {{was assumed}} that major {{spawning}} activity of <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> occurs in discrete pulses along the outer-shelf/slope off Argentina/southern Brazil during late-fall/winter and that early life stages develop near the Brazil–Malvinas Confluence (BMC).

Here, we analyzed the spatial distribution of <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> inside San Matias Gulf based on the position of the CPUE of jiggers in order to improve the knowledge of the population structuring in coastal regions. Squids were mainly concentrated on the northern region of the gulf where favorable oceanographic conditions (e. g. water stratification, chlorophyll-a concentration peaks) to feeding and spawning are present. These results provided empirical evidences that individuals of I. argentinus use Argentinean coastal waters, particularly San Matias Gulf, as permanent feeding and spawning grounds which supports the new hypothesis.

40|$|Abstract only. The Patagonian marine {{ecosystem}} {{is one of}} the most productive ecosystems in the world, with important commercial shared/straddling stocks. One of the highest mobility resources is the Argentine shortfin squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus).</b> Its distribution is limited to the area of influence of the warm-cold waters of sub-Antarctic origin, particularly of the Falkland Current; and it plays an important ecological role in the region. This resource is exploited by different foreign fleets that operate both within the Argentine exclusive economic zone and within the adjacent area beyond the 200 -mile limit, as well as in Falklands (Malvinas) waters. Hence, the countries face what is known as stock externality in which one nations catch impacts negatively on another ones. Nevertheless, little research has been done on both legal and economic aspects of this fishery. By pursuing this line of inquiry in this paper, we use the predictive power of game theory to explore the economic benefits of cooperative or non-cooperative fisheries management of <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> between Argentina and the United Kingdom. The model used is a discrete-time one of finite horizon with the fishery steady state static model of harvesting. The preliminary empirical results suggest that there is a correspondence between what the fishery has experimented over the last few years, with a non-cooperative scenario. This paper also demonstrates that in the cooperative scenario both players would obtain better economic benefits, because each would reduce the fishing effort and hence the abundance of the stock would remain below the reference points recommended by scientists...|$|E

The peptide maps of PSC digested by pepsin were distinct from those of carp skin collagen. Denaturation temperatures, measured by melting point using circular dichroism, was 26. 5 ˚C.

40|$|Commercial {{exploitation}} of the Argentine shortfin squid (<b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus)</b> was virtually non-existent in Brazilian waters until 2000 when foreign trawlers initiated their operations on slope grounds {{as part of a}} government-induced chartering program. Since then, the species has been included among the targets of a developing slope trawl fishing off southeastern and southern Brazil. Biological samples were collected from commercial catches of 25 national and seven foreign (chartered) trawlers between 23 °- 33 °S and 170 - 740 m depth. These samples represent two periods of the commercial {{exploitation of}} <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> in Brazil: 2001 - 2003, when both chartered and national trawlers operated simultaneously, and 2006 - 2007, when only national vessels continued to exploit I. argentinus along with other slope stocks. Catches contained immature and ma-turing squid throughout the year, as well as at least two distinct, fully mature, spawning groups: one composed of small-sized males and females present year-round on the shelf-break/ upper slope (< 400 m), and the other consisting of large squid present only in austral winter-spring in southern (26 °- 29 °S) and deep fishing grounds (400 - 700 m). The latter group has sustained the large winter catches reported since 2000 and the large sizes and concentrations of the specimens sparked the interest of the fishing industry as a potential target of the slope fishery. The reproductive attributes and temporal/ spatial distribution patterns of winter spawners support the hypothesis that relates this group to migrating concentrations of a north Patagonian shelf stock.

The most important prey species were bottom fish: hagfish (Myxine australis), southern cod (Salilota australis) and Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus), followed by the red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus) and Patagonian squid (L. gahi). The remaining species, among others Sprattus fuegensis and <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus,</b> were marginal or perhaps items ingested by the other actual prey species. The feeding ecology of Peale's dolphin off northeastern Tierra del Fuego seems to be associated with demersal and bottom species captured in or near kelp beds...|$|E
40|$|Trophic {{relations}} of cephalopods in southern Brazil were investigated from predation on cephalopods by 71 species of potential predators, including two squids, 47 fishes, seven seabirds and 15 marine mammals from shelf, upper slope and oceanic adjacent waters. In all, 27 families and 41 species of cephalopods were identified from stomach contents. The {{number of families}} ranged from six, in the diet of shelf predators, to 27 families in those from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. The most frequent cephalopod prey on the shelf was Loligo sanpaulensis, particularly important in the diet of Franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei, occurring also in the diet of the penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, the fur seals Arctocephalus australis, A. gazella, A. tropicalis, and several benthic and demersal fishes. Ommastrephidae, mainly <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> and Ornithoteuthis antillarum, was the most frequent family in the diet of predators from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters. <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> was an important prey for the wreckfish Polyprion americanus, the bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus, the swordfish Xiphias gladius and some marine mammals, especially in their winter and spring northward reproductive migration. Ornithoteuthis antillarum was frequent in the diet of the skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, the albacore Thunnus alalunga, the yellowfin tuna T. albacares, the Atlantic sailfish Istiophorus albicans and the white marlin Tetrapturus albidus. Ammoniacal squids, such as Ancistrocheirus lesueurii, Histioteuthis spp, Chiroteuthis veranii and Octopoteuthis sp, were mainly found in stomach contents of the blue shark, Prionace glauca, the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps, the dwarf sperm whale K. sima, the long-finned pilot whale, Globicephala melas and oceanic seabirds. The relative importance, based on frequency of occurrence, of cephalopods as food resources seems to be higher in the food chains of the upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters, {{when compared to the}} continental shelf...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we report the {{presence}} of paralarvae and juveniles oflllex argentinus {{in the waters of}} Nuevo Gulf (42 ° 45 'S- 64 ° 45 'W, Argentina) during three consecutive years (2004 - 2007). Paralarvae were caught using a Hensen net of 295 µm mesh size. Juveniles were found stranded on the coast in September 2007. These findings show that the species uses near-shore waters for breeding. En este estudio reportamos la presencia de paralarvas y juveniles de <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> en aguas del Golfo Nuevo (42 ° 45 'S- 64 ° 45 'W, Argentina) durante tres años consecutivos (2004 - 2007). Las paralarvas fueron capturadas usando una red Hensen de 295 µm de malla. Los juveniles se hallaron varados en la costa en septiembre de 2007. Estos registros son evidencia de que esta especie utiliza aguas costeras para la cría...|$|E
40|$|Cd {{levels in}} ommastrephid squids from Brazil {{are the highest}} ever {{reported}} for cephalopods. Regarding Brazilian coast, industrial and urban developments are concentrated along Central South Brazil Bight. Samples from inshore and offshore species from the concerned area were analyzed, comprising 24 cetaceans (9 species) and 32 squids (2 species). Cadmium was deter-mined by GFAAS and our results were in agreement with certified values (DOLT- 2, NRCC). Mean cadmium concentration (in mg/g, wet weight) observed in the digestive gland of sexually mature Argentine short-finned squids (<b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus)</b> was 1002. 9. To our knowledge this is the highest cadmium level ever reported for a cephalopod. Concerning cetaceans, our results include {{one of the highest}} renal cadmium concentra-tions described for striped dolphins (71. 29 mg/g, wet weight). Anthropogenic action, upwelling and cannibalism of Argentine short-finned squid on the studied area are possible reasons for such remarkable cadmium concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The Argentine {{short-finned squid}} <b>Illex</b> <b>argentinus</b> {{is the main}} {{cephalopod}} species which occurs in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. It is the most highly fished species in terms of catches and is the major target of large-scale directed fishing carried out by “jiggers”, {{and to a lesser}} extent, by trawlers. The variability of main current systems in the region (Brazil and Falkland/Malvinas Currents) has been suggested to influence the abundance and distribution of I. argentinus, thus largely affecting profitability and sustainability of the fisheries. In this working document we analyse the environmental, geographical, temporal and physical factors affecting the distribution (abundance) of I. argentinus in two areas of highest distribution, using geographic information systems tools. Strong correlation was found between Illex abundance and the season of the year, as well as with latitude, confirming our knowledge of the fishery and the literature on this specie...|$|E
