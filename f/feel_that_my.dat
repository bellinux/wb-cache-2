500|$|On 29 May, al-Tamimi {{was sentenced}} to time served of {{thirteen}} months' imprisonment, and an additional two suspended sentences. A military spokeswoman stated that the sentence had been suspended due to [...] "irregularities in the trial" [...] and al-Tamimi's [...] "clean prison record". Under the terms of al-Tamimi's suspended sentences, he would be imprisoned for two months if he participated in an illegal demonstration within {{two years of the}} sentencing, and imprisoned for seven months if he participated in [...] "activity against the security forces" [...] within five years. Responding to the suspended sentences, al-Tamimi said, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> whole life is under the surveillance of the judge." ...|$|E
500|$|Elgar {{was another}} {{composer}} who had cause {{to be grateful}} to Boult. His Second Symphony had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the Queen's Hall in March 1920 to [...] "great applause" [...] and [...] "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: [...] "With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym.... I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> reputation {{in the future is}} safe in your hands." [...] Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist W. H. Reed, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought [...] "the grandeur and nobility of the work" [...] to wider public attention.|$|E
500|$|Kajol {{describes}} herself as being [...] "extremely mischievous" [...] as a child. She added {{that she was very}} stubborn and impulsive from a very young age. Her parents separated when she was young; but according to Tanuja, Kajol was not affected by the split as [...] "we never argued in front of [...] ". In the absence of her mother, Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who [...] "never let me <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> mother was away and working". According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her at a very young age. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her [...] "Maharashtrian pragmatism" [...] from her mother and her [...] "Bengali temperament" [...] from her father.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E

2500|$|The Four Lads (Bernie Toorish, Jimmy Arnold, Frank Busseri and Connie Codarini) {{had begun}} as a Canadian-based gospel group, who first gained fame as the backup singer on Johnnie Ray's early chart-busters ("Cry", [...] "The Little White Cloud that Cried"), but {{garnered}} a following {{of their own}} with songs such as [...] "The Mocking Bird", and [...] "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)". The album produced one hit, [...] "Rain! Rain! Rain!", along with tracks such as [...] "Remember Me", [...] "I <b>Feel</b> <b>That</b> <b>My</b> Time Ain't Long", and [...] "Didn't He Moan". The last four tracks were recorded during a later session.|$|E
2500|$|Melville House and the Homestead, {{visited by}} {{over a million}} people from {{numerous}} countries around the world, {{has been described as}} [...] "...this shrine, where lingers the spirit of the great inventor". At a farewell dinner at Brantford's Kerby House as Melville was preparing to depart for Washington, D.C., the elder Bell addressed the invited banquet guests, saying [...] " [...] could not come to us, so we resolved to go to him.

2500|$|As {{a present}} for his 16th {{birthday}} Weston's father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Bull's-Eye #2, which was a simple box camera. He took it on vacation in the Midwest, {{and by the time}} he returned home his interest in photography was enough to lead him to purchase a used 5 × 7inch view camera. He began photographing in Chicago parks and a farm owned by his aunt, and developed his own film and prints. Later he would remember that even at that early age his work showed strong artistic merit. He said, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> earliest work of 1903 ‒ though immature ‒ is related more closely, both with technique and composition, to my latest work than are several of my photographs dating from 1913–1920, a period in which I was trying to be artistic." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{week after}} the engagement, the {{proposed}} Anglo-Russo alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to Scotland, {{so that she could}} meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in Cologne, instead. The Queen called it [...] "simply impertinent" [...] that [...] "I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be ready to run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess." [...] Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar’s offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria Alexandrovna looked forward happily to her marriage: [...] "How happy I am to belong to him. I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> love for him is growing daily. I have a feeling of peace and inexpressible happiness and a boundless impatience to be altogether his own." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, Clementi {{complained to}} a {{resident}} assistant {{and two other}} officials that Ravi had used a webcam to videostream part of Clementi's private sexual encounter with another man. The resident assistant testified at trial that Clementi appeared shaky and uncomfortable when they met around 11 p.m., and in his official report of the meeting, the resident assistant said that Clementi requested both a room change and punishment for Ravi. In a formal e-mail request to the resident assistant made after the meeting, Clementi described the two viewing incidents, quoted from Ravi's Twitter postings, and wrote [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> privacy has been violated and I am extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with someone who would act in this wildly inappropriate manner." [...] Clementi wrote in detail on the Just Us Boys and Yahoo! message boards about complaints he filed through university channels about his roommate. His posts indicated {{that he did not}} want to share a room with Ravi after he learned about the first incident and then discovered that Ravi invited his Twitter followers to watch a second sexual encounter. [...] "He [...] seemed to take it seriously," [...] Clementi wrote in a post about 15 hours before his jump from the George Washington Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|She had {{understood}} {{that she had}} to pray and give her life for sinners like Pranzini. But Carmel prayed especially for priests and this had surprised her since their souls seemed to her to be [...] "as pure as crystal". A month spent with many priests taught her that they are [...] "weak and feeble men". [...] She wrote later: [...] "I met many saintly priests that month, but I also found that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, 'the salt of the earth', as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, 'If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?' I understood my vocation in Italy." [...] For the first time too she had associated with young men. [...] "In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Guérin and various priests. Now she had her first and only experiences. Céline declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group [...] "developed a tender affection for her". Thérèse confessed to her sister, [...] "It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world...I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others." [...] Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse. On 9 April 1888 she became a Carmelite postulant.|$|E
