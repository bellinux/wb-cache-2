6000|$|Of course I [...] "confounded myself" [...] in asseverations to the contrary; and Madame, {{running into}} the little salon, brought thence a pretty basket, filled with fine <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit,</b> rosy, perfect, and tempting, reposing amongst the dark green, wax-like leaves, and pale yellow stars of, I know not what, exotic plant.|$|E
60|$|The {{latter part}} of his {{resolution}} Ned found {{it very hard to}} maintain, for Mr. Mulready became a not unfrequent visitor. He had always some excuse for calling, either to bring in a basket of fresh trout, some game, or <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit,</b> for, as he said, he knew her appetite was delicate and needed tempting, or some book newly issued from the London press which he was sure she would appreciate.|$|E
6000|$|... "You and I {{both know}} {{the value of}} these things," [...] he went on, with a little sweep of the hand. [...] "We know the value of them because we were once {{accustomed}} to them, because we have both since experienced the passionate craving for them or the things they represent. Chippendale furniture, a Turkey carpet, roses in January, <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit,</b> Bartolozzi prints, do not march with an income of fifty pounds a year." ...|$|E
6000|$|And how {{was this}} to be done? Lovers with all the glories and all the graces are {{supposed}} to be plentiful as blackberries by girls of nineteen, but have been proved to be rare <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruits</b> by girls of twenty-nine. Brehgert was rich, would live in London, and would be a husband. People did such odd things now and 'lived them down,' that she could see no reason why she should not do this and live this down. Courage was the one thing necessary,--that and perseverance. She must teach herself to talk about Brehgert as Lady Monogram did of Sir Damask. She had plucked up so much courage as had enabled her to declare her fate to her old friend,--remembering as she did so how in days long past she and her friend Julia Triplex had scattered their scorn upon some poor girl who had married a man with a Jewish name,-- whose grandfather had possibly been a Jew. 'Dear me,' said Lady Monogram. 'Todd, Brehgert, and Goldsheiner! Mr Todd is--one of us, I suppose.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1858, Mason {{invented a}} square-shouldered jar with {{threaded}} screw-top, matching lid, and rubber ring for an airtight seal - the Mason jar. Until the 1830s, long before refrigeration and <b>hothouse</b> gardens, many <b>fruits</b> and vegetables had been available only seasonally, {{but the recent}} development of jars had made canning a practical alternative to drying, pickling, or smoking to preserve food.|$|R
6000|$|Signing {{him to be}} seated, Challoner rang a bell, {{and wine}} and cigars and <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit</b> were brought in. These he offered his guest, who helped himself freely and then said, [...] "Your nephew spent {{a week in the}} {{settlement}} where I live, preparing for a journey to the North. Though his object was secret, I believe he went in search of something to make varnish of, because he took a young American traveller for a colour factory with him, besides another man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the day," [...] he assented. [...] "I {{remember}} so well {{getting out}} of the train and walking up that long, miserable street. School wasn't over, and I went straight to her cottage, as I have often done before. There was a change. Her cheap furniture had gone. It was like one of those little rooms we had dreamed of. There was a soft carpet upon the floor, Chippendale furniture, flowers, <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit,</b> and on the mantelpiece--the photograph of a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Warmish, buddy," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "But a regular Paradise Lost for elegance of scenery and be-yooty of geography. Ye're wakened every morning by the sweet singin' of red birds with seven purple tails, and the sighin' of breezes in the posies and roses. And the {{inhabitants}} never work, for {{they can reach}} out and pick steamer baskets of the choicest <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit</b> without gettin' out of bed. And there's no Sunday and no ice and no rent and no troubles and no use and no nothin'. It's a great country {{for a man to}} go to sleep with, and wait for somethin' to turn up. The bananys and oranges and hurricanes and pineapples that ye eat comes from there." ...|$|E
60|$|Phineas Duge, {{notwithstanding}} {{an absence}} of anything approaching vulgarity in his somewhat complex disposition, was, {{for a man of}} affairs and an American, singularly fond of the small elegances of life. Although he sat alone at dinner, the table was heaped with choice flowers and carefully selected <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit.</b> His one glass of wine, the best of its sort, he sipped meditatively, and with the air of a connoisseur. The soft lights upon the table were such as a woman, mindful of her complexion, might have chosen. Behind his chair stood his English butler, grave, solemn-faced, attentive. The cigars and matches were already on his left-hand side, ready for the moment when he should have finished his wine. Outside a footman was waiting for a signal to bring in the after-dinner coffee.|$|E
60|$|To the {{ordinary}} observer {{there would have}} been nothing remarkable in the appearance of the little room, save its entirely unexpected air of luxury and refinement. There was a small Chippendale sideboard against the wall, a round, gate-legged table on which stood a blue china bowl filled with pink roses, a couple of luxurious easy-chairs, some old prints upon the wall. On the sideboard was a basket, as yet unpacked, filled with <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit,</b> and on a low settee by the side of one of the easy-chairs were a little pile of reviews, several volumes of poetry, and a couple of library books. In the centre of the mantelpiece was a photograph, the photograph of a man a little older, perhaps, than this newly-arrived visitor, with rounder face, dressed in country tweeds, a flower in his buttonhole, the picture of a prosperous man, yet with a curious, almost disturbing likeness to the pale, over-nervous, loose-framed youth whose eye had been attracted by its presence, and who was gazing at it, spellbound.|$|E
60|$|They {{were both}} seated on low folding-chairs {{out on the}} open moorland, {{only a few yards}} away {{from the edge of the}} rugged line of cliffs against which, many {{hundreds}} of feet below, the sea was breaking with a low monotonous murmur. Close behind them, on a level stretch of springy turf, a roughly improvised table, covered with a cloth of dazzling whiteness, was laden with deep bowls of lobster salad, p√¢tes de foie gras, chickens, truffled turkeys, piles of <b>hothouse</b> <b>fruit,</b> and many other delicacies peculiarly appreciated at al fresco symposia; and, a little further away still, under the shade of a huge yellow gorse bush, were several ice-pails, in which were reposing many rows of gold-foiled bottles. The warm sun was just sufficiently tempered by a mild heather-scented breeze, and though it flashed gayly upon the glass and silver, and danced across the bosom of the blue water below, its heat was more pleasant than oppressive. The two women who sat there looked delightfully cool. Helen Thurwell especially, in her white holland gown, with a great bunch of heather stuck in her belt, and a faint healthy glow in her cheeks, looked as only an English country girl of good birth can look--the very personification of dainty freshness.|$|E
