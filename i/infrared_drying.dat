40|$|The {{conventional}} processing of sweet potatoes produces {{a very strong}} caustic waste that is high in organic matter. Present technology does not emphasize recirculation or other control of water use. Improved technology is available such as high presure lowvolume water sprays and a dry caustic peeling process that reduces water use and converts the liquid caustic waste to a semi-solid waste that can be disposed of in sanitary landfills, or sold as cattle feed.

Mango cylinders were blanched under similar temperature-time conditions either by IR heating or by immersion in a water bath during 2 min at 90 degrees C (high-temperature-short-timeHTST) or for 10 min at 65 degrees C (low-temperature-long-timeLTLT). After blanching mango was hot air dried at 70 degrees C. PPO was completely inactivated during the blanching treatments, but AAO had a moderate remaining activity after LTLT treatment (approximate to 30 %) and a low remaining activity after HTST treatment (9 % to 15 %). A higher retention of vitamin C was observed in mango subjected to IR dry blanching, 88. 31. 0 % (HTST) and 69. 2 +/- 2. 9 % (LTLT), compared with water blanching, 61. 4 +/- 5. 3 % (HTST) and 50. 7 +/- 9. 6 % (LTLT). All-trans [...] carotene retention was significantly higher in water blanched dried mango, 93. 2 +/- 5. 2 % (LTLT) and 91. 4 +/- 5. 1 % (HTST), compared with IR dry blanched, 73. 6 +/- 3. 6 % (LTLT) and 76. 9 +/- 2. 9 % (HTST). Increased levels of 13 -cis [...] carotene isomer were detected only in IR dry blanched mango, and the corresponding dried mango also had a slightly darker color. IR blanching of mango prior to drying can improve the retention of vitamin C, but not the retention of carotenoids, which showed to be more dependent on the temperature than the blanching process. A reduction of drying time was observed in LTLT IR-blanching mango. Practical Application Blanching is widely used in fruit and vegetable processing industry.

This product possesses a wide range of vitamins and minerals, being an important component of the alimentation worldwide.

In some cases the conventional (convective, contact or <b>infrared)</b> <b>drying</b> processes can damage the quality of food due to crusting phenomena, overheating or protein denaturation. Better results can be obtained using combined microwave–convective dehydration. The paper mainly focuses on the investigation of drying Saccharomyces cerevisiaepulp using the method of dielectric dehydration.

40|$|A multi-wall carbon {{nanotube}} (MWCNT) /ZnO nanoparticle composite is fabricated by the thermal decomposition of {{a mixture of}} Zn(NH 3) 4 CO 3, MWCNTs and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). From the <b>infrared</b> spectra of <b>dried</b> samples of Zn(NH 3) 4 CO 3, PVP, and the mixture of Zn(NH 3) 4 CO 3 and PVP, we {{show that there is}} a coordination interaction between the Zn of Zn(NH 3) 4 CO 3 and the carbonyl of PVP. Thermal decomposition of the mixture of Zn(NH 3) 4 CO 3 and PVP with MWCNTs results in the decomposition of Zn(NH 3) 4 CO 3 to ZnO nanoparticles which are well-dispersed on the outer walls of the MWCNTs. The results show that PVP can be used to control the ZnO nanoparticle size and its dispersion on the MWCNTs walls during decomposition. This method is favorable for large scale synthesis. © 2007 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Building {{cost-effective}} {{models is}} {{of academic and}} practical value for fast measurement of soil properties, especially at a farm-scale. The {{aim of this study}} is to build quantitative models for soil total nitrogen (TN) and total carbon (TC) using visible and near <b>infrared</b> (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy. <b>Dried</b> samples (n= 122) collected from an experimental farm, at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, were scanned from 350 to 2500 nm at 1 -nm intervals. Samples were divided into a calibration set (75 %) and an independent validation set (25 %). A partial least squares regression (PLSR) with leave-one-out cross validation was carried out based on different spectral ranges. Result shows that the best predictions (R 2 > 0. 90 and RPD> 3. 3) are achieved for TN using the VIS range (400 - 700 nm) and for TC using the VIS-NIR range (400 - 2500 nm). It is concluded that VIS-NIR spectroscopy coupled with PLSR can be adopted for the prediction of soil TN and TC at a farm-scale...|$|R
40|$|Glutamic acid [(L-glu) n] + dihydrogen {{phosphate}} {{systems are}} studied by <b>infrared</b> (IR) spectroscopy <b>dried</b> and hydrated at 75 % relative humidity, {{as a function}} of both the phosphate-glutamic acid residue (Pi/glu) ratio and the type of cations present. It is shown that the glutamic acid groups form hydrogen-bonded chains with the phosphates. In these chains the positive charge fluctuates, and they show very large proton polarizability which increases in the series Li+,Na+,K+ systems. These chains are cross-linked via phosphate-phosphate hydrogen bonds, in which the proton is almost localized at one Pi. The comparison of the (L-glu) n + dihydrogen phosphate systems with the results obtained earlier in the case of (L-glu) n + hydrogen phosphate systems shows that the behavior of (L-glu) n + Pi systems strongly depends on the pH. Only with decreasing pH the conducting chains are formed. Finally, a hypothesis is discussed with regard to the charge conduction in the F 0 subunit of the H+-ATPase in mitochondria...|$|R
