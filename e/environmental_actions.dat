5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful <b>environmental</b> <b>actions.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{dealing with}} the environment, Bush reauthorized the Clean Air Act. The {{legislation}} sought to curb acid rain and smog by requiring decreased emissions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide. The measure {{was the first major}} update to the Clean Air Act since 1977, and {{was the result of a}} compromise between Congress and Bush. Bush also signed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 in response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill. However, the League of Conservation Voters criticized some of Bush's other <b>environmental</b> <b>actions,</b> including his opposition to stricter auto-mileage standards.|$|E

40|$|Theorizing about <b>environmental</b> or {{collective}} <b>action</b> {{relies on}} individualistic or collectivistic assumptions, respectively. Thus, a unified explanation for lowering one's thermostat (a form of <b>environmental</b> <b>action)</b> {{and participating in}} mass protest (a form of collective action) is lacking. Building on a broad literature that views humans as relational beings, I aim to show that (a) a relational perspective synthesizes these two perspectives by reconceptualizing <b>environmental</b> and collective <b>action</b> as types of social interaction that regulate social relationships and (b) therefore, <b>environmental</b> and collective <b>action</b> have a similar motivational profile. This implies that both collective and <b>environmental</b> <b>action</b> are ultimately relational phenomena; that any assumption that <b>environmental</b> <b>action</b> is motivated by individualistic concerns and collective action by collectivistic concerns, limits our understanding of either type of action; and that future theorizing and research on <b>environmental</b> and collective <b>action</b> will benefit from adopting a relational perspective...|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{attitudes are}} not always a clear {{prediction}} of behavior, resulting in the ‘value-action gap’. The decision-making process is hard to predict as positive attitudes are not followed by positive intentions, and what shapes behavior is a complex process. Even if values are high, few people take <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> which involve changes to their lifestyle and often <b>environmental</b> <b>actions</b> can be unrelated to particular concerns an individual may have. The result is that attitudes are not necessarily a clear determinant of behavior.|$|E

40|$|When youth create {{positive}} {{environmental change}} in their communities they typically act with adult guidance. The role of adults, however, is largely absent in literature around youth participation in <b>environmental</b> <b>action.</b> This research explored through phenomenological interviews with 33 practitioners (e. g., teachers, extension educators, community organizers) facilitating youth <b>environmental</b> <b>action</b> in formal and non-formal educational settings across the U. S. : (a) ways practitioners involved youth in <b>environmental</b> <b>action,</b> (b) purposes and goals motivating practitioners to engage youth in <b>environmental</b> <b>action,</b> and (c) methods practitioners used to facilitate youth <b>environmental</b> <b>action.</b> The study sought insight into successful and challenging experiences. It also inquired {{about the meaning of}} these experiences for participating youth through group interviews with 46 youth in 9 programs. Practice accounts included multiple forms of action among five types: physical improvements, community education, inquiry, advocacy, and contributions to community development. Practitioners described purposes integrating multiple individual, environmental, and community development goals. Most placed higher value in developing youth as citizens and change agents than in promoting environmental improvements. Evident in practitioners' narratives was a tension between encouraging youth autonomy while maintaining authority. Practitioners experienced and managed this 'autonomy-authority duality' differently but all described characteristics of youth-adult partnerships. Nine practice themes emerged: creating safe spaces; providing structure; building relationships; bridging differences; setting rigorous expectations; providing opportunities for meaningful contribution; supporting youth; expanding horizons; and connecting youth with community. Youth reported learning in physical (e. g., fitness), intellectual (e. g., technological skills), psychological (e. g., initiative), and social (e. g., teamwork) domains. Parallel themes with youth development literature suggest <b>environmental</b> <b>action</b> is a valuable context for positive youth development. The interplay of science education and community action evident in practitioner and youth interviews suggests the merit of a theoretical framework where <b>environmental</b> <b>action</b> occurs at the intersection of inquiry-based science education and youth civic engagement. Participation in <b>environmental</b> <b>action</b> enhanced some youths' capabilities in 'practical inquiry' and influenced some youths' perceptions of themselves from passive to active citizens. <b>Environmental</b> <b>action</b> concurrently involves youth in civic and scientific processes through which they can develop the critical dispositions and skills characteristic of both endeavors.
