First it was a jackal howling amongst the rocks; next a sand-fly bit him in the ankle so sharply that he thought he must have been stung by a scorpion. Then, notwithstanding his warm coat, the cold got hold of him, for the clothes beneath were wet through with perspiration, and it occurred to him that unless he did something he would probably contract an <b>internal</b> <b>chill</b> or perhaps fever.

They raise {{the temperature of}} the phase transformations in aluminium bronzes as well as the casts’ abrasive and adhesive wear resistance. The paper presents a selection of feeding elements and thermal treatment times which guarantees structure stability, for a cast of a massive bush working at an elevated temperature (650 - 750 °C) made by means of the lost foam technology out of composite aluminium bronze. So far, there have been no analyses of the phenomena characteristic to the examined bronze which accompany the process of its solidification during gasification of the EPS pattern. There are also no guidelines for designing risers and steel <b>internal</b> <b>chill</b> for casts made of this bronze. The work identifies the type and location of the existing defects in the mould’s cast. It also proposes a solution to the manner of its feeding and cooling which compensates the significant volume contraction of bronze and effectively removes the formed gases from the area of mould solidification. Another important aspect of the performed research was establishing the duration time of bronze annealing at the temperature of 750 °C which guarantees stabilization of the changes in the bronze microstructure - stabilization of the changes in the bronze HB hardness...|$|E

50|$|Riser {{aids are}} items used to assist risers in {{creating}} directional solidification or {{reducing the number}} of risers required. One of these items are chills which accelerate cooling in a certain part of the mold. There are two types: external and <b>internal</b> <b>chills.</b> External chills are masses of high-heat-capacity and high-thermal-conductivity material that are placed on an edge of the molding cavity. <b>Internal</b> <b>chills</b> are pieces of the same metal that is being poured, which are placed inside the mold cavity and become part of the casting. Insulating sleeves and toppings may also be installed around the riser cavity to slow the solidification of the riser. Heater coils may also be installed around or above the riser cavity to slow solidification.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Detailed {{sampling}} of the Little Minch Sill Complex reveals that it is composed of both single and multiple sills. These are formed of three main, genetically related units: picrite, picrodolerite and crinanite, which {{are the result of}} differentiation of an alkali-olivine basalt magma (approximately 10 % MgO) in an upper-crustal magma chamber. Variations in igneous stratigraphy and the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>chills</b> in the Trotternish sills suggest that they were emplaced by multiple intrusion and subsequently differentiated in situ. Changes in petrography adjacent to pegmatite veins and textures within picrite units indicate compaction and filter-pressing were important processes after emplacement. Rhythmic layering (1 cm to 1 m thick) is conspicuous in the sills near contacts but does not involve cryptic mineral variation. Such modal layering may be more common than realised in relatively small-scale intrusions and may be modelled in terms of in situ differentiation under conditions of significant undercooling in a changing thermal gradient at the synthetic for-sterite-diopside-anorthite eutectic...|$|R
40|$|Although {{absorption}} cooling {{has been}} available for many years, the technology has typically been viewed as a poorly performing alternative to vapour compression refrigeration. Rising energy prices and the requirement to improve energy efficiency is however driving renewed interest in the technology, particularly {{within the context of}} combined cooling, heat and power systems (CCHP) for buildings. In order to understand the performance of absorption cooling, numerous models are available in the literature. However, the complexities involved in the thermodynamics of absorption chillers have so far restricted researchers to creating steady state or dynamic models reliant on data measurements of the <b>internal</b> <b>chiller</b> state, which require difficult-to-obtain, intrusive measurements. The pragmatic, yet fully-dynamic model described in this paper is designed to be easily calibrated using data obtained from the measurements of inflows and outflows to a chiller, without resorting to intrusive measurements. The model comprises a series of linked control volumes featuring both performance maps and lumped mass volumes, which reflect the underlying physical structure of the device. The model was developed for the ESP-r building simulation tool. This paper describes the modelling approach, theory and limitations, along with its calibration and the application of the model to a specific example...|$|R

O filme de PVC reduziu a perda de matéria fresca e manteve o teor de água das raízes, durante o armazenamento por 60 dias a 5 e 10 ºC. Os danos causados por frio foram inibidos nas raízes embaladas em filme de PCV, em ambas as temperaturas de armazenamento. As baixas temperaturas induziram o acúmulo de açúcares solúveis e a degradação de amido e, para as raízes armazenadas sem PVC, o aumento do conteúdo dos açúcares solúveis foi transiente e a taxa de degradação de amido foi {{superior}} à das raízes armazenadas com PVC.

40|$|Some {{hundred years}} ago, wise men decided that preharvest {{research}} and applications {{had to be}} regarded separated from the postharvest handling and behaviour. Over the years, both areas developed completely separated. Control over both areas was obtained by different companies and advisory boards, with mostly not too good means of communication between them. This decision hampered seriously the consistent and integral development of knowledge on food production and usage. Bridging the gap between all the knowledge and expertise available in the preharvest area of growing food and the postharvest area of storing and processing food, has become and is still {{becoming more and more}} important {{over the last couple of}} years. In this paper, based on theoretical considerations, on plausible (but unproven) mechanisms and applying the fundamental rules of chemical kinetics, a pathway to deduce general and generic models is developed towards a possible approach to integrate all available knowledge. Still the validity of this approach is not proven. However, a number of examples from both the applied as well as the fundamental point of view are elaborated to indicate such an interaction exists, and to indicate how to tackle the modelling problem. The examples range from physiological disorders like core brown, <b>internal</b> brown, <b>chilling</b> injury and the biological age of individual tomatoes in truss tomatoes as related to the maturity at harves...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{optimisation}} possibilities of single-effect water LiBr absorption chillers for the chilled water supply by combined heat, cold, and power supply are examined. Within the examinations both technical and economic interests {{are taken into}} account. A summary of the different thermal refrigeration processes and their fields of application is given. As main emphasis in this work, however, the single-effect absorption chiller with the working pair water-LiBr is chosen. Corresponding to the available techniques and the wide area of application this process is used most frequently till now {{in the area of}} chilled water production. For the single-effect water LiBr absorption chiller process a physical model to describe steady-state process-behaviour is developed. Furthermore, the possibilities to develop optimised system components as well as the influence of operation and design parameters are examined. The influence of chilled water, re-cooling water, hot water temperature and mass flow of <b>internal</b> solution to <b>chiller</b> capacity and COP are examined by use of this model. Concerning the generator design three different concepts to guarantee of a possible high level capacity for low driving heat temperatures are considered, a flooded ripped-tube-evaporator (standard solution), a concept with plate heat exchanger and separated steam drum and a concept with a horizontal spray film evaporator. An optimisation of the process design for different operation conditions is included. Due to the dynamically unfavourable operating behaviour of single-effect water LiBr absorption chiller a dynamic model of the absorption process is developed and the dynamic operation characteristics are studied. Additional to this analysis new control concepts are discussed and new solutions to guarantee a better operational behaviour are suggested. Furthermore, the influence of initial concentration and initial hold-up of the different main components to the performance characteristics of the chiller are studied. Finally, the analysis of results are compared to the behaviour of a single stage absorption chiller unit of the chiller plant of the University of Dortmund...|$|R
40|$|The Slieve Gullion {{district}} {{is the site}} of one of the four Tertiary Centres in the North-East of Ireland. The area was mapped during the Geological Survey of Ireland about 1870. Since then a number of more detailed studies of certain aspects of the geology have been carried out. Of these, the more important were the investigations of Richey and Thomas (1932), and Reynolds (1943, 1901). The Tertiary Centre is neatly inset at the south-western end of the Newry granodiorite complex, of Caledonian age. There are at least two distinct units within the Slieve Gullion centre, a ring dyke and, situated within this, a later layered complex. The ring dyke is made up of two major intrusive bodies, the Porphyritic Felsite intruded into vents opened along the ring fracture in the south-west, and a later Porphyritic Granophyre intruded into the other three-quarters of the ring fracture. (Richey, 1932). The ring intrusions were preceeded by violent explosive activity in the south-west of the complex, and within the vent agglomerates of Forkill, Richey recognised the presence of foundered masses of lavas. These Thomas showed to be petrographically similar to lavas seen at the southern edge of the Antrim Lava Sheet, some 10 miles {{to the north of the}} complex, and known to be of Tertiary age. Apart from the very close structural and other similarities with the centres of proven Tertiary age in the west of Scotland, this is the most convincing evidence available in support of a Tertiary age for the Slieve Gullion centre. From the results of a gravity survey of the north of Ireland, it is considered that the Tertiary Centres, including Slieve Gullion, are underlain by a considerable body of basic rock at a depth of four or five miles. (Cook & Murphy, 1952.) During the present investigation, the western half of the ring dyke was remapped on the scale of six inches to the mile, particular attention being paid to the Porphyritic Felsite and its associated agglomerate. Specimens collected from the ring dyke, the Central Complex of Slieve Gullion, and other of the Irish and Scottish Tertiary Centres, were examined petrographically, chemically and spectrographically at Oxford, under the supervision of Professor L. R. Wager. Newry granodiorite forms the country rock to the centre, and at several localities this has been found to be deeply rotted. The rotting is evidently pre-glaciation, since sound granodiorite may readily be found in the overlying drift. Thin sections reveal the preferred alteration of the plagioclase within the granodiorite, and it is considered that the decomposition of the granodiorite is due to hydrothermal alteration of the granodiorite during the evolution of the ring complex. The alteration does not appear to be connected with the Central Layered Complex (Reynolds, 1951). Thin sections of the gabbro from the small plugs along the south-west of the complex show this to be a relatively iron-rich gabbro. Richey demonstrated that there had been two phases of intense dynamic crushing of rocks of the ring dyke complex (Richey & Thomas, 1932), and the crushing was shown to be closely connected in place with the granophyre ring dyke. This has been verified, and it is considered to be possible to confine each phase of crushing within fairly narrow limits during the development of the ring dyke. Possible causes for the extensive crushing are examined and the suggestion is made that the crushing developed as a result of the central block of country rook within the ring dyke being pushed upwards, due to the pressure of underlying acid magma. Comparisons are made with other areas. Reynolds (1951) has advanced the suggestion that gas action played an important, and probably predominant part in the formation of the crush rocks, or Cam Lough breccias as Richey termed them. This suggestion is examined and the conclusion reached that dynamic crushing has played the more important role in the formation of the breccias. The Porphyritic Felsite, which is earlier than the extensively crushed Porphyritic Granophyre, has completely escaped the effects of dynamic crushing. This is shown to be probably accidental. Within the Forkill agglomerates the distribution of the different rock types has been mapped, and from this distribution and other considerations, it appears likely that part of the agglomerate now exposed originated at a deeper level In the vents, being brought into its present position by bodily upwards displacement by the intruding felsite, a suggestion which has also been made by Richey. Small-scale structures within the agglomerates are described and figured. These are attributed to the flow of particle-charged gases through the partially brecciated rocks. The manner of formation of the breccias is examined, and drawing on examples from others of the Tertiary Centres and using the descriptions given by Reynolds (1954) of fluidized systems of solids suspended in gases, the development of the agglomerates is traced and a sequence of decreasing explosive activity described. It is considered that Richey's suggestion that the explosive activity during which the agglomerates were formed is connected with escape of gas from the felsite magma, is correct. The writer would not go so far as to say that the escape of gas took place when the felsite was being intruded into the upper parts of the ring fracture. Within the Porphyritic Felsite a pattern of fluxion structures has been mapped, this indicates several centres of upwelling of the felsite, and strengthens Richey's conclusion that the large masses of felsite were vent intrusions. Macroscopic and microscopic structures within the felsite are described; these lead to the conclusion that the felsite was emplaced as an extremely viscous and relatively cool mass. Chemical, optical and X-ray work on the alkali feldspar phenocrysts from the felsite shows that these were originally homogenous 'high temperature' forms, which now show various stages in unmixing from sanidine-anorthoclases. Some high temperature optics are preserved in marginal specimens. From the chemical composition of phenocrysts and rocks, it appears that prior to emplacement the felsite may have been differentiated into relatively sodic and potassic parts, now reflected in slight differences between the inner and marginal parts of the felsite. Despite this, and the evidence of centres of flow banding, there is no evidence of multiple intrusion in that no <b>internal</b> <b>chilled</b> contact was found. The problem of embayments and apparent corrosion features in phenocrysts, especially quartz, is examined and the suggestion made that for the ring dyke rocks these features may equally well be due to rapid growth of the phenocrysts, though the evidence available is inconclusive either way. Fayalite is described from the felsite (and the granophyre), and the conditions suitable for the precipitation of iron-rich olivine from an acid melt are discussed. It had been suggested that the felsites were possibly welded tuffs. This is not thought to be so, but the presence of numerous fragments of phenocrysts is taken as an indication that at some stage the felsite magma may have violently disintegrated, possibly when the gases were given off to form the agglomerates. It is thought that at this stage the small sedimentary xenoliths found throughout the otherwise inclusion-free felsite, may have been incorporated at this stage. Within the Porphyritic Granophyre ring dyke a zone of inclusions has been mapped. The inclusions are practically identical chemically to their enclosing granophyre, but have a very different, and distinctive, texture consisting of quartz and idiomorphic feldspar intergrown, sometimes in spherulitic aggregates. Through the inclusions there are small pieces of granodiorite, and on Slieve Gullion some of the altered granodiorites develope somewhat similar textural features. The suggestion is made that the inclusions may represent granodiorite altered at depth by basic magma. Texturally identical inclusions are found in two of the Tertiary granites from Skye, these are described. From evidence provided by the contacts of granophyre and felsite, the granophyre would appear to have been emplaced very soon after the felsite, possibly when the inner parts were only partially solid. Reynolds has made the suggestion that the granophyres were emplaced as tuffisites, and altered to granophyre subsequently. This is discussed, and reasons advanced for rejecting her suggestion. Trace element analyses of various rocks from Slieve Gullion, Mourne, Antrim and Skye are described. Variations are found within the rock types of Slieve Gullion and Mourne, and from one to another. It is suggested that the differences may be accounted for if the rocks be considered as representing different stages in differentiation from a more basic parent, or parents. The relatively high Rb/K ratio for the Mourne rocks analysed is thought to indicate that these are extreme differentiates. The high zirconium in certain of the acid rocks from the Tertiary Centres in discussed. The concentration of Zr in the acid rocks may originate through a combination of selective remelting and assimilation of country rock by basic magma, and strong fractionation within the magma. Duplicate analyses were made of rocks from Skye that had been previously analysed for their major and trace elements. The trace element determinations were carried out at the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen, in the first place, and the duplicates made in the Department of Geology and Mineralogy at Oxford provide a standard by which results from the two laboratories may be compared. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} use of air conditioning for indoor cooling in offices and large commercial buildings in Kuwait represents {{a major part of}} the power and electricity consumption in that country. The main objective of this research was to investigate ice and chilled water cool thermal storage technologies and operating strategies for air conditioning. This was motivated by the extreme climatic conditions in Kuwait and the necessity to reduce both maximum power demand and energy consumption whilst being economically feasible. This work represents the first such study undertaken. In Kuwait approximately 45 % of the total annual exported electrical energy is consumed solely by air conditioning systems as a result of the very high ambient temperatures occurring between March and October. Furthermore, it was estimated air conditioning systems represent about 62 % of the peak electrical load. To assess the potential of cool thermal storage, the air conditioning system for an existing clinic building, representing a typical medium size building in Kuwait, was designed with and without a cool thermal storage system. The results demonstrate that <b>internal</b> ice-on-coil and <b>chilled</b> water storage systems are suitable storage technologies that can be implemented in Kuwait. The cooling demand of the clinic building was first estimated using the ESP-r building energy simulation program, following which the different components in the air conditioning systems were sized including chiller, storage tanks, pumps, air handling units for conventional, ice and chilled water storage air conditioning systems operating with load levelling, 50 % demand limiting and full storage strategies. The heat gains by different auxiliary components in the air conditioning systems were estimated and the final cooling demand profiles were developed. For each air conditioning design, the power and energy consumption for the design day condition and over the whole year were calculated and analysed. Furthermore, the life cycle costs were determined based on the estimated capital, maintenance, operating costs and a financial analysis was carried out. For the Kuwaiti climate, the results demonstrate ice and chilled water storage systems can reduced the maximum power consumption during the day time when the electricity demand is high and largest reduction in the maximum power achieved full storage strategy. However, the energy consumption of ice storage system operating with 50 % demand limiting and full strategies were found were found to be higher than the conventional air conditioning system. Nevertheless, the energy consumption in the ice storage system with a load levelling operating strategy was slightly lower. Chilled water storage system was found to be unlike ice storage system, the energy consumption in all operating strategies improved over the conventional system. Based on the estimated life cycle cost using the actual operating costs for both the government and user, it was established that for the government, ice storage operating with load levelling strategy and all other strategies of the chilled water storage systems would be more economical than conventional systems. However, for the user, load levelling ice storage, load levelling chilled water storage, and 50 % demand limiting chilled water storage systems would be more cost effective. Out of all alternatives, chilled water storage system with a load levelling strategy was found to be the most cost effective for the climate of Kuwait and for similar climates of Kuwait. Although, the outcome from this research work can not be generalised however, the method of sizing and energy and economic analysis, which was discussed in this thesis can be generalised and followed to evaluate the impact of cool thermal storage systems on energy performance and economy of the air conditioning systems.
