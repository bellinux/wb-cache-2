The scene required Modine and Cage to <b>hang</b> <b>off</b> {{the edge of the roof}} secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E

[...] So the company president, Channing Meek, came up to the quarry, sat on the wooden bench, was lowered over the mountainside, and started cutting marble. [...] After that no worker refused to go over the side and cut marble. Quarry 2 was followed by #3 in 1907 and #1 in 1912. [...] A fourth opening to the left of #3 (out of view) was started but did not become a producing quarry.|$|E

2500|$|Statham, who is {{a former}} diver for the British Olympic Team, {{performed}} all of Parker's stunts in the film. In one scene, Statham {{jumped out of the}} window of a fast-moving car for his character to escape being shot; this stunt was considered [...] "really dangerous" [...] and Hackford said he was [...] "nervous when he went out that window" [...] five or six times before the scene was finished. In another scene, Statham had to <b>hang</b> <b>off</b> a building's balcony. The actor said he took a [...] "real beating" [...] from these scenes.

Gaga's vocals span the nodes of A4 to D6 and it follows a basic sequence of B5–A5–E–B5–A5 as its chord progression. It is a pop rock song, which contains influences of other genres including country, disco, funk, and house. According to Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times, classifying the genre of the song is difficult, as it combines [...] "tinny Euro-house synths, slowed-down funk drums and a boot-scooting bass line straight out of Nashville." [...] The track has [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] lyrics, referencing cowboy in the opening verse: [...] "I just love a cowboy, I know it's bad, but I'm, like, can I just <b>hang</b> <b>off</b> {{the back of your}} horse and can you go a little faster?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Metal Gear Solid 2 {{carries the}} {{subtitle}} of [...] "Tactical Espionage Action", {{and most of}} the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the enemies. Most fundamental are the wider range of skills offered to the player. The first-person aiming mode allows players to target specific points in the game, greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted by a flying piece of fruit or hit in weak spots. Players can walk slowly, allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without making a sound, or <b>hang</b> <b>off</b> walkways to slip past below guards' feet. The corner-press move from Metal Gear Solid, which allowed players a sneak peek around the next bend is expanded to allow players to fire from cover. Other abilities included leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers, and sneaking up behind enemies to hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition. Players are able to shoot out the enemy's radio so they are unable to communicate with others on their team. [...] The environment also has a greater impact on the stealth gameplay, taking into account factors such as weather, smell, atmosphere and temperature.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Davis {{became the}} second woman to free climb El Capitan in one day. One year later, in October 2005, {{she became the}} first woman to free climb the Salathé Wall, on El Capitan, The route is rated 5.13b/c, is 35 pitches, and {{approximately}} [...] long. The difficulty of the climb can be described as [...] "spidering up the side of a skyscraper, climbing to [...] no bigger than lentils". What makes Davis' achievement even more impressive is that she free climbed the route, meaning that she used only her hands and feet to climb the rock; she did not <b>hang</b> <b>off</b> the rope or any other mechanical aids. Davis worked on the route throughout September, learning every inch of the climb and meeting Cybele Blood, who became her belayer. Davis had initially planned for the climb to take five days and had cached water and food along the route for that length of the time, but poor weather, high numbers of climbers on the route and difficult climbing made the climb take eleven days. In fact, Davis wore only light climbing shoes, climbing tights, long underwear, and a light wind jacket. The only other gear she had was climbing gear, a lightweight sleeping bag, a portable espresso maker, water and food. When the two ran low on food and water, Blood went looking for the cached supplies but couldn't find them, so Davis [...] "jugged" [...] to the top to get some water and then returned to the route to continue the free climb. This climb was Davis' [...] "dream come true" [...] and afterwards she said [...] "I don't have to prove anything to myself anymore, or to anyone else." ...|$|E

6000|$|Your {{letter from}} Chocorua, {{received}} {{a day or}} two ago, has a rare charm and value for me, and in fact brings to my eyes tears of gratitude and appreciation! I can't tell you how I thank you for offering me your manly breast to hurl myself upon in the event of my alighting on the New York dock, four or five weeks hence, in abject and craven terror--which I foresee as a certainty; so that I accept without shame or scruple the beautiful and blessed offer of aid and comfort that you make me. I have it at heart to notify you that you will in all probability bitterly repent of your generosity, and that I shall be sure to become for you a dead-weight of the first water, the most awful burden, nuisance, parasite, pestilence and plaster that you have ever known. But this said, I prepare even now to me cramponner to you like grim death, trusting to you for everything and invoking you from moment to moment as my providence and saviour. I go on assuming that I shall get off from Southampton in the Kaiser Wilhelm II, of the North German Lloyd line, on August 24th--the said ship being, I believe, a [...] "five-day" [...] boat, which usually gets in sometime on the Monday. Of course it will be a nuisance to you, my arriving in New York--if I do arrive; but that got itself perversely and fatefully settled some time ago, and has now to be accepted as of the essence. Since you ask me what my desire is likely to he, I haven't a minute's hesitation in speaking of it as a probable frantic yearning to get off to Chocorua, or at least to Boston and its neighbourhood, by the very first possible train, and it may be on the said Monday. I shall not have much heart for interposing other things, nor any patience for it to speak of, so long as I <b>hang</b> <b>off</b> from your mountain home; yet, at the same time, if the boat should get in late, and it were possible to catch the Connecticut train, I believe I could bend my spirit to go {{for a couple of days}} to the Emmets', on the condition that you can go with me. So, and so only, could I think of doing it. Very kindly, therefore, let them know this, by wire or otherwise, in advance, and determine for me yourself whichever you think the best move. Grace Norton writes me from Kirkland Street that she expects me there, and Mrs. J. Gardner writes me from Brookline that she absolutely counts on me; in consequence of all of which I beseech you to hold on to me tight and put me through as much as possible like an express parcel, paying 50 cents and taking a brass check for me. I shall write you again next month, and meanwhile I'm delighted at the prospect of your being able to spend September in the mountain home. I have all along been counting on that as a matter of course, but now I see it was fatuous to do so--and yet rejoice but the more that this is in your power.... But good-night, dearest H.--with many caresses all round, ever your affectionate ...|$|E
