'He could have been a great man,' <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> once. 'The only thing he lacked was character.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "the {{surest way to}} make people find out the worst is to keep them ignorant.

6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "no one. My <b>father</b> only <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} name of the little village is Kleindorf. He wrote it on the label for my bag." ...|$|R
6000|$|He answered: 'Your <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that to-morrow I {{must fight}} with his negro. He is only another man like myself, and I hope to subdue him, {{and to gain}} the contest.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I do, {{and what}} is more, I intend, sooner or later, {{to try to have}} matters mended. My <b>father</b> always <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he wished me to keep on going to school and then to enter Princeton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{you might}} have letter from Miss Sefton, and there is none from her,' said Lady Merrifield, with a {{somewhat}} perplexed air.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Wilmet abstractedly, 'his <b>father</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he had--what did he call it?--"a fair {{independent}} {{competence of}} his own." [...] Oh! {{they are so}} kind!' ...|$|E

6000|$|And as, perhaps, I {{seemed to}} wonder at {{this way of}} beginning, he opened a little, and said, [...] "It is my <b>father.</b> He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that if ever I came here I was to mind and do his work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'From what my <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of him, he is not--a more {{desirable}} brother-in-law {{to me than}} I shall be in all likelihood to him. What business has a man of that character to marry Berta, I should like to ask?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And it is that, the children, {{that makes}} Mr. Eden impossible," [...] Mrs. Morse went on incisively. [...] "Their {{heritage}} must be clean, and he is, I am afraid, not clean. Your <b>father</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of sailors' lives, and--and you understand." ...|$|R

6000|$|...
