25|$|Prior to 1958, {{flooding}} was {{a persistent}} problem near the lower {{reaches of the}} river, with Beighton, Catcliffe, Treeton and Woodhouse Mill particularly at risk. When the River Rother Improvement Scheme was first proposed in September 1958, analysis of flood flows revealed that peaks flows on the Rother generally reached the River Don at Rotherham after the peak flow on that river had already passed. Enlarging the channel of the Rother {{would have resulted in}} the peak flows reaching the Don earlier, effectively moving the problem of flooding downstream to Rotherham. The scheme therefore recognised the need to create and manage washlands to hold back the <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Ryton draws {{its water}} from the Anston Brook, the Pudding Dyke, the Bondhay Dyke, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Broadbridge Dyke. Prior to the {{construction}} of the Chesterfield Canal in the 1770s, the flow of the Broadbridge Dyke was much greater, but water from its catchment area was diverted to form the reservoirs at Pebley and Harthill, which supply the canal. Overflow from the reservoirs reaches the Ryton by the Pudding Dyke, but the river also supplies water to the canal via the Brancliffe feeder and the Kilton feeder. The natural water sources are supplemented by the outflows from Dinnington and Anston Sewage Treatment Works into the Anston Brook, which together provide about 7 Ml/d (megalitres per day), while Kilton Treatment Works supplies about 12.8 Ml/d. At Manton, <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> from the canal tops up the river, and water pumped from Manton Colliery formerly performed the same function. With the closure of the mine, a new borehole was constructed in 2004, and water is pumped from the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer into the river. The borehole is operated by Severn Trent Water.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2005, pumps were {{installed}} on Tick and Dove Creeks (tributaries of Bell Canyon) to remove urban runoff from [...] of residential areas in eastern Rancho Santa Margarita. The pumps remove <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> and divert it to storage basins {{for later use}} as reclaimed irrigation water.|$|E
5000|$|The PWSD Board {{views the}} {{reservoir}} as a [...] "Regional" [...] asset. The District has collaborated with other South Metro water districts to acquire intermittent available {{water under the}} WISE agreement in conjunction with Denver/Aurora. Rueter-Hess is the vessel to hold <b>excess</b> <b>flows.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the water}} cycle, when {{precipitation}} {{falls on the}} earth's land, some of the water flows on the surface forming streams and rivers. The remaining water, through infiltration, penetrates the soil traveling underground, hydrating the vadose zone soil, recharging aquifers, with the <b>excess</b> <b>flowing</b> in subsurface runoff. In hydrogeology it {{is measured by the}} Groundwater flow equation.|$|R
50|$|The Bonneville Unit {{is located}} in central and northeastern Utah and {{provides}} water for the following counties: Salt Lake County, Utah County, Wasatch County, Summit County, and Duchesne County. Bonneville Unit water is developed by collecting and storing <b>excess</b> <b>flows</b> of several streams (principally tributaries to the Duchesne River), purchasing water rights, using part of the existing water supply in Utah Lake, and using project return flows and high flows entering Utah Lake.|$|R
500|$|In {{response}} to public outcry, most pro-Auburn Dam groups now recommend {{the construction of}} a [...] "dry dam", or one that purely supports the purpose of flood control. Such a dam would stand empty most of the year, but during a flood the <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> would pool temporarily behind the dam instead of flowing straight through, and therefore the dam could still provide flood control while leaving the American River canyons dry for most of the year (hence [...] "dry"). Water would be impounded for only a few days or weeks each year instead of all year long, minimizing damage on the local environment. The dam would be built to protect against a 500-year flood. Also, with {{the construction of a}} [...] "dry" [...] Auburn Dam, Folsom Lake could be kept at a higher level throughout the year because of reduced flood-control pressure, therefore facilitating recreational access to the reservoir. Finally, regulations in flow could help groundwater recharge efforts; the lower Sacramento Valley aquifer is acknowledged as severely depleted.|$|E

50|$|This <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> {{will cause}} the {{temperature}} to over-shoot the set-point. Once the room sensor has detected this overflow it will close the actuator, causing {{a sharp drop in}} flow. The process will repeat itself in a phenomenon described as ‘hunting’.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of {{diversification}} on firm cash <b>flows</b> and <b>excess</b> value. Specifically, we investigate {{whether there is a}} direct link between the discount to diversification and <b>excess</b> cash <b>flow</b> reductions around related and unrelated acquisitions. Our results provide empirical support for a positive and significant association between <b>excess</b> cash <b>flow</b> declines and <b>excess</b> value losses after the acquisition. Our findings also show that bidders who conduct unrelated acquisitions experience larger <b>excess</b> cash <b>flow</b> declines and valuation discounts than do bidders who engage in related acquisitions. Our results are robust to the targets’ <b>excess</b> cash <b>flow</b> and valuation characteristics. Recent empirical studies find that the average diversified firm trades at a discount relative to a portfolio of comparable single-segment firms. This literature suggests that diversification itself might be the reason that diversified firms produce cash flows different from those they would generate if broken into single-segment firms operating in the same line of business with diversified firm’s distinct lines of business (see Berger and Ofek, 1995 among others). 1 The possibility that conglomeration might reduce cash flows motivates this article. However, several papers (Campa and Kedia, 2002; Chevalier, 2000; Graham, Lemmon, and Wolf, 2002; Whited...|$|R

30|$|Horton (1933) {{compared}} {{the soil surface}} to a “diverting dam and head-gate” that divides net precipitation (precipitation received {{at the top of}} the vegetation canopy less interception losses) into an infiltration component limited by the infiltration capacity of the soil and a surface runoff component. The surface runoff component is commonly known as Hortonian overland <b>flow</b> or infiltration <b>excess</b> overland <b>flow.</b> The infiltration rate is supply controlled (or flux controlled) at the beginning of a storm (preponding infiltration; Rubin, 1966), and as soon as the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration capacity of the soil surface, infiltration becomes rainpond and the resulting infiltration <b>excess</b> <b>flows</b> off along the land surface as overland flow. In this stadium, infiltration is surface controlled. Whilst infiltration <b>excess</b> overland <b>flow</b> is common under dry initial conditions and on hillslopes with surface sealing, the saturation <b>excess</b> overland <b>flow</b> generating mechanism is more common under temperate climate conditions with frequent, low intensity precipitation, and occurs when the soil is saturated and unable to absorb more water (Dunne and Black, 1970). Under such conditions, infiltration is soil controlled or more specifically, profile controlled when the infiltration capacity of the topsoil exceeds that of the underlying soil layers, and the decline rate of the infiltration capacity depends on soil structure, texture, and water content. A special form of infiltration is channel infiltration, which is the infiltration into the channel bed and results in a loss of water in downstream direction. The reverse process, channel seepage, occurs when groundwater surfaces on the face of a stream bank or exfiltrates into the channel.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2005, pumps were {{installed}} on Tick and Dove Creeks (tributaries of Bell Canyon) to remove urban runoff from 1100 acre of residential areas in eastern Rancho Santa Margarita. The pumps remove <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> and divert it to storage basins {{for later use}} as reclaimed irrigation water.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel {{receives}} flows {{that might}} otherwise reach the river. Instead, the CSO tunnel transports them to the Swan Island Pump Station. Portland's 1930s sewer design combined street and surface runoff with sewage in a common system that was overwhelmed during heavy precipitation. The original system handled overflows by sending <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> into the river.|$|E
50|$|With {{this form}} of routing it is {{possible}} to represent pressurized flow when a closed conduit becomes full, such that flows can exceed the full normal flow value. Flooding occurs when the water depth at a node exceeds the maximum available depth, and the <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> is either lost from the system or can pond atop the node and re-enter the drainage system.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the floods}} of 1931 and 1932, the Borough council {{arranged}} {{for an investigation}} {{to be carried out}} into the flooding problem within the catchment. The planned solution was the construction of two flood relief culverts, with associated improvements to the sewerage system. Opened in 1938, the largest of the diversion tunnels was called the Northern Flood Relief Culvert, and drains <b>excess</b> <b>flows</b> from the Markeaton and Mackworth brooks. The second, known as the Bramble brook culvert takes surplus flows for that tributary stream.|$|R
50|$|Mount Piper draws its {{cooling water}} from Lyell Dam and Thomsons Creek Dam, both purpose {{built for the}} station. Lyell Dam {{is located on the}} Coxs River 20 km away. Large pumps draw water from the dam and {{transfer}} it to a pipeline built between Thompsons Creek Dam and Mount Piper. The power station taking what water it needs and the <b>excess</b> <b>flowing</b> into Thompsons Creek Dam. When no pumps are in service the water supply to the power station is gravity fed from Thompsons Creek Dam.|$|R
50|$|Plazac {{was put on}} the map, so to speak, by the Archbishop of Périgueux, {{who used}} it as a country retreat. Parts of the village, {{including}} the church, date back to the 12th century. It is rumored that there are underground tunnels beneath the village that were used during the many conflicts over the centuries. There is certainly a spring which feeds underground passages sending water to the church and its attached presbytery with the <b>excess</b> <b>flowing</b> beneath the streets to the nearby Vimont River.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of gas {{cabinets}} available in the market in different gas cylinder configurations, such as 1, 2 and 3 bottle designs. They can be either new, used, or reconditioned. A gas cylinder cabinet can have many features depending on the specific gas. These features include gas sensor, sprinkler head, <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> sensor, automatic operation with automatic purging and excess pressure sensor.|$|E
50|$|HDS systems {{should be}} sized based on {{treatment}} objectives including desired level of pollutant removal, drainage basin characteristics, {{climate of the}} region, and particle size to be targeted. Performance is also sensitive to water temperature, i.e. season. Care {{must be taken to}} avoid routing <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> through the device and compromising performance. Each vendor’s product has different pollutant removal rates that should be evaluated before selecting the system.|$|E
50|$|Sewers {{overflow}} {{during a}} significant rainfall because the {{combined sewer systems}} fill up beyond their capacity to carry both sewage and storm water, thereby discharging the <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> into rivers and streams. Since streams also are affected, people should limit stream contact as well. Runoffs and overflows subside gradually and river water quality usually does not return to normal until 24 to 36 hours after the rainfall ends.|$|E

50|$|These are {{normally}} the pipe line that discharges to a watercourse, downstream of a combined sewer overflow. It takes the <b>excess</b> <b>flow</b> from a combined sewer. A surface water sewer conveys rainwater; legally {{you have a}} right of connection for your rainwater to this public sewer.

5000|$|The {{algorithm}} is typically separated into two phases.

50|$|Oil {{pressure}} is higher when {{the engine is}} cold due to the increased viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert <b>excess</b> <b>flow.</b> Oil {{pressure is}} lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive oil pressure may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of oil. Low oil pressure indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|E

50|$|The flow, and {{effective}} catchment area, {{are affected by}} irrigation diversion. <b>Excess</b> <b>flow</b> from the Cressy-Longford irrigation scheme is diverted into the river increasing summer flow in the river's lower reaches. This irrigation diversion originates at the Poatina Hydroelectric Power Station's tailrace and enters the river near Bracknell. Though the upper hills {{are known for their}} cool temperate rainforest, land along most of the river's length is used for agriculture.Water quality in the lower reaches is affected by agricultural run-off and for a small length by discharge from a sewerage plant at Carrick.
