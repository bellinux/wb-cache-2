40|$|Abstract Bar Chart, {{the other}} name of Gantt Chart, is {{one type of}} sheduling form that often used in {{construction}} project. The Bar Chart is usually completed with <b>S</b> <b>Curve,</b> that present the cumulative earned of work from time to time. The <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> {{can be used to}} controlled the progress of work in any time. The analysis of Earned Value Concept, that analyze cost and time consumed of work simultaneously, is based on <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> either. In many cases, the shape of <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> is formed unless reffered to certain rule, so that the shape of letter “S” some times too steep or too slope slightly. To improve the shape of <b>S</b> <b>Curve,</b> Miller introduced the concept of <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> that composed from three mathematic’s formulas. The three formulas that form three parts of the curve are y = 0, 0225 x 2, y = 1, 5 x – 25, and y = - 125 + 4, 5 x – 0, 0225 x 2 respectively. This curve is ideal, whereas the earned of the work in a certain unit time changes gradually, therefore meet the concept of resources levelling. Miller divided the duration of project excecution in three parts. Each part has a same length of periode. The study of different length of periode for three parts shows that <b>S</b> <b>Curve</b> is not ideal, proved by the fluctuation of earned of work in significant value. 	 Key words : <b>S</b> <b>Curve,</b> earned of work, resources levelling...|$|R
40|$|The <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> {{developed}} by the Earning Value has been widely employed for Project Performance Control. However, the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> evaluates project durations and costs deterministically, but takes no uncertainties into account. In order to control projects under uncertainties, the SS <b>curve</b> (Stochastic <b>S</b> <b>curve)</b> is developed. Compared to the <b>S</b> <b>curve,</b> the SS curve is more complete and systematic. Nevertheless, the SS curve does not deal with performance correlation comprehensively, because it ignores that performance deviation may be a normal consequence in the real world, and may lead to an arbitrary estimate of project performance. To deal with the above problems, this paper uses the factor statuses, factor period and unit price period to construct a new performance control mechanism, named as the Factor-Oriented Stochastic <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> (FOSS-Curve). The FOSS-Curve can properly handle performance correlation and enhance the SS curve to avoid over-adjusting when performance deviation occurs. Furthermore, this paper utilizes a scenario analysis to verify the FOSS-Curve and punctuate the overreaction which the SS curve may have.

In order to properly manage technological processes, the company strategists need models {{for the analysis of}} the technological performance trend. In recent decades, the literature of technology management has proposed the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> models as useful tools for the analysis of the life cycle of technological innovations in order to plan the company strategies and policies. As for many other models developed in the field of management, the scarce attention devoted to the analytical foundations has reduced the theoretical consistency of the <b>S</b> <b>curves</b> to model the technological innovation process, making it difficult to use these models as real strategic tools. In this work a flexible <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> model is examined in order to highlight the model suitability to analyse the technological innovation process. Specifically, the linearity properties of the model have been studied and a suitable re-parameterization has been proposed. In order to enable the management to strategically use the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> model, approximate prediction intervals about the technological innovation level have been built to monitor the evolution of the performance of a given technology. The theoretical considerations are supported by the practical application of the proposed methodology to three data sets concerning three different technologies: piston aero-engines, jet-aero-engines and digital signal processors, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{hydrograph}} at {{the watershed}} outlet was simulated using the time-area curve concept implemented in a {{geographic information system}} (GIS). The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if hydrograph prediction accuracy would be improved by accounting for spatial and temporal variation of excess rainfall. Three models with different methods of estimating excess rainfall were developed: the Distributed Curve Number (DCN) model uses a CN for each cell, generating spatially distributed excess rainfall using the Soil Conservation Services curve number method (SCS, 1972); the Uniform Curve Number (UCN) model uses a single “average ” CN for the whole watershed, thus generating a uniform excess rainfall; the Phi (Φ) index model which uses the Φ-index method to generate uniform excess rainfall. With the aid of a GIS, the cumulative flow time to the watershed outlet is estimated for each cell in the watershed and the isochrones of equal travel time are developed. The time-area curve is developed in the form of an <b>S</b> <b>curve.</b> The spatially distributed 1 -hr unit hydrograph is derived from the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> as the difference between the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> and its value lagged by 1 -hr.

40|$|Abstract—The {{structure}} of steady state diffusion flames is investigated {{by analyzing the}} mixing and chemical reaction of two opposed jets of fuel and oxidizer as a particular example. An Arrhenius one-step irreversible reaction has been considered in the realistic limit of large activation energies. The entire range of Damkohler numbers, or ratio of characteristic diffusion and chemical times, has been covered. When the resulting maximum temperature is plotted {{in terms of the}} Damkohler number (which is inversely proportional to the flow velocity) the characteristic <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> emerges from the analysis, with segments from the curve resulting from: (a) A nearly frozen ignition regime where the temperature and concentrations deviations from its frozen flow values are small. The lower branch and bend of the <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> is covered by this regime. (b) A partial burning regime, where both reactants cross the reaction zone toward regions of frozen flow. This regime is unstable. (c) A premixed flame regime where only one of the reactants leaks through the reaction zone, which then separates a region of frozen flow from a region of near-equilibrium. (d) A near-equilibrium diffusion controlled regime, covering the upper branch of the <b>S</b> <b>curve,</b> with a thin reaction zone separating two regions of equilibrium flow. Analytical expressions are obtained, in particular, for the ignition and extinction conditions. 1...|$|R

We present {{limits to}} the log N − log <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> for {{isolated}} neutron stars, both cooling and accreting neutron stars, which are not active as radio pulsars, as observed with the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and compare it with theoretical expectations. So far, only one isolated neutron star is identified optically among ROSAT sources, namely RXJ 185635 - 3754 (Walter & Matthews 1997). Three more promising candidates have been suggested. In addition, several upper limit estimates {{are available on the}} space density of such neutron stars from different optical follow-up studies. We show that the log N −log <b>S</b> <b>curve</b> according to the current observations, including the identified neutron star, the three additional candidates, and the upper limits, lies between the theoretical expectations for middle-aged cooling neutron stars and old accreting neutron stars. At least one of the neutron star candidates found so far with ROSAT may be cooling instead of accreting. We suggest that the fact that more accreting isolated old neutron stars were expected (e. g., Madau & Blaes 1994) than observed is mostly due to the velocity distribution used in those calculations. More recent radio observations indicate that there are fewer slow neutron stars, ie., fewer accreting X-ray bright old neutron stars.
