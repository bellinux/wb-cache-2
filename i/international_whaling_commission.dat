5|$|The hunting led to {{the near}} {{extinction}} of large whales, including sperm whales, until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972.

5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the <b>International</b> <b>Whaling</b> <b>Commission</b> (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales are harvested each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{organs of}} farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the <b>International</b> <b>Whaling</b> <b>Commission</b> implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E
50|$|Anti-whaling {{activism}} has a {{short history}} {{compared to other}} forms of activism and environmental awareness. Early members of environmental organizations began protesting whale hunts around the world in the 20th century. These actions were in direct response to the global depletion of whale populations due to over-exploitation by the whaling industry and the failure of <b>international</b> <b>whaling</b> regulations.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{system of}} subsidies {{issued by the}} King and his ministers supported Dutch entrepreneurs, which minimized a competitive disadvantage {{in a period of}} <b>international</b> <b>whaling</b> with similar financial incentives being funded by many national governments. In this context, a lack of quality in the art of shipbuilding and in the training of seamen has been regarded as very important factors in explaining the ultimate failure of the Dutch whaling industry in the late 19th century.|$|R
25|$|After World War I, {{the major}} whaling {{nations of the}} time (Norway, Great Britain, United States) became {{increasingly}} concerned the depletion of blue whales and other whale species, and entered into first <b>international</b> <b>whaling</b> treaty in 1931, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which became effective in 1935 after ratification by the member nations. The treaty banned the hunting of all right whales. However, Japan and the Soviet Union did not ratify the treay, and thus were not bound by it. Attempts to bring the other major whaling nations under an international regime stalled until after World War II.|$|R
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the <b>International</b> <b>Whaling</b> <b>Commission</b> (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important for}} the world economy. All species were exploited, and as one type's stock depleted, another type was targeted. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially through the 1960s as all whale stocks had been depleted, and practically stopped in 1988 after the <b>International</b> <b>Whaling</b> <b>Commission</b> placed a moratorium which banned whaling for commercial use. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, gray whales may be as numerous as they were prior to whaling, making it the first marine mammal to {{be taken off the}} Endangered species list. The Southern right whale was hunted to near extinction in the mid-to-late 20th century, with only a small (unknown) population around Antarctica. Because of international protection, the Southern right whale's population has been growing 7% annually since 1970. Conversely, the eastern stock of North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the coast of North Africa to the North Sea and Iceland; it is thought that the entire stock consists of only ten individuals, making the eastern stock functionally extinct.|$|E
5|$|Whaling {{decreased}} substantially after 1946 when, {{in response}} to the steep decline in whale populations, the <b>International</b> <b>Whaling</b> <b>Commission</b> placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004. As of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 bowhead whales off Alaska and two from the western coast of Greenland, 620 grey whales off Washington state, three common minke whales off the eastern coast of Greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 fin whales from the west coast of Greenland, nine humpback whales from the west coast of Greenland and 20 off St. Vincent and the Grenadines each year. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the North Atlantic population is functionally extinct. Conversely, the North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the North Atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of Canada, Greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the European coastline.|$|E

5|$|The earlier {{of known}} records of {{commercial}} hunting of killer whales {{date to the}} 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, {{and the difficulty of}} taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the <b>International</b> <b>Whaling</b> <b>Commission</b> to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|From {{its origins}} as a secret sealers' haven Otago Harbour {{developed}} into a busy <b>international</b> <b>whaling</b> port after the Weller brothers established their whaling station at Te Umu Kuri, Wellers Rock, at {{what is now called}} Otakou in November 1831. The busiest whaling port south of the Bay of Islands, it was also the hub of the largest European population in New Zealand after the Bay of Islands/Hokianga district by the end of 1839. By that time whaling had collapsed and Dumont D'Urville and his officers, visiting in 1840, observed the port had become the centre of a riotous trade in liquor and prostitution. This continued until the Scottish settlers arrived in 1848 and made Port Chalmers and Dunedin the new population centres on the harbour.|$|R
25|$|In {{the course}} of a {{turbulent}} decade the Wellers' Otago establishment grew to be the largest in the country and the harbour became an <b>international</b> <b>whaling</b> port.

Whaling collapsed in 1839 and Dumont D'Urville, a visiting French navigator, described the Peninsula's European and Māori communities both trafficking in alcohol and sex, in March 1840. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed on the Peninsula in June, although the South Island had already been annexed by 'right of discovery'. The first Christian service was preached on the Peninsula later that year at Otago by Bishop Pompallier. In 1841 Octavius Harwood and C.W. Schultze took over the Wellers' operation.|$|R

The quotas recommended were so much lower than usual that the whaling countries argued over them for many years but eventually they had to lower the quotas. However the whaling countries first adopted interim, compromise quotas which were higher than recommended.|$|R
