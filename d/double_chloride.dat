Since {{the exact nature}} of the reacting complex is unknown, several candidates were considered. These were: (1) a mononuclear adduct with two ligand molecules, L-PdCl 2 -L, (2) a mononuclear adduct with one ligand and one solvent molecule, L-PdCl 2 -dmf, (3) a dinuclear adduct with a <b>double</b> <b>chloride</b> bridge, [L-PdCl-(mu-Cl) ] 2, and (4) a coordinatively unsaturated complex with an agostic interaction, L-PdCl 2. The reaction profile initiating from L-PdCl 2 -dmf, which displays an agostic intermediate produced after displacement of the dmf molecule by the activating C-H bond, has the lowest barrier (20. 4 kcal/mol in the step with the proton transfer to the O(dmf) atom). In all other reaction pathways, the proton migration is to a chlorine atom and is associated with remarkably high barriers. The results are related to previous experimental and other computational findings. While none of the reaction profiles includes explicit dissociation of the ligand, the proton transfer was found to occur only after the ligand is almost completely displaced from the coordinating shell. It was concluded that the transition state corresponds to 14 -electron coordination of Pd and that ease of a ligand dissociation is an important, but not necessarily decisive, factor for cyclopalladation...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} mass susceptibilities of salts of ammonium {{and potassium}} have been {{measured in the}} solid state and {{in a series of}} solutions, as well as the single salts of magnesium, zinc, cadmium, lithium and thallium. Additivity relationships suggested by earlier workers for the potassium, ammonium and magnesium halides and sulphates were confirmed both in the solid state and in solution. The molar susceptibilities of these salts in solution are generally about 1 to 2 % higher than for the solid state. The molar volumes and molar refractions were also determined from density and refractive index measurements on most of the solutions investigated. 2. Susceptibility measurements on double salts of ammonium and potassium with magnesium and zinc were made. Additivity relationships in these salts in the solid state and in solutions were found to be valid. Comparing the molar susceptibility of the <b>double</b> <b>chlorides</b> of ammonium and potassium with magnesium at the same ionic strengths, it was found {{that in the case of}} the double salts containing the potassium ion the calculated molar susceptibility and molar volume are slightly greater than the experimental. 3. The susceptibility of the salt was found to varywith the concentration of the solution for most of the salts studied. In the case of ammonium, potassium and magnesium salts the susceptibility of the solute showed only a slight change, a fall in susceptibility with increasing concentration being observed. The susceptibility of the salt calculated from the susceptibility of solutions of zinc, cadmium, lithium and thallium salts showed a marked variation with the concentration, the susceptibility concentration curves passing through a minimum after which the susceptibility of the salt rises again. A marked change in molar volumes with increasing concentration for this group of salts was also noticed. 4. These changes with increasing concentration ofthe solute have been correlated with changes in the mean stoichiometric activity coefficient of the salt and resemblances between the changes in the magnetic susceptibility and the activity coefficient noted. The effect of ion pair formation and complex ion formation has been considered and the influence of ionic hydration on the activity coefficients has been estimated in some cases.

40|$|The {{neutrophil}} enzyme myeloperoxidase uses H 2 O 2 {{to oxidize}} chloride, bromide, iodide and thiocyanate {{to their respective}} hypohalous acids. Chloride {{is considered to be}} the physiological substrate. However, a detailed kinetic study of its substrate preference has not been undertaken. Our aim was to establish whether myeloperoxidase oxidizes thiocyanate in the presence of chloride at physiological concentrations of these substrates. We determined this by measuring the rate of H 2 O 2 loss in reactions catalysed by the enzyme at various concentrations of each substrate. The relative specificity constants for chloride, bromide and thiocyanate were 1 : 60 : 730 respectively, indicating that thiocyanate {{is by far the most}} favoured substrate for myeloperoxidase. In the presence of 100 mM chloride, myeloperoxidase catalysed the production of hypothiocyanite at concentrations of thiocyanate as low as 25 microM. With 100 microM thiocyanate, about 50 % of the H 2 O 2 present was converted into hypothiocyanite, and the rate of hypohalous acid production equalled the sum of the individual rates obtained when each of these anions was present alone. The rate of H 2 O 2 loss catalysed by myeloperoxidase in the presence of 100 mM <b>chloride</b> <b>doubled</b> when 100 microM thiocyanate was added, and was maximal with 1 mM thiocyanate.

As a consequence, more consideration should be given to the oxidation products of thiocyanate and to the role they play in host defence and inflammation...|$|R

The activities of serum creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydroge-nase (LDH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined to assess the degree of myocardial injury and oxidative stress-induced damage.

The results demonstrated that pretreat-ment with high dose (H) -CG markedly improved cardiac function, as evidenced by upregulated EF, FS and LVESP, and downregulated LVEDP. In addition, administration of CG resulted in significant decreases in infarct size in the I/R+low dose-CG and I/R+H-CG groups, compared with the I/R group. The activities of CK and LDH, and the levels of MDA in the I/R+H-CG group were reduced, compared with those in the I/R group, whereas SOD activity was elevated. Treatment with CG inhibited the cleavage and activity of caspase- 3 and caspase- 9, and enhanced the phosphorylation of PI 3 K p 85 and Akt. Notably, administration of the PI 3 K inhibitor, LY 294002, markedly lowered the levels of p-PI 3 K p 85 /p-Akt, and eradi-cated the inhibitory effects of H-CG on infarct size, myocardial injury and oxidative stress-induced damage.

Samples were collected from three drinking water utilities supplied by source waters with varying organic and inorganic precursor content. The filtered samples were treated in the laboratory with a range of UV doses delivered from low pressure (LP, UV output at 253. 7 nm) and medium pressure (MP, polychromatic UV output 200 - 400 nm) mercury lamps followed by chlorination or chloramination, in the presence and absence of additional bromide and nitrate. The regulated trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were not affected by UV pretreatment at disinfection doses (40 - 186 mJ/cm 2). With higher doses (1000 mJ/cm 2), trihalomethane formation was increased 30 - 40 %. While most effects on DBPs were only observed with doses much higher than typically used for UV disinfection, there were some effects on unregulated DBPs at lower doses. In nitrate-spiked samples (1 - 10 mg N/L), chloropicrin formation doubled and increased three- to six-fold with 40 mJ/cm 2 MP UV followed by chloramination and chlorination, respectively. Bromopicrin formation was increased in samples containing bromide (0. 5 - 1 mg/L) and nitrate (1 - 10 mg N/L) when pretreated with LP or MP UV (30 - 60 % with 40 mJ/cm 2 LP UV and four- to ten-fold increase with 40 mJ/cm 2 MP UV, after subsequent chlorination).

40|$|Following {{a random}} block {{experimental}} design in each case, three repeated measurement studies {{were carried out}} in three different groups of conscious rabbits, to investigate the renal effects of increasing doses of intravenous calcium chloride (CaCl 2) and bovine parathyroid hormone (PTH). In the first study, each rabbit received either CaCl 2 (0. 15, 0. 3, 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg kg- 1 min- 1) or vehicle alone (control) for 160 min. In the second study, rabbits were given either PTH (0. 15 microgram kg- 1 min- 1), CaCl 2 (1. 0 mg kg- 1 min- 1), PTH plus CaCl 2 (0. 15 microgram kg- 1 min- 1 and 1. 0 mg kg- 1 min- 1, respectively) or vehicle alone; PTH was infused for just over 60 min. In the third study, a much smaller dose (0. 05 mg kg- 1 min- 1) of CaCl 2 was infused for 100 min. CaCl 2 infusion produced a striking fall in fractional excretion of sodium of at least 50 % (P less than 0. 01), but this was not dose related, being almost maximal at the smaller doses infused. Although this effect was evident {{in the absence of any}} changes in total plasma calcium concentration at the lower doses of CaCl 2, renal calcium excretion was increased between 2 - and 20 -fold (P less than 0. 01) at all doses infused. Fractional excretion of <b>chloride</b> <b>doubled</b> at the two higher doses of CaCl 2 (P less than 0. 01), but potassium excretion was unchanged. There were no consistent alterations in mean arterial blood pressure, effective renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate or plasma renin activity (PRA); total plasma calcium concentration was consistently elevated only during infusion of the high dose by just under 1 mmol l- 1. PTH infusion had no measured effect on fractional excretion of sodium or renal calcium excretion, but doubled fractional potassium excretion (P less than 0. 05). Heart rate and PRA increased (P less than 0. 01 and less than 0. 05, respectively), the latter by 50 %, but systemic pressure and renal haemodynamics were not significantly affected. By contrast, PTH infused with CaCl 2 produced a 4 -fold rise in fractional sodium excretion and although renal calcium excretion remained increased, it was reduced by ca. 80 % when compared with renal calcium excretion during infusion of CaCl 2 alone. Infusion of PTH alone increased PRA, but when PTH and CaCl 2 were infused together, PRA did not change. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
