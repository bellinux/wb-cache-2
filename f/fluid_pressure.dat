5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure</b> in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is injected into the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure</b> within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E

40|$|Many active faults are {{expected}} to develop <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> in excess of hydrostatic pressures below 3 to 7 km depth during interseismic periods. Suprahydrostatic <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> are known to reduce the stresses required for brittle failure. Stress differences that trigger moderate to large earthquakes typically range from 40 to 160 MPa, as indicated by earthquake shear stress drops and paleostress estimates obtained from mylonites. For stresses in this range (40 – 160 MPa), seismic fault reactivation requires in most cases pore fluid factors (<b>fluid</b> pressure/overburden <b>pressure)</b> higher than for hydrostatic <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> (i. e., > 0. 37) along misoriented faults with fault angles ≥ 45 °, such as many segments of the San Andreas fault system. For example, at a stress difference of 100 MPa and fault angles of 45 ° – 55 °, fault reactivation at 7 to 20 km depth requires hypocentral pore fluid factors of ≈ 0. 8 - 1 for reverse faults, 0. 6 – 0. 9 for strike-slip faults, and < 0. 8 for normal faults. Pore fluid factors increase with increasing cohesive strength of faults, increasing coefficient of internal friction, and increasing fault angle. Seismic reactivation of cohesive faults at stress differences of 40 – 160 MPa requires near {{the base of the}} seismogenic zone (≈ 15 km depth) suprahydrostatic <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> at all possible fault angles. Pore fluid factors are ≈ 0. 4 – 0. 9 for normal faults, ≈ 0. 6 - 1 for strike-slip faults, and ≈ 0. 8 – 1. 05 for thrust or reverse faults.

40|$|AbstractWe {{document}} regional pore-fluid {{pressures in}} the active Taiwan thrust belt using 55 deep boreholes to test the classic Hubbert–Rubey hypothesis that high static <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> (depth normalized as λ = Pf/ρrgz) account for the extreme weakness of thrust faults, since effective friction μf∗=μf(1 −λ). Taiwan <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> are dominated by disequilibrium compaction, showing fully compacted sediments with hydrostatic <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> at shallow depths until the fluid-retention depth zFRD ≈  3  km, below which sediments are increasingly undercompacted and overpressured. The Hubbert–Rubey fault weakening coefficient is a simple function of depth (1  − λ)  ≈  0. 6 zFRD/z. We map present-day and pre-erosion <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> and weakening (1  − λ) regionally and show that active thrusts are too shallow relative to zFRD for the classic Hubbert–Rubey mechanism to be important, which requires z ≥ ∼ 4 zFRD ≈  12  km to have the required order-of-magnitude Hubbert–Rubey fault weakening of (1  − λ)  ≤ ∼ 0. 15. The best-characterized thrust is the Chelungpu fault that slipped in the 1999 (Mw =  7. 6) Chi-Chi earthquake, which has a low effective friction μf∗≈ 0. 08 – 0. 12, yet lies near {{the base of the}} hydrostatic zone at depths of 1 – 5  km with a modest Hubbert–Rubey weakening of (1  − λ)  ≈  0. 4 − 0. 6.

These complementary methods of pore pressure generation act on potential basal failure planes, decreasing effective stresses and consequently decreasing frictional resistance to failure. The twin agents of pore pressure generation provide a rational and quantifiable means of initiating and sustaining flank instability, even as the driving forces provided by magma pressurization ultimately drop as flank displacement is initiated, Pore pressures developed by mechanical and thermal effects are readily evaluated using simple, but mechanistically rigorous, models. Mechanically induced pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> are evaluated through an analogy with a moving line dislocation within a saturated porous-elastic medium.

25|$|A forging press, {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure</b> and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity.

25|$|After deposition, {{physical}} processes can deform the sediment, producing a third class of secondary structures. Density contrasts between different sedimentary layers, such as between sand and clay, {{can result in}} flame structures or load casts, formed by inverted diapirism.

Clay can be easily compressed as a result of dehydration, while sand retains the same volume and becomes relatively less dense. On the other hand, when the pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure</b> in a sand layer surpasses a critical point, the sand can break through overlying clay layers and flow through, forming discordant bodies of sedimentary rock called sedimentary dykes. The same process can form mud volcanoes on the surface where they broke through upper layers.|$|E

25|$|Secondary {{headaches}} {{are classified}} {{based on their}} cause and not on their symptoms. According to the ICHD-2 classification, the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury, intracranial hematoma, post craniotomy or other head or neck injury. Headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage, vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches. This type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders. Other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>pressure,</b> non-infectious inflammatory disease, intracranial neoplasm, epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system. ICHD-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well. This type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances. HIV/AIDS, intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches. The ICHD-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders {{in the category of}} secondary headaches. This means that headaches caused by dialysis, high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches. Secondary headaches, according to the same classification system, can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth, jaws, or temporomandibular joint. Headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh-quality 3 D seismic and {{borehole}} {{data in the}} Broad Fourteens Basin, Southern North Sea, is used {{to investigate}} newly recognised concentric faults formed in salt-withdrawal basins flanking reactivated salt structures. Throw-depth and throw-distance plots were used to understand the growth histories of individual faults. As a result, three families of concentric faults are identified: a) intra-seal faults within a salt-withdrawal basin, b) faults connecting the seal and the reservoir {{on the crest of}} an inverted anticline, c) raft-bounding faults propagating into reservoir units. They have moved obliquely and show normal throws, even though they formed during a period of regional compression. Faults in the salt-withdrawal basin and on the inverted anticline are highly segmented, increasing the chances of compartmentalisation or localised fluid flow through fault linkages. Slip tendency analysis was carried out on the distinct fault families to compare the likelihood of slip along a fault at different pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> and within different lithologies. Our results show that sections of the faults are optimally oriented with regards to maximum horizontal stresses (σHmax), increasing the slip tendency. The identified faults cut through a variety of lithologies, allowing different values of pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> to build up before faults reactivate. Within the Vlieland Sandstones, pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> of 30 MPa are not sufficient to reactivate pre-existing faults, whereas in the deeper Posidonia Shales faults might reactivate at pore <b>fluid</b> <b>pressures</b> of 25 MPa.

Heterogeneity in slip tendency along concentric faults, and high degrees of fault segmentation, present serious hazards when injecting CO 2 into the subsurface.
