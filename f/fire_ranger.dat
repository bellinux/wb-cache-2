25|$|Webb {{was born}} in Detroit in 1905 and grew up there and in a Quaker {{community}} in Ontario. From 19241929 {{he worked as a}} bank teller and clerk at a brokerage firm in Detroit; in another account, he was a successful stockbroker during the 1920s but lost his earnings during the Crash before the Depression. During the Depression beginning in 1929, he moved to California and worked as a prospector and earned a meager living. During these years he also worked as a <b>fire</b> <b>ranger</b> for the United States Forestry Service. Webb reportedly wrote short stories which were unpublished. After 1934, Webb returned to Detroit and worked for the automobile manufacturer Chrysler in their export division. In 1937, he visited a friend in Panama in search of gold, but had little success. But in Panama, he brought along a camera donated by his former employer, Chrysler.|$|E
25|$|The North Channel naval duel was in {{some respects}} a {{small-scale}} dress-rehearsal, in reverse, for Jones's 1779 battle with HMS Serapis. Drake had been built as a merchant ship with defensive capability, and bought by the Royal Navy to help fill the gap left when many ships had {{to be sent to}} America; even the 20 four-pound guns were not official Navy issue, but her armament as a merchant vessel. The hull was the wrong shape for rapid battle manoeuvres, and not designed to resist cannon <b>fire.</b> <b>Ranger</b> had been built as a fighting ship, and modified by Jones for maximum efficiency: for example, although there were ports for 20 guns, he found it safest to install only 18 six-pound guns. That made for a total broadside weight of 54 pounds, slightly more than Drake 40 pounds total. However, those dozens of Irish volunteers meant that if Drake could grapple and board Ranger the Americans would be in trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1913, Thomson {{annually}} {{stayed in}} Algonquin Park {{from the spring}} until the autumn, often working as a guide while also fishing and painting for his own pleasure. In 1916, he also worked in the Park as a <b>fire</b> <b>ranger.</b> It was there, on Grand Lake with the hills near Carcajou Bay in the background, that Thomson made the oil sketch in 1916 that he would use for the final painting in 1917. There are numerous other paintings by Thomson with compositions {{similar to that of}} The Jack Pine: in fact, the majority of Thomson's canvasses depict the far side of a shore. [...] These include Northern Lake (1912–13), his first; Pine Island, Georgian Bay (1914–16; pictured); and more famously, The West Wind (1917), another painting of iconic status.|$|E

In the second season he appears solely as Smokey Bear. Overall, Frommer appeared in 52 episodes in rather minor mainly non-speaking roles.|$|R

50|$|Following {{the worst}} forest fires in Israel’s history which burned {{areas of the}} Carmel Mountain Range {{near the city of}} Haifa in December 2010, Music for Relief contributed to partner Jewish National Fund for reforestation.

With Music for Relief's support, Jewish National Fund began re-planting in select areas where regeneration failed to occur. Music for Relief’s contribution funds the planting of 1,100 trees as a part of Operation Carmel Renewal: From Black to Green.|$|R
2500|$|Pohebits-quasho ("Iron Jacket")'s death {{came when}} he {{repeatedly}} rode down the line of <b>firing</b> <b>Rangers</b> and Tonkawa, taunting them. Many historians believe the mail that protected him from light weapons fire simply {{was not able to}} protect him from the buffalo gun used by Tonkawa Jim Pockmark which killed him or, as Ford records, [...] "six rifle shots rang on the air". In any event, the death of their legendary chief discouraged his warriors, and only the timely intervention of his son, Peta Nocona, and his warriors, saved Pohebits-quasho's village. As it was, his body could not be recovered, and was scalped, and partially eaten by the cannibal Tonkawas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{preceding}} summer {{had been}} unusually hot and dry. <b>Fire</b> <b>rangers,</b> anticipating the upcoming [...] "burn" [...] season, had requested {{to stay in}} the area but were not granted permission. They left {{at the end of the}} fire season in mid September, leaving the area without fire protection services. In the fall when burning permits were no longer required, farmers and settlers started to set small brush fires to clear the land. Dry conditions had persisted past the usual [...] "burn" [...] season and on October 4, the wind turned into hurricane-force gales, fanning the flames out of control and combining the brush fires into one large inferno.|$|R
5000|$|No fire {{suppression}} efforts were {{directed at the}} fire. Fire crews were spread thin because of numerous blazes in B.C., the Yukon Territory and Alberta. At the time, the Alberta forestry department's policy was to respond only to fires within 15 km of settlements and major roads. [...] A request by the <b>fire</b> <b>ranger</b> at Keg River to fight the fire with a ground crew was denied by provincial fire managers. According to Tymstra, the Chinchaga fire changed the way Alberta responded to forest fires.|$|E

5000|$|Abbey {{dedicated}} {{the book}} to his second wife Judy, who had died of acute leukemia just before publication of the novel. Because Judy had {{spent some time with}} Abbey when he worked as a <b>fire</b> <b>ranger,</b> some readers naturally believe the book is based on their relationship. However, according to James M. Cahalan's Edward Abbey: A Life, the character of Sandy MacKenzie was actually based on a woman Abbey had an affair with in 1963. His first draft of this book was completed in 1968, two years before Judy's death. Calhalan writes: [...] "... it was a bone of contention in their marriage. He reported on March 17, 1968, that Judy hated it, 'thinking it the story of one of my old love affairs, which in a way it is, but only in a greatly altered and much exaggerated way. If only she understood that there's nothing deader than a dead romance.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Thomas John [...] "Tom" [...] Thomson {{was born}} near Claremont, Ontario to John and Margaret Thomson {{and grew up}} in Leith, Ontario, near Owen Sound in the Municipality of Meaford. In 1899, he entered a machine shop {{apprenticeship}} at an iron foundry owned by William Kennedy, a close friend of his father. He was fired from his apprenticeship by a foreman who complained of Thomson's habitual tardiness. Also in 1899, he volunteered to fight in the Second Boer War, but was turned down because of a medical condition. Thomson was reputed to have been refused entry into the Canadian Expeditionary Force for service in the First World War also. He served as a <b>fire</b> <b>ranger</b> in Algonquin Park during this time. In 1901, he enrolled in a business college in Chatham, Ontario, but dropped out eight months later to join his older brother, George Thomson, who was operating a business school in Seattle. [...] There he met and had a brief summer romance with Alice Elinor Lambert. In 1904, he returned to Canada, and may have studied with William Cruikshank, 1905-1906. Settling in Toronto, Thomson joined Legg Brothers, a photo-engraving firm. In late 1908/early 1909, Thomson joined Grip Ltd., an artistic design firm in Toronto, where several of the future members of the Group of Seven also worked. In fall 1912, Thomson left Grip with several other designers to work at another Toronto firm, Rous & Mann.|$|E

The Commissioner changes his mind and instead promotes Ranger Smith, who decides to let Yogi stay at Jellystone; to thank Ranger Smith for believing, the Easter Bunny gives him what he asked for all these years: a double-decker raspberry-filled dark chocolate egg.|$|R

40|$|Lead contamination, <b>Firing</b> <b>rangers</b> Abstract: In this document, {{the major}} factors {{influencing}} the specification, partitioning, and fate {{of lead in}} the natural environment are examined. Data providing the concentrations of three metals in the soils and vegetation {{in the vicinity of}} a small arms range was obtained and analyzed. The observed lead concentrations exceeded 6000 ppm in the soil near the base of an impact berm at the range. The soil lead content was found to decline, although not uniformly, with distance from the berm. However, soil lead levels of almost 2000 ppm and greater than 100 ppm were found at distance of more than 100 feet and 200 feet from the berm, respectively. The concentrations of the other metals, copper and zinc were not comparable to lead and did not warrant detailed analysis[URL]...|$|R
