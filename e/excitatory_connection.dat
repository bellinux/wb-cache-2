40|$|The {{strength}} of synaptic connections fundamentally determines how neurons influence each other's firing. <b>Excitatory</b> <b>connection</b> amplitudes between pairs of cortical neurons vary over two orders of magnitude, comprising only very few strong connections among many weaker ones. Although this highly skewed distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its functional significance remains unknown: {{it is not}} clear how connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs contribute to information processing in local microcircuits.

Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure. Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity.

30|$|In summary, {{we studied}} {{a family of}} {{balanced}} excitatory–inhibitory firing rate networks that satisfy Dale’s law for arbitrary network size N. When there is no variance in synaptic connections—each <b>excitatory</b> <b>connection</b> has strength μ_E/√(N), and each inhibitory connection has strength μ_I/√(N)—we find a family of deterministic solutions whose existence can be inferred from the underlying symmetry structure of the network. These solutions persist in the dynamics of networks with quenched variability—that is, variance in the connection strengths— even when the variance is large enough that the envelope of the spectrum of the connectivity matrix approaches that of a Gaussian matrix. This offers a striking example in which linear stability theory is not useful in predicting transitions between dynamical regimes. Given the increasing interest in network science and, in particular, networked dynamical systems, such observations concerning the impact of symmetry of connectivity can be extremely valuable for studying stability, bifurcations, and reduced-order models.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Two {{groups of}} interneurons, Tr 1 and DRI, have been {{identified}} in the escape swim circuit of the marine mollusc Tritonia diomedea that have important roles in behavioral initiation. DRI functions as a command neuron, receiving direct excitatory input from the afferent neurons, and in turn directly exciting the DSI neurons of the central pattern generator. DRI fires throughout the swim motor program, and activity in DRI is both necessary and sufficient for sensory input to elicit the swim motor program. Tr 1 is an excitatory interneuron that fires briefly in response to sensory input and then remains silent during the motor program. Tr 1 excites DRI with an <b>excitatory</b> <b>connection</b> that has fast and slow components and thus appears to have a role in converting brief afferent neuron activity to long-lasting firing in downstream circuit elements. These neurons complete the description of a continuous synaptic pathway from afferent to flexion neurons in the Tritonia swim circuit.

To examine the suprathreshold perception of moving patterns, we measured the perceived contrast of a moving grating while the direction and speed of the surround patterns varied. Subjects matched the apparent contrast of a center patch embedded in surround patches {{to that of a}} patch with no surround pattern. Temporal frequency, Michelson contrast and movement direction of both center and surround patterns varied systematically. We found that: (1) contrast reduction is most prominent when the center and surround have the same velocity (velocity selectivity); (2) contrast enhancement occurs when the surround moves at a higher speed than the center, if the difference in temporal frequencies of center and surround exceeds 10 – 20, independent of the directional relationship between center and surround; (3) contrast reduction is stronger for higher surround contrasts with lower center contrasts; and (4) contrast enhancement is relatively unaffected by center and surround contrasts. We conclude that the contrast perception of moving patterns is influenced by directionally-selective mechanisms except at high temporal frequencies. Our results further suggest that there is not only the lateral inhibition often assumed to influence contrast gain control, but also an <b>excitatory</b> <b>connection</b> between motion encoding units...|$|E

Stimulation of behaviorally confirmed self-stimulation sites in lateral hypothalamus evoked short-latency (2 and 4 msec) excitation of 88 % of the NGC units in the first category and only 15 % in the second.

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} (BG), which {{influence}} cortical activity via the thalamus, {{play a major}} role in motor activity, learning and memory, sensory processing, and many aspects of behavior. The substantia nigra (SN) consists of GABAergic neurons of the pars reticulata that inhibit thalamic neurons and provide the primary output of the BG, and dopaminergic neurons of the pars compacta that modulate thalamic excitability. Little is knownabout the functional properties of the SN 3 thalamus synapses, and anatomical characterizationhas been controversial. Here we use a combination of anatomical, electrophysiological, genetic, and optogenetic approaches to re-examine these synaptic connections inmice. We find thatneurons in theSN inhibit neurons in the ventroposterolateral nucleusof the thalamusvia GABAergic synapses, excite neurons in the thalamic nucleus reticularis, and both excite and inhibit neuronswithin the posterior nucleus group. Glutamatergic SN neurons express the vesicular glutamate receptor transporter vGluT 2 and receive inhibitory synapses from striatal neurons, andmany also express tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, in addition to providing inhib-itory outputs, which is consistent with the canonical circuit, the SN provides glutamatergic outputs that differentially target thalamic nuclei. This suggests that an increase in the activity of glutamatergic neurons in the SN allows the BG to directly excite neurons in specific thalamic nuclei. Elucidating an <b>excitatory</b> <b>connection</b> between the BG and the thalamus provides new insights into how the BG regulate thalamic activity, and has important implications for understanding BG function in health and disease.

Connections between layer 4 excitatory cells involve excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) averaging 949 μV, with an average coefficient of variation of 0. 21 (n = 30).

The most frequently found feature (65 / 84 = 77 %) was a central peak, straddling the origin and representing a source of common synaptic input to both cells. One third of these also had superimposed lagged peaks, indicative of a serial <b>excitatory</b> <b>connection.</b> Pure lagged peaks and lagged troughs, indicative of serial excitatory or inhibitory linkages, respectively, both occurred in 5 % of the correlograms with features.

Plotting the strength of synaptic interaction against response similarity during alternating wrist torques revealed a positive relationship for the correlated cell pairs. A linear fit yielded a positive slope: the pairs with excitatory interactions tended to covary more often than countervary. This linear fit had a positive offset, reflecting a tendency for both covarying and countervarying cells to have excitatory common input.
