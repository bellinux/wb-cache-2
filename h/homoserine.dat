25|$|When {{methionine}} {{is followed}} by serine or threonine, side reactions can occur that destroy the methionine without peptide bond cleavage. Normally, once the iminolactone is formed (refer to figure), water and acid can react with the imine to cleave the peptide bond, forming a <b>homoserine</b> lactone and new C-terminal peptide. However, if the adjacent amino acid to methionine has a hydroxyl or sulfhydryl group, this group can react with the imine to form a <b>homoserine</b> without peptide bond cleavage. These two cases are shown in the figure.|$|E
25|$|During surface {{colonization}} bacteria {{cells are}} able to communicate using quorum sensing (QS) products such as N-acyl <b>homoserine</b> lactone (AHL).

In addition to the polysaccharides, these matrices may also contain material from the surrounding environment, including but not limited to minerals, soil particles, and blood components, such as erythrocytes and fibrin.

2500|$|The lolines are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} pyrrolizidine alkaloids produced by many plants, notably the necine ring containing a tertiary amine. This {{led to the}} early hypothesis that the biosynthesis of the lolines {{is similar to that}} of the plant pyrrolizidines, which are synthesized from polyamines. However, feeding studies with carbon isotope–labeled amino acids or related molecules in pure cultures of the loline-producing fungus N. uncinatum recently demonstrated that the loline alkaloid pathway is fundamentally different from that of the plant pyrrolizidines. The basic loline chemical structure is assembled in several biosynthetic steps from the amino acid precursors, L-proline and [...] L-homoserine. In the proposed first step in loline biosynthesis, these two amino acids are coupled in a condensation reaction linking the γ-carbon in <b>homoserine</b> to the secondary amine in proline in a PLP–type enzyme–catalyzed reaction to form the loline intermediate, N-(3-amino-3-carboxy)propylproline (NACPP). Further steps in loline biosynthesis are thought to proceed with sequential PLP-enzyme-catalyzed and oxidative decarboxylations of the carboxy groups in the <b>homoserine</b> and proline moieties, respectively, cyclization to form the core loline ring structure, and oxidation of the C-2 and C-7 carbons to give the oxygen bridge spanning the two pyrrolizidine rings.|$|E
