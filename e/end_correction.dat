40|$|The {{concept of}} microperforated noise control {{treatments}} {{was introduced by}} Maa 1975; in that theory, the transfer impedance of the microperforated layer was calculated based on oscillatory viscous flow within a small cylinder combined with resistive and reactive <b>end</b> <b>corrections.</b> Initially, microperforated materials were the subject of mostly academic study since practical implementations were rare owing {{to the cost of}} manufacturing the materials with acceptable accuracy. However, recently, new manufacturing procedures have dramatically lowered the cost of these materials, and perhaps as a result, there has been renewed interest in studying their properties. Since 1975, Maa’s original theory has been widely used to predict the performance of microperforated materials. However, in principal, that theory can only be used to describe cylindrical perforation, while in practice, perforations are rarely cylindrical. In addition, there have been questions about the dependence of <b>end</b> <b>corrections</b> on frequency, and on the effect of coupling between the motion of the fluid in the perforations and the solid sheet in which they are formed. Additionally, in his original paper, Maa drew a distinction between the dissipative properties of thermally conducting and adiabatic materials.

30|$|The goal of {{this stage}} is to {{construct}} a harmonic series that represents the solo instrument and {{that is consistent with}} the tone objects found in the previous stage.

(2) The acoustic differences between the voice, string, and wind instruments need to be considered when harmonic components are located. Namely, inharmonicity characteristics differ between instrument families. A well known characteristic of conical bore instruments, for example, is the flattening of upper resonances in relation to the fundamental component due to open <b>end</b> <b>corrections</b> in the tone hole lattice [27]. In contrast, string instruments experience inharmonicty patterns that deviate to the higher end of the calculated harmonic location [28].
