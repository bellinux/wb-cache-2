40|$|In this study, {{a musical}} {{approach}} {{to provide an}} automatic heart disease detection system is proposed. Heart sounds are recorded with <b>audio</b> <b>format.</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>files</b> are converted to semi-structured music files that can be represented textually. Samples were captured from different heart diseases and were stored in a database. Two different approaches which are information retrieval based on n-gram and longest common subsequence are used to retrieve the similarity of a given sample with existing heart diseases in the database. Since the frequency of heart sound is relative to age and physical characteristics of a patient, an important feature of using n-gram {{in this study is}} to retrieve diseases without respect to the different heart sounds frequencies. The effects of window sizes for n-gram approach on the accuracy of the information retrieval were tested and a proper window size was extracted. The results of the performed experiments showed that window size of 5 notes revealed a high performance in comparison with other window sizes. Hence, the proposed technique can detect and recognize a heart disease with a reliable accuracy. Average of precision values for around 85 % in information retrieval and 55 % in longest common subsequence technique were obtained for the retrieval of heart sound categories. Moreover, the results of string matching technique demonstrated that threshold level of 65 % could appropriately detect heart disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. The aim of the DyViS database {{is to provide a}} database of 100 speakers of similar age and with the same accent, primarily with a view to studying variation in personal voice characteristics untrammelled by accent variation. Such a resource has applications in forensic phonetic research, but will also be useful for studying many linguistic aspects of speech. The speakers are all male, aged between 18 and 25 years, and selected as speakers with Standard Southern British English (SSBE) pronunciation. In order to elicit some of the range of variation a voice may exhibit, the speakers were recorded doing four tasks. In the first, they took part in a simulated police interview based on a crime, the details of which were supplied to them as they were interviewed. Some of the information, being incriminating within the imaginary scenario, had to be denied. In the second, the speaker engaged in a telephone conversation with an 'accomplice'. Both these tasks provide extensive examples of spontaneous conversation. The telephone call was recorded simultaneously direct and over a landline, allowing acoustic comparisons to be made. Speakers also read a text, and sentences containing target words. A subset of 20 returned over a month later to re-record non-contemporaneous versions of the reading tasks. Further information about the project may be found on the ESRC Dynamic variability in speech: a forensic phonetic study of British English award webpage and on the DyVis project website.
