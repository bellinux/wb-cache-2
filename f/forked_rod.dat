5000|$|The usual {{solution}} for high-performance aero-engines is a [...] "forked" [...] connecting rod. One rod is {{split in two}} at the big end {{and the other is}} thinned to fit into this fork. The journal is still shared between cylinders. The Rolls-Royce Merlin used this [...] "fork-and-blade" [...] style. A common arrangement for <b>forked</b> <b>rods</b> is for the <b>fork</b> <b>rod</b> to have a single wide bearing sleeve that spans the whole width of the rod, including the central gap. The blade rod then runs, not directly on the crankpin, but on the outside of this sleeve. The two rods do not rotate relative to each other, merely oscillate back and forth, so this bearing is relatively lightly loaded and runs as a much lower surface speed. However the bearing movement also becomes reciprocating rather than continuously rotating, which is a more difficult problem for lubrication.|$|R

5000|$|The Martin {{engine was}} an all-alloy V8 {{with a single}} {{overhead}} camshaft (SOHC) per bank driven by a toothed-belt (originally Gilmer belt - see also Timing belt). Designed for the new 3-litre limit announced for the 1966 Formula One season, it weighed just [...] with ancillaries and produced @7000 rpm. An unusual feature of the Martin V8 was that four of the connecting rods were forked at the big end, much like those on the Rolls Royce Merlin engine. The connecting rod for the opposing cylinder bore fit into the gap of the <b>forked</b> <b>rod.</b> This meant that the cylinder banks were not offset on the crank-line, reducing overall engine length. The engine {{was used in the}} Pearce-Martin F1 car as well as the Lucas-Martin, a modified Lotus 35 Formula 2 frame that was run briefly in Formula One. It also appeared in 2.8-litre form in some specials, including some of Lawrence's own Deep Sanderson sports and racing cars.|$|E

Spring-operated valve gear was used to minimise the weight of the flywheel, overcoming one of the drawbacks of industrial steam engines.|$|R
50|$|The engine had {{a single}} {{horizontal}} cylinder which, along with the boiler and firebox, was placed behind the rear axle. The motion of the piston was transmitted to a separate crankshaft via the <b>forked</b> piston <b>rod.</b> The crankshaft drove the axle of the driving wheel (which was fitted with a flywheel) via a spur gear. The steam cocks (used to blow out water condensate from the steam chest), the force pump and the firebox bellows were also driven by the crankshaft.|$|R

In other parts of England the technique was used in Elizabeth's royal mines for calamine and by 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales.

Lawrence had heard that Rolls-Royce had recently idled one of their production facilities due to the loss of a contract and might be interested in taking on the Martin V8 project. Lawrence met with representatives from Rolls-Royce, who were fascinated by the small size of the Martin V8 and intrigued by the <b>forked</b> connecting <b>rods</b> so reminiscent of those in the Rolls-Royce's own Merlin. Unfortunately for Lawrence, Rolls-Royce landed another defense contract which would need the previously idled plant and bowed out of negotiations. Lawrence went back to Coventry-Victor.|$|R

50|$|Koreyvo, Jumo and Napier Deltic engines {{used one}} piston per {{cylinder}} to expose an intake port, {{and the other}} to expose an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this regard.

In the Jumo 205 and its variants, the upper crankshaft serves the exhaust pistons, and the lower crankshaft the intake pistons. In designs using multiple cylinder banks, such as the Junkers Jumo 223 and the Deltic, each big end bearing serves one inlet and one exhaust piston, using a <b>forked</b> connecting <b>rod</b> for the exhaust piston.|$|R

50|$|His {{sewing machine}} used the chain stitch method, {{in which the}} machine uses a single thread to make simple {{stitches}} in the fabric. A stitching awl would pierce the material and a <b>forked</b> point <b>rod</b> would carry the thread through the hole {{where it would be}} hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, locking the stitch. Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including saddles and bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the London Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the London Science Museum.|$|R

5000|$|After {{that the}} only [...] "true" [...] AJS models, as far as AJS enthusiasts were concerned, were the racing 7Rs, Porcupines and the pre-war AJS Four. The shared models were {{considered}} by some AJS fans to be only badge-engineered Matchless models. In 1935 the Matchless/AJS hairpin valve springs made their first appearance. Matchless supplied engines for the V-twin versions of the Morgan three-wheeler from 1933 until Morgan production was halted by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. From 1935 on they were Morgan's exclusive supplier of V-twin engines. A dozen surviving unused engines were still in storage at the Morgan works in 1946 and were used to build a final batch of V-Twin trikes for a Morgan dealer in Australia. Matchless also supplied engines after 1935 to 1940 to the Brough Superior works. These engines {{were made to the}} specifications of Brough Superior and are not identical to similar engines used in Matchless motorcycles. The Brough Superior engines used a <b>fork</b> and blade <b>rod</b> configuration, cams ground to different specification, and larger ports in the cylinders or heads.|$|R
5000|$|Encouraged by this success, Bert Greeves {{decided to}} diversify into {{motorcycle}} manufacture. A keen trials rider {{in his spare}} time, he had started collecting veteran and vintage motorcycles, including a 1912 Triumph with the registration 'OLD 1'. His disabled cousin Derry Preston-Cobb also encouraged him to start the motorcycle business. Derry's own Invacar {{was used as a}} promotional vehicle and had been fitted with a more powerful engine, which he used to amazed other drivers as he overtook them on the Southend roads. [...] Working together they developed a prototype using a two-stroke [...] single-cylinder engine sourced from Villiers Engineering - and a Greeves badge on the fuel tank. The motorcycles were really a sideline for the main business of producing the three-wheeled invalid cars, so development of the prototypes had to be fitted in when the production schedule allowed. Bert had been an enthusiastic motorcyclist in his youth and always had an ambition to become a motorcycle manufacturer. The first Greeves motorcycle was developed in mid-1951, using rubber-in-torsion springing at both front and rear. This unconventional rubber springing came straight from the patented system used for the invalid car. Rear wheel suspension was by a pivoted <b>fork</b> with <b>rods</b> connecting to torsion rubber mounted units just below the seat. Friction dampers were also fitted which could be manually adjusted. [...] The front forks were also unusual, with short leading links to carry the wheel, pivoting on rubber-in-torsion spring units (later known as the 'Banana Leading Link' front fork. Motorcycle production began in the autumn of 1953 and the new models featured a unique frame with the steering head and a massive front down member combined in a large 'I-section' cast alloy beam, cast in a new light-alloy foundry that had been added to the Greeves factory. The tubular frame member was inserted into a mould and the main frame was cast around it, making for a very strong frame. Made from LM6 silicon-aluminium alloy, it was claimed to be stronger than tubular steel and proved capable of standing up to the rough treatment of international off road trials competition. Protection was finished off with reinforced engine cradle plates which were also light alloy castings.|$|R

Dowsers claim that the dowsing device will respond to any buried anomalies, and years of practice are needed to use the device with discrimination (the ability to cause the device to respond to only those materials being sought). Modern dowsers have been developing various new methods to add discrimination to their devices. These new methods include molecular frequency discrimination (MFD) and harmonic induction discrimination (HID). MFD has taken the form of everything from placing a xerox copy of a Polaroid photograph of the desired material into the handle of the device, to using dowsing rods in conjunction with frequency generation electronics (function generators). None of these attempts to create devices that can detect specific materials such as explosives (or any materials for that matter) have been proven successful in controlled double-blind scientific tests. In fact, all testing of these inventions has shown these devices to perform no better than random chance...." ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{something}} remarkable, and not flattering to human sagacity, in the periodical resurrection of superstitions. Houses, for example, go on being 'haunted' in country districts, and no educated man notices the circumstance. Then comes {{a case like}} that of the Drummer of Tedworth, or the Cock Lane Ghost, and society is deeply moved, philosophers plunge into controversy, and he who grubs among the dusty tracts of the past finds a world of fugitive literature on forgotten bogies. Chairs move untouched by human hands, and tables walk about in lonely castles of Savoy, and no one marks them, till a day comes when the furniture of some American cottage is similarly afflicted, and then a shoddy new religion is based on the phenomenon. The latest revival among old beliefs is faith in the divining rod. 'Our liberal shepherds give it a shorter name,' and so do our conservative peasants, calling the 'rod of Jacob' the 'twig.' To 'work the twig' is rural English for the craft of Dousterswivel in the 'Antiquary,' and perhaps from this comes our slang expression to 'twig,' or divine, the hidden meaning of another. Recent correspondence in the newspapers has proved that, whatever may be the truth about the 'twig,' belief in its powers is still very prevalent. Respectable people are not ashamed to bear signed witness of its miraculous powers of detecting springs of water and secret mines. It is habitually used by the miners in the Mendips, as Mr. Woodward found ten years ago; and <b>forked</b> hazel divining <b>rods</b> from the Mendips are a recognised part of ethnological collections. There are two ways of investigating the facts or fancies about the rod.
