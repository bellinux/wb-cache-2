40|$|Carlsson and van Damme (1991, 93) {{presented}} {{a notion of}} a global game, which is an incomplete information game where the actual payoff structure is affected by a realization of a common shock and where each player <b>gets</b> <b>noisy</b> private information of the shock. For n -person symmetric games with two possible actions characterized by strategic complementarity, they showed that equilibrium play in a global game with vanishing noise is uniquely determined. The concept of global games is important {{not only as a}} theory of the most refined notion of equilibrium but also as a theory of coordination failures under private information. From this viewpoint, this paper makes the theory of global games more general and more applicable to such problems. The implications of the theory of global games are investigated in two specific models: a peculative attack model and a network externality model. It is shown that both the monetary authority in the speculative attack model and the central planner in the network externality model will prefer the equilibrium in a global game with small noise to the worst equilibrium in the corresponding complete information game. Therefore, they will welcome the existence of small noise, if they apply mini-max principle to multiple equilibrium problems. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{increase}} in the likelihood of alternative hypotheses in the MDT system under noisy conditions also causes the MC MDT system with GD to run about 2.5 times slower than under clean conditions (row 3 of Table 4 versus row 3 of Table 5). As the data <b>get</b> <b>noisier,</b> the imputation becomes less constrained, since the number of unreliable components increases and the bounds outlined in Section 2.1 become less strict. Hence, the dynamic range of the BG likelihoods will decrease, such that the hypothesis likelihoods will show smaller differences, causing pruning to be less effective. Additionally, the system is slowed down with increasing noise levels because more spectro-temporal regions are labeled as unreliable and the complexity of imputation for CGs and CCGs increases.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-Transformation {{of digital}} image becomes a major method of {{communication}} in the modern age, but the image obtained after transmission the data tends to <b>get</b> <b>noisy</b> and thereby the further processing {{does not lead to}} good results. Hence, Pre processing of an image is very essential. The pre processing being worked upon is the denoising of images. The received image needs processing before it can be used in applications. Image denoising involves the manipulation of the image data to produce a high quality image and wavelet transforms have been applied. For denoising the image different noise models including Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise and speckle noise. Selection of the denoising algorithm is application dependent. In this paper, a comparative analysis of different combinations of the suggested threshold values and thresholding techniques has been carried out very efficiently. This has been done in order to find more possible combinations that can lead to the best denoising technique and compare the results in term of PSNR and MSE...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{stochastic}} approximation (SA) based distributed {{algorithm is}} proposed to solve the resource allocation (RA) with uncertainties. In this problem, a group of agents cooperatively optimize a separable optimization problem with a linear network resource constraint and allocation feasibility constraints, where the global objective function {{is the sum of}} agents' local objective functions. Each agent can only <b>get</b> <b>noisy</b> observations of its local function's gradient and its local resource, which cannot be shared by other agents or transmitted to a center. Moreover, there are communication uncertainties such as time-varying topologies (described by random graphs) and additive channel noises. To solve the RA, we propose an SA-based distributed algorithm, and prove that agents can collaboratively achieve the optimal allocation with probability one by virtue of ordinary differential equation (ODE) method for SA. Finally, simulations related to the demand response management in power systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

30|$|Figures 4 and 6 {{reveal that}} {{for both the}} {{synthetic}} data and observation, the errors of the two velocities caused by the system noise are about constants (i.e. the amplification factor independent), while those by the natural background noise are generally proportional to the amplification factors. Note that the received signal {{is the product of}} transmitted power (modulated by the system) and the atmospheric medium (wave packet with natural background noise). It is clear that when the natural background is <b>getting</b> <b>noisy,</b> the associated random noise fluctuation starts growing, even competing with the wave packet amplitude. Because the natural background noise is a random function of space and time, the phase relationships between the adjacent altitudes are disturbed and become less correlated, which results in the errors of the two velocities increasing with the amplification factor of natural noise accordingly. On the other hand, the system noise is simply a random function of time, and therefore the transmitted power together with its noise gives an equal weighting to each altitude, which preserves the phase relationships along the altitude. Therefore, the errors of the two velocities remain about constants and not functions of the amplification factor of the system noise.|$|R
30|$|More particularly, {{for this}} study two source {{configurations}} were considered. In the first configuration, we considered a single patch, made of 100 contiguous triangles (approximately 5 cm²) located in the left superior temporal gyrus. In the second configurations, two patches of 100 triangles each were located in the left superior temporal and left inferior parietal regions, respectively. Activities of dipoles within the patches were highly correlated whereas activities between patches were set uncorrelated. For each source configuration, 50 realizations of spike simulations were generated. These signals corresponded to “clean data”. In order to generate noisy EEG simulations, 50 epochs of EEG muscle activity were extracted from real 32 -channel EEG data.

40|$|Abstract — Automated face {{annotation}} aims {{to automatically}} detect human faces from a photo and further name the faces with the corresponding human names. Most {{of the images}} are obtained from World Wide Web (WWW), so there is possibility of <b>getting</b> <b>noisy</b> and incomplete images. This study tackle problem by investigating a search-based face annotation (SBFA) paradigm for mining large amounts of facial images. Given a query facial image for annotation, the idea of SBFA is to first search for top-n similar facial images from facial image database and then exploits these top-ranked similar facial images and their weak labels for naming the query facial image. Major challenging task of search based annotation scheme is how to perform effective annotation by exploiting the list of most similar facial images and their weak labels. Unsupervised label refinement (ULR) approach is used for refining the labels of facial images. In this proposed work unsupervised label refinement approach effectively solves the problem of weak labelling. A clustering-based approximation algorithm is proposed to improve the scalability of naming and images. In future it will evaluate a larger database to develop more efficient solutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In Video based Iris Recognition system, Iris {{images are}} {{obtained}} with non-Cooperative situation. In video based system, {{it is time}} consuming to process each video frame for iris segmentation because some video frames may not contain an eye at all. The raw video frames were not processed like the still images. To improve the efficiency of iris recognition system {{it is important to}} process the video frames. Processing of video sequence is more challenging. It requires a robust and accurate method to extract frames that have only iris images. For non-cooperative users there could be many noisy video frames with different quality of iris images. Noisy video frames include blinking eye and blurred frames. In our paper we mainly concentrate on detecting these blink and blurred frames and the results are shown. The results are more accurate than the existing ones. Keywords- Iris images; blinking eye; blurred video frames. The Iris recognition system consists of several steps like image acquisition, image segmentation, normalisation and many more in identifying a person. In the Image acquisition step capturing of iris image is taking place. In video based system the user may not be co-operative to iris camera. For this reason there is always a chance of <b>getting</b> <b>noisy</b> frames. That is while capturing iris imag...|$|R

This was calculated by using the Pearson Regression Coefficient Ratio which was up to 0. 6 for hearing at 1000 Hz. Over 90 % of subjects had raised auditory thresholds in three or more frequencies; this was more marked in the lower frequencies.
