5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{stewards}} elected not to {{take any}} action over the incident between Prost and Heidfeld on the race's 44th lap. Heidfeld believed {{the origins of the}} accident came from both Andretti cars being released under the minimum pit stop time, saying he drove onto the pit lane alongside Félix da Costa and ceded the position to the Andretti driver. He additionally stated that Bird was also involved and remained ahead of him. Prost was resolute that the contact was avoidable had he been given enough space by Heidfeld. He was confident the stewards would agree with his point of view. [...] "I was on the kerb and he did not leave me any room at all when I was at his side", he said. Evans thought after he was hit by Rosenqvist, he could not finish the race and felt his Jaguar would not survive such a collision in a similar scenario. Nevertheless, he was delighted with his first points-scoring finish in the series, saying: [...] "Those first points are always the hardest. We know we've not got the best package but we're making great progress and <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> really proud." [...] Jaguar team principal James Barclay said the incident was the moment when [...] "our hearts sunk". He felt there was no possibility of finishing the race but praised the strength of the Jaguar's monocoque.|$|E

[...] Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister said that the weak agreement was because of distrust between nations: [...] "To meet the climate change challenge, the international community must strengthen confidence, build consensus, make vigorous efforts and enhance co-operation."

In the fall of 2011, during an interview to promote Miss Little Havana, Estefan expressed her views on gay rights and gay marriage and revealed {{that she was a}} strong supporter of both.

2500|$|In the United States, {{the use of}} {{the title}} [...] "Doctor" [...] is {{dependent}} upon the setting. The title is commonly used socially by physicians and those holding doctoral degrees; however, there was formerly a division between Letitia Baldrige and Miss Manners on its social usage by those who are not physicians. Baldrige saw this usage as acceptable, while in contrast, Miss Manners wrote that [...] "only people of the medical profession correctly use the title of doctor socially," [...] but supports those who wish to use it in social contexts in the spirit of addressing people according to their wishes. Miss Manners has since softened her approach, noting in her Washington Post column that there are two approaches: [...] "having been earned, it should be used" [...] and [...] "that level of education being assumed, it need not be expressly mentioned"; while she maintains that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> addressed according to their wishes, she no longer states that only medical professionals use the title correctly but instead acknowledges that the title has been earned by those with Ph.D.s. The Emily Post Institute similarly advises that [...] "Socially as well as professionally, medical doctors, dentists, and other professionals are addressed by, and introduced with, their titles. People who have earned a Ph.D. or any other academic, nonmedical doctoral degree have the choice of whether to use [...] "Dr." [...] both professionally and socially." [...] Other advice columns have also noted that [...] "it has become common to see someone with a Ph.D. addressed on the envelope as Dr., and as a consequence, deviation from convention has become acceptable." [...] Although the usage of the title by Ph.D. graduates has become common, its use socially by holders of professional doctorates (other than physicians) is neither explicitly endorsed nor explicitly discouraged by writers on etiquette. Miss Manners has, however, stated that a physician who has had their license revoked should be addressed by their former preferred honorific (i.e. not according to their M.D. degree). [...] It is unusual for those who hold honorary doctorates to use the title [...] "Doctor".|$|E

No sooner had they moved out, than a crowd of Indians rushed into the fort through the breach and embrasures, and butchered all the wounded who {{had been left behind}} to be cared for by the French. Having committed this atrocity the Indians, and many of the Canadians, rushed up to the intrenched camp, where the English were now collected. The French guards, who had been stationed there, did nothing to keep them out; and they wandered about, threatening and insulting the terrified women, telling the men that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> massacred, and plundering the baggage.|$|E

You must remember that {{a vast number of}} people act quite as much in accordance with what they think other people will do, as with their own convictions. We are all apt to be guided by the opinions of the world; and though it seems hard that the sins of parents should in any degree be visited upon their children, we must remember that children get the benefit the other way. If a boy or a girl's father is a rich and popular man, they will be made more of than when not so situated. Of course this is wrong, and <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> judged by themselves, and no doubt that eventually is the case. Of course if one whom we believed to be a true friend fell away at a time of trial, it would be a proof that his friendship was not a true one; but we must not be surprised if any mere acquaintances go with the stream, whatever its direction may be." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is clear}} that only two methods of {{self-defence}} would have been open to the rain-maker: namely, either to kill Sir Samuel, or to buy his real secret of bottling the lightning, that he might use it for his own ends. The former method--that of killing the man of science--was found more easy in ancient times; the latter in these modern ones. And there have been always those who, too good-natured to kill the scientific man, have patronised knowledge, not for its own sake, but for the use which may be made of it; {{who would like to}} keep a tame man of science, as they would a tame poet, or a tame parrot; who say--Let us have science by all means, but not too much of it. It is a dangerous thing; to be doled out to the world, like medicine, in small and cautious doses. You, the scientific man, will of course freely discover what you choose. Only do not talk too loudly about it: leave that to us. We understand the world, and are meant to guide and govern it. So discover freely: and meanwhile hand over your discoveries to us, that we may instruct and edify the populace with so much of them as we think safe, while we keep our position thereby, and in many cases make much money by your science. Do that, and we will patronise you, applaud you, ask you to our houses; and you shall be clothed in purple and fine linen, and fare sumptuously with us every day. I know not whether these latter are not the worst enemies which science has. They are often such excellent, respectable, orderly, well- meaning persons. They desire so sincerely that <b>everyone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> wise: only not too wise. They are so utterly unaware of the mischief they are doing. They would recoil with horror if they were told they were so many Iscariots, betraying Truth with a kiss.|$|E
