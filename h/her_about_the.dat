5|$|Matilda and Henry {{remained}} childless, {{but neither}} party {{was considered to}} be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church. In early 1122, the couple travelled down the Rhine together as Henry continued to suppress the ongoing political unrest, but by now he was suffering from cancer. His condition worsened and he died on 23 May 1125 in Utrecht, leaving Matilda in the protection of their nephew Frederick, the heir to his estates. Before his death, he left the imperial insignia in the control of Matilda, but it is unclear what instructions he gave <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future of the Empire, which faced another leadership election. Archbishop Adalbert subsequently convinced Matilda that she should give him the insignia, and the Archbishop led the electoral process which appointed Lothair of Supplinburg, a former enemy of Henry, as the new King of the Romans.|$|E

With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E

After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs {{his way through the}} meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the family}} eats breakfast the next morning, Lois reveals her {{intention}} {{to become a}} surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset {{at the thought of}} her being pregnant for nine months.

A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95.

5|$|Ef: The Latter Tale begins {{once again}} with Yuko Amamiya and Yu Himura {{in the middle of}} a reunion in a church during Christmas time.

Like Yuko, Yu also abruptly appears out of nowhere and disappears just as mysteriously. He often gives advice and warnings to Renji and others. Yu is close to Chihiro and takes care of her. After the conclusion of the third chapter, the story goes back to Yuko and Yu with Yu ending his recount of the third chapter, and goes on to talk about how he and Yuko were separated in the past. Yu starts his recount of the events from the fourth chapter. At the end of the fourth chapter, the story shifts one final time back to Yuko and Yu. Up to this point the two have been recounting individual tales to each other. The meaning of the overall title Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two is revealed to be in connection with Yuko and Yu.|$|E

5|$|Iris Crowe is {{the older}} sister of Brother Justin and a devoted {{supporter}} of his ministry duties in California. Iris' {{significance in the}} series starts when Brother Justin informs <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> church board's plan to take away his new ministry. Shortly after, {{a fire in the}} church kills several orphans, but it remains unknown {{until the end of the}} first season that Iris was the arsonist. Radio show host Tommy Dolan, who arrived to help with the arson investigation, develops feelings for Iris, but a romance is hindered by Brother Justin's return from a week-long self-discovery trip. Dolan starts to uncover evidence pointing to Iris's guilt, but a strange twist at Iris's planned public confession results in Dolan's arrest as the culprit. To prevent the revelation of Brother Justin's true nature, Iris murders an innocent Okie, Eleanor. Late in the second season, Iris joins her foster father Norman in an ultimately unsuccessful plot against Brother Justin.|$|E
5|$|Levy {{was last}} seen on May 1, 2001. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report {{that they had not}} heard from their {{daughter}} in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been {{having an affair with a}} U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be U.S. Representative Gary Condit. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.|$|E

However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells <b>her</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E
