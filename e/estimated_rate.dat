Since 2001, the population has grown by 99,500, or 10.1%. Birmingham is the largest local Authority area and city in the UK outside of London.

25|$|The {{cities and}} {{nations that have}} {{invested}} most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita fossil fuel use. The social and economic sustainability of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to The Economist, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an <b>estimated</b> <b>rate</b> of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like Zoom in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries {{in an effort to}} reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand {{the number of people who}} have access to cars.|$|E

25|$|The {{stations}} {{are built on}} the largest area of open shingle in Europe, measuring 12km by 6km, which has been deposited by the sea and built up over thousands of years. The entire area is moving slowly north and east as the sea moves the shingle {{from one side of}} the headland to the other. It is surrounded by a nature reserve Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A fleet of lorries is used to continuously maintain shingle sea defences for the plant as coastal erosion would otherwise move shingle away at an <b>estimated</b> <b>rate</b> of 6 m per year. Around 30,000 cubic metres of shingle are moved each year. It seems that deposition on the north shore of the headland does not keep pace with erosion, although the power {{stations are}} about 1 km to the west of that shore. In all, 90,000 cubic metres are moved each year along parts of the coast between Pett Level and Hythe. This is necessary for the safety of the entire area including the power stations. Around 100 million litres of cooling water are extracted and returned to the sea each hour, after being heated by 12 deg Celsius (22 deg F).|$|E
