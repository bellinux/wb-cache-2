25|$|A garden door {{resembles a}} French window (with lites), but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the {{operating}} door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch {{is located at the}} wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an <b>espagnolette</b> bolt.|$|E
25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or lites) that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An <b>espagnolette</b> bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
50|$|When the reversis is won or broke, the <b>espagnolette</b> pays singly {{for all the}} company. When {{the player}} holding the <b>espagnolette</b> can break the reversis, he is paid by the players whose reversis he broke. If the <b>espagnolette</b> has placed his quinola, {{and there is a}} reverses, either made or broken, he is not to receive the stake, for when the reversis is attempted, the stakes are neither {{received}} nor paid, except by him who undertakes the same. If, by another player having the Ace or King of Hearts, the <b>espagnolette</b> has, in any part of the game, either of his quinolas forced, he pays the stake and his consolation to him who forces, unless there is a reversis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>espagnolette</b> {{is either}} simply four Aces, or three Aces and one quinola, or two Aces and two quinolas. The player {{having one of}} these {{combinations}} {{has the right to}} renounce in every suit, during the whole game, and if he can avoid winning any trick, once there is no reversis, he wins the “party” in preference to the player who is better positioned in the game. But if he is forced to win a trick, he then pays the “party” to the other, and returns the stake he may have received for Aces or quinolas. And if he has a quinola, he must pay the stake to the pool, instead of receiving it. The player having the <b>espagnolette</b> can call for his privilege, and play his game as a common one, but renounces this privilege the moment he has renounced playing in suit. The player of the <b>espagnolette</b> receives the stake in any part of the game, if another player forces the quinola.|$|E

5000|$|A {{player who}} wins the first nine tricks is deemed to have {{undertaken}} the reversis. This obliges him to win the other two or lose the game. If no reversis or <b>espagnolette,</b> was undertaken, each player totals the value of counting cards contained in the tricks he won. The player with fewest wins, the player with most loses.---- ...|$|E
5000|$|An <b>espagnolette</b> is a locking device, {{normally}} {{mounted on}} the vertical frame of a French door or casement window. A handle or knob is connected to a metal rod mounted {{to the surface of}} the frame, at about three or four feet above the floor. Operating the handle rotates the rod, which has hooks at each end that fit into sockets at the head and sill of the opening. This type of lock is often used on a semi-trailer truck to fasten the rear doors. It can be identified by the use of a round bar, instead of a half-round bar used on a crémone bolt.|$|E
5000|$|A {{casement}} {{window is}} a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called [...] "awning window"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash {{or a combination of}} these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash. In the USA, these are usually opened using a crank, but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and <b>espagnolette</b> locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a casement stay. Handing applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.|$|E
50|$|The game of Reversis {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in France in 1601, {{under the name}} Reversin, played with a 52-card pack. Jean-Baptiste Bullet suggested it was invented in the Court of Francis I. Reversis is a subtle game which knew important additions, in particular {{towards the end of}} the 18th century in the form of options. At the 19th century the game, the increasingly popular game of Reversis saw its rules becoming more and more complex with the exclusive use of preceding options making it a high-tension kind of game. It was long thought to be a game of Spanish origin, once a 48-card pack was used, besides its counter-clockwise rotation and the words Quinola, name of a 17th-century Spanish admiral, and <b>Espagnolette,</b> but it more probably originated in Italy where a negative variety of Tressette called Rovescino is still played.|$|E
