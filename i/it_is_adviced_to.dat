40|$|Boars have {{different}} {{roles in the}} reproductive management in pigs. Boar contact can stimulate follicle development and thereby induce oestrus, both in gilts and sows. Boar contact during oestrus is essential for good oestrus expression, which {{is essential for the}} correct timing of insemination and the proper use of boar contact during insemination can stimulate sperm transport and thereby fertilisation. Stimulation by boars clearly has an olfactory component (the boar smell), but can also have an auditory, visual and evn tactile component. The background of the different roles and some of these different components of the boar are discussed. To enable a good farrowing rate and litter size, sows should be inseminated between 0 and 24 h before ovulation. However, {{it is not possible to}} accurately predict the time of ovulation in sows. Although ovulation takes place at a relatively fixed 60 - 75 % of the duration of oestrus, the duration of oestrus varies considerably between sows and between farms, resulting in a variable ovulation time from onset of oestrus. Therefore, most farmers inseminate their sows every day of oestrus to ensure insemination within the optimal period. Since post-ovulation inseminations should be avoided, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>adviced</b> <b>to</b> only inseminate sows while they still show an optimal standing respons...|$|E

The disease can be divided in two groups, autoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism and non-autoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the surface hydrological component of the spatially distributed hydrological model SWAT to different input parametrisation schemes was tested for a small agricultural catchment of the Thyle in {{the central part of}} Belgium. For this analysis 2 different soil parametrisation schemes, 2 different soil maps, and 2 land use maps were used as input to the SWAT model. For generating the soil parametrisation schemes, use was made of the generalised soil association map at the scale of 1 : 500. 000, the detailed IRSIA soil map at the scale of 1 : 25. 000 and the soil profile analytical data base AARDEWERK. Uncalibrated simulations were performed for two different periods (1977 - 1979 and 1999) for which a land use map was available and for which detailed hydrological data are available. The results are suggesting that the SWAT model is very sensitive to the soil parametrisation scheme and to the input data resolution. For both simulated time periods only one soil parametrisation scheme performed appropriately. However the use of a high resolution soil map will not always result in the best modelling performance. The use of detailed soil map in combination with detailed land use map performs well. However, the results obtained from the use of the detailed soil map in combination with a generic land use map are surprisingly poor. This {{can be explained by the}} equifinality problem of different parameters sets in distributed hydrological models. Therefore <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> use a similar resolution for the input maps and input data sets while applying the SWAT model.

You should penetrate beyond the eyes which fix the events, which classify your childhood as a mere phase of develop ment.

And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> his son too, to help him fulfill his <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> himself. Both pieces of <b>advice</b> <b>are</b> some what strange compared with how we usually think about the educational relationship between father and son, parent and child, or teacher and student. First, the father does not want to fix his child’s being with his own values and expectations. To look at your child in the way you want him or her to be is to measure the child and to compare him or her with more or less impersonal and imposed standards and norms. This means, however, that the child is regarded not in a direct, but an indirect, way so that the child loses his or her uniqueness. In other words, the relationship needs to be immediate. Second, the father seems to feel that he may fail fulfilling this relationship. Therefore, he needs help from his child, and so he advises the son to go beyond the measuring eyes to reach the realm of immediacy between each other. Thus the father aims for a relationship which transcends any form of unlinear influential power. Like many educational the orists he seems to regard the main characteristic of the educa tional relationship as asymmetrical. And he recognizes a helping capability that the child can offer the parent or educa tor. But can this kind of relationship be called an educational one in the way we conventionally think about it? Or does the father inadvertently seem to give up the idea of education entirely?

The comparisons of the selected equations with the existing experimental results, which are available in the literature, were expressed through MARE, MRE+, MRE-, RMSE, Ѳ, and S. The statistical comparisons were also carried out using MSC and AIC. The analyses show that the Wilson-Thomas (1985) and Morrison (2013) models are best fit models to the experimental data for the Reynolds number up to 40000. Within this range, both models can be used alternately. But beyond this Re value the discrepancy of the Wilson-Thomas model is higher than the Morrison model. In {{view of the fact that}} the Morrison model requires fewer calculations and parameters as well as a single equation is used to compute the friction factor for all flow regimes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the authors’ <b>advice</b> <b>to</b> use this model for friction factor estimation for the flow of Bingham fluids in smooth pipes as an alternative to the Moody chart and other implicit formulae...|$|R
60|$|He {{plunged into}} facts and figures, and Maraton {{more than once}} yawned. He seemed to find more {{interest}} in watching {{the faces of the}} audience than in listening to the stock arguments which were being thrown at their heads. A little cloud of tobacco smoke hung about the room. There were few women present, and most of the men were smoking. On the whole they were a very earnest gathering. There were very few there who were not deeply interested. Julia was listening to every word, her head resting upon her hand, her lips a little parted, her eyes full of smouldering fires. At the end of Docker's speech, one of the Union officials got up on his feet. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> for the men themselves to decide, he said. They had subscribed the money; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for them to say whether <b>it</b> should <b>be</b> used. Was the moment propitious for a blow on behalf of their rights? If they thought so, then let <b>it</b> <b>be</b> war. If they asked for his <b>advice,</b> they <b>were</b> welcome <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> His <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> fight. The masters had refused their reasonable ultimatum. Let the masters try and carry out their contracts without work people! That was his way of looking at it.|$|R
