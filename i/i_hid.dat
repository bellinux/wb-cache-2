The rock formation, which is now a part of West Rock Park, is known as Judges' Cave, and the path leading to the cave is called the Regicides Trail.|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of the lengthy world tour {{supporting}} 1995's multi-platinum Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Chamberlin's father died, and his substance abuse hit a fever pitch. Of this period, Chamberlin later said, [...] "I learned that escapism was better than emotion, and that's where <b>I</b> <b>hid...</b> It got to the point that I really didn't care. Life was scary for me." [...] Prior to shows scheduled July '96 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Chamberlin and touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin overdosed on heroin; Melvoin subsequently died, and Chamberlin was kicked out of the band, ostensibly to protect his health.|$|E

500|$|Agnes and {{her sister}} were virgins of Rome {{in the time of}} the Emperor Constantine, though all figures are shown in {{contemporary}} 14th-century dress. The story begins {{on the inside of the}} bowl, which has a round medallion showing St Agnes kneeling before a bearded figure, representing her teacher, wearing a chaperon. She holds a book inscribed Miserere mei Deus sancte ("Have pity on me, Holy God"), while a banderole says In corde meo abscondi eloquia tua ut non peccem tibi ("Thy words have <b>I</b> <b>hid</b> in my heart that I might not sin against thee". [...] ). [...] The top of the cover continues the story up to Agnes' martyrdom in five scenes, shown with a continuous groundline from which small rocks rise up to demarcate the scenes; on the base trees perform this function. Sunrays radiate from the centre of the cover above all the scenes; the red enamel which once filled these is nearly all lost.|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century, long {{after the fall of the}} Roman Empire in the West, pirates and privateers began a hundred years of attacks and sackings. In the tenth century, the village of La Garde-Freinet was founded [...] to the North of Saint-Tropez. From 890 to 972, Saint-Tropez and its {{surroundings}} became an Arab Muslim colony dominated by the nearby Saracenic settlement of Fraxinet.; in 940, Saint-Tropez was controlled by Nasr ibn Ahmad. From 961 to 963, Audibert, son of Berenger, the pretender to the throne of Lombardy who was pursued by Otto <b>I,</b> <b>hid</b> at Saint-Tropez.

2500|$|TWA Flight 741 (type Boeing 707, serial 18917/460, {{registration}} [...] ) was a round-the-world flight carrying 144 {{passengers and}} {{a crew of}} 11.

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) {{when he was a little}} kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. <b>I</b> <b>hid</b> behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked when we could see it again – that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E

Chief Tackett yelled into the house that the place was surrounded and the Phantom might as well give up. Who do you suppose walked out? None other than Lone Wolf Gonzaullas of the Texas Rangers and a woman photographer from Life and Time magazines. Lone Wolf explained rather sheepishly {{that he had been}} re-enacting the crime and the young lady was taking pictures of him.
