5|$|Moving towards energy {{sustainability}} {{will require}} changes {{not only in}} the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> is essential.

5000|$|A <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{that is to}} be {{delivered}} in terms of a contract with a customer qualifies as a performance obligation if the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> is “distinct”. In this context a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> is distinct if: ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{defined by}} the Austrian School of {{economics}} the marginal use of a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> is the specific use to which an agent would put a given increase, or the specific use of the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> that would be abandoned {{in response to a}} given decrease. [...] The usefulness of the marginal use thus corresponds to the marginal utility of the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|In economics, {{marginal}} {{concepts are}} associated with a specific change in the quantity used of a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service,</b> as opposed to some notion of the over-all significance of that class of <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service,</b> <b>or</b> of some total quantity thereof.|$|R
5|$|Currency {{was often}} used for {{settling}} judicial fines, taxes and payments for <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made {{in the form of}} land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC. These earliest coins were punch marked rectangular pieces of silver known as kahavanu. These eventually became circular in shape, which were in turn followed by die struck coins. Uncoined metals, particularly gold and silver, were used for trading as well. Patterns of elephants, horses, swastika and Dharmacakra were commonly imprinted on the coins of this period.|$|E
5|$|The Sundanese author M.A.Salmoen classifies Joehana as a realist. Rosidi {{writes that}} {{a sense of}} realism was {{promoted}} in Joehana's writings {{through the use of}} references to existing (and often popular) brands of products, including cigars, salted fish, and biscuits (though, as Joehana wrote for persons in contemporary Bandung who were expected to know these products, they are not given any in-text explanation). Joehana used real-life Bandung locations in his novels, and local figures prominent in the news (such as the pickpocket Salim) are mentioned in passing. There is also the possibility that the use of such names are a form of product placement, in which Joehana was paid to include the names of the products in his novels; this payment may not have been direct, but in the form of <b>goods</b> <b>or</b> <b>services,</b> or a donation to Sarekat Rakyat.|$|E
25|$|A {{trademark}} may {{be composed}} of a word, design, symbol, color, sound, three-dimensional shape or a combination thereof.

5000|$|In economics, utility is the {{satisfaction}} or benefit derived by consuming a product; thus the marginal utility of a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{is the change}} in the utility from an increase in the consumption of that <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R

50|$|In economics, a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> {{is called}} {{excludable}} {{if it is}} possible to prevent people (consumers) who have not paid for it from having access to it. By comparison, a <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> is non-excludable if non-paying consumers cannot be prevented from accessing it.|$|R
50|$|A {{user charge}} is a {{charge for the}} use of a product <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> A user charge may apply per use of the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> <b>or</b> {{for the use of}} the <b>good</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> The first is a charge for each time while the second is a charge for bulk or time-limited use.|$|R

They may also review information (including statistics) about events (known future events such as holidays, or unexpected past events such as terrorist attacks), competitive information (including prices), seasonal patterns, and other pertinent factors that affect sales. The models attempt to forecast total demand for all products/services they provide, by market segment and price point. Since total demand normally exceeds what the particular firm can produce in that period, the models attempt to optimize the firm's outputs to maximize revenue.|$|E
