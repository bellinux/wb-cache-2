In the current competitive world, hygienic issue is a sever challenge to both the industry and the economy. Since the cinnamon production process is traditional over one hundred years old, the current hygienic issues have a great impact on the industry which is under discussion at government ministry level. A sample of cinnamon peelers in the industry along with small home based processing centre owners were selected for the survey and interviews respectively and all the findings were done by covering all the created objectives of the study. Data gathered from observations were also considered for explanations. Collected data was analysed to identify project management challenges hence the improvement of hygiene of cinnamon production process in home based small processing centres can be considered as a project by enforcing duration and a budget.

As the first attempt to improve the lot of factory children, it is often seen as {{paving the way for}} future Factory Acts. At best, it only partially paved the way; its restriction to apprentices (where there was a long tradition of legislation) meant that it was left to later Factory Acts to establish the principle of intervention by Parliament on humanitarian grounds on worker welfare issues against the [...] "laissez-faire" [...] political and economic orthodoxy of the age which held that to be ill-advised.|$|E

Graduates may work in the hospitality or hotel industry and are qualified for a job in catering and should be able to ensure compliance in hygiene, health and safety at work. This work is focused on students of the secondary hotel schools and their awareness of <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food services. The work is divided into two parts. The theoretical part defines catering service, its features and types. It also includes the legislation relating to <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food industry, describes the spatial requirements for businesses, personal and operational hygiene and the HACCP system. The work also briefly describes different ways of food preparation and possibilities to influence health safety and the most common foodborne infections in catering services caused by failing to comply with correct manufacturing and hygiene principles. This work describes sanitation (disinfection, insect and rodent control) and the performance of state health supervision of food hygiene. The practical part includes research results which were obtained by a quantitative questionnaire method. Questionnaires were distributed amongst students of third and fourth (the final) years {{of secondary}} hotel schools in České Budějovice and Teplice. Each questionnaire contained 25 closed questions; the data collection was conducted anonymously. 106 of the 110 distributed questionnaires were returned from the Secondary Hotel School in České Budějovice. 99 questionnaires were sufficiently filled in to meet the research needs, making the return of 90 %. In the Secondary Hotel School in Teplice, 98 of the 100 distributed questionnaires returned, 96 were sufficiently filled in, making the return of 96 %. The aim of this work was to determine the level of awareness of the <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food service at secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice. Based on the objectives of the work I set two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Students of secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice are not informed about <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food services. Hypothesis 2 : Students of secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice who are interested in working in catering services are informed about <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> for food services more than students who are not interested in such work. After testing the two hypotheses it is evident from the results that the students of secondary hotel schools in Teplice and České Budějovice are not informed about <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> in food services and that students of secondary hotel schools in České Budějovice and Teplice who are interested in working in catering services are more informed about the <b>hygiene</b> <b>requirements</b> than students who do not intend to work in the field. Based on these findings, it is important to educate students of secondary hotel schools continually, especially about the foodborne disease issues and also, to motivate them to work in catering services, because there are more than 50 % of students who do not want to advance towards working in the industry at both schools. There was almost no difference between the knowledge of students in secondary hotel schools in Teplice or České Budějovice. Students of the Secondary Hotel School in České Budějovice were slightly better an the number of correctly answered questions.
