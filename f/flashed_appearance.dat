Certainly I think the sea is most luminous after a few days of more calm weather than ordinary, during which time it has swarmed with various animals. Observing that the water charged with gelatinous particles is in an impure state, and that the luminous appearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the fluid in contact with the atmosphere, I am inclined to consider that the phosphorescence {{is the result of the}} decomposition of the organic particles, by which process (one is tempted almost to call it a kind of respiration) the ocean becomes purified.|$|R

Far red excitation did not increase the amount of the AG band in iron-limited cells, as observed for iron-replete cells. The effect of iron deficiency on the photosystem I activity was also examined by measuring the changes in P 700 redox state during illumination. The electron donation to photosystem I was substantially reduced in iron-deficient cells. This could be related with the important decline on cytochrome c 6 content observed in these cells. Iron deficiency also induced a marked increase in light sensitivity in Phaeodactylum tricornutum cells.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of {{different}} manners of shinai gripping on striking movement in kendo. The subjects were 3 kendo men, 3 rd and 4 th grade, and 3 untrained men ages of 21 - 23 years old. The subjects stroke the striking stand by shinai using two different gripping manners. First was the manner which the thumb, the index finger and the middle finger of both hands were mainly used (thumb side manner : TSM). Second was the manner which the little and the third finger of both hands were mainly used (little side manner : LSM). The subjects were requested to strike as quickly as possible when the light signal was flashed. The EMG activities of m. flexor carpi radialis, m. flexor carpi ulnaris, m. biceps brachii and m. triceps branchii were recorded by bipolar surface electrodes. The magnitude of striking force was recorded using strain gauge which was attatched to the striking atand. The time from the light <b>flashing</b> to the <b>appearance</b> of EMG activities of biceps brachii was determined as premotor time. The time from the appearance of EMG activities of biceps brachii to triceps brachii was determined as the time for swing up time of shinai. The time from the appearance of EMG activities of triceps brachii to the impact of shinai was determined as the time for swing down time of shinai. The striking movement was analyzed by the 16 mm film which was taken from the side of the subject. The following results were obtained from present study study. 1) Kendo men show shorter swing up time and smaller swing up movement in LSM than in TSM. LSM is tend to take shorter swing down time and larger striking movement in shinai. 2) Untrained men didn't show any differences between LSM and TSM in the striking movement. 本実験は、被検者に剣道の中段の構えにおける竹刀保持を橈側手根屈筋群による条件（母指条件）と尺側手根屈筋群による条件（子指条件）の 2 条件を指示し、光刺激に対してできるだけ素早く一歩踏み込んで打込台を打撃させ、竹刀の保持方法の違いによる打撃動作の影響を比較・検討した。筋電図は、上腕二頭筋、上腕三頭筋、橈側手根屈筋、尺側手根屈筋を被検筋として、表面双極導出法を用いて記録し、動作開始時間、振り上げ時間、振り下し時間を計測した。また、打込台には荷重計を設置し、打撃圧の鉛直分力を検出するとともに、被検者の右方から 16 mm映画撮影法を用いて、動作分析を行った。本実験結果は、次のようである。　 1) 経験者群における動作開始時間は、母指条件で 503 ms、小指条件で 481 ms、振り上げ時間は、それぞれ 240 msと 235 ms、振り下し時間は 212 msと 205 msであり、母指条件に比較して小指条件の振り下し時間は有意に短縮した値を示した（P< 0. 05 ）。未経験者群の値は、それぞれ 256 msと 267 ms、 301 msと 354 ms、 267 msと 236 msであり、振り上げ時間は、母指条件より小指条件が有意に遅延した値を示した（P< 0. 05 ）。　 2) 経験者群における竹刀の打撃速度は、母指条件で 16. 7 m／s、小指条件で 16. 5 m／s、打撃力はそれぞれ 36. 8 kgと 38. 4 kgであり、未経験者群の値は、それぞれ 18. 7 m／sと 18. 9 m／s、 63. 3 kgと 58. 3 kgであり、各群の両条件間にはいずれも有意な差が認められなかった。　 3) 経験者群の各局面における関節角度は、母指条件に比較して小指条件が、中段の構えで肩関節の屈曲が有意に小さく（P< 0. 01 ）、肘関節の屈曲と手関節の内転が有意に大きく（各P< 0. 01 ）、竹刀最高位で肩関節の屈曲が有意に小さく（P< 0. 01 ）、打撃時で手関節の内転が有意に大きかった（P< 0. 01 ）。未経験者の中段の構えと竹刀最高位における関節角度には、両条件間に有意な差は認められなかったが、打撃時では母指条件に比較して小指条件が肩関節の屈曲が有意に大きく（P< 0. 01 ）、肘関節の屈曲が有意に小さかった（P< 0. 05 ）。　 4) 経験者群の振り上げ動作における関節角度変化は、母指条件に比較して小指条件では肘・手関節の角度変化が有意に小さく（各P< 0. 01 ）、振り下し動作では肩、手関節の角度変化が有意に大きかった（各P< 0. 01 、P< 0. 05 ）。未経験者群の振り上げ動作については、母指条件に比較して小指条件では肘関節の角度変化が有意に小さく（P< 0. 05 ）、振り下し動作には両条件間に有意な差が認められなかった。　これらの結果は、打撃動作の未熟な未経験者群では、竹刀保持方法の違いにともなう打撃動作への顕著な影響が観察されなかったが、経験者群では、尺側手根屈筋群で竹刀を保持することが、橈側手根屈筋群での竹刀保持に比較して、振り上げ動作を小さくしてその時間を短縮し、大きな振り下し動作を短時間で遂行することによって、竹刀の打撃速度および打撃力の増大に貢献していることを示唆するものである...|$|R
60|$|It may {{be worth}} while to examine how {{darkness}} can operate {{in such a manner}} as to cause pain. It is observable, that still as we recede from the light, nature has so contrived it, that the pupil is enlarged by the retiring of the iris, in proportion to our recess. Now, instead of declining from it but a little, suppose that we withdraw entirely from the light; it is reasonable to think that the contraction of the radial fibres of the iris is proportionally greater; and that this part may by great darkness come to be so contracted, as to strain the nerves that compose it beyond their natural tone; and by this means to produce a painful sensation. Such a tension it seems there certainly is, whilst we are involved in darkness; for in such a state, whilst the eye remains open, there is a continual nisus to receive light; this is manifest from the <b>flashes</b> and luminous <b>appearances</b> which often seem in these circumstances to play before it; and which can be nothing but the effect of spasms, produced by its own efforts in pursuit of its object: several other strong impulses will produce the idea of light in the eye, besides the substance of light itself, as we experience on many occasions. Some, who allow darkness to be a cause of the sublime, would infer, from the dilatation of the pupil, that a relaxation may be productive of the sublime as well as a convulsion: but they do not, I believe, consider, that although the circular ring of the iris be in some sense a sphincter, which may possibly be dilated by a simple relaxation, yet in one respect it differs from most of the other sphincters of the body, that it is furnished with antagonist muscles, which are the radial fibres of the iris: no sooner does the circular muscle begin to relax, than these fibres, wanting their counterpoise, are forcibly drawn back, and open the pupil to a considerable wideness. But though we were not apprised of this, I believe any one will find, if he opens his eyes and makes an effort to see in a dark place, that a very perceivable pain ensues. And I have heard some ladies remark, that after having worked a long time upon a ground of black, their eyes were so pained and weakened, they could hardly see. It may perhaps be objected to this theory of the mechanical effect of darkness, that the ill effects of darkness or blackness seem rather mental than corporeal: and I own it is true that they do so; and so do all those that depend on the affections of the finer parts of our system. The ill effects of bad weather appear often no otherwise than in a melancholy and dejection of spirits; though without doubt, in this case, the bodily organs suffer first, and the mind through these organs.|$|R
40|$|Proefskrif (DLitt) [...] PU vir CHO, 1984 It was {{suggested}} {{at the start}} of this experimental survey that time is of integral importance as a structural element of drama and that it is a dynamic element which has changed rapidly throughout the ages. The survey showed that this hypothesis could be proven by means of facts. In the course of chapter one it was indicated how drama, with regard to the handling of time, developed from the classical tragedy with its linear of chronological expression of time up to a complicated structure of time. A dramatically distinguishing trait of the drama is that everything in the events after being accomplished stretches towards the future. According to Emil Staiger 's Grundbegriffe der Poetik (1972) he distinguishes between lyrics, epics and dramatics because the dramatic distinguishes itself as an impulse towards the future. In the framework of time of the New Drama and especially in the drama after the sixties, the primary factor is not that which is to come seeing that time cannot be divided from scope anymore. Time is present visually in the stage framework where different times exist alongside each other. The first step used to work against the futuristic nature of the traditional drama came from the Naturalists who stressed the past extensively. Natural ism wanted to provide the present with psychological motivation for deeds which aimed towards the past with a clinical and scientific attitude. This view was maintained by various twentieth century dramatists such as Miller, Tennessee Williams and Ionesco where the influence of the past is clearly notable in the present. The incident in the past i s used to explain the present as it is illustrated in Tennessee Williams's drama The glass menagerie (1945). The third step in the survey about the structure of time was to replay the past as part of the dramatic present. In these dramas, where the emphasis is shifted towards a number of situations which are placed next to each other, the aim is not primarily progressive anymore, but is the exploitation of the here and now in a spatially presented present. The performance now develops chronologically and there is no question of a linear advancement as i s the case in Our town(1938) by Thornton Wilder. The fourth phase {{in the development of the}} structure of time is that the inseparability time is of integral importance where the complicated experience of all the elements of time in the present overlap. In these dramas the important factor is not primarily the past as a force in its own right anymore, seeing that there can be moved mutually in time, as is the case in Pinter's Old times (1972). The shift of emphasis with regard to the initiation of time in drama after the sixties and the elevation of chronology lead towards a circular movement in time. Cyclical time is embodied in drama by a concluding scene which is identical to the beginning of the drama so that it is not a continuation in time anymore, but rather a circular movement in time. By using such a movement in situations which are completed over and over again, time attains ritualistic meaning which leads it to rise above the necessarily passing time. The architect and the emperor (196 7) by Arrabal consists of a sequence of ritualistic situations of which the conclusion connects directly with the beginning. The use of mythological and religious motives tie in with the use of cyclical •time and thus i t i s endeavoured to provide time with "eternal value", and to stress its universal nature. Archetypes are used to provide the events with more substance and to rise above the timely. Claus does it in Vrijdag (1977) with Christiane and Lili. In the fourth phase of the development of the conception of time the <b>flash</b> makes its <b>appearance</b> which enables the dramatist, by means of flashback and advance flash, place the dramatic present i n the correct perspective. In the Theatre of the "Absurd" time is elevated so as to form the theme of certain dramas as in Beckett's Waiting for Godot (1953) in which the two beggars endlessly wait for Godot' s arrival. Everything i n the drama centres around time because one is intensely aware of the passing of time when you wait. In Ionesco' s drama The bald soprano (1 948) there is not any advance i n time because a disturbance takes place in the time. The latter is indeterminable and nothing can be trusted upon because the watches show exactly the opposite of the correct time and, at one stage, the watch even chimes seventeen times when it is nine o' clock. Time therefore becomes a lasting unreliable idea. Multi surfaced scope in presenting drama and understudying of characters make time shifts easier. This technique heightens the complexity of the time structure of the drama and is aimed at making competent shifts in time easier to visualize. From the survey it appears that the characters in the dramas do not only experience time objectively but also subjectively. In this way scope, characterization, events and the discourse are not to be separated from time - it is part of the entirety of the drama. To prove how the structure of time in drama changed after the sixties, four subgenres of the drama are examined and aspects of the handling of time during this period is stressed. In the experimental drama Kanna hy ko hystoe (1965) by Adam Small, events are recalled in Kanna 's memory. This drama is thus an example of subjectified time scope because the events which take place on the s t age are as Kanna remembers them. Kanna is the main character in these events which have already taken place when the drama starts, and here there is thus a question of the present and past which do not only inter mingle but which also exist simultaneously. In Claus's drama Vrijdag (1977) which is discussed as contemporary Dutch drama, the past and present exist simultaneously spatially on the stage. It occurs, however, by means of auditory and visual flashes from the past which occurred while serving a prison sentence. Thus has a definite effect on the present events. By using the flashback technique, as in the case of Vrijdag, it is possible to move backward and forward in time and the drama can be coloured visually. This makes the time shifts manageable with ease and the events are easily stage able. By means of this technique the difficulties experienced by the stage drama are eliminated because the drama reaches its conclusion only when i t is presented to an audience. The radio drama h Stasi e in die niet (1970) by Chris Barnard is analysed because the past, present and future are intermingled. The time shifts caused by the back flashes, intensify the time structure seeing that the radio drama is not bound to visual presentation. Here complete freedom within the movement of time exists. From the analysis of ‘n Stasie in die niet it appears that the technical possibilities of the auditory to express time, are virtually endless. With a video drama such as Piet-my-vrou (1982) by Chris Barnard the time shifts can be managed relatively easily and successfully by means of film cuts. In the latter the video drama are simultaneous whole acting components which represent segments in time. In Piet-my vrou the court case takes place in the present. From the present there is a continuous backward movement towards four different stages in the past. The purpose of this alternation between past and present is to rectify the faulty evidence in the present and to place it in the correct perspective. In this video drama, the form without dialogue is satisfactory evidence to attain the corrective. It has been endeavoured, in this survey, to point out, in a linear responsible way, the time structure in the Afrikaans and Dutch drama after the sixties. The changing time structure is an integral character trait of the renewal which took place in the drama after the sixties where chronology is not questioned any longer, but where the past, present and future can exist spatially.
