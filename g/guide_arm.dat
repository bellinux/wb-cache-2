40|$|Abstract. The {{displacement}} amplification and hysteresis {{of parallel}} four-bar mechanism using piezo actuator were researched in this paper. The displacement amplification was analyzed by employing the material bending theory firstly. Theoretical and FEM analysis {{proved that the}} amplification ratio of parallel four-bar mechanism is only related {{to the position of}} driving point and the <b>guiding</b> <b>arm</b> displacement is directly proportional to the input with the certain structure. Then the Preisach model was employed to model the hysteresis of <b>guiding</b> <b>arm</b> and using the model to perform the research on the output displacement of the mechanism. Experiments proved that the analysis is correct and showed that this model can effectively improve the accurate of the <b>guiding</b> <b>arm</b> output displacement and can realize output arbitrary series displacement using the Preisach interpolation surface...|$|R

50|$|The Gametrak uses a {{patented}} {{mechanical system}} for tracking position of physical elements in three-dimensional space in real time. The base unit features two identical mechanisms, {{each of which}} can determine the three-dimensional coordinates of an associated element relative to the mechanism. Each mechanism contains a retracting cable reel and a small tubular <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> from which the cable passes out. The <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> is articulated in a ball joint such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism.

The <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> is articulated in a ball joint such that the arm and ball follow the angle at which the cable extends from the mechanism. The distance of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure {{the rotation of the}} spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended.|$|E
50|$|When the {{operator}} turns the power handle, the cylindrical drum makes a complete revolution through all 27 bars. If a lug {{on one of}} the bars contacts the <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> of an active key wheel, that bar is slid to the left; lugs in neutral positions, or which do not contact a <b>guide</b> <b>arm,</b> do not affect the position of the bar. All bars that are slid to the left comprise a variable-toothed gear, which in turn shifts the letter to be encoded; the shift is equal to the number of bars protruding to the left. The resulting ciphertext letter is printed onto the paper tape.|$|E

5000|$|The Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) was {{installed}} in the HRF-1 during Expedition 11. The SLAMMD measures the on-orbit mass of the crewmembers by applying Newton's second law of motion (force is equal to mass times acceleration). This device can measure a mass between 95 and 240 lb using the force generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer. Each spring {{is attached to a}} cam, which is also attached to a centrally located shaft with a flywheel mounted on top of it. The cam is designed such that, as the springs are stretched over a distance, a constant force is applied to the central shaft. A lanyard wrapped around the large flywheel is fed through a small slit on the SLAMMD front panel. The lanyard is latched onto the SLAMMD <b>guiding</b> <b>arm,</b> where the crewmember sits for a body mass measurement. Attached to the <b>guiding</b> <b>arm</b> is a leg support assembly around which the crew-member wraps his or her legs (as one would for a leg curl machine), a belly pad to help align the stomach, and a headrest.|$|R

50|$|The Mark 26 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS) was a United States Navy fully {{automated}} system that stows, handles, and launches {{a variety of}} missiles. The system supported RIM-66 Standard, RUR-5 ASROC, and potentially other weapons. The Mark 26 had the shortest reaction time and the fastest firing rate of any comparable dual arm shipboard launching system at the time. With only one man at the control console, a weapon can be selected, hoisted to the <b>guide</b> <b>arm,</b> and launched. Several mods (0 to 5) provided magazine capabilities of 24 to 64 missiles.|$|E
5000|$|Behind {{the row of}} six key wheels is a {{cylindrical}} drum consisting of 27 horizontal bars. Each drum bar is affixed with two movable lugs; the lugs can be aligned {{with any of the}} six key wheels, or may be placed in one of two [...] "neutral" [...] positions. An effective pin causes its <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> to tilt forward, contacting the drum. The positioning of the lugs comprises {{the second part of the}} internal keying mechanism. Owing to the complexity of setting the internal keying mechanism, it was altered relatively infrequently; changing internal keys once a day was common in practice.|$|E

40|$|The use of implant {{anchorage}} has simplified {{orthodontic treatment}} by sparing us {{the need for}} patient compliance and the complexity of treatment. One {{of the most important}} factors affecting the success of interdental implants is preventing the damage to adjacent roots and periodontal ligament. The most common causes of root damage from mini-implant insertion are improper site selection and an inaccurate angle of drill penetration. We thereby present a custom made modified grid help in more accurate placement of temporary anchorage devices and guide the angle of drill penetration. The grid can be placed anywhere in the oral cavity (buccally, palatally, anteriorly or posteriorly) and it can be attached to the main arch wire, bracket or even on unbounded teeth. The measuring reference grid with two vertical <b>guide</b> <b>arms</b> is connected with a horizontal arm that will later be secured to the adjacent bracket at both ends. The grid includes small squares, which effectively upgrade the efficiency during the orthodontic implant placement. The two vertical <b>guide</b> <b>arms</b> help in maintaining the desired angulation while drilling indicating the mesial and distal root surface of the adjacent teeth...|$|R

5000|$|The {{distance}} of the tracked element from the mechanism is determined through components which measure {{the rotation of the}} spool drum for the retracting cable reel, and calculating how far the cable is extended. Through the ball joint and <b>guide</b> <b>arm,</b> the mechanism functions in a similar fashion as a gamepad analog stick to determine the angular direction from the mechanism to the track element. From the distance and angle data, a three-dimensional position for the element is resolved. The predetermined spacing and orientation of the mechanisms on the base unit allows the coordinate data gathered by the two mechanisms to be converted into positions in a unified space. According to In2Games, the mechanisms can determine position [...] "to an accuracy of 1 millimetre anywhere within a 3m cube around the unit, with no processor overhead or time delay." ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 404 - 405) The MK 26 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS), {{specifically in}} the <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> assemblies, possess design deficiencies which harbor and promote specific forms of corrosive attack. This study is focused on corrosion which occurs in the hydraulic access cover areas of the <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> assemblies. The HK 26 GHLS is continuously exposed to a fluctuating marine environment and occasional high temperature rocket exhaust gases. 1008, 1018, ASTM A 514 Grade B, and ASTM A 514 Grade E steel specimens were sujected to potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, crevice, atmospheric, immersion, inhibitor, atmospheric, and paint tests in Port Huememe, CA sea water to ascertain corrosion mechanisms taking place and effective corrosion control/prevention measures. No passive film was formed {{on any of the}} steels tested when immersed in sea water. Pitting occurred at magnesium sulfide inclusions, grain boundaries, and localized areas where corrosion product films were breached. Under immersed conditions without crevices, pitting was prevalent {{in the early stages of}} corrosion, but pit growth soon became severly retarded, giving way to intergranular attack. Pitting was and remained the dominant form of attack in tight crevices. Under atmospheric condtions, pitting was dominant at all times as well. Intergranular attack was significantly more severe in the plain carbon steels than in the ASTM A 514 steels. Cathodically polarizing to - 780 mv (S. C. E) proved adequate to protect 1008, 1018, ASTM A 5614 Grade B, and ASTM A 514 Grade E steels under laboratory conditions. Sodium nitrite, calcium benzoate, and sodium silicate were effective inhibitors, provided concentrations are maintained above a critical threshold. The protective nature of various paint systems tested was far more dependent on metal preparation methods than on the properties of the paint themselves...|$|E
30|$|The main {{advantage}} of the APLR is to eliminate {{the side effects of}} the CLR and the additional treatment to correct the side effects. This advantage is due to the heavy <b>guide</b> <b>arm</b> that is controlled by the path tube. Another important finding was that favorable alveolar bone response was shown using the lingual retractors, regardless of their types, because they splinted the anterior teeth together. Although the tendency of alveolar bone loss on the palatal side was similar to previous studies [5, 16], the amount of vertical bone loss was much smaller than that of conventional appliances. Ahn et al. [5] also reported that the alveolar bone area increased at the middle level of maxillary incisors on the labial side and decreased in all maxillary incisors on the palatal side.|$|E
