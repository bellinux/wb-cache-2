25|$|Public {{safety is}} {{protected}} by Bloomington's 120 officer police force. The officers have sophisticated Ford Police Interceptor squad cars that assist them in their round-the-clock patrol: each contains a computer-assisted dispatching center that contains a computerized records system, mobile <b>digital</b> <b>terminals</b> that allow officers direct access to warrant information and state motor vehicle and driver's license records, and Opticom System equipment, which automatically switches traffic signals. The police force is also supported by six canine teams: four dual-purpose patrol dogs, a single-purpose narcotics dog, and a single-purpose explosives-detection dog assigned to the Mall of America. The police department has one of only four bomb squads in Minnesota and a highly trained 20 member SWAT team.|$|R

40|$|<b>Digital</b> fiber-optic data-link <b>terminal</b> modules {{are being}} {{developed}} {{in a number of}} laboratories, and often the modules take the form of black boxes without convenient access to internal signals. This paper discusses types of measurements which can be made using only the <b>digital</b> <b>terminals</b> of the link. Bit-error-rate (BER) vs signal-power data can, of course, provide a means for proving overall link performance, {{but it can also be}} used to determine certain internal parameters of the receiver. The theoretical dependence of the BER-vs-light-signal-power curve shape on receiver input-noise equivalent power and comparator slicing level is discussed. BER-vs-light-signal-power measurements obtained with an experimental link are presented and interpreted with the aid of the theoretical curves. The effects of other problems, such as hum or oscillation, on the BER data are mentioned. Sensitivity of the system BER to bit rate is also discussed, with application to determining system operating limits. Since BER measurements are simple to make and can easily be automated, they may prove to be a useful means for either laboratory evaluation or production-line acceptance testing of sealed terminal modules...|$|R

5000|$|Future Narrowband <b>Digital</b> <b>Terminal</b> (FNBDT) - Now {{referred}} to as the [...] "Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol" [...] (SCIP), the FNBDT is a replacement for the wide-band STE, which uses narrow-bandwidth communications channels like cellular telephone circuits, rather than ISDN lines. The FNBDT/SCIP operates on the application layer of the ISO/OSI Reference Model, meaning that it can be used on top of different types of connections, regardless of the establishment method. It negotiates with the unit at the other end, much like a dial-up modem.|$|E

40|$|Mobile <b>digital</b> <b>terminals</b> (MDTs) are two-way computers, {{installed}} inside police vehicles, {{that provide}} officers with remote data base prospecting capabilities. Proponents argue that MDTs help officers recover stolen property. Several Texas police departments implemented MDT {{systems in the}} 1980 s. This article assesses how MDTs in Dallas and Fort Worth affected vehicle theft recoveries, in comparison to a city with no MDTs, Austin. Five hypotheses are evaluated in a multiple interrupted time series design using ANOVA, response surface analysis, and pooled time series regression. The analysis of recoveries before and after intervention in two MDT cities and one non-MDT control city suggests that the technology is linked with increases in vehicle theft recoveries. The magnitude of improvement in recoveries associated with MDTs is more significant at lower levels of vehicle thefts. Austin showed some improvement in recovery rates without using MDTs, so other factors besides the technology {{are likely to be}} important. ...|$|R
