2500|$|Spedding also {{introduced}} {{the practice of}} [...] "coursing the air". As in other pits, the working areas were ventilated by fresh air, drawn down one half of a partitioned shaft; the air was then exhausted up {{the other half of}} the shaft, the air circulation being driven by a furnace at the base of the return half of the shaft: wooden partitioning and doors were used to prevent short-circuiting between feed and exhaust flows within the mine. Spedding improved this by ensuring that [...] after ventilating areas currently being worked the exhaust stream was routed through previously worked areas to eliminate any possibility of <b>firedamp</b> <b>accumulation</b> in unventilated volumes. This practice also spread from the Lowther pits to become standard practice in other coalfields.|$|E
