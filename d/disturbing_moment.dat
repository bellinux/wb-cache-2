The accuracy and resource of operation of such systems requires an increase. The problem of improving the accuracy and increasing the service life of information – measuring systems of stabilization can be solved by using as a sensitive element of a dynamically tuned gyroscope. Today the issue of achieving {{the potential of the}} metrological characteristics of information-measuring systems stabilization on dynamically tuned gyroscope is not fully resolved. It requires the development of mathematical models, different from the known, detailed description of the perturbations acting on a device.

40|$|Airships are {{expected}} to have in future an increasing diffusion in the aeronautic scenario. The use of airships is not necessary expected to be the same proposed in the past. Several new uses will assume a relevant importance in the next 20 years. The resurgence of airships has created a need for dynamics models and simulation capabilities of these lighter-than-air vehicles. A theoretical framework for designing flexible airships has developed deriving the equations for determining the flight behavior of an airship directly form the data of wind tests and CFD simulations. This model has been a fundamental part of the final design activities of the MAAT (Multibody Advanced Airship for Transport) EU FP 7 project, which has studied an innovative cruiser feeder airship based transport system. Main results relates to the definition of a specific mathematical model, which allow approximating the behavior of a flexible or low structured semi rigid airship in presence of external oscillations, in pitch or yawing. Different shapes of airships with different shapes, also not conventional, are assumed and aerodynamic behavior has been evaluated when slightly disturbed from steady forward motion or from hovering conditions in presence of an impacting wind. New uses and the exigency of adopting photovoltaic energy for long endurance missions, is producing airship shapes, which are slightly different from traditional Parsifal. The model presents defines effective criteria based on constructal law, which allow designing an airship with an intrinsic stability in pitch and yaw. An approximate condition for a dynamically stable motion, such as unamplifying pitch, has been expressed in familiar aerodynamic quantities. These results allow stating the following theorem, which has been demonstrated: "Stable pitch flight conditions can be ensured if damping moment is in rotational equilibrium with the <b>disturbing</b> <b>moment</b> and if the disturbing force, the damping force, and the inertia force, are in translational balance". If pitch angle and angular speed are small it can be obtained a relation that must be necessarily satisfied for ensuring a stability condition.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{about the process of}} telling stories. In particular, a group of stories centred on a <b>disturbing</b> <b>moment</b> in New Zealand history. The killing of the Gilfillan family was a brutal and {{unprecedented}} event, shocking the European population of New Zealand in 1847, and maintaining an ability to discomfort even 150 years later. The following pages are not an attempt to write the 'true' story of the Gilfillan killings, but rather to consider what made the killings shocking and disturbing in the first instance, and, how that power to shock and disturb can give a greater access to a historical moment. The focus is on how fragments of the past can maintain an aesthetic power in the present, and how an event becomes a cultural object, entangled in context and culture, and constantly renegotiated and re-narrated over time. The killing of the Gilfillans is normally called the "Gilfillan massacre", or the "Gilfillan murders". Both these phrases prejudge their deaths as criminal and 'savage' acts - whereas for the Maori involved they were at least partially political. Whatever the judgement of the morality of the killing of the children, I find the phrase "Gilfillan killings", more neutral, without eliding the violence of the event. One recent writer David Young (Young, David, Woven by Water: Histories from the Whanganui River, Wellington: Huia, 1998) has used the phrase the "Gilfillan muru" (killing). While I have avoided {{the use of the word}} "massacre", as it feels so redolent with colonial overtones, I feel no need to place the killings in a solely Maori cultural sphere - although in itself, by bringing a conception of the plurality of cultural responses to the killings, Young's act of renaming has strong points. A key assertion is that the story of the Gilfillan killings is marginal; outside the bounds of 'normal' experience. The marginal story, uncomfortable, disorientating, or difficult to understand and contexualise, is a way to puncture and break through explanatory meta-narratives which overwrite the particularity and contingency of history. To use a phrase borrowed from the school of literary criticism called Russian Formalism, it can 'make things strange', offering a new way of seeing and understanding the world. Boris Eichenbuam, "The Theory of Formal Method" in The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism, Vincent B. Leitch, gen. ed., New York, London: Norton Press: 2001, pp. 1062 - 87. To the Russian formalists the "roughened form" of great literature "defamiliarised" or "made things strange", breaking through "automatism" - normalised habits of perception. Analysing the marginal, strange-making story as a 'way in' to a historical past is a technique that has been used by a number of historians, particularly in the last few decades, as postmodernism and the influence of other disciplines, such as anthropology, began to move historical practice away from broader explanatory meta-narratives towards more historically specific and culturally situated explanations. A famous example is the description of the execution at the beginning of Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish. 4 4 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison, translated from the French by Alan Sheridan, New York: Pantheon Books, cl 977. pp. 1 - 3.

40|$|Background: Sleep {{and rest}} {{is a problem}} that is {{constantly}} reported as a lack of patients in intensive care. Consequences to this involve problems involving immunological, neurological, respiratory and cardiovascular problems. It also leads to prolonged care times related to increased mortality and morbidity, difficulty in mobilization and increased risk of developing delirium.   Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the disturbances of intensive care patients and their duration.   Method: The study is a non-experimental non-participation observation study with mixed method when quantitative data is obtained and explained using qualitative data. The data collected was interference that could affect the rest and sleep of patients by means of a structured observational schedule. In addition to the observational schedule, field notes were taken, which among others included reflections on the care environment.   Results: The observations showed that the patients were disturbed ⅖ of the time of observations, including everything from sound, relatives, and nursing measures. The longest duration without interference was one hour and 23 minutes. However, there were other <b>disturbing</b> <b>moments</b> during this time, among others several alarms from both the surveillance and the port phone. The total number of alarms was 972. Conclusion: Although many previous studies indicate that critically ill patients need a good rest and sleep to recover faster and not suffer from IVA-delirium, this is still a commonly reported problem in the intensive care. The result suggests that nurses in the intensive care can re-prioritize and combine various nursing measures to reduce the time with patient disturbances...|$|R
