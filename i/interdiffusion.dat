50|$|Recently, the {{diffusion}} equation was thus mathematically investigated {{in accordance with}} the divergence theorem and the coordinate transformation theory. As a result, {{the diffusion}} flux should be determined by taking account of the concerned coordinate system of diffusion equation. Using the corresponding diffusion flux to the concerned coordinate system of diffusion equation for <b>interdiffusion,</b> one way diffusion, impurity diffusion and self-diffusion, we found that they are uniformly discussed and the foundation of diffusion problems is included in <b>interdiffusion</b> problems. The <b>interdiffusion</b> theory of an elements system applicable to every material was thus reasonably established. In the analysis of <b>interdiffusion</b> problems, the only difference between a binary system and an N elements system is whether the solvent material is one element or elements.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947, Kirkendall {{found that}} an inert marker set {{at a point in}} a binary alloy moves from the initial sate point after the {{diffusion}} treatment. [...] The phenomena are so called Kirkendall effect and it was considered that we cannot understand it from the existing theory of binary <b>interdiffusion</b> in those days. As a result, a new concept of intrinsic diffusion was then introduced for understanding the Kirkendall effect in the <b>interdiffusion</b> problems. Based on the intrinsic diffusion concept, Darken derived a relation between an <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficient and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in a binary <b>interdiffusion</b> in 1948. At present, however, it is revealed that the so-called Darken equation itself is mathematically wrong in the derivation process. Although the concentration of diffusion particles is a real quantity in physics, the temperature is a thermodynamic state quantity. As far as the shape of heat conduction material is unchangeable during a thermal treatment, the coordinate system of heat equation set in a material is a fixed one, since the coordinate system is not influenced by variations of the material internal structure. On the other hand, strictly speaking, the coordinate system of diffusion equation set in the diffusion field (solvent) is a moving one, since the origin of coordinate system is generally influenced by such variations.|$|E

5000|$|The process {{differs from}} {{diffusion}} bonding in which diffusion {{occurs when a}} melting point repressant element from an interlayer moves into lattice and grain boundaries of the substrates at the bonding temperature. Solid state diffusional processes lead to a change of composition at the bond interface and the dissimilar interlayer melts at a lower temperature than the parent materials. Thus {{a thin layer of}} liquid spreads along the interface to form a joint at a lower temperature than the melting point of either of the parent materials. This method differs from brazing in that it is [...] "isothermally solidifying". While holding the temperature above the filler metal melting point, <b>interdiffusion</b> shifts the composition away from eutectic, so solidification occurs at the process temperature. If sufficient <b>interdiffusion</b> occurs, the joint will remain solid and strong well above the original melt process temperature. This is why it is termed [...] "transient liquid phase." [...] The liquid solidifies before cooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{diffusion}} model {{does not take}} into account the miscibility of substrate and layer, so for immiscible or low-miscibility systems it will overestimate the degree of mixing, while for highly miscible systems the model will underestimate the degree of mixing. Thermodynamic effects are also not considered in this basic <b>interdiffusion</b> equation, but can be modeled by equations that consider the enthalpies of mixing and the molar fractions of the target species, and one can thereby develop a thermodynamic effective diffusion coefficient reflecting temperature effects (which become pronounced at high temperatures).|$|E
5000|$|We {{found that}} the {{diffusivity}} of diffusion equation depends generally on the concentration of diffusion particles. In that case, the diffusion equation becomes a nonlinear partial differential equation, and the mathematical solution is almost impossible, {{even if it is}} a case of the time and one dimension space coordinate [...] In accordance with the parabolic law, Boltzmann transformed the diffusion equation of, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation, into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of in 1894.Since then, however, the Boltzmann transformation equation had not been mathematically solved until recently, although Matano empirically used it for analyzing <b>interdiffusion</b> problems in the metallurgy field.|$|E

50|$|Other gold-aluminium {{intermetallics}} {{can cause}} problems as well. Below 624°C, purple plague {{is replaced by}} Au2Al, a tan-colored substance. It is a poor conductor and can cause electrical failure of the joint {{that can lead to}} mechanical failure. At lower temperatures, about 400 - 450°C, an <b>interdiffusion</b> process takes place at the junction. This leads to formation of layers of several intermetallic compounds with different compositions, from gold-rich to aluminium-rich, with different growth rates. Cavities form as the denser, faster-growing layers consume the slower-growing ones. This process, known as Kirkendall voiding, leads to both increased electrical resistance and mechanical weakening of the wire bond. When the voids are collected along the diffusion front, a process aided by contaminants present in the lattice, it is known as Horsting voiding, a process similar to and often confused with Kirkendall voiding.|$|E
5000|$|The {{silver and}} gold {{that was used to}} make King Philip II’s diadem would have {{originally}} been mined, processed, and then shipped to a jeweler or expert artisan. During the first millennium B.C. the region around the Balkans and Greece was famed for its precious metals. [...] During this period, most objects were cast in a lost wax process. The lost wax process involves creating a mold with an object made out of wax, the object being an identical rendering of what the finished product should look like. Once the wax is formed it is incased in clay and then baked. While baking, the wax will melt leaving the artisan with a mold. With a completed mold the artisan would be able to fill it with the metals they wished to use. [...] The gilding process that most likely would have been used on this diadem would have involved gold leaf being burnished to the silver. The adhesion of gold with the use of heat helps promote <b>interdiffusion</b> with the underlying metals which usually consist silver or copper.|$|E
50|$|Darken’s {{equations}} can {{be applied}} to almost any scenario involving the diffusion of two different components that have different diffusion coefficients. This holds true except in situations where there is an accompanying volume change in the material because this violates one of Darken’s critical assumptions that atomic volume is constant. More complicated equations than presented must be used in cases where there is convection. One application in which Darken’s equations play an instrumental role is in analyzing the process of diffusion bonding. Diffusion bonding is used widely in manufacturing to connect two materials without using adhesives or welding techniques. Diffusion bonding works because atoms from both materials diffuse into the other material, resulting in a bond that is formed between the two materials. The diffusion of atoms between the two materials is achieved by placing the materials in contact with each other at high pressure and temperature, while not exceeding the melting temperature of either material. Darken’s equations, particularly Darken’s second equation, come into play when determining the diffusion coefficients for the two materials in the diffusion couple. Knowing the diffusion coefficients is necessary for predicting the flux of atoms between the two materials, which can then be used in numerical models of the diffusion bonding process, as, for example, was looked at in the paper by Orhan, Aksoy, and Eroglu when creating a model to determine the amount of time required to create a diffusion bond. In a similar manner, Darken’s equations were used in a paper by Wantabe et al., on the nickel-aluminum system, to verify the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients that were calculated for nickel aluminum alloys.|$|E

The <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients are evaluated as average values over selected regions of the diffusion zone by the method of moments developed by Dayananda and Sohn. ^ The program was assessed by determining the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients from a ternary test diffusion couple with known <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients; the evaluated coefficients agreed within 1 % of the known coefficients. The program was also used to analyze two sets of Cu-Ni-Zn single-phase diffusion couples annealed at 775 °C; one set with intersecting diffusion paths and the other with overlapping diffusion paths. For the intersecting couples, the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients calculated at the common composition of the intersection from each individual couple agreed with those determined by the Boltzmann-Matano analysis within 2 - 39 %. For the couples with overlapping diffusion paths, <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients calculated for each couple over the overlapping path segments agreed within 0 - 30 %. ^ New expressions relating the concentration profiles, <b>interdiffusion</b> fluxes, and <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients have been developed. The expressions were applied to one two-phase and several single phase Cu-Ni-Zn diffusion couples annealed at 775 °C as well as one single phase Fe-Ni-Al couple annealed at 1000 °C. Such applications showed that the ratio of the flux gradient to the concentration gradient of each component plotted against distance yielded overlapping straight lines with identical slopes. Effective <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients for the individual components were also calculated at selected locations within the diffusion zones of the various diffusion couples. ^ Additional expressions have also been developed to relate slopes of the diffusion path and ternary <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients at selected locations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{study of}} {{concentration}} dependent diffusion {{is important in}} the field of alloys and semiconductors. It is a key issue to calculate accurate <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficients using experimentally obtained concentration profiles. The Boltzmann-Matano (BM) method is often used for determining diffusion coefficients. But this technique has some shortcomings in calculating an accurate <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficient. Because of this, the Sauer and Freise (SF) method (which is a clever modification of the BM method) is more useful for calculating the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficient. The Hall Method (HM) was specifically designed for determining the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficient at the low and high concentration limits. In the present study, concentration profiles have been numerically generated as a solution to the <b>interdiffusion</b> problem in a binary system when the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficient is dependent on concentration. This has been done using an explicit finite difference method. A comparative study of the HM, BM and SF methods has been performed using the generated concentration profiles. This allows for a direct comparison between the SF, BM and HM techniques. Present results clearly indicate that the HM technique can only be applicable when the <b>interdiffusion</b> coefficient is constant (independent of concentration) or almost constant at the low concentration regions.
