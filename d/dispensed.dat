40|$|Khaled Aldhwaihi, Fabrizio Schifano, Cinzia Pezzolesi, Nkiruka Umaru Department of Pharmacy, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK Background: <b>Dispensing</b> {{errors are}} common in {{hospital}} pharmacies. Investigating <b>dispensing</b> errors is important for identifying the factors involved and developing strategies to reduce their occurrence. Objectives: To review published studies exploring the incidence and types of <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies and factors contributing to these errors. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and Web of Science were searched for articles published between January 2000 and January 2015. Inclusion criteria were: studies published in English, and studies investigating type, incidence and factors contributing to <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies. One researcher searched for all relevant published articles, screened all titles and abstracts, and obtained complete articles. A second researcher assessed the titles, abstracts, and complete articles to verify {{the reliability of the}} selected articles. Key findings: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria all of which were conducted in just four countries. Reviewing incident reports and direct observation were the main methods used to investigate <b>dispensing</b> errors. <b>Dispensing</b> error rates varied between countries (0. 015 %– 33. 5 %) depending on the <b>dispensing</b> system, research method, and classification of <b>dispensing</b> error types. The most frequent <b>dispensing</b> errors reported were <b>dispensing</b> the wrong medicine, <b>dispensing</b> the wrong drug strength, and <b>dispensing</b> the wrong dosage form. The most common factors associated with <b>dispensing</b> errors were: high workload, low staffing, mix-up of look-alike/sound-alike drugs, lack of knowledge/experience, distractions/interruptions, and communication problems within the dispensary team. Conclusion: Studies relating to <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies are few in number and have been conducted in just four countries. The majority of these studies focused on the investigation of <b>dispensing</b> error types with no mention of contributing factors or strategies for reducing <b>dispensing</b> errors. Others studies are thus needed to investigate <b>dispensing</b> errors in hospital pharmacies, and a combined approach is recommended to investigate contributing factors associated with <b>dispensing</b> errors and explore strategies for reducing these errors.

40|$|Powder {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most important parts in manufacturing industry when materials applied in large quantities of solid particles. <b>Dispensing</b> technology for powders can significantly improve operation efficiency in manufacturing processes. The powder <b>dispensing</b> technologies have a broad range of applications. The powders exhibit different flow behaviours due to different physical properties. This project aims to reveal the <b>dispensing</b> mechanism and pharmaceutical powder flow behaviour in a designed <b>dispensing</b> hopper under the ultrasonic mechanical vibration, and to develop a powder dosing system to achieve the precise <b>dispensing</b> of pharmaceutical powders. The experimental work focuses on the <b>dispensing</b> device design and pharmaceutical powder <b>dispensing</b> tests by using ultrasonic vibration dosing system. The experimental results indicate that the ultrasonic vibration dosing system is capable of fast (less than one second) and precise (RSD< 5 %) pharmaceutical powder <b>dispensing</b> in small-dose (milligram scale) and large-dose (gram scale). A dome-control mechanism is identified in the ultrasonic vibration <b>dispensing</b> process. Powder dome formed in the <b>dispensing</b> hopper as a “valve” of powder flow under the ultrasonic vibration. The <b>dispensing</b> results represent that the parameters of <b>dispensing</b> hopper, i. e. orifice size, hopper angle, and working voltage signal, i. e. vibration duration, are the critical factors for the powder flow rate and dosage uniformity of the <b>dispensing.</b> Additionally, the working voltage signal properties and mechanical vibration performance are investigated in the ultrasonic vibration <b>dispensing</b> device by using the digital oscilloscope and the 3 D scanning vibrometer...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} installing an original-pack automated <b>dispensing</b> system (ADS) on dispensary workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents in a hospital pharmacy. Methods: Data on dispensary workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents, defined as <b>dispensing</b> errors detected and reported before medication had left the pharmacy, were collected over 6 weeks at a National Health Service hospital in Wales before and after the installation of an ADS. Workload was measured by non-participant observation using the event recording technique. Prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents were self-reported by pharmacy staff on standardised forms. Median workloads (measured as items dispensed/person/hour) were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests and rate of prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents were compared using Chi-square test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to examine the association between workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents. A P value of ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Key findings Median dispensary workload was significantly lower pre-automation (9. 20 items/person/h) compared to post-automation (13. 17 items/person/h, P < 0. 001). Rate of prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents was significantly lower post-automation (0. 28 %) than pre-automation (0. 64 %, P < 0. 0001) but there was no difference (P = 0. 277) between the types of <b>dispensing</b> incidents. A positive association existed between workload and prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents both pre- (ρ = 0. 13, P = 0. 015) and post-automation (ρ = 0. 23, P < 0. 001). <b>Dispensing</b> incidents were found to occur during prolonged periods of moderate workload or after a busy period. Conclusion: Study findings suggest that automation improves <b>dispensing</b> efficiency and reduces the rate of prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents. It is proposed that prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents frequently occurred during periods of high workload due to involuntary automaticity. Prevented <b>dispensing</b> incidents occurring after a busy period were attributed to staff experiencing fatigue after-effects...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of biological analytical techniques and high throughput screening techniques, {{a large number of}} automated biological agents <b>dispensing</b> systems are widely used in the field of life science research. Non-contact <b>dispensing</b> method characterized by its small <b>dispensing</b> volume, high <b>dispensing</b> precision and quick service speed which satisfies the requirements of biological agent’s distribution, becomes the mainstream <b>dispensing</b> method used in reagent <b>dispensing</b> systems. However, the difficult control way, complex system of non-contact <b>dispensing</b> method and its vulnerable <b>dispensing</b> process, which can be easily affected by characteristics of the agent, have hindered the application and development of the method. In this study, simulation model of the separation process of micro scale biological reagent are constructed in order to solve the above problems. The prerequisites of the non-contact <b>dispensing</b> method, the relationship between <b>dispensing</b> volume and precision and characteristics of reagents, formation of system and control parameters are researched through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.

40|$|Objectives: To identify, {{review and}} {{evaluate}} the published literature on the incidence, type and causes of <b>dispensing</b> errors in community and hospital pharmacy. Method: Electronic databases were searched from 1966 to February 2008. This was supplemented by hand-searching the bibliographies of retrieved articles. Analysis of the findings explored the research methods, operational definitions, incidence, type and causes of <b>dispensing</b> errors. Key findings: Sixty papers were identified investigating <b>dispensing</b> errors in the UK, US, Australia, Spain and Brazil. In general, the incidence of <b>dispensing</b> errors varied depending on the study setting, <b>dispensing</b> system, research method and operational definitions. The most common <b>dispensing</b> errors identified by community and hospital pharmacies were <b>dispensing</b> the wrong drug, strength, form or quantity, or labelling medication with the incorrect directions. Factors subjectively reported as contributing to <b>dispensing</b> errors were look-alike, sound-alike drugs, low staffing and computer software. High workload, interruptions, distractions and inadequate lighting were objectively shown to increase the occurrence of <b>dispensing</b> errors. Conclusions: Comparison of the reviewed studies was confounded by differences in study setting, research method and operational definitions for <b>dispensing</b> errors, error rate and classification of error types. The World Health Organization is currently developing global patient safety taxonomy. Such a standardized taxonomy for <b>dispensing</b> errors would facilitate consistent data collection and assist the development of error-reduction strategies...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -axis <b>dispensing</b> {{system is}} {{utilized}} {{to control the}} initiating and terminating fiber positions and trajectory via the <b>dispensing</b> software. The polymer fiber length and orientation {{is defined by the}} spatial positioning of the <b>dispensing</b> system 3 -axis stages. The fiber diameter is defined by the prescribed <b>dispense</b> time of the <b>dispensing</b> system valve, the feed rate (the speed at which the stage traverses from an initiating to a terminating position), the gauge diameter of the <b>dispensing</b> tip, the viscosity and surface tension of the polymer solution, and the programmed drawing length. The stage feed rate affects the polymer solution’s evaporation rate and capillary breakup of the filaments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To examine {{differences}} in prescribing between <b>dispensing</b> and non-dispensing practices. SETTING [...] The 108 practices covered by Lincolnshire Family Health Services Authority. DESIGN [...] Analysis of prescribing data for 1990 - 1 from PD 2 {{reports from the}} Prescription Pricing Authority in relation to data on practice characteristics obtained from Lincolnshire Family Health Services Authority; and aggregated level 3 prescribing and cost information (PACT data) for 10 selected drugs from the Prescription Pricing Authority to examine amounts prescribed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prescribing cost per patient, items per patient, and cost per item in <b>dispensing</b> and non-dispensing practices. RESULTS [...] <b>Dispensing</b> practices had higher prescribing costs per patient than non-dispensing practices. This difference held for non-dispensing patients within <b>dispensing</b> practices. Structural features failed to explain the {{differences in}} prescribing cost, except for the higher numbers of elderly patients in <b>dispensing</b> practices (which explained 13 % of the difference) {{and the number of}} partners (5 %). The main determinant of the difference was the lower use of generic drugs in <b>dispensing</b> practices (84 %). <b>Dispensing</b> patients were prescribed lower quantities of drugs on average for each item. CONCLUSIONS [...] <b>Dispensing</b> practices could reduce their prescribing expenditure to that of non-dispensing practices by increasing their prescribing of generic drugs. The shorter prescribing intervals for <b>dispensing</b> patients may be due to <b>dispensing</b> fees being related to the number of prescribed items...|$|R

Then, we empirically investigate the impact of <b>dispensing</b> practices on antibiotic consumption by means of combined spatial-lag and spatial-error econometric estimators for panel data (SARAR). The investigation exploits data from small geographic areas {{in a country where}} both regimes - with and without <b>dispensing</b> physicians - are possible. We find evidence that <b>dispensing</b> practices increase antibiotic use after controlling for determinants of demand and access, and spatial effects.
