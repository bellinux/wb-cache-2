500|$|August 27–28, 2011— Hurricane Irene makes {{landfall}} on Coney Island as {{a tropical}} storm with winds of 70mph (110km/h). Storm surge reaches underneath the boardwalks in both Coney Island and Long Beach. and the Hudson River also flooded. Top recorded winds reach 70mph {{at the height of}} the storm and left 400,000 without power. The storm also killed five people in the state and had a major impact on Upstate NY. [...] The storm caused the National Weather Service in Albany, NY to issue a Tropical Storm Warning for the local <b>forecast</b> <b>area.</b> [...] This had never been done before, and actually required a breach in protocol to achieve. [...] Prior to this event, the Albany, NY <b>forecast</b> <b>area</b> was considered outside of the valid area for Tropical Storm warnings.|$|E
