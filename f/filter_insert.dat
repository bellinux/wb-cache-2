40|$|The {{treatment}} of dissolved phosphorus and metals in runoff requires specialized filtration media, which, however, is not {{accounted for in}} the typical swale ditch check designs currently employed. In this project, ditch checks with iron-enhanced sand <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> were developed to increase the retention of phosphate and dissolved metals in roadside swales and ditches. The iron-enhanced swale ditch checks were designed and installed as part of roadway projects of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) and City of Roseville. The effectiveness of the ditch checks was investigated by field testing using synthetic runoff, and field monitoring during natural rainfall events in Fall 2014 and from Spring to Summer 2015. A ditch check containing no enhanced media was also monitored for comparison. The MnDOT iron-enhanced ditch check provided consistent phosphate mass reductions during 15 rainfall events (33 % mean; 37 % median). The cumulative phosphate mass removal was 35 %. Metal reductions were largely negative, possibly due to leaching of metals from the filter media. The Roseville iron-enhanced ditch check exhibited 47 %, 43 %, 26 % phosphate removal and 14 % zinc removal under different field testing scenarios. The ditch check without the iron-enhanced sand <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> showed no phosphate removal but retention of metals in the top soil cover. Since the iron-enhanced ditch check monitoring excluded the effect of top soil, it can be presumed that an iron-enhanced ditch check will retain metals in the soil covering the ditch check and retain phosphate in the filter section. The project results were utilized to develop typical design recommendations for future applications of the iron-enhanced ditch check. U. S.

40|$|The {{productive}} {{infection of}} human monocyte-derived macrophages (Mφ) by HIV was suppressed by primary CD 8 + cells from asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals. This anti-HIV response was noncytotoxic; {{removal of the}} CD 8 + cells from the infected Mφ leads to virus production. CD 8 + cells inhibited HIV replication when separated from the infected Mφ by a transwell <b>filter</b> <b>insert,</b> indicating a diffusible factor made by the CD 8 + cells suppressed productive infection of Mφ. Three β-chemokines, which can be secreted by activated CD 8 + cells, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 α and MIP- 1 β prevented HIV replication in the Mφ cultures. In addition, incubation of acutely infected Mφ {{with a mixture of}} neutralizing antibodies to RANTES, MIP- 1 α, and MIP- 1 β enhanced virus replication. Nevertheless, neutralization of β-chemokines with specific antibodies did not abolish the suppression by CD 8 + cells of HIV replication in Mφ. Thus, even though β-chemokines decrease HIV replication in Mφ, these cytokines are not responsible for the ability of CD 8 + cells to inhibit HIV production in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{metastasis}} {{of breast}} cancer induces severe osteolysis with increased bone resorption. Osteoclast differentiation regulated by the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) in osteoblasts and matrix degradation induced by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) {{are thought to be}} involved in the process of bone resorption. When nude mice were inoculated with human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB- 231 (MDA- 231), numerous osteoclasts resorbed bone and the degradation of the bone matrix markedly progressed in the femur and tibia with metastasis of the MDA- 231 tumour. The expression of RANKL, MMP- 13 and membrane-type 1 -MMP mRNA was markedly elevated in bone with metastasis. When MDA- 231 cells were cocultured with mouse calvaria, MDA- 231 markedly induced bone resorption measured by calcium release from the calvaria, and the expression of RANKL, MMP- 2 and MMP- 13 was elevated in the calvaria after the coculture. The separation of MDA- 231 from the calvaria using <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> showed decreased bone resorption, suggesting that cell-to-cell interaction is essential for cancer-induced bone resorption. Adding MDA- 231 cells to bone marrow cultures markedly induced osteoclast formation, and the expression of RANKL in osteoblasts was enhanced by contact with the cell surface of MDA- 231 cells. These results indicate that RANKL-induced osteoclast formation and MMP-dependent matrix degradation are associated with osteolysis because of bone metastasis {{of breast cancer}}...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThat {{promising}} neuroprotectants {{failed to}} demonstrate benefit against stroke highlights the great difficulties to translate preclinical pharmacological effects in clinical outcomes. Part of this hurdle implies the complex response to injury of the neurovascular unit increasing the cerebrovascular permeability {{at the level}} of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Previous studies reported neuroprotection in animal models upon activation of the nuclear receptor PPARα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) α, but the cellular targets at the BBB level remain largely unexplored. Here, to study whether PPAR-α activation acts on BBB permeability, we adapted a mouse BBB cell model to ischaemic conditions at the stage of occlusion defined in vitro as oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). This model consists of a co-culture of brain capillary endothelial cells (ECs) on a <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> placed upon a rat glial cell culture. The EC monolayer permeability increase induced by 4 h of OGD was significantly restricted after treatment with the PPAR-α agonist fenofibric acid (FA) 24 h before or at the onset of OGD. Treatments of separated ECs or glial cells showed that this protective effect was conferred by BBB ECs but not glial cells. Furthermore, co-cultures with ECs from PPAR-α-deficient mice revealed that FA had no effect on OGD-induced hyperpermeability. No transcriptional modulation of classical PPAR-α target genes such as SOD, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, ACO, CPT- 1, PDK- 4 or ET- 1 was observed in wild type mouse ECs. In conclusion, these results suggest that part of the preventive PPAR-α-mediated protection may occur via BBB ECs by limiting hyperpermeability...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrug {{and gene}} {{delivery}} via nanoparticles across biological barriers {{such as the}} alveolar-capillary barrier of the lung constitutes an interesting and increasingly relevant field in nanomedicine. Nevertheless, potential hazardous effects of nanoparticles (NPs) {{as well as their}} cellular and systemic fate should be thoroughly examined. Hence, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the effects of amorphous silica NPs (Sicastar) and (poly) organosiloxane NPs (AmOrSil) on the viability and the inflammatory response as well as on the cellular uptake mechanisms and fate in cells of the alveolar barrier. For this purpose, the alveolar epithelial cell line (NCI H 441) and microvascular endothelial cell line (ISO-HAS- 1) were used in an experimental set up resembling the alveolar-capillary barrier of the lung. In terms of IL- 8 and sICAM Sicastar resulted in harmful effects at higher concentrations (60 μg/ml) in conventional monocultures but not in the coculture, whereas AmOrSil showed no significant effects. Immunofluorescence counterstaining of endosomal structures in NP-incubated cells showed no evidence for a clathrin- or caveolae-mediated uptake mechanism. However, NPs were enclosed in flotillin- 1 and - 2 marked vesicles in both cell types. Flotillins appear to play a role in cellular uptake or trafficking mechanisms of NPs and are discussed as indicators for clathrin- or caveolae-independent uptake mechanisms. In addition, we examined the transport of NPs across this in vitro model of the alveolar-capillary barrier forming a tight barrier with a transepithelial electrical resistance of 560 ± 8 Ωcm 2. H 441 in coculture with endothelial cells took up much less NPs compared to monocultures. Moreover, coculturing prevented the transport of NP from the epithelial compartment to the endothelial layer on the bottom of the <b>filter</b> <b>insert.</b> This supports the relevance of coculture models, which favour a differentiated and polarised epithelial layer as in vitro test systems for nanoparticle uptake...|$|E
40|$|The lipid A {{portion of}} the {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) molecule of gram-negative bacteria {{has the ability to}} turn on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in macrophage cells. The question addressed in this paper was whether the presence of the polysaccharide moiety on the LPS molecule had any bearing on this ability. The question was asked (i) by using isolated LPS from a series of Salmonella mutants having progressively less polysaccharide attached to the lipid A {{portion of the}} molecule and (ii) by using whole bacteria expressing alternatively the smooth or rough LPS phenotype. Isolated LPS and bacteria were examined for their abilities to induce bioactive TNF in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. The results indicated that the presence of long- or short-chain polysaccharide moieties had no bearing on the ability of the isolated LPS molecule to induce TNF. However, the presence of long-chain polysaccharides attached to the lipid moiety on the intact smooth bacterium was associated with a decreased ability to induce TNF. To test whether the bacteria were inducing TNF by a cell (bacterium) -to-cell (macrophage) contact mechanism or through a releasable product, the bacteria were removed from direct contact with the macrophage cells by using a Transwell <b>filter</b> <b>insert.</b> Under these conditions the rough bacteria continued to induce TNF, while the smooth bacteria were no longer capable of doing so. When filtrates from the bacteria were examined in the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, the results showed that the rough bacteria were releasing approximately a log order more Limulus amebocyte lysate activity than the smooth bacteria. The {{results of this study suggest}} that rough bacteria may be superior inducers of TNF compared with their smooth counterparts because of a greater propensity to shed their LPS...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of installing biocidal beads into a catch basin <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> for simultaneous stormwater disinfection and contaminant removal was tested. The catch basin <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> (DrainPac®) was tested for its sediment, oil and grease, and coliform bacteria removal efficiency {{in conjunction with}} bench-scale testing of biocidal polymer beads. DrainPac® catch basin filters are composed of a metal frame, polypropylene filter fabric, and a high-density polymer support basket, and are installed below storm drains. A 12 x 41 in. DrainPac® filter (United Stormwater, Inc.) insert was set in a flume that simulated a large-scale catchment basin. Pond water was gravity fed to the flume at flow rates up to 200 gpm. The pond water contained fine sediments at concentrations ranging from 30 - 50 mg/L. The biocidal beads were tested in a small laboratory column for potential application to stormwater treatment. The head loss through the clean <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> varied from 0. 5 cm at 20 gpm to 9. 1 cm at 200 gpm. Head loss of 21. 5 cm occurred after 625 g of solids {{were added to the}} filter at 200 gpm at which point water began bypassing the filter fabric and flowing through the mesh screen. The highest flow rate that could be filtered through the loaded filter was 80 gpm. The DrainPac® filter removed total suspended solids with efficiencies ranging from 83 % to 91 % at flow rates of 20 to 200 gpm, with higher removal efficiencies at lower flow rates. The oil and grease removal efficiency of the DrainPac® filter ranged from 40 % to 82 %. The DrainPac® filter exhibited no removal of coliform bacteria under these test conditions. Biocidal brominated polystyrene beads, developed by Dr. S. D. Worley at Auburn University, were tested in a 1 -cm diameter laboratory column apparatus for leaching of bromine compounds, which is important for determining if the filters will meet water quality regulations of the receiving waters. Removal efficiencies of coliform bacteria were tested in a companion study by Cal Poly graduate student Alex Bowerman. Pond water was passed through a 1 -cm thick bed of beads in an up-flow direction. Leachate was analyzed for bromine, bromide, and bromoform. Leaching from both 0. 3 -mm and 0. 8 -mm biocidal beads was tested in the column apparatus. Samples collected for bromoform analysis were quenched with sodium thiosulfate, and the time before samples were quenched had a drastic effect on bromoform concentrations. Samples quenched after the collection of the total sample were assumed to be the most realistic for stormwater conditions since stormwater entering catch basins isn’t immediately discharged into its receiving waters. Effluent from a 1 -cm bed of 0. 3 -mm beads at 0. 56 mL/sec contained the following average concentrations: 0. 47 mg/L bromine, 2. 45 mg/L bromoform, and 0. 53 mg/L bromide. The same conditions for 0. 8 mm beads resulted in effluent containing the following average concentrations: 0. 27 mg/L bromine, 0. 06 mg/L bromoform, and 0. 50 mg/L bromide. The much lower concentrations of bromine measured in the 0. 8 -mm bead leachate was likely due to the greater surface area of the smaller beads. The greater leaching of bromoform from the 0. 3 mm beads may be partly attributed to the greater surface area of the smaller beads, but also the manufacturer of the beads reported that different production methods were used for the 0. 3 mm beads. Higher bromine compound concentrations were found at lower flow rates, due to the longer contact times with the beads. Deionized (DI) water that was used to initially wet the biocidal beads before passing pond water through the column was also analyzed for bromoform. The DI flush water from the 0. 3 mm beads contained 1. 25 mg/L bromoform at a flow rate of 0. 28 mL/sec. Bromoform concentrations in the DI flush water from the 0. 8 mm beads at the same flow rate were below detection. Bromoform is expected to be formed as bromine is reduced to bromide by the presence of organics. Since there are no organics present in DI water to form such high concentrations of bromoform as those found from the 0. 3 -mm bead DI flush water, it appears that bromoform could have leached {{from the surface of the}} 0. 3 mm beads. The longevity of the bromine treatment of the biocidal beads was tested on one set of 0. 3 -mm beads by simulating five use cycles, and also by testing another set of beads after dry storage. Each use cycle was simulated by pumping pond water through a 1 -cm bed of 0. 3 mm beads at 0. 56 mL/sec for one hour and then connecting the column to an air pump to dry for 23 hours. After five simulated uses, leachate from the beads showed only a slight reduction in concentrations of bromine and bromide (21 % and 4 % less than fresh beads, respectively), while the concentration of bromoform was nearly 100 times less. The drastic decrease in bromoform concentration suggests that after five simulated uses, much of the bromoform was exhausted or conditions for the formation of bromoform were no longer present. For the dry storage test, 0. 3 mm beads were wetted with 1 -L DI water and then stored dry for 162 days. Then pond water was pumped through the column at 0. 56 mL/sec and the leachate was analyzed. After dry storage for 162 days, the leachate showed no reduction in bromine concentrations compared to fresh beads, a 97 % reduction in bromoform, and a 30 % increase in bromide concentrations. This significant reduction in bromoform could be due to the volatilization of bromoform off the surface of the 0. 3 mm beads during dry storage. The 0. 3 mm beads are no longer being manufactured, and leachate from the 0. 8 mm beads contained bromoform at concentrations below the potable drinking water maximum contaminant level of 80 µg/L. Under all tested conditions, bromine, bromide, and bromoform are present in the leachate from the biocidal beads, and thus their applicability for stormwater disinfection depends on the longevity of the bromine compounds in receiving waters, and on the regulations governing these compounds...|$|E
40|$|North Dakota lignite-fired {{power plants}} {{have shown a}} limited ability to control mercury {{emissions}} in currently installed electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), dry scrubbers, and wet scrubbers (1). This low level of control {{can be attributed to}} the high proportions of Hg{sup 0 } present in the flue gas. Speciation of Hg in flue gases analyzed as part of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) information collection request (ICR) for Hg data showed that Hg{sup 0 } ranged from 56 % to 96 % and oxidized mercury ranged from 4 % to 44 %. The Hg emitted from power plants firing North Dakota lignites ranged from 45 % to 91 % of the total Hg, with the emitted Hg being greater than 85 % elemental. The higher levels of oxidized mercury were only found in a fluidized-bed combustion system. Typically, the form of Hg in the pulverized and cyclone-fired units was dominated by Hg{sup 0 } at greater than 85 %, and the average amount of Hg{sup 0 } emitted from North Dakota power plants was 6. 7 lb/TBtu (1, 2). The overall objective of this Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) project is to develop and evaluate advanced and innovative concepts for controlling Hg emissions from North Dakota lignite-fired power plants by 50 %- 90 % at costs of one-half to three-fourths of current estimated costs. The specific objectives are focused on determining the feasibility of the following technologies: Hg oxidation for increased Hg capture in wet and dry scrubbers, incorporation of additives and technologies that enhance Hg sorbent effectiveness in ESPs and baghouses, the use of amended silicates in lignite-derived flue gases for Hg capture, and the use of Hg adsorbents within a baghouse. The scientific approach to solving the problems associated with controlling Hg emissions from lignite-fired power plants involves conducting testing of the following processes and technologies that have shown promise on a bench, pilot, or field scale: (1) activated carbon injection (ACI) upstream of an ESP combined with sorbent enhancement, (2) Hg oxidation and control using wet and dry scrubbers, (3) enhanced oxidation at a full-scale power plant using tire-derived fuel (TDF) and oxidizing catalysts, and (4) testing of Hg control technologies in the Advanced Hybrid{trademark} <b>filter</b> <b>insert...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Exposure Assessment Pro- gram {{provides}} {{national and}} inter- national {{leadership in the}} development and use of effective exposure assessment tools to pre- vent work-related illness and in- jury. This snapshot shows recent accomplishments and upcoming work. What are our priorities? The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Exposure Assessment Program works with partners in industry, labor, trade associations, professional organizations, and academia. The program focuses on promoting the use of 21 st century exposure assessment sensors, methods, and processes. What do we do? 1. Develop guidance for how to conduct exposure assessments in all types of occupational settings. Exposure assessments help identify who is exposed, how they are exposed (air, water, skin contact), how much exposure occurs, how often, and the duration of exposure. 2. Develop new or improved sensors for assessing exposure to make it easier and quicker to identify and measure exposures. 3. Develop new or improved assessment methods to ensure that exposure measure-ments are accurate and able to detect lower levels of agents in the workplace. What have we accomplished? 1. Published NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods (NMAM) Method 0501, "Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated," which accurately measures nuisance dusts. 2. Published NMAM Method 5100, "Carbon Black," which more accurately measures the fine carbon powder that {{can be found in the}} air when petroleum products are not completely burned. 3. Published NMAM Method 8319, "Acetone and Methylethyl Ketone in Urine. " These two chemicals are used in a wide variety of industrial processes. 4. Published NMAM Method 8322, "Trichloroacetic Acid in Urine," which detects a metabolite of trichloroethylene that occurs from inhaling this industrial solvent or swallowing trichloroethylene-contaminated water. 5. Published a method on a new sensor for hazardous drug exposure. It enables rapid assessment of unknown spills of hazardous drugs in the pharmacy or treatment areas of healthcare facilities. Current methods to measure for spills can take weeks to analyze, but this new sensor checks for hazardous drugs in just a few minutes, so workers can be protected sooner. 6. Published guidance on using biomarkers of effect to set occupational exposure limits. This is one of a series of NIOSH documents to understand factors that can or cannot be reliably used to assess risk and set standards. 7. Published NMAM method 7306, "ELEMENTS by Cellulosic Internal Capsule Sampler and ICP-AES. " It uses an analyzable <b>filter</b> <b>insert</b> to improve reporting accuracy for 33 elements by collecting material that may have adhered to the sampler wall and making that material available for analysis. What's next? 1. Refine the NMAM method for total isocyanates, at OSHA's request. Isocyanates are potent irritants and sensitizers which are increasingly used in the automobile industry, for auto body repair, and in insulation for buildings. Current methods underreport isocyanate levels, and a refined method will more accurately assess exposure levels. 2.

30|$|Our {{measurements}} {{show that}} the error-free bit rate of HSDPA may significantly decline during the WiFi transmission, sometimes down to {{a small fraction of}} the rate observed in the absence of the WiFi interference, which leads to an early loss of connection. A SPART <b>filter</b> <b>inserted</b> early in the signal processing chain of the receiver (before baseband) can recover a noticeable portion of the lost rate, and enables to maintain an error-free connection under much higher levels of the WiFi interference than a receiver that does not contain such a filter.|$|R
5000|$|Report filter is used {{to apply}} a filter to an entire table. For example, if the [...] "Color of Item" [...] field is dragged to this area, then the table {{constructed}} will have a report <b>filter</b> <b>inserted</b> above the table. This report filter will have drop-down options (Black, Red, and White in the example above). When an option is chosen from this drop-down list ("Black" [...] in this example), then the table that would be visible will contain only the data from those rows that have the [...] "Color of Item = Black".|$|R
50|$|There is a {{wide array}} of {{different}} types of waveguide filters. Many of them consist of a chain of coupled resonators of some kind that can be modelled as a ladder network of LC circuits. One of the most common types consists of a number of coupled resonant cavities. Even within this type, there are many subtypes, mostly differentiated by the means of coupling. These coupling types include apertures, irises, and posts. Other waveguide filter types include dielectric resonator <b>filters,</b> <b>insert</b> <b>filters,</b> finline filters, corrugated-waveguide filters, and stub filters. A number of waveguide components have filter theory applied to their design, but their purpose is something other than to filter signals. Such devices include impedance matching components, directional couplers, and diplexers. These devices frequently take on the form of a filter, at least in part.|$|R

Until lately, such filters have been unremovable. In a recent case, however, we treated a patient who experienced acute massive pulmonary embolism after having undergone an emergency right hemicolectomy. He underwent a successful emergency pulmonary embolectomy with the help of cardio-pulmonary bypass; to prevent recurrent embolism, we inserted a removable intracaval filter through the right atriotomy with an introducer set. On the 7 th postoperative day, the absence of significant residual thrombi was confirmed by means of phlebography, and the caval filter was removed percutaneously via the femoral approach...|$|R
30|$|Typical {{means of}} {{isolating}} fluorescence emission {{include the use}} of optical filters. Using a low-, high-, band-pass, or other <b>filters</b> <b>inserted</b> prior to the receiving detector (i.e. CMOS array sensor, the most common camera used for smartphones) increases selectivity of emitted fluorescent light. Not only can these filters differentiate wavelengths, but can also serve as a mechanical method for controlling unwanted scattering and diffracting light. Two types of optical filters are commonly used for fluorescence detection. The first type is an absorption filter, in which absorption at the excitation wavelength is desirable and absorption at the emission wavelength is undesirable. In contrast, an interference filter has low absorption at the excitation wavelength and high absorption at the emission wavelength.|$|R

Cells were allowed to migrate for 24 h in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, and 3 replicates were performed for each line. After incubation, the <b>filter</b> <b>inserts</b> were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and then the migrated cells were stained by purple crystal 30 min at room temperature.

30|$|Ohsawa et al. [34] {{proposed}} a one-shot 6 -band HDTV camera system. In their system, {{the light is}} divided into two optical paths by a half-mirror and is incident on two conventional CCD cameras after transmission through the specially designed interference <b>filters</b> <b>inserted</b> in each optical path. The two HDTV cameras capture three-band images in sync to compose each frame of the six band image. The total spectral sensitivities of the six band camera are the combination of spectral characteristics of the optical components: the objective lens, the half-mirror, the IR cutoff filter, the interference filters, the CCD sensors, etc. This system needs custom designed filters and complex optics making it still far from being practical.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{entanglement}} distillation and purification {{scheme for}} symmetric two-mode entangled Gaussian states that allows to asymptotically extract a pure entangled Gaussian state from any input entangled symmetric Gaussian state. The proposed scheme is a modified and extended {{version of the}} entanglement distillation protocol originally developed by [Browne et al., Phys. Rev. A 67, 062320 (2003) ]. A key feature of the present protocol is that it utilizes a two-copy de-Gaussification procedure that involves a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with single-mode non-Gaussian <b>filters</b> <b>inserted</b> in its two arms. The required non-Gaussian filtering operations can be implemented by coherently combining two sequences of single-photon addition and subtraction operations.
