40|$|Objective: Subjects {{were exposed}} to {{cumulated}} partial sleep deprivation (psd), alcohol intake and hypoxia in a sequential design to examine the impact on neurobehavioral performance. Methods: Sixteen healthy male volunteers were enrolled {{in this study and}} were exposed in turn, after adaptation and baseline measurements, to one day of periods of hypoxia, one day of alcohol intake and one day for recovering (with 8 h time in bed TIB). Subsequently the exposition of those conditions is that the subjects spent 5 h night restriction daily <b>for</b> <b>four</b> consecutive <b>days,</b> followed by two recovery days. Performance was tested five (or six) times per day with reaction time task (SRT) and unstable tracking task (UTT). Results: The performance impairment showed to be cumulative in both tests over the <b>four</b> sleep deprivation <b>days</b> and differed significantly from baseline. Corresponding performance deficits {{under the influence of the}} stressors were <b>for</b> SRT: <b>four</b> <b>days</b> psd, 13 % O 2 concentration and a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of around 0. 4 – 0. 6 ‰ <b>for</b> UTT: <b>four</b> <b>days</b> psd, 13 % O 2 concentration and a BAC of around 0. 6 ‰. One night of 8 h sleep restored performance nearly to baseline level. Conclusions: A sleeping time of 5 h per night <b>for</b> <b>four</b> consecutive <b>days</b> impairs performance in such a way that traffic safety may be compromised...|$|R
