50|$|Wason’s chosen professions {{were the}} law and politics. He was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1870 and practised on the Northern Circuit. Whether he did not at first take to being <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or perhaps just to gain greater legal experience, in 1872 Wason was <b>disbarred</b> as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> {{at his own request}} in order to become a solicitor. He was {{admitted}} as a solicitor in 1876, becoming a partner in Williams, James & Wason until 1885. Again at his own request, Wason was struck off the Rolls in 1886, ceasing to be a solicitor, in order to gain readmission {{as a member of the}} Bar the following week. This was deemed a unique experience, Wason having been both disbarred and struck off the Rolls, but each time at his own request. From 1878-1882, Wason served as Assistant Examiner to the Incorporated Law Society in Common Law.|$|R

5000|$|After gaining ten years' {{experience}} as <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> or government counsel in Hong Kong, <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> admitted in Hong Kong may apply {{to become a}} Senior Counsel (S.C.).

25|$|Despite its name, Section IV also {{contains}} provisions referring to barristers. Before {{the passing of}} the act there was no contractual relationship between <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and the instructing solicitor, or between <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> and his client. This made it very difficult to obtain damages or recover money if there was <b>a</b> problem. <b>A</b> <b>barrister</b> was paid only as a matter of honour—there was no contract requiring that he be paid for his services, and no way of gaining his fee if he was not. The way that the legal profession got around this was by making it an act of professional misconduct for a solicitor not to pay the fees of <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> in <b>a</b> case.|$|R

5000|$|The {{difference}} between [...] "Barrister" [...] and [...] "Counsel" [...] is subtle.

[...] "Counsel" [...] is used to refer to <b>a</b> <b>barrister</b> who is instructed on a particular case.
