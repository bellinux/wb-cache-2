50|$|The <b>jointer</b> <b>plane</b> (also {{known as}} the try plane or trying plane) {{is a type of}} hand plane used {{primarily}} to straighten the edges of boards in the operation known as jointing. A <b>jointer</b> <b>plane</b> may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the <b>jointer</b> <b>plane</b> is usually preceded by the fore plane or jack plane and followed by the smoothing plane.|$|E

5000|$|The jointer derives {{its name}} from its primary {{function}} of producing flat edges on boards prior to joining them edge-to-edge to produce wider boards. The use of this term probably arises from {{the name of a}} type of hand plane, the <b>jointer</b> <b>plane,</b> which is also used primarily for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, the {{functions}} of the <b>jointer</b> and thickness <b>planer</b> are often combined into a single machine. In the U.K. this is called a planer-thicknesser or over-and-under.|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} bench planes are {{designed}} to perform different tasks, with the name {{and size of the}} plane being defined by the use. Bailey iron bench planes were designated by number respective to the length of the plane. This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. A typical smoothing plane (approx. nine inches) is usually a No. 4, jack planes at about fourteen inches are No. 5, an eighteen inch foreplane will be a No. 6, and the <b>jointer</b> <b>planes</b> at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8 respectively. A designation, such as No. 4½ indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation, such as 5-1/2 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation, such as 5-1/4 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3). [...] "Bedrock" [...] versions of the above are simply 600 added to the base number (although no [...] "601" [...] was ever produced, such plane is indeed available from specialist dealers; 602 through 608, including all the fractionals, were made).|$|R
2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer <b>jointer,</b> <b>planer,</b> shaper or boring features. The blade arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|R
5000|$|A scrub {{plane is}} {{generally}} used in diagonal strokes {{across the face}} of a board, rather than parallel to the length of the board (along the grain) as with most other bench planes. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the scrub plane is usually followed by the jack plane, <b>jointer</b> <b>plane,</b> then smoothing plane.|$|E
5000|$|In {{preparing}} stock, {{the jack}} plane is used after the scrub plane {{and before the}} <b>jointer</b> <b>plane</b> and smoothing plane. The name {{is related to the}} saying [...] "jack of all trades" [...] as jack planes can be made to perform some of the work of both smoothing and jointer planes, especially on smaller pieces of work.|$|E
50|$|Edge {{jointing}} or just jointing is {{the process}} of making the edge of a wooden board straight and true in preparation for subsequent operations, often ultimately leading to joining two or more components together. Traditionally, jointing was performed using a <b>jointer</b> <b>plane.</b> Modern techniques include the use of a jointer machine, a hand held router and straight edge, or a table-mounted router.|$|E

Along the south wall is the miter bench and storage unit, radial arm saw, and (not seen in episodes) a computer, a TV, {{and a small}} office area. The east wall of the shop has a {{staircase}} leading to a loft area, jig storage, horizontal edge sander, and dust collector. The north wall houses sheet goods, router table, bar clamps, Timesaver wide belt sander, <b>planer,</b> <b>jointer,</b> band saw, and various mobile tools. The center area of the shop consists of the table saw and associated outfeed tables {{as well as a}} large assembly table. In the northeast section of the building is a separate finishing room.|$|R
5000|$|Finger {{planes are}} used for final {{trimming}} work after glue-up, particularly around curved edges and to level inlays across curved instrument tops. They are thus small in length, as {{they do not need}} to span a wide area as a <b>jointer</b> <b>plane</b> does. They are also narrow in blade width, as they are meant for trimming the edges of thin boards, or for scrubbing small areas when graduating the thickness of arched soundboards. Some have flat bases, for convex work; the more distinctive have curved bases for concave surfaces. They are made with soles in a range of curvatures and a typical workshop will have several, of varying curvature.|$|E
