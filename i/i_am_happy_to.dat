25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> be able {{to inform}} you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to San Clemente, California, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, La Casa Pacifica, Pat Nixon rarely appeared {{in public and}} only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the Patricia Nixon Elementary School. In her remarks, she said, [...] "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> tell you that I'm not gone—I mean, not really gone." [...] It was Pat's only solo public appearance in {{five and a half}} years in California.|$|E
500|$|Discrimination also {{extended}} to those {{killed during the}} war. In one notable case, {{the owner of a}} funeral parlor refused to allow the family of Private Felix Longoria, a soldier killed in action in the Philippines, to use his facility because [...] "whites would not like it". Then-U.S. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson and Hector P. Garcia, the Mexican-American World War II veteran who founded the American G.I. Forum, intervened on Longoria's behalf. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, Congressman John Lyle, and President Truman's military aide Gen. Harry H. Vaughan joined the Longoria family for a full military burial with honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 16, 1949. Johnson stated of the incident, [...] "This injustice and prejudice is deplorable. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> have a part seeing that this Texas hero is laid to rest with the honor and dignity his service deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> not have to do it these days".|$|E

500|$|Only a few {{of those}} in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized {{collapsible}} boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; [...] "In no instance, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'." [...] Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.|$|E
500|$|The Tunnel {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated that while remakes are [...] "often underwhelming", The Tunnel was [...] "gripping stuff", {{and he believed}} that viewers [...] "should find plenty to enjoy" [...] in the series. The performances of Dillane and Poésy were also lauded. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent was positive in his assessment of the series, stating that [...] "as an avid fan of The Bridge, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> report that The Tunnel works well {{in its own right}} – it's intelligently made, well cast and ambitiously cinematic", adding that it had [...] "succeeded in its high-risk strategy of re-working a near-flawless Scandi-drama in our Anglo-French image". Ellen E Jones, also of The Independent, said that Dillane and Poésy's performances [...] "stuck closely" [...] to the original characterisation of the leads from the Scandinavian version. Of the execution, Jones stated: [...] "should you bother watching The Tunnel even if you've already seen the original? The early signs are good. The makers obviously have sense enough to preserve what was effective about the original, and invention enough to distinguish their work too." ...|$|E

Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, [...] "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in – a New York icon and a true American original." ...|$|E

[...] There was a bona fide dispute between the Association and the Company as to whether the termination of the building contract terminated the right to the interim payment. [...] Now that dispute could be litigated. [...] Had the payment remained with the bank it would have been swallowed up by the creditors of the insolvent company leaving Barclays Bank to claim for a mere dividend in the bankruptcy, unjust enriching the creditors of the insolvent Company.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2008, Bravo was {{a member}} of the Trinidad and Tobago squad for the Stanford Series. Having failed to play in the first match against the Super Stars he came into the side for the next match against Middlesex and scored 27 not out {{including}} hitting the winning runs with a six over long-on. His domestic form in the 2008–09 season was much improved from the previous season, in the WICB Cup which Trinidad and Tobago won he scored 41 in the semi-final run chase against Jamaica and added 20 in the final against Barbados. In first-class cricket he scored 97 against Barbados, in a team score of 264 he was the last man out after 330 minutes of batting. Later in the month of January he scored a maiden first-class century against the Windward Islands, his innings of 105 included 13 fours and a six. The form led to his selection for West Indies A however an injury meant he missed the fixture against the England tourists. On his return to first-class cricket Bravo scored a second century of the season, against Barbados he added 111 and shared a 250 run partnership for the fourth wicket with Kieron Pollard. In the following match against Jamaica he scored 41 and 70 also equalling a Trinidad and Tobago record by taking five catches in the second innings. Older brother Dwayne praised his form saying: [...] "He had been good with the bat and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> see that he has been very consistent this season".

To his delight, she told him she would play Bhairavi. [...] "They were so happy to see me," [...] she said. [...] "The script was rewritten and Bhairavi was alive again. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>happy</b> <b>to</b> act as Bhairavi. She is still the same soft person. The only difference is she is older and the mother of two children. There is more understanding between JKB and Bhairavi now -- she doesn't fight with him". Carnatic singer Anuradha Krishnamoorthy, who has never acted before, will play Sindhu. When contacted by Minbimangal, a surprised Anuradha was reluctant to accept the offer. [...] "My initial reaction was I am not interested in acting. I am a professional singer. I had absolutely no plans to act. I told them I needed time to think. It was my husband's gentle persuasion that made me meet K Balachander. Once I met him, I was struck by his simplicity. When he told me they would see to it that my kacheris (concerts) would not get affected because of the shooting, I said yes". [...] "That Suhasini acted in the original film does not bother me at all," [...] she says. [...] "I am a student as far as acting is concerned.
