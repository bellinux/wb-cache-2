5|$|The Pony Express {{demonstrated}} that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When {{replaced by the}} telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and {{became part of the}} lore of the American West. <b>Its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the Frontier times.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} was {{formally}} announced on 2 April after an LM convention. As the LM {{had already begun}} establishing an infrastructure while in the LCL, {{it was able to}} pick up momentum readily, presenting itself as a centrist moderate party, but it was never able to shed <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> Hall.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside the state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} met with mixed to {{positive}} reviews from critics; many reviewers lauded the band's musical composition, but maligned the track for <b>its</b> heavy <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> pop culture references.|$|R
5|$|China's {{economic}} policies laid {{the basis of}} the industrialization drive in export-oriented development, and <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> low-wage manufacturing to produce consumer goods for the world market. Young migrant women left their homes in rural settings to work in urban industrial areas. Work included export-oriented industrialization, manufacturing in electronics and toy assembly, sewing in garment production, and mixed assembly and sewing in the footwear industry. Hong Kong and Shenzhen were cities established as centers of export-oriented industrialization, and migrant women workers have made up 70% of Shenzhen's three million people.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} series its own {{distinctive}} musical identity, according to Djawadi, the producers asked {{him not to}} use musical elements such as flutes or solo vocals {{that had already been}} successfully used by other major fantasy productions. He mentioned that a challenge in scoring the series was <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> dialogue and its sprawling cast: on several occasions already-scored music had to be omitted so as not {{to get in the way}} of dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Having, it is believed, {{purchased}} the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius {{was granted a}} ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis. On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. <b>Its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the Molyneux globe is shown {{by a number of}} legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.|$|E

50|$|Lepper {{was born}} in Stowięcino, a tiny hamlet of roughly 200 people, which has {{suffered}} greatly since Poland's transformation to a market-based economy because of <b>its</b> previous <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the socialist agricultural system.|$|R
50|$|One of Mackinder's {{personal}} objectives was to warn Britain that <b>its</b> traditional <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> sea {{power would}} become a weakness as improved land transport opened up the Heartland for invasion and / or industrialisation (Sempa, 2000).|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the chiefs}} {{respected}} Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power. A {{new system of}} status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. The entire class recognised <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2014, C-SPAN {{announced}} that it would begin restricting access to the live feeds of the main channel, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer, citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> carriage fees from cable and satellite providers. However, it will continue to allow all government meetings, hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C-SPAN Video Library without requiring an authenticated login by a provider. The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates, citing the fact that C-SPAN was designed as a public service.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it {{remained}} successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon {{is thought to}} have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodons fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out {{at the same time that}} most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. <b>Its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.|$|E
50|$|CDR is {{credited}} with being able to discern very mild impairments, but its weaknesses include {{the amount of time}} it takes to administer, <b>its</b> ultimate <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> subjective assessment, and relative inability to capture changes over time.|$|R
5000|$|The latter feature, {{although}} not externally apparent, {{was perhaps the}} most pioneering of the design; a leap forward from the rudimentary action information system of the [...] "Counties" [...] and <b>its</b> heavy <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> manual data input.|$|R
50|$|International Klein Blue (IKB) is a {{deep blue}} hue first mixed by the French artist Yves Klein. IKB's visual impact comes from <b>its</b> heavy <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> ultramarine, as well as Klein's often thick and {{textured}} application of paint to canvas.|$|R
5|$|Plant {{technology}} {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} directly chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E
5|$|As the 1950s began, {{demand on}} the Colorado River – which forms {{the border of}} California and Arizona and {{provided}} most of Southern California's water – was moving toward unsustainable levels. The Bureau of Reclamation restarted its surveys of the Trinity River basin {{as part of a}} larger proposal to move water from northern to southern parts of the state, and compensate for the shortages on the Colorado. The United Western Investigation, in 1951, proposed the damming of nearly every river in the North Coast region of California, chiefly the Trinity, Klamath and Eel. The Ah Pah Dam would have flooded the canyons of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to form the largest reservoir in California. These grandiose plans culminated in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan of 1964, which sought to comprehensively link the water systems of California and the rest of the Colorado River Basin. One of the key projects was an aqueduct to transport North Coast water to the Imperial Valley, reducing <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> water from the Colorado River. However, with the exception of the upper Trinity River project, none of these dam and diversion projects were ever realized.|$|E
25|$|The county {{justice system}} has faced {{criticism}} for <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> since-discredited dog handler John Preston {{as an expert}} witness in the 1980s. Brevard County paid Preston over $37,000 as a consultant {{in the first half}} of 1984.|$|E

25|$|Despite Fayetteville's modest ranking as the 106th {{largest city}} in the US, with a {{population}} of about 204,000, Fayetteville has earned many top awards and recognition as a desirable location, due to its economic and housing growth as well as <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> Fort Bragg.|$|E

25|$|The high {{abundance}} of the cyclopoid copepod Limnoithona tetraspina {{may be due}} to <b>its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> ciliates rather than phytoplankton as a primary food source.

25|$|Timbuktu {{served in}} this process as a {{distribution}} centre of scholars and scholarship. <b>Its</b> <b>reliance</b> <b>on</b> trade meant intensive movement of scholars between {{the city and its}} extensive network of trade partners.
