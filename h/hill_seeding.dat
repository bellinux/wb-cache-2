40|$|Abstract—Understanding spatial {{structure}} of secondary metabolites with abiotic and biotic chorographers of chemical heterogeneity in natural populations may allow deeper insights into their function {{at the plant}} and community levels. Cycads are an ancient group of plants characterized by opulent secondary chemistry. Cycas micronesica K. D. <b>Hill</b> <b>seed</b> chemistry was determined in seven populations throughout Guam to determine if steryl glucosides would segregate among the habitats. Further, we measured covariables {{to shed light on}} habitat characteristics that may help explain the heterogeneity. Seed gameto-phyte content of steryl glucosides stigmasterol -D-glucoside and sitosterol -D-glucoside and their precursors stigmasterol and sitosterol significantly differed among habitats. Cycad plants from the littoral habitat on sandy soils produced higher seed concentrations of these compounds than the six upland habitats. Concentration among the other six habitats also differed, but was less pronounced. None of the measured habitat characteristics correlated with seed chemistry across the continuum of habitats. However, the littoral site was the most resource-scarce site. Our results are valuable for informing ongoing attempts to answer critical conservation, ecology, and neurotoxicity questions. Resource manipulation studies are urgently needed to validate the hypothesis that resource limitations increase production of these neurotoxins in this endangered species...|$|R

40|$|Clematis vitalba, {{introduced}} to New Zealand from Europe {{in the early}} 1900 s, is an invasive weed which poses a high risk to native forest remnants, particularly in the central North Island and upper and central South Island. Its dispersal techniques and rate of spread make it a particular challenge for managers attempting to control its range expansion. Is the population abundance and distribution of C. vitalba on Banks Peninsula seed or microsite limited? I tested the presence of seed limitation in three populations of C. vitalba at two sites by measuring seed dispersal and checking {{for the presence of}} a soil seed bank. At a location where C. vitalba is absent due to control efforts, I investigated the presence of a long-term seed bank and long-distance dispersal. I also tested the degree of microsite limitation in C. vitalba at the two sites by surveying the natural distribution of seedlings, monitoring seedling emergence after seed addition and measuring the survival and growth of planted seedlings. Soil samples taken from the Port Hills and Akaroa sites contained low amounts of previous-season C. vitalba seed (an average of 0. 0125 seeds per m² in the forest and 0. 0025 per m² in the open) and cofirmed the presence of a small short-term soil seed bank. Seed rain was greater at Akaroa (3912 seeds caught) than on the Port <b>Hills</b> (1507 <b>seeds</b> caught), which is also reflected in a larger seed bank at Akaroa. The distribution of natural seedlings and growth of planted seedlings suggests that the optimum habitat for this species varies among different life stages. At the site cleared of C. vitalba more than eight years ago, there were no seeds in the seed bank but new seeds arrived by long-distance dispersal. Overall, these results suggest that microsite limitation has a greater role near the parent plant and seed limitation becomes more pronounced at increasing distance from the seed source. Clematis vitalba populations continue to spread from ongoing long-distance dispersal and short-distance dispersal with lateral expansion of established populations; established populations {{are more likely to be}} limited by the availability of microsites while expanding populations will be seed limited at the edge of the population where plant density is low...|$|R

Virtually no plot to speak of, gibberish dialogue you'll wish they didn't speak, long stretches of nothing happening, and most baffling of all, the film is edited in a non-linear fashion that only makes the experience even more tediously impenetrable. Maybe that was the point. Maybe the whole idea was to create a sadistic fever dream. Maybe the director was shooting for an avant-garde grindhouse vibe. The movie is most definitely a grind all right". Horror News had a mixed reaction Seed 2, and concluded, [...] "As is, Seed 2 has some pretty nasty, gritty gore scenes, some brutal kills, some weird religious imagery, and a kind of cool twist, all put together in a nearly unwatchable way. The reason this makes me sad is that it is shot well, it's a cool idea, and if it had just been put together in a coherent, linear fashion, I think the boo-birds would have never picked on it. The technique of rearranging the timeline can work, as has been proven in numerous other films, but it is not employed correctly here.

CIVT and 3 / 4 HK (both improved) and Sadoré (local) given pre-sowing tillage (ploughing, ridging, 'sand fighting' or no-tillage) and application of 17 kg P + 40 kg N/ha upon seedling emergence, were observed. Sowing depth of 3 - 5 cm resulted in the highest percentage emergence, the highest shoot DW and most secondary roots. These growth parameters were greater in the > 2. 12 mm seed size category than in the other 2 smaller sizes. The adverse effects of wind erosion were least when sowing in hills; establishment, crop stand survival, and yield were better under hill planting than drilling seed. Pre-sowing tillage increased initial stands and their survival, the latter also depending on fertility. Thus, improving crop yields resulted from better stand survival and higher yields per hill. Application of P and N tripled grain yields. Ridging without prior tillage and ploughing increased grain and stover yields 2 - to 3 -fold. In combination with fertilizer application, 6 -fold yield increases were obtained.

40|$|Our study {{focuses on}} the {{keystone}} species Acacia tortilis and {{is the first to}} investigate the effect of domestic ungulates and aridity on seed viability and germination over an extensive part of the Eastern Sahara. Bruchids infest its seeds and reduce their viability and germination, but ingestion by ruminant herbivores diminishes infestation levels and enhances/promotes seed viability and germination. The degree of these effects seems to be correlated with animal body mass. Significantly reduced numbers of wild ruminant ungulates have increased the potential importance of domestic animals and pastoral nomadism for the functionality of arid North African and Middle Eastern ecosystems. We sampled seeds (16, 543) from A. tortilis in eight areas in three regions with different aridity and land use. We tested the effect of geography and sampling context on seed infestation using random effects logistic regressions. We did a randomized and balanced germination experiment including 1193 seeds, treated with different manure. Germination time and rates across geography, sampling context, and infestation status were analyzed using time-to-event analyses, Kaplan–Meier curves and proportional hazards Cox regressions. Bruchid infestation is very high (80 %), and the effects of context are significant. Neither partial infestation nor adding manure had a positive effect on germination. There is a strong indication that intact, uningested seeds from acacia populations in the extremely arid Western Desert germinate more slowly and have a higher fraction of hard seeds than in the Eastern Desert and the Red Sea <b>Hills.</b> For ingested <b>seeds</b> in the pastoralist areas we find that intact seeds from goat dung germinate significantly better than those from camel dung.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{coexistence}} mechanisms in a guild of seven species of annual plants that inhabit dry, open, compacted ground in Silwood Park, Berkshire. Annual plants {{were chosen for}} the study because {{of the importance of}} obtaining whole-generation estimates of the vital rates, and because short-lived plants help/hold out the prospect of being able to assess the importance of year-to-year variation in the rates of recruitment, growth, survival and fecundity. The field work was carried out at Pound <b>Hill</b> for the <b>seed</b> bank experiment, at Walled Garden for the seed dispersal experiment and at Ashurst for the main experiment in Silwood Park, Berkshire. The location was chosen because the area was already fenced and beds were laid out for a previous pilot study experiment in 1996. The intention was to have a range of contrasting ecologies within our guild of annual plants. All species were capable of germination in autumn followed by over-winter survival as rosettes, and then rapid growth and early seed set in spring. Some species were immediately precluded from consideration {{as a result of their}} thuggish behaviour in the pilot studies. The final choice consisted of a grass (Aira praecox), a legume (Ornithopus perpusillus), three contrasting herbs (Myosotis discolor (Boraginaceae), Cerastium glomeratum (Caryophyllaceae) and Veronica arvensis (Scrophulariaceae)), and two tiny crucifers (Erophila verna and Arabidopsis thaliana). All were locally frequent on gravel paths and other compacted open habitats within Silwood Park. The thesis describes 7 separate replicated experiments, each carried out over 5 years: monocultures of each of the seven species; saturation sowing; two-species mixtures (21 of them) and multispecies mixtures. I show clear pattern of year effects in both inter and intra-specific density dependence. The time series experiments are backed up by quantification of seed dispersal and seed bank dynamics.

The lowest moisture content limit for application of the viability equation at 65 ºC was 4. 9 %, estimated under hygroscopic equilibrium with 23 % of relative humidity in the storage environment. Este trabalho teve como objetivos verificar o desempenho de sementes de Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden, após a deterioração em condições controladas, e obter as constantes da equação de viabilidade. As sementes foram colhidas na safra de 1999, e a umidade foi ajustada de 11, 3 % para valores entre 1, 2 e 18, 1 % a 25 ºC As subamostras foram acondicionadas em embalagens de alumínio termossoldadas, armazenadas a 40, 50 e 65 ± 0, 5 ºC. As sementes apresentaram um desempenho ortodoxo em relação ao armazenamento. As constantes para a predição da longevidade foram K E = 9, 661, C W = 6, 467, C H = 0, 03498 e C Q = 0, 0002330. Foi observada a relação inversa entre teor de água e longevidade. O limite inferior de grau de umidade, calculado para aplicação da equação a 65 ºC, foi de 4, 9 %, estimativa obtida sob equilíbrio higroscópico com umidade relativa de 23 % no ambiente de armazenamento...|$|R
