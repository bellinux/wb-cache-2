5000|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Wool</b> <b>Textile</b> <b>Organisation</b> (IWTO) is the promulgator of the Fabric Labelling Code of Practice which {{governs the}} use of the [...] "S" [...] and [...] "Super S" [...] designations for fine wool and wool blend fabrics. The Code defines the S number by {{correlation}} to maximum fiber diameter. For example, 80s must have maximum fiber diameter of 19.75 micrometres or finer and 90s, 19.25 micrometres or finer. This scale continues to the 210s at 13.25 micrometre or finer. Thus each step of ten (as from 80s to 90s or 90s to 100s) corresponds to 0.5 micrometre less in allowed maximum fiber diameter. It has been proposed to extend the scale to 250s at 11.25 micrometre or finer.|$|E
50|$|The {{worsted count}} {{was only a}} rough {{measurement}} and {{has been replaced by}} more exact methods such as the metric yarn count. However, for fine wool, the memory of the older system survives in the S numbers which have a very rough correspondence to worsted count. In other words, fiber that yielded about 80 worsted hanks is roughly comparable to fiber designated as 80s using the S numbers. The critical difference is that while the worsted number was an indirect measure (and a rough one at that) of yarn thickness, the S number is a direct (and precise) measurement of the thickness of the fiber. The S number of fiber, and hence of yarn, fabric, or garments made of that fiber, is determined using the international standard promulgated by the <b>International</b> <b>Wool</b> <b>Textile</b> <b>Organisation</b> (IWTO).|$|E

With the popularization of air conditioning, however, it is much hotter outdoors than indoors with a large temperature gradient in summer, under which circumstances the wearer finds it easier to sweat out of doors, and feels cold and clammy when entering a room kept at a lower temperature by air conditioning. With the advances in knitting and finishing technology, fine wool knitted fabrics are finding more applications as summer garments. Thus, the design and study of comfortable summer wool knitted fabric is increasing. Wool fiber has a higher vapor moisture absorbency than other natural fibers, such as cotton, linen, and silk, and general synthetic fibers. It also has higher heat releasing and heat absorption properties accompanying moisture absorption and desorption respectively, which strengthens the buffering effect of the clothing between the human body and the surrounding environment. In the present study, different kinds of fabric knitted by wool yarn in a plain structure (W 1, W 2), and wool yarn matched with polyester yarns (WP 1, WP 2) or cotton yarns (WC 1, WC 2) as plating yarn are developed so as to have different liquid water transport properties. Their liquid moisture transport properties are characterized by using the Moisture Management Tester. By fabric design and post-finishing, our aim to create different liquid water transfer and distribution properties in the fabrics was achieved. W 2 is poor at spreading liquid in the top and bottom surfaces of the fabric, showing poor liquid transfer properties, and WC 1 is the best at spreading liquid in the bottom surface, showing good moisture management properties.

40|$|The {{use of the}} protein-crosslinking enzymes transglutaminases (EC 2. 3. 2. 13), as {{biocatalysts}} in {{the processing}} of <b>wool</b> <b>textiles</b> {{offers a variety of}} exciting and realistic possibilities, which include reducing the propensity of wool fabric to shrink and maintaining or increasing fabric strength. Guinea pig liver (GPL) transglutaminase or the microbial transglutaminase isolated from Streptoverticilium mobaraense, when applied to wool either alone or following a protease treatment, resulted in an increase in wool yarn and fabric strength (up to a 25 % increase compared to a control). This indicates that transglutaminases can remediate the negative effects of proteolytic treatments in terms of loss in fibre strength. Incubation of samples pretreated with different oxidative and reducing agents with both sources of transglutaminases led to significant increases in tensile strength for all samples tested, suggesting that yarn strength lost following chemical treatments can also be recovered. The two different transglutaminases (TGases) could also impart a significant reduction in fabric shrinkage. The incorporation of primary amine transglutaminase substrates into wool fibres, with a view to altering wool functionality, was demonstrated using the incorporation of the fluorescent primary amine fluorescein cadaverine (FC). Incubation of wool with this fluorescent amine and transglutaminase led to high levels of incorporation into the fibres. The treatment of <b>wool</b> <b>textiles</b> with transglutaminases indicates that a number of novel and radically different finishes for <b>wool</b> <b>textiles</b> can be developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{restructuring of}} Chinese industries is of immense importance {{not only for}} the continued development of China but also to the stability of the world economy. The transformation of the Chinese <b>wool</b> <b>textile</b> industry illustrates well the many problems and pressures currently facing most Chinese industries. The Chinese <b>wool</b> <b>textile</b> industry has undergone major upheaval and restructuring in its drive to modernize and take advantage of developments in world textile markets. Macro level ownership and administrative reforms are well advanced as is the uptake of new technology and equipment. However, the changing market and institutional environment also demands an increasing level of sophistication in mill management decisions including product selection, input procurement, product pricing, investment appraisal, cost analysis and proactive identification of new market and growth opportunities. This paper outlines a series of analyses that have been integrated into a decision-making model designed to assist mill managers with these decisions. Features of the model include a whole-of-mill approach, a design based on existing mill structures and information systems, and the capacity for the model to be tailored to individual mills. All of these features facilitate the adoption of the model by time and resource constrained managers seeking to maintain the viability of their enterprises in the face of extremely dynamic market conditions.

On {{the other hand}} the need of qualified and skilled workforce prevents the relocation to countries that can only offer low wages. Thus the EU maintains its world leading position as <b>wool</b> <b>textile</b> producer, the dominant role belonging to Italy, Germany and France. Another important feature is specialisation of these countries in a specific segment of the wool "filière".
