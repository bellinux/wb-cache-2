5|$|The Ramayana narrates: Rama, his consort Sita and {{his brother}} Lakshmana were exiled to the forest for a 14-year period. While in the forest, Sita was kidnapped by the demon-king Ravana. Rama was {{informed}} of Sita's fate by the dying vulture Jatayu, who had been mortally wounded in trying to save her. Searching for Sita, Rama and Lakshmana reached the Krauncha forest, where Kabandha dwelt. The brothers first encountered a demoness, who tempted Lakshmana. Lakshmana cut off her nose, ears, and breasts, and the brothers moved deeper into the forest, where bad omens <b>greeted</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late October, the Beatles began {{a five-day}} tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg {{engagement}} of December 1962. On {{their return to}} the UK on 31 October several hundred screaming fans <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.|$|E

25|$|As the Whites took Vyborg {{under their}} control, they {{conducted}} a large mass execution. Some 1,200 people were shot, including up to 400 Russians {{and people of}} associated ethnicities. Today their execution is considered as an ethnic cleansing. Ironically, most of the Russian victims were White supporters and even had <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> as liberators. Included in the number {{are plenty of other}} foreign nationalities who were also executed, as the Whites possibly mistook them as Russians. Other nationalities included Ukrainians, Polish, Estonian, Tatars, Jews and Italians. The largest mass executions were carried out in the Annenkrone fort on the western side of the city. Youngest of the executed were only 12–13-year-old children and at least three civilian women were also shot.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the Portuguese arrived in India in 1498, the Saint Thomas Christians were in a {{difficult}} position. Though prosperous owing to their large stake in the spice trade and protected by a formidable militia, the tumultuous political climate of the time had placed the small community {{under pressure from the}} forces of the powerful rajas of Calicut, Cochin, and the various smaller kingdoms in the area. When the Portuguese under Vasco da Gama arrived on the South Indian coast, the leaders of the Saint Thomas community <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> and proffered a formal alliance to their fellow Christians. The Portuguese, who had keen interest in implanting themselves in the spice trade and in expanding the domain of their bellicose form of Christianity, jumped at this opportunity.|$|E
25|$|Over fifty dead horses <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> {{with their}} putrid smell. Forsyth’s command {{had been out}} of rations and forced to survive on the {{decaying}} horse flesh. Forsyth's 2nd in command, Lt. Fredrick H. Beecher, had been killed during the battle. Forsyth {{had been shot in the}} thigh, fracturing his leg, and wounded in the forehead. He was not expected to survive another day. The air around him was completely filled with a great stench and was swarming with black flies feasting on the rotting defensive line of dead horses. The square sandy hole, where Forsyth was lying was half encircled by dead mounts and would have become his grave if help had not arrived when it did. Other gun pits, interconnected, contained the living and the dead of his unit.|$|E

25|$|He landed {{his troops}} of Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island militia over the protests of Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks (1798–1865). He put {{some on the}} old Navy {{training}} ship frigate, USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides") and moved it off shore beyond reach of easy attack. Recruiting some railroad workers and boilermakers among his soldiers, Butler had them rescue a small yard locomotive in the trainyards {{and use it to}} take cars full of soldiers up the Annapolis Line of the B Railroad to Relay Junction near Ellicott City, where it joined the Main Line going west to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia or south to Washington. The Northern regiments used this route to reach the train station (now Union Station near the U.S. Capitol). They camped that evening in the Rotunda, which was not yet completed. An additional unit was sent up Pennsylvania Avenue to reinforce the White House, where the President <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> with relief.|$|E
25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E
25|$|In October 1970, when Genie was {{approximately}} 13 years and 6 months old, Genie's parents had a violent argument {{in which her}} mother threatened to walk out if she could not call her own parents. Her husband eventually relented, and later that day she left with Genie {{when he was out}} of the house and went to her parents in Monterey Park; Genie's brother, by then 18, had already run away from home and was living with friends. Around three weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother decided to apply for disability benefits for the blind in nearby Temple City, California and brought Genie with her, but on account of her near-blindness Genie's mother accidentally entered the general social services office next door. The social worker who <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> instantly sensed something was wrong when she saw Genie and was shocked to learn her true age, having estimated from her appearance and demeanor that she was around 6 or 7 and possibly autistic, and after she and her supervisor questioned Genie's mother and confirmed Genie's age they immediately contacted the police. Genie's parents were arrested and Genie became a ward of the court, and due to her physical condition and near-total unsocialized state a court order was immediately issued for Genie to be taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Those on Carpathia were {{startled by}} the scene that <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> as the sun came up: [...] "fields of ice on which, like points on the landscape, rested innumerable pyramids of ice." [...] Captain Arthur Rostron of Carpathia saw ice all around, {{including}} 20large bergs measuring up to [...] high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from Titanic. It appeared to Carpathias passengers that their ship {{was in the middle}} of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs appearing like hills in the distance.|$|E
500|$|At {{one point}} the {{expedition}} met a tribe of Tuaregs and <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> by offering their camels water from the container. According to the commentary in the documentary film, the camels had never tasted anything as delicious as the Norwegian glacier water. This was not entirely true; the water was contaminated by the glass wool and tar paper, and it was barely drinkable. The expedition arrived at the Hoggar Mountains near the Tropic of Cancer after fourteen days of travelling. A measurement at that point showed a loss of 96litres of water. Once the Sahara was traversed, after [...] of driving, 177litres had melted away. On average 15litres melted each day in the desert.|$|E

[...] The next day he reported to the LSU president announcing his intention to offer his services to the U.S. Army, and he sent a telegram to the War Department announcing his availability for service.

500|$|After Young {{succumbed to}} asthma in 1800, Adams took {{responsibility}} for the education and well-being of the nine remaining women and 19 children. Using the ship's Bible from Bounty, he taught literacy and Christianity, and kept peace on the island. This was the situation in February 1808, when the American sealer Topaz came unexpectedly upon Pitcairn, landed, and discovered the by then thriving community. News of Topazs discovery did not reach Britain until 1810, when it was overlooked by an Admiralty preoccupied by war with France. In 1814, two British warships, HMS Briton and HMS Tagus, chanced upon Pitcairn. Among those who <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> were Thursday October Christian and Edward Young's son, George—the respective captains, Sir Thomas Staines and Philip Pipon, reported that Christian the son displayed [...] "in his benevolent countenance, all the features of an honest English face". On shore they found a population of 46 mainly young islanders led by Adams, upon whom, {{it was clear to}} them, the islanders' welfare was wholly dependent.|$|E
500|$|On 7 February 1964, the Beatles {{left the}} United Kingdom with an {{estimated}} 4,000 fans gathered at Heathrow, waving and screaming as the aircraft took off. Upon landing at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 <b>greeted</b> <b>them.</b> They gave their first live US television performance two days later on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 per cent of the American population. Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was [...] "the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television [...] ". The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a negative critical consensus in the US, but a day later their first US concert saw Beatlemania erupt at Washington Coliseum. Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall. The band then flew to Florida and appeared on the weekly Ed Sullivan Show a second time, before another 70 million viewers, {{before returning to the}} UK on 22 February.|$|E
500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that <b>greeted</b> <b>them</b> at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E
