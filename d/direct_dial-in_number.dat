This can be an ISDN30 connection, delivered through either a copper or fibre cable. This ISDN30 can carry 30 simultaneous telephone calls and many <b>direct</b> <b>dial-in</b> telephone <b>numbers,</b> (DDI's).|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} use a {{callback}} service, a subscriber is allocated a unique number in, for example, the US, which must first be dialled in order to trigger a return call. This is known (in the US) as a Direct Inbound Dialing (DID) number, or in the UK as a <b>Direct</b> <b>Dial-In</b> (DDI) <b>number.</b> Where Caller ID is available, {{it may be possible}} to use the same DID number for many different subscribers, as the callback system will be able to recognise each subscriber's registered number.|$|R
50|$|Provide a <b>dial-in</b> <b>number,</b> and ask {{participants}} {{to call in}} to give their feedback after a conference session. Make participation open to all, and eliminate paper forms and manual tabulation.|$|R
5000|$|International calling {{companies}} {{which offer}} low-cost international calling rates use Voxbone's services to provide local <b>dial-in</b> <b>numbers</b> to their customers. They also reserve call capacity on Voxbone's VoIP backbone. Such companies include: Skype and IDT.|$|R

50|$|XXXDial is a spyware/dialer {{application}} {{which created}} {{a number of}} problems for UK internet users in December 2004. It changes a victim's point-to-point protocol (PPP) settings so that it automatically tries to reconnect to a premium rate number, as opposed to a user's normal <b>dial-in</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{growth in}} second phone lines, <b>direct</b> <b>dial-in</b> (DDI) lines, fax {{machines}} and multiple telecoms operators during the 1980s {{the demand for}} telephone numbers exceeded the available number ranges. A number of changes were {{to be made to}} the UK numbering plan. All these stages were planned out in one exercise in the early 1980s, though the exact dates for each stage was decided later.|$|R
50|$|Direct inward dialing (DID), {{also called}} <b>direct</b> <b>dial-in</b> (DDI) in Europe and Oceania, is a {{telecommunication}} service offered by telephone companies to subscribers who operate a {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) system. The feature provides service for multiple telephone numbers over one or more analog or digital physical circuits to the PBX, and transmits the dialed telephone number to the PBX so that a PBX extension is directly accessible for an outside caller, possibly by-passing an auto-attendant.|$|R
50|$|Conference {{calls are}} also {{beginning}} {{to cross over}} {{into the world of}} podcasting and social networking, which in turn fosters new kinds of interaction patterns. Live streaming or broadcasting of conference calls allows a larger audience access to the call without dialing into a bridge. In addition, organizers of conference calls can publish a <b>dial-in</b> <b>number</b> alongside the audio stream, creating potential for audience members to dial in and interact.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{each of the}} franchisees {{agreed to}} consolidate, centralize, and combine their resources. Matchmaker {{incorporated}} and relocated all of the Matchmaker servers to Bedford, Texas. In September 1998, the system became burdened by having to provide <b>direct</b> <b>dial-in</b> over modems and {{a decision was made}} to move to the Internet exclusively. At the height of the distributed franchise model in 1998, the number of national systems exceeded 60. An agreement was reached to centralize in Bedford, Texas and incorporate with the name Matchmaker.com. Private stock was issued and there were approximately 12 administrators and employees. Patrick M. O'Leary became the company's president.|$|R
50|$|In September, the Ottawa Citizen {{carried a}} front page article by Dominic Lacasse, {{describing}} the new pilot free-net project. The article included the <b>dial-in</b> phone <b>number</b> and, as a result, twenty people per day started signing up as members.|$|R
50|$|Some {{systems may}} {{automatically}} map a large block of DID numbers (differing {{only in a}} trailing sequence of digits) to a corresponding block of individual internal stations, allowing each {{of them to be}} reached directly from the public switched telephone network. In some of these cases, a special shorter <b>dial-in</b> <b>number</b> can be used to reach an operator who can be asked for general information, e.g. help looking up or connecting to internal numbers. For example, individual extensions at Universität des Saarlandes can be dialed directly from outside via their four-digit internal extension +49-681-302-xxxx, whereas the university's official main number is +49-681-302-0 (49 is the country code for Germany, 681 is the area code for Saarbrücken, 302 the prefix for the university).|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{performance of}} local area networks (LANs) has encouraged {{the development of}} multimedia applications, like video telephony, teleconferencing, etc. Services based on the de facto standard transmission control protocol and internet protocol (TCP/IP) are very popular, as they are independent of the network used and, thus, can easily be applied to existing infrastructures. Private users or small and medium enterprises (SMEs), extending these applications to wide area networks (WANs), such as utilizing the Internet, still demands to use <b>direct</b> <b>dial-in</b> to access providers utilizing public telecommunication infrastructure. Due to the digital signalling and communication scheme used, the integrated services digital network (ISDN) offers a better embedding for such remote accesses, resulting in {{a better quality of}} service offered to the user¾ compared to conventional modem accesses. From the service provider's point of view, however the popularity of such remote accesses increase [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Netherlands: The then {{state-owned}} {{phone company}} PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel (nl) and Videotex Nederland (nl). The main {{difference was that}} Viditel used one big central host where Videotex used a central access system responsible for realizing the correct connection to the required host: owned and managed by others. The Videotex services offered access via several premium rate numbers and the information/service provider could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, the tariff could vary 0-1 Dutch guilders (0.00-0.45 euro) per minute. Some private networks such as Travelnet (for travel-agencies) and RDWNet for automotive industry, used the same platform as Videotex Nl but used dedicated <b>dial-in</b> phone <b>numbers,</b> dedicated access-hardware and also used authentication. Although the protocol used in France for Minitel was slightly different than the international standard you could use the 'international' terminal (or PC's with the correct terminal-emulation software) to access the French services. It was possible to connect to most French Minitel services via the Dutch Videotex network, but the price per minute was considerably higher: most French Minitel services were reachable via the <b>dial-in</b> <b>number</b> 06-7900 which had a tariff of 1 guilder/minute (approx. €0,45/minute) Both Viditel and Videotex were shut down between 1997 and 1999, and the parent company behind Videotex Nederland was subsequently renamed as Planet Media Group.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic service}} {{includes}} free audio, conferencing and online meetings with screen sharing and video conferencing, call recording, scheduling and tracking in Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar, mobile applications, customer support, and security features. The business service includes enterprise account management, billing, analytic reports and training. It can accommodate up to 1,000 participants per call, with calls lasting {{up to six}} hours. The Broadcaster feature allows the user to play audio files or pre-recorded screen sharing sessions during live calls. Calls can be broadcast in real time as Internet radio, and recorded calls are searchable by keywords. After a user signs up, they receive a dedicated <b>dial-in</b> <b>number</b> and access code to set up conference calls. For those who install the mobile app (available on iOS and Android), they can dial in to a call without having to manually dial the number or enter a PIN. The service has been noted for its ease of use, clear connections and stable network infrastructure, with minimal dropped calls.|$|R

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2001 by David Erickson, who serves as CEO. Prior to {{founding}} the company, Erickson had been developing vDesk, a program that would allow users to make voice calls, hold video conferences, and share information on their computer screens. After a rival company started offering a similar service for free, Erickson looked for ways to provide free conference calls. He purchased the FreeConferenceCall.com domain name through GoDaddy for $10 and built a website capable of patching users {{from around the world}} into a call hosted on a single high-definition conferencing bridge. Erickson was the only employee for the company's first two years; as of 2016, the company has 150 employees. It has more than 5,000 new customers sign up per day, users from over 800,000 businesses, and worldwide service with local <b>dial-in</b> <b>numbers</b> in more than 60 countries, including the United States, Japan, England, Mexico, France, Germany, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and India. By 2015, the company was the fifth-largest conferencing provider in the world (by volume of minutes).|$|R

5000|$|On April 2, 2013, {{two months}} after the launch of Zoom, Judy Schneider and Paul Doherty {{reviewed}} Zoom at Construction Executive's Tech Trends section. Their choice of words to summarize their experience was [...] "love at first byte". [...] "The first meeting was seamless," [...] said the authors. [...] "Everyone arrived on time with little to no wait time". The overall tone of the review was positive with little mention of caveats in the software. This was also the first review mentioning its REST API. At the time, there were no alternative <b>dial-in</b> <b>numbers,</b> which they pointed out in their article. On December 14, 2013, Zoom has since implemented dial-in access in the release of version 2.5 of its software. On September 2013, when Zoom Video Conferencing has been released for six months, Emily Read wrote a comprehensive review of the software, in which she noted that [...] "it's perfect if you want to record your meeting, or share your mobile screen" [...] but [...] "while there's no time limit on one-on-one calls made with a free account, a potentially annoying issue is that group calls using a free account are limited to a maximum of 40 minutes". Read also considered the software useful for [...] "clients, friends or family who don't have Skype or Google+" [...] {{as a result of the}} ability to join a meeting without registering accounts.|$|R
50|$|In the Netherlands {{the then}} {{state-owned}} phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel and Videotex Nederland. From the user perspective {{the main difference}} between these systems was that Viditel used standard <b>dial-in</b> phone <b>numbers</b> where Videotex used premium-rate telephone numbers. For Viditel you needed a (paid) subscription {{and on top of that}} you paid for each page you visited. For Videotex services you normally didn't need a subscription nor was there the need to authenticate: you paid for the services via the premium rate of the modem-connection based on connection time, regardless of the pages or services you retrieved.|$|R
