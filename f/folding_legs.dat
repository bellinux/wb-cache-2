5000|$|The {{posture of}} zazen is seated, with <b>folded</b> <b>legs</b> and hands, and an erect but settled spine. The hands are folded {{together}} into a simple mudra over the belly. [...] In many practices, the practitioner breathes from the hara (the center of gravity in the belly) and the eyelids are half-lowered, the eyes being neither fully open nor shut so that the practitioner is neither distracted by, nor turning away from, external stimuli.|$|R
50|$|The Lunar Module was chiefly {{designed}} by Grumman aerospace engineer Thomas J. Kelly. The first LEM design {{looked like a}} smaller version of the Apollo Command/Service Module (a cone-shaped cabin atop a cylindrical propulsion section) with <b>folding</b> <b>legs.</b> The second design invoked {{the idea of a}} helicopter cockpit with large curved windows and seats, to improve the astronauts' visibility for hover and landing. This also included a second, forward docking port, allowing the LEM crew to {{take an active role in}} docking with the CSM.|$|E

25|$|Tinamous prefer thick {{branches}} {{on which}} to roost as they do not clutch the branch with their toes, but rest on it with <b>folded</b> <b>legs.</b> They will reuse the same locations and avoid defecating nearby to avoid advertising the roost site to predators. The smaller forest species, along with the steppe tinamous, will roost on the ground, sometimes in the shelter of a bush. They will also use the same location repeatedly; known examples are the elegant crested and ornate tinamous.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the recent}} years when {{accomplishing}} anthropological investigations, some complementary anthropological test are included {{for a better}} characterization of a population. For {{the aims of the}} present investigation there have been used the following: Hand clasping, Arm <b>folding,</b> <b>Leg</b> <b>folding,</b> leading hand. The purpose of the study is to be discovered anthropological differences concerning age or sex in the examined population, and to be detected possible changes occurring in dependence of age. In respect of the hand clasping the right hand type predominates over the left, the opposite is noted about arm folding. As a whole right leading hand type dominates over left in the examined population. Total domination of the left or right hand type occurs rarely, in comparison with the mixed type...|$|R
50|$|The {{line between}} {{electric}} lap steel guitar and console steel guitar is fuzzy, {{with a great}} deal of overlap. Some makers and authorities do not use the term console steel guitar at all, but refer to any steel guitar without pedals as a lap steel guitar. In 1956, Gibson was selling an 8+8 string with <b>folding</b> <b>legs</b> as a lap steel guitar, but this particular instrument is unplayable in lap steel fashion; The Fender Stringmaster with up to four necks was also described as a lap steel guitar in some Fender catalogs, while in others it was simply described as a steel guitar.|$|E
50|$|Since their introduction, many {{improvements}} {{have been}} made to the quality and construction of rebounders. Spring size, shape, and durability have improved greatly over time, and {{in the last several years}} springs have been replaced entirely in certain high-end units by bungee-bands, which are quieter and may also offer certain advantages in terms of smoothness and user experience. Units with <b>folding</b> <b>legs,</b> and units whose entire body (including the mat and the rim) folds in half, or even in quarters, have been introduced. Rebounders can be purchased for anywhere from between $40 and $1,000 and up.|$|E
5000|$|The estate {{versions}} {{had some}} interesting features. All had split tailgates - the rear windscreen would wind {{down into the}} bottom part, which could then be folded down. On the one hand, this allowed the access to the cargo compartment without opening the full tailgate. On the other, this meant that a rear window heater could never be installed in estates. Additionally, the 1500 GL version's cargo floor, which doubled as the cover for the spare wheel (stowed flat), could be removed and, thanks to four <b>folding</b> <b>legs,</b> converted into a picnic table! [...] A 1500 Familial version had two child seats (facing each other) in the cargo compartment, and a luggage rack on the roof.|$|E

50|$|The ballet is {{approximately}} five minutes long. The music consists of ten percussive bars, a verse and chorus, repeated seven times. It {{begins with a}} harsh, martial-sounding chord, which then subsides into the simple melody. As the scene opens, the women in black are arranged in a semi-circle angled inward toward center stage. They stand shoulder to shoulder, arms <b>folded,</b> <b>legs</b> slightly apart and parallel. Stage left, the woman in white stands alone outside the semicircle, head in profile, hair unbound, facing outward. Seeking welcome or acceptance, she repeatedly approaches the group. Every attempt is met with rejection.|$|R

At intervals in the distance one could see a hacienda standing in majestic solitude in a cup of the hills. In the blue sky floated little banderillos of white cloud, while a graceful hidalgo appeared poised on a crag on one <b>leg</b> with <b>folded</b> wings, or floated lazily in the sky on one wing with <b>folded</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
