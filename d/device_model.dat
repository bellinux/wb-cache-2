Therefore, it is imperative to develop practical, functional <b>device</b> <b>models</b> of minimum mathematical complexity for fast, reliable, and accurate computing architecture technology design and simulation. To this end, various <b>device</b> <b>models</b> have been proposed in the literature seeking to characterize the physical electronic and time domain behavioral properties of memristor devices.
