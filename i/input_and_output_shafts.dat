The gearbox is equipped with separate Renk multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings for the main engines. The hydrodynamic couplings that allow over 100% slipping between <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> are used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The gearbox itself is also designed to withstand the high thrust and torque loads caused by an open propeller operating in ice — the gear teeth are dimensioned to withstand loads up to five times the nominal value. The fully locking mechanical clutches are used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship is operating in open water or light ice conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} arctic seas placed high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of [...] at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings. The hydrodynamic couplings that allowed over 100% slipping between <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship was operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters {{was at that time}} one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the Arktika class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable-pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.|$|E

50|$|<b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> flanges are {{bolted to}} the giubo on either side using {{alternating}} hole positions, so that the flanges are not connected directly to one another but instead only through the rubber material of the coupling. The elasticity of the rubber absorbs vibration and flexes for alignment. It follows that the rubber must withstand the application's full transmitted torque, for which reason the rubber is often reinforced internally using moulded-in fibre material.|$|R
50|$|In a rear-wheel-drive transmission, the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> lie {{along the}} same line, and {{may in fact be}} {{combined}} into a single shaft within the transmission. This single shaft is called a mainshaft. The <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> ends of this combined shaft rotate independently, at different speeds, which is possible because one piece slides into a hollow bore in the other piece, where it is supported by a bearing. Sometimes the term mainshaft refers to just the input shaft or just the <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> rather than the entire assembly.|$|R

Each shaft has a circular flange whose face is perpendicular to the center line of the shafts. Each flange has a plurality of equally spaced cylindrical recesses machined into the inside face thereto adapted to receive conical inserts therein. Balls are contained by the conical inserts and transmit the rotational movement from the input to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A stationary housing extends around the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> has a transducer shell secured thereto. When {{force is applied to}} the input shaft to cause movement, the balls encounter torsional resistance which causes the balls to roll up the ramps of the conical seat inserts to separate the two torque flanges. The force transmitted through the balls causes rotation to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> produces tension to the stationary transducer shell. The stationary transducer shell is instrumented with semi-conductor strain gauges...|$|R
50|$|The constant-velocity {{relationship}} between <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> {{joined by a}} Schmidt coupling is unaffected by changes in radial displacement.

50|$|Other {{advantages}} {{shared with}} similar CVT designs include that the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> may be either in-line, offset, or in a U configuration (input and output both coaxial and coplanar), making the transmission simple, small, light {{and easy to}} package.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a lumped model of planetary gears, for the estimation of the forces on the gear teeth and for the investigation of the problem of contact losses and tooth wedging. Differently from previous works, which analyzed the behavior of gears with torque and assembly error, this model takes into consideration the effects of parallel offset between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>shafts</b> on the load sharing factor. The mathematical model is implemented in Matlab© environment. The code estimates the mesh forces on each planet and it can determine the load on each planet.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a controller development for an electro-mechanical friction clutch (EMFC) system for automotive applications {{and especially for}} vehicles that use continuously variable transmission. The work focuses on developing an EMFC engagement controller based on experimental work using a Proportional Derivative (PID) controller algorithm to engage the dry friction clutch. The EMFC is electromechanically actuated using a DC motor system, such that a smooth engagement process can be performed satisfactorily. To develop the controller, the dynamic behaviors of the EMFC system are investigated by performing tests on the EMFC bench-test. Results from this experiment show {{that the percentage of}} slip between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the EMFC system depends on the <b>input</b> speed <b>and</b> <b>output</b> torque. Therefore, by applying slip control, engagement of the EMFC can be controlled and achieved for any <b>input</b> speed <b>and</b> torque during the standing start of a vehicle...|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft power}} is {{transferred}} to the machine driven; the electric input power is what is metered and charged for. Loss in motor efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the <b>input</b> power <b>and</b> <b>output</b> or <b>shaft</b> power.|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|E
50|$|An Oldham {{coupling}} {{has three}} discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined {{to the first}} two by tongue and groove. The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center {{at the same speed}} as the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> Often springs are used to reduce backlash of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for John Oldham who invented it in Ireland, in 1821, to solve a problem in a paddle steamer design.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a condition monitoring method for wet friction clutches based on monitoring the change of the relative velocity signal measured between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the clutch. To quantify the change of the signal, the engagement duration and two dissimilarity measures, namely the Euclidian and the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance are proposed here. Service-life data obtained from Accelerated Lifetime Tests (ALTs), carried out using an SAE# 2 test setup, are recorded and analyzed to extract the proposed features; then to justify the potential and the relevance of the features for the clutch condition monitoring. The plots of the features extracted from the relative velocity signal in function of the service-life of the tested clutches exhibit clear trends that can be associated with the progress of the clutches degradation. Remarkably, all the trends are linearly increasing with relatively small variations. The proposed quantities can therefore be seen as relevant features that may enable us to monitor and assess the condition of wet friction clutches. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A shift force {{simulator}} for {{manual transmission}} is developed {{to estimate the}} shift force that is transmitted to the driver’s hand. In order to develop the simulator, dynamic models of the external linkage, internal linkage, synchronizer and drivetrain are obtained. The synchronizing motion is modelled as seven steps depending on {{the relative displacement of}} the sleeve to the ring spring, outer ring chamfer and gear chamfer. The chamfer-to-chamfer contact mechanism is modelled as a linear spring. In addition, a driver model is proposed to simulate the driver’s shift lever operation. Based on the dynamic model of each element, a shift force simulator is developed. The simulator calculates the sleeve displacement, cone torque, index torque, sleeve force, shift force and the speed of the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> It is found that the shift force by the simulator shows a good correlation with the test results, and it is expected that the shift force simulator developed in this study {{can be used as a}} useful design tool to evaluate the shift feeling in the initial design stage...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{methodology}} of establishing two-carrier planetary gear trains (PGT) equipped with a speed-changing system which contains breaks and clutches is considered. The reactive shaft is changed by means of breaks whereas the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the gear train are changed by clutches. Compound multi-speed planetary gear trains are obtained {{by a combination of}} two-carrier two-speed planetary gear trains controlled by only two breaks. The coding system of the two-speed planetary gear trains, which defines the connection between shafts of planetary gear sets and the shaft layout equipped with breaks, a driving and an operating machine is shown. It is established which variants of two-speed planetary gear trains are possible to combine by means of corresponding clutches in order to get two-variant or three-variant PGT. The methodology of choosing two-carrier PGT which are created by a combination of two or three two-speed variants within the frame of the same scheme is described as well as the example of finding an optimal three-speed PGT by means of the developed computer program 6 -brz is shown...|$|R

50|$|An {{idler gear}} {{does not affect}} the gear ratio between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> Note that in a {{sequence}} of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain. But, of course, the addition of each intermediate gear reverses the direction of rotation of the final gear.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{coupling}} types, {{it is not}} intended to compensate for high radial mis-alignment between shafts, but it can compensate axial misalignments better than elastomer couplings. The coupling may have a small ability to compensate for varying alignment, but if this is needed it is generally done through using an additional coupling in tandem. The coupling also runs at the same speed for <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts,</b> unlike a torque converter.|$|E

[...] The Multitronic system uses a link-plate chain drive, an oil-cooled multi-plate clutch (initially of six parts, later of seven to enable it to cope better with the high torque outputs of larger turbodiesel engines), and complex electronics, to overcome the traditional shortcomings of CVTs.|$|R

The crankshaft axis, <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the Ninja ZX-10R engine are positioned in a triangular layout to reduce engine length, while the high-speed generator is placed behind the cylinder bank to reduce engine width. With a bore and stroke of 76 × 55 mm, the ZX-10R engine's one-piece cylinder and crankcase assembly reduces weight and increases rigidity. The DOHC are machined from chromoly steel, built for strength; four valves per cylinder improve high-rpm breathing; and the forged, lightweight pistons offer high heat resistance to further enhance the bike's power-to-weight ratio.|$|R
40|$|Wet {{friction}} clutches {{play a critical}} role in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions. It is unavoidable that they progressively degrade and eventually break down while the vehicles are under operational condition. To avoid unexpected failures, a proper condition monitoring tool extended with a lifetime prediction method should be implemented. In order to achieve this, appropriate parameters delivering any information about the failure modes and levels must be determined. This paper presents an experimental investigation on a set of statistical parameters generated from the zeroth- and first-order derivative of time domain pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, to determine the appropriate parameters, often called relevant features, for condition monitoring of wet {{friction clutches}}. The torsional vibrations are measured by using two Ferraris sensors installed on both <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the clutch. The determination of the relevant features is based on an evaluation of the historical trends of the parameters. Clearness and fluctuation level of the historical trends are considered as criteria for selecting relevant features from the generated statistical parameters. The trends of the parameters are extracted from lifetime data obtained from an accelerated lifetime test on a paper-based wet clutch, using a SAE# 2 test setup. This study reveals that the RMS value and Shannon entropy extracted from the first-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, and the kurtosis extracted from the zeroth-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, can be used as relevant features for condition monitoring of wet friction clutches. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantages}} include: no backlash, high compactness {{and light}} weight, high gear ratios, reconfigurable ratios within a standard housing, good resolution and excellent repeatability (linear representation) when repositioning inertial loads, high torque capability, and coaxial <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> [...] High gear reduction ratios are {{possible in a}} small volume (a ratio from 30:1 up to 320:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gears typically only produce a 10:1 ratio).|$|E
50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft. A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the idler wheel.|$|E
5000|$|The Hydrosteer {{system was}} based on a {{conventional}} cam-and-peg mechanism, except that the cam is surrounded by the skirt of a piston within the body of the steering box. Hydraulic power from the power steering pump is transmitted directly from the piston to the peg carrier. A spool type hydraulic valve moves along the axis of the cam in response to steering wheel movement, causing oil pressure to be applied to one side or other of the piston according to the direction the steering wheel is turned, and the load on the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most {{front-wheel-drive}} transmissions for {{transverse engine}} mounting are designed differently. For one thing, {{they have an}} integral final drive and differential. For another, they usually have only two shafts; <b>input</b> <b>and</b> countershaft, sometimes called <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output.</b> The <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> runs the whole length of the gearbox, {{and there is no}} separate input pinion. At {{the end of the second}} (counter/output) shaft is a pinion gear that mates with the ring gear on the differential.|$|R
50|$|The {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) is a transmission in which {{the ratio of the}} rotational speeds of two shafts, as the <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of a vehicle or other machine, can be varied continuously within a given range, providing an infinite number of possible ratios. The CVT allows the driver or a computer to select the relationship between the speed of the engine and the speed of the wheels within a continuous range. This can provide even better fuel economy if the engine constantly runs at a single speed. The transmission is, in theory, capable of a better user experience, without the rise and fall in speed of an engine, and the jerk felt when changing gears poorly.|$|R

5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber damper. The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression type coil springs placed between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> of the cush drive assembly.|$|E
50|$|The {{spur gear}} design of reverse gear {{represents}} some compromises (less robust, unsynchronized engagement and loud noise) which are acceptable {{due to the}} relatively small amount of driving {{that takes place in}} reverse. The gearbox of the classic SAAB 900 is a notable example of a gearbox with a helical reverse gear engaged in the same unsynchronized manner as the spur gears described above. Its design allows reverse to share cogs with first gear, and is exceptionally quiet, but results in difficult engagement and unreliable operation. However, many modern transmissions now include a reverse gear synchronizer and helical gearing, especially in applications which use three shafts as part of the transmission implementation instead of the conventional dual <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> (usually to permit a shorter gearbox for the number of gears provided), since the third shaft inherently provides the option to reverse output rotation while still allowing permanently meshing gears.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{critical}} components, {{very little}} attention has been paid for wet friction clutches in the monitoring and prognostics research field. This paper presents and discusses an overall methodology for assessing the health (performance) and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of wet friction clutches. Three principle features extracted from relative velocity signal measured between the <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of the clutch, namely (i) the normalized engagement duration, (ii) the normalized Euclidean distance and (iii) the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance are fused with a logistic regression technique into a single value called the health index. In logistic regression analysis, the output of the logistic model (i. e. the health index) is restricted between 0 and 1. Accordingly, the logistic model can guide the users to assess the state of a wet friction clutch either in healthy state (e. g. health index value of (close to) 1) or in failed state (e. g. health index value of (close to) 0). In terms of prognostics, the logarithm of the odds-of-success g defined as g = log(h/[1 -h]), where h denotes the health index, is used as the predicted variable. Once history data are sufficient for prediction, the weighted mean slope (WMS) method is implemented in this study to adaptively build a prognostics model and to predict the trajectory of g until it crosses a predetermined threshold. This way, the remaining useful life (RUL) of a clutch can be determined. Furthermore, an experimental verification of the proposed methodology has been performed on two history datasets obtained by performing accelerated life tests (ALTs) on two clutch packs with different friction materials but the same lubricant. The experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is promising and has a potential to be implemented for real-life applications. As was expected, the estimated RUL converges to the actual RUL and the uncertainty interval decreases over time that may indicate that the prognostics model improves as more evidence becomes available. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|With the {{projected}} growth of wind {{energy in the}} United States expected to account for 20 % of the energy portfolio by 2030, it can be expected that wind turbines will not only increase in number, but also in size. This increase in size implies that internal components, such as the gearbox, will also increase to handle the higher loads. And given the high failure rates for gearbox components already in existence, one could expect more failure if nothing is done to improve reliability. It {{is well known that}} wind loading is not constant, rather it is random and ultimately causes fatigue loading. This thesis is concerned with studying what the effects of dynamic loading are on a smaller gear system. It is assumed {{the findings of this study}} can be scaled to a larger wind turbine system. A simple spur gear pair is first simulated at constant loading to establish a baseline and then run with a sinusoidal input with differing amplitudes and frequencies. The hypothesis is that by varying the amplitude and frequency, the responses for gear contact force <b>and</b> <b>input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> torques will also vary. And if these variations are noted, then conclusions may be drawn as how the frequency and amplitude influence the system. After which, it may then be correlated to a wind turbine system. Knowing what affects the frequency and amplitude have on a smaller system may help to establish guidelines. For this model, mechanical simulation software is used to build a multibody dynamics model of a spur gear system with flexible shafts. Using known wind data obtained near Amarillo, TX, a matrix of possible frequencies and amplitudes for a sinusoidal <b>input</b> are implemented <b>and</b> the solutions compared to those at constant loading. It was found that the system responded similarly regardless of input, showing RMS values for accelerations of approximately 50 m/s 2, gear contact forces of 520 N, input shaft torques of 42 Nm, <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> torques of 78 Nm.
