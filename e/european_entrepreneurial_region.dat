40|$|The {{entrepreneurship}} {{and economic}} development agenda {{is one that is}} both academic and political. Places grow because they generate new firms. Underpinning the idea of entrepreneurship-led growth is the supposition that entrepreneurship can be stimulated at the regional level by policy intervention. A dilemma for policy makers, however, is the persistence of entrepreneurial regions independently of politics. To address this problem, the European Union has introduced the <b>European</b> <b>Entrepreneurial</b> <b>Region</b> (EER) project. The EER ‘is a project that identifies and rewards EU regions which show an outstanding and innovative entrepreneurial policy strategy, irrespective of their size, wealth and competences. The regions with the most credible, forward-thinking and promising vision plan are granted the label “European Entrepreneurial Region” (EER) for a specific year. ’ However, in the face of more firms, more jobs, wealth creation and lowering unemployment, there is still a lack of clear evidence of the impact of enterprise policies. The chapter considers how regions become entrepreneurial and which organizations are dominant in shaping visions and coordinating entrepreneurial activity. The high-tech entrepreneurial regions of Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire in the UK are used to illustrate, even in apparently similar regions, the distinctive differences in how the entrepreneurial region concept is developed and enacted at the local level...|$|E

40|$|Much {{existing}} work {{argues that}} {{a small number of}} high growth start-ups create the majority of new firm jobs; that policies aiming to increase the volume (i. e. number) of start-ups in the UK’s less <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>regions</b> may adversely affect their growth or quality; and, therefore, policy should target high growth new starts. To test these arguments, a database of all UK independent limited companies set up between 2001 and 2005 still operating in 2008 was constructed and analysed. In 2008 there were 351, 000 such start-ups with 1. 51 â€‰m employees. Defining high growth as firms with over 24 employees in 2008, high growth start-ups did not create the majority of new firm jobs and the ‘job creation problem’ in the UK’s less <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>regions</b> is too few start-ups rather than a relative absence of high growth start-ups. Consequently, in the UK’s less <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>regions</b> policy should aim to increase the volume of start-ups. business start-ups; business support; employment growth; high growth firms; new firms; regional development; regional policy; small firms...|$|R

In this study, we focus on one type of platform boundary resource, namely application programming interfaces (APIs).

Using a data-driven visual network analysis approach to examine more than 15, 000 APIs and mashups, we first map the global locations of where APIs are being created.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Early stage {{venture capital}} {{investments}} declined sharply following the post- 2000 technology crash. Investment activity began to pick-up by mid-decade, {{in large measure}} {{as a result of}} increased public sector involvement, but has been brought to a halt by the global financial crisis. At the regional scale, several northern regions now have more than their expected share of early stage venture capital investment. However, deal sizes are small, hence early stage venture capital, measured by the total amount invested, remains over-concentrated in London and the south-east. Moreover, the public sector now dominates much of the investment activity in the midlands and north. The paper argues that public sector venture capital is unable to create <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>regions</b> and that a regionally-based model of public sector venture capital is ineffective because it lacks scale. A new approach for venture capital-deficient regions is therefore required which gives greater emphasis to the demand-side...|$|R

Then, using data for Great Britain, the paper shows the employment impact of new firm formation is significantly positive in England, but zero in Scotland where formation rates are much lower. It also shows that, in the low enterprise counties of GB, new firm formation has a negative effect on employment, implying that we find that the "wrong type of entrepreneurship" is possible.

After first reviewing the evolution of the household deposit market during the 1990 s, they explore regional variations in net withdrawals from Sberbank branches during the period August-October 1998 as well as identify characteristics of individual/household depositors making (or attempting to make) such withdrawals. More severe runs on Sberbank outlets are found to be associated with more affluent and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>regions,</b> regions of more youthful and less educated population closer to Moscow, and areas with greater media freedom.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of the most important factors for SMEs’ performance, survival and growth in EU. The main objective is to consider what determines the potential failure of young companies to innovate and grow. The importance for new, young and thus often still small firms to introduce innovations and grow is commonly claimed. Therefore, factors that would inhibit these small, young companies to achieve their goals can have a huge public impact. The research results show that the age of the firm (which reflects its reputation) is important to {{the degree to which the}} firm feels financially constrained. Also, finance barriers can be associated with the market failure. Risk and informational asymmetries create capital market imperfections and a firm’s lack of reputation and collateral become crucial elements. Conclusions reveal that the ability of SMEs to grow depends highly on their potential to invest in restructuring, innovation and qualification. All of these investments require capital and therefore access to finance. Recent policy initiatives aim at improving the financial environment for <b>European</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> activity and, more specifically, at supporting newly-founded innovative firms in order to increase their global competitiveness and spur innovation.

However as presented in the title, the study will go further {{by comparing the results}} of those strategies in familiar and nonfamiliar businesses. This study was carried on in construction and industry sectors, in the region of Vale do Sousa, in the north of Portugal. In order to classify businesses as familiar or non-familiar types two criterion were adopted: (1) Management Control, (2) Family Employability. On the opposite to some studies that present a larger percentage of familiar businesses in national and <b>European</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> fabric, the criterion used leaded to a larger number of non-familiar businesses (53 %). The results showed that in general SMEs in this region are not following entrepreneurship strategies. Analysing the entire sample without a separation of businesses by nature (familiar/non-familiar) only proactivity showed to be more present in the managerial decisions. There is a lack of innovation and risk culture. Comparing the groups only on proactivity tests was possible to verify some differences. It was concluded that non-familiar businesses are more proactive than familiar ones. Between those groups there are no statistical differences on the means of the variables innovation and risk.

The region which may be characterised as an ?industrial district?, is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises. It is well-known for its entrepreneurial spirit and in the international literature it has been compared with other <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>regions,</b> such as ?the third Italy?, Rhone-Alps, Baden-Wurttemberg, and Silicon Valley. The employment share for manufacturing in the region is approximately double that of the rest of Sweden. This pattern seems to be very stable over time. Industries which are declining in other parts of Sweden are actually expanding in this region. The purpose of the current paper is to try to explain why the manufacturing industry is so successful in this region. In the paper we test a number of different hypotheses. In particular, we investigate whether the apparent success is the result of higher productivity growth or if it is the result of low input costs, mainly low wages. Differences in productivity growth or in input costs might be the result of the existence of particular types of agglomeration economies. In the paper we investigate the role of such economies. In the analysis we use productivity and gross profit distributions of Salter type. These distributions we estimate by using data on sales value, value added and wages for the manufacturing industry in Sweden for various years collected by Statistics Sweden. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>entrepreneurial</b> undertaking, in {{the form}} of an {{equipped}} and armed merchant ship, ready to circumnavigate and conquer the Globe, created the modern world as a world with one side only: the mondialised West. To be globalised today, such a world has to be re-made as a new net, but now as a new multitask and multidirectional entrepreneurial feedback. Contemporary global liberal interventionism and governmental entrepreneurship are segmented today into a dangerously simplified multitask global pyramid of governance through one-directional cascades. For a real globalisation, this process has to be two-directional at least: from the center to the periphery – but from the periphery to the center, too. Otherwise, at the beginning of a new “centennial trend” and a “great cycle”, there is the risk that the collapse of the liberal civilization of the 19 th century could be repeated, once again due to the weakness of the world system peripheries. The question how to strengthen the “anonymous” global cultural and political processes of that two-directional kind is becoming the central global and strategic issue for today’s politics and political science. It has turned out that these processes in the real global environment could be successfully analyzed and effectively made use of only with the complete unreduced methodical front of all the fields of political science i. e. a whole set of expertly managed public policies. From the historically based Croatian point of view, its opportunity for integration into the world center was always in finding a world-market “niche”, never in creating a mini-empire or in controlling a mondialized or a mega-national net. Without a methodically global political science approach, leaning on Central European and Mediterranean cultural and political science traditions, such Croatian interests will not be fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{deals with}} the {{questions}} if and how entrepreneurship education and access to research at university stimulate student start-ups. The phenomenon of student entrepreneurs is approached in three empirical studies. In the first study mail questionnaires were sent out to former entrepreneurship students at three universities in Sweden, {{in order to find}} out if the students’ entrepreneurial behaviour was influenced by education. The second study explores differences in communication skills and the handling of liabilities of newness between entrepreneurs with entrepreneurship education at university and/or previous start-up experience. Student entrepreneurs are compared with a control group of randomly chosen Swedish entrepreneurs. In the third study, the influence from university research on student entrepreneurship as well as direct and indirect regional effects are examined through interviews with university spin-offs around Halmstad University. Entrepreneurship education at university is found to influence entrepreneurial behaviour, to increase the student’s awareness of business opportunities and to result in high start-up frequency early in life. The student entrepreneurs perceive fewer problems to handle some aspects of liability of newness as well as communicative skills in terms of openness and adaptation. Other-orientation is on the other hand supported by previous start-up experience. Hence, with experience from both entrepreneurship education and previous start-up, the students seem well prepared for future start-ups. The case study show multiple and long term indirect effects from student entrepreneurship in developing an <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>region.</b> Established student entrepreneurs support less experienced student entrepreneurs by linking them to supplementary resources.

40|$|The Bergslagen {{region in}} Sweden {{has a history}} of iron and steel production, and in the small {{industrial}} towns in the region, one large employer has often held a strong position. Although the region has gone through structural change since the 1970 ’s, in previous research, becoming self-employed is perceived of as difficult, since it implies going against a strong working culture. The image of Bergslagen is that of a non-entrepreneurial region. Furthermore, in previous research, the gender contract in the region is characterized as traditional. In this thesis light is shed on women in the region who are self-employed. Topics that are focused on are work experience, role models, family situation and networks. The study builds on qualitative interviews and longitudinal registry based statistics (1993 - 2003). The interviews were carried out in the municipalities of Norberg and Fagersta with self-employed women in the fields of health and business services. Conclusions drawn concern both the region Bergslagen as an <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>region</b> and the lives of self-employed women. The situations and conditions under which women become and remain self-employed displays a complex interaction between different areas of life, both in relation to the start-up phase and the subsequent running of their businesses. The idea of the region as non-entrepreneurial is scrutinized. For one, the share of self-employed in the Bergslagen municipalities only differs among men, compared to the national average. The share of self-employed women in the region, however, is similar to the national average. Furthermore, the share of self-employed men and women varies among the municipalities within the region. Thus, it is problematic to speak of the region as non-entrepreneurial and as homogenous when it comes to self-employment and entrepreneurship. These findings indicate that the idea of the region as non-entrepreneurial is an expression of both the region being male coded and women entrepreneurs being subordinated...|$|R

Conversely, the impact of GVC alone appears to be negligible.

Our results remain stable after controlling for endogeneity, survivorship bias, reverse causality, anticipation effects, legal and institutional differences across countries and over time and are stable with respect to potential non-linear patterns in the growth dynamics of entrepreneurial firms.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study on {{entrepreneurial}} financing and the support mechanisms that exist to help founders manage their entrepreneurial journey between the establishment phase and the growth phase. It is an analysis of different funding alternatives and challenges that occur when a start-up enter the growth phase. It is also a feasibility study of how Norway can improve as an entrepreneurial country and, more specifically, Stavanger as an <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>region.</b> Throughout a qualitative interview process, the assignment highlights how the start-up ecosystem in Stavanger support growth-oriented entrepreneurs related to the ongoing readjustment that will radically affect the labour market in the Stavanger region. Moreover, the report analyses situations where many Norwegian entrepreneurs struggle to grow further. This period, {{often referred to as}} the “valley of death”, do often characterise situations when public development funds are used, and where start-ups involves too high risk in order to receive bank financing. Finding risk capital to finance growth in early growth stages is one of the biggest challenges that entrepreneurs face. An increased amount of private investments to finance early stage growth have proven to have a significant impact on economic growth in many countries. The results from the interview process indicates that many entrepreneurs needs a better overview of different financial resources available in the early growth phase and that the private investor environment in Stavanger is not visible enough. The results are important for Stavanger in order to build a more progressive investment community with expertise within other fields than the oil and gas industry. Norway needs to continue improving the investment culture in level with Sweden, Finland and Denmark. These countries have succeeded to attract a much higher percent of venture capital investments and hence, developed more internationally successful ventures. There is a need for implementing tax-incentives that can motivate more local investors to invest in start-ups in early stages. An increased amount of governmental pre-seed funding will be one solution in order to co-finance and share technological risk with private investors, and at the same time motivate them to contribute to the readjustment process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the unification or rather harmonization potential of European requirements concerning documentary evidences. These evidences are necessary to exempt intra-Community supplies from value-added tax (VAT). The analysis concerns not only the concrete differences in the national requirements but also the fulfillment of <b>European</b> and <b>entrepreneurial</b> conditions and the existence of potential best solutions. The results of the analysis are not only interesting for entrepreneurs but also for researches. The former ones benefit from this thesis as an overview of the differences is provided and along coming difficulties as additional efforts are studied. For the latter group this thesis contributes to research in general as no European-wide comparison is available and in particular as internationalization decisions are influenced or even affected by the design of documentary evidences in the respective EU Member States. Hence, the review of literature, the VAT Directive, Council Directives and decisions of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) provide a theoretical basis that shows the need for documentary evidences, the reason for the national differences and their potential design. Furthermore, this basis is used to establish a catalogue of criteria that includes the EU as the initiator of the requirements and the entrepreneur as the person responsible for fulfilling these requirements {{in order to be able}} to compare and analyze the national differences. The study of different national law texts and a survey aiming on the collection of further national requirements led to the comparison and analysis of 16 Member States. Hence, it was possible to conclude that the differences in the requirements on documentary evidences are partly striking but that a common requirement basis would be possible. This was also supported by the facts that none of the countries fulfills both the <b>European</b> and the <b>entrepreneurial</b> requirements and that no country provides a best solution. Therefore, a harmonization proposal is provided that takes also the national wish for sovereignty into account. This study is restricted by certain limitations concerning formal requirements, facilitating definitions, quality of data and ignorance of further factors. Anyhow, the results that were drawn are valid and important in the limits of this thesis. They do not only indicate that a basic harmonization of requirements on documentary evidences would be advantageous but also that further research potential is available and necessary.

The concept, developed in the late 1970 s, suggests that the regional production frontier depends on input capacities that can be over- or underutilized, once a benchmark, i. e. a national yardstick, is defined. In this paper, this concept is taken up and applied to united Germany. Including variables that capture headquarter and R&D effects of firms on regional income to account for the <b>entrepreneurial</b> competence in <b>regions</b> extends a recent paper. It is shown that headquarter functions play a decisive role in describing the east-west income divide. In total, 85 % of the East’s average income lag is explained by three factors: technology, headquarter functions, and transport accessibility. ...|$|R

40|$|Globally {{universities}} are facing an increasingly dynamic environment, {{and many have}} responded through becoming more <b>entrepreneurial.</b> <b>European</b> and US universities have adopted new governance structures, diversified their funding, changed their organisational structures and adopted an entrepreneurial culture to drive more innovative behaviour. Using multiple case studies, based on semi-structured interviews, the barriers and opportunities for entrepreneurialism in five UAE {{universities are}} identified. UAE universities possess inherent qualities necessary for entrepreneurialism, including steerage, concern for economic surplus plus their performance driven environment allows quick response to the dynamic external environment; however, there are certain areas that require further development such as developing a culture of innovation, incentivising Universities to take risks as well as gaining appropriate support from the State. Based {{on the results of}} this work a change agenda has been chartered to further support and develop entrepreneurial universities in the Middle Eastern environment...|$|R
