50|$|Following <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in the core, {{the overall}} stellar {{structure}} drastically changes. Hydrogen burning now {{takes place in}} a narrow shell surrounding the newly processed helium core. While the helium core quickly contracts and heats up, the layers above the hydrogen-burning shell undergo important expansion and cooling. The star becomes a red giant whose radius and luminosity increase in time. These stars are now located on the so-called red giant branch of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram; they are commonly named RGB stars. Once their central temperature reaches 100 106 K, helium starts burning in the core. For stellar masses smaller than about 2 Mʘ, this new combustion {{takes place in a}} highly degenerate matter and proceeds through a helium flash. The readjustment following the flash brings the red giant to the so-called red clump (RC) in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.|$|E
40|$|Clock {{reactions}} are rare kinetic phenomena, so far limited mostly to systems with ionic oxoacids and oxoanions in water. We report a new clock reaction in cyclohexanol that forms molybdenum blue from a noncharged, yellow molybdenum complex as precursor, {{in the presence}} of hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, the concomitant color change is reversible, enabling multiple clock cycles to be executed consecutively. The kinetics of the clock reaction were experimentally characterized, and by adding insights from quantum chemical calculations, a plausible reaction mechanism was postulated. Key elementary reaction steps comprise sigmatropic rearrangements with five-membered or bicyclo[3. 1. 0] transition states. Importantly, numerical kinetic modeling demonstrated the mechanism’s ability to reproduce the experimental findings. It also revealed that clock behavior is intimately connected to the sudden <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide. Due to the stoichiometric coproduction of ketone, the reaction bears potential for application in alcohol oxidation catalysis. Swiss National Science Foundatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} 2 p-capture {{reactions}} on rp-process nucleosynthesis in novae and X-ray bursts was investigated. In this context an improved formalism for {{the calculation of}} 2 p-capture reaction rates is presented. In addition, a new experimental technique is described that allows to investigate very proton rich nuclei using the (#alpha#," 8 He) -reaction. With this technique, the level energies {{of the first two}} excited states in " 2 " 4 Si have been determined {{for the first time to}} be 1. 879 #+-# 0. 011 and 3. 441 #+-# 0. 010 MeV. An improved value for the " 2 " 8 S mass excess of 4. 192 #+-# 0. 034 MeV has also been measured. The new data allow a more accurate calculation of the " 2 " 3 Al(p,#gamma#) " 2 " 4 Si- and the " 2 " 7 P(p,#gamma#) " 2 " 8 S-reaction rate and thus of the 2 p-capture rates of " 2 " 2 Mg and " 2 " 6 Si. Based on calculations with the improved reaction network it is shown that the new 2 p-capture rate on " 2 " 2 Mg does not solve the discrepancy between the large " 2 " 2 Na yields predicted by some nova models and recent COMPTEL observations. For X-ray bursts, the first calculation of the full rp-process reaction path is presented. Since 2 p-capture reactions accelerate the reaction flow considerably, the rp-process in a 23 s burst reaches nuclei as heavy as " 9 " 8 Cd. The rp-process above " 5 " 6 Ni doubles energy production and fuel consumption but does not lead to a complete <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> fuel. The enery production rate shows extreme variations, which could be observable in the burst profiles. The ashes of X-ray bursts consists of a whole range of elements between Zn and Ru and contains especially large amounts of the light p-nuclei " 9 " 2 Mo, " 9 " 4 Mo, " 9 " 6 Ru and " 9 " 8 Ru. If some of the burned material escapes into the interstellar medium, X-ray bursts could be the production site for the solar system abundances of these nuclei. (orig.) 159 refs.

40|$|Abstract. We {{summarise}} {{the main}} properties of Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, including their structure, evolution and nucleosynthesis. The main physical mechanisms are outlined, {{as are the}} uncertainties. In keeping with the multi-disciplinary nature of this meeting, this paper is designed {{for those who are}} not experts in stellar structure. 1 What Is An AGB Star? Most stars will pass through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. Although only a brief phase compared to the overall stellar lifetime, these stars experience substantial nucleosynthesis during this phase. Further, they find ways of mixing the results of this synthesis to the surface, where stellar winds expel the material into the interstellar medium. The AGB phase is the last phase of evolution for low and intermediate mass stars (about 1 – 8 M⊙). The evolution leading up to this phase has been discussed in detail in [16] and [15]. Briefly, stars begin by burning hydrogen in their cores, on the main sequence. Following the <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> their central <b>hydrogen</b> supply, they become red-giants. During this phase the stars develop a deep convective envelope which extends inwards and can reach into regions where partial hydrogen burning has taken place. This is called the “first dredge-up ” event, and it results in polluting the stellar surface with the products <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> burning. The ascent of the giant branch is terminated by ignition of the central helium supply, either degenerately in a core flash (in the case of low mass stars, below about 2. 5 M⊙) or non-degenerately (for higher masses). The subsequent evolution is characterized by helium burning in a convective core and a steadily advancing hydrogen burning shell. For low mass stars the evolution is complicated by semiconvection, but this a detail we do not need for our present purposes. The fusion of helium produce...|$|R
40|$|The rapid <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> {{fossil fuel}} {{reserves}} and {{the adverse effects}} of climate change have attracted global attention and pose serious threats to mankind. The emergence of new energy technologies based on new materials discovery is crucial if the world is to arrest the adverse {{effects of climate change}} and secure the global energy security based on sustainable and renewable energy sources.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{to remove}} hydrogen selectively from ethane/ethene mixtures, as obtained during the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane, is investigated. In contrast to current practice in oxidative dehydrogenation, selective oxidation <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is performed over mixed oxide solid oxygen carriers (SOCs) {{rather than using}} O 2 gas. In this way a cyclic process is obtained where hydrogen is oxidized {{up to the point}} <b>of</b> <b>exhaustion</b> <b>of</b> the SOC. Subsequently the SOC is regenerated by oxidation with oxygen. The major obstacle to this cyclic operation is the development of a SOC material with sufficient selectivity, stability and oxygen storage capacity.
