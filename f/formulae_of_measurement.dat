According to the primary functions of this kind of robot, three irrelevant technologies, pattern recognition, binocular vision and motion estimation, make up of the basic technologies of our robot. The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm is applied to detect the target. The application method of NMF in our robot is demonstrated. Interesting observations on distance measurement and motion capture are discussed in detail. The reasons resulting in error <b>of</b> distance <b>measurement</b> are analyzed. According to the models and <b>formulas</b> <b>of</b> distance <b>measurement</b> error, the error type could be found, which is helpful to decrease the distance error.

40|$|The optical method Digital Speckle Correlation Measurement (DSCM) {{has been}} {{extensively}} applied due its capability to measure the entire displacement field over a body surface. A <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> displacement <b>measurement</b> errors by the gradient-based DSCM method was derived. The errors were found to explicitly relate to the image grayscale errors consisting of sub-pixel interpolation algorithm errors, image noise, and subset deformation mismatch at each point of the subset. A power-law dependence of the standard deviation <b>of</b> displacement <b>measurement</b> errors on the subset size was established when the subset deformation was rigid body translation and random image noise was dominant and it was confirmed by both the numerical and experimental results.

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognized that identifying {{the degree of}} blame or responsibility <b>of</b> each <b>formula</b> for inconsistency <b>of</b> a knowledge base (i. e. a set <b>of</b> <b>formulas)</b> is useful for making rational decisions to resolve inconsistency in that knowledge base. Most current techniques for measuring the blame <b>of</b> each <b>formula</b> with regard to an inconsistent knowledge base focus on classical knowledge bases only.

However, the notion of priority is important in inconsistency-tolerant reasoning. This article investigates this issue and presents a family <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> for the degree of blame <b>of</b> each <b>formula</b> in an inconsistent prioritized knowledge base by using the minimal inconsistent subsets of that knowledge base.

40|$|Purpose - To {{identify}} key success {{factors related}} to internet advertising, in the specific case of a portal directed at a teenage audience in Hong Kong; to derive a generally applicable formula for measuring the effectiveness of internet advertising. Design/methodology/approach - Proposes a framework for advertising effectiveness that includes traditional objective measures (click-through rates), subjective measures applied by advertisers, and seasonality corrections. Derives a mathematical <b>formula</b> for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> effectiveness. Extracts components from ten banner advertising campaigns at one web site between January 2001 and May 2002, and analyses them by means of proprietary data-mining rule-induction software. Selects two rules form the several generated, {{on the basis of}} confidence levels. Findings - Finds that, in the case example studied: small interactive games and free gifts deliver the highest brand impression after normalization of the banner click-through rate; revenue is significantly affected by local cultural and seasonal factors; "media-rich" design {{is an important factor in}} attracting the target audience to click on a banner. Notes the importance of countering the natural variability of click-through rates, and proposes a variety of design add-ons to stabilise them. Research limitations/implications - The study relates to a very specific case example of internet advertising in one special administrative area of China. Caution is therefore indicated in applying the proposed model and formula or the related communication strategies more generally. Future research should investigate the conversion of muse-clicks to sales. Practical implications - Since, the cost to internet users of switching from one site to another is almost zero, competition for audiences is particularly severe, and planned marketing communication strategies essential to effective performance. In particular, continuing uncertainty about the cause-effect link to sales threatens the revenue stream for firms that rely heavily on internet advertising. It is vital that such advertisers keep abreast of relevant research, such as the case study reported here. Originality/value - The proposed <b>formula</b> for <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> effectiveness is original in combining objective and subjective measures of effectiveness. The general principles underpinning strategic conclusions drawn in this particular situation could be selective applied by planners of internet advertising campaigns for other products and services to other target audiences.

Either measurement was taken in vivo over the scrotal skin and again in vitro after castration, excluding or including, when possible, the epididymis. In a sub-sample of 14 testes of 7 randomly selected dogs, the testicular volume was calculated by the <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> an ellipsoid: length (l) x width (w) x height (h) x 0. 5236, and the empiric <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> Lambert: (l) x (w) x (h) x 0. 71. The calculated volumes were then compared to the actual ones, which were estimated by water displacement. For each measurement method, the formula that estimated more accurately the true testicular volume was, subsequently, applied to the calculation of the testicular volume of the remaining testes. The <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> ellipsoid estimated testicular volume more accurately when in vivo and in vitro caliper measurements and in vitro ultrasound measurements were performed. The <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> Lambert estimated testicular volume more accurately when in vivo ultrasound measurements were performed. The volumes calculated from the <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> calipers over the scrotal skin overestimated true volumes, on average, by 69 +/- 27 % (concordance correlation coefficient r(ccc) = 0. 49). By contrast, those calculated from the ultrasonography measurements were more accurate, overestimating the true volumes by 17 +/- 24 % (r(ccc) = 0. 81). Therefore, ultrasonography when the <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> Lambert is used is more accurate than caliper methods for the estimation of testicular volume in clinical practice and should be the method of choice.
