Effect of various mechanisms’ parameters including crank length, flexibility of the connecting rod and the slider׳s mass on the dynamic behaviour is studied. Two control schemes are proposed for elastodynamic vibration suppression of the flexible connecting rod and also obtaining a constant angular velocity for the crank. The first scheme is based on feedback linearization approach and the second one {{is based on a}} sliding mode controller. The input signals are applied by an electric motor located at the crank <b>ground</b> <b>joint,</b> and two layers of piezoelectric film bonded to the top and bottom surfaces of the connecting rod.

40|$|Humans can {{communicate}} even with few existing conventions in common (e. g., when they lack a shared language). We explored {{what makes this}} phenomenon possible with a nonlinguistic experimental task requiring participants to coordinate towards a common goal. We observed participants creating new communicative conventions using the most minimal possible signals. These conventions, furthermore, changed trial-by-trial in response to shared environmental and task constraints. Strikingly, as a result, signals of the same form were able to successfully convey contradictory messages from trial to trial. Such behavior implicates what we term "joint inference," in which social interactants are inferring, in the moment, the most sensible communicative convention {{in light of their}} common <b>ground.</b> <b>Joint</b> inference may help to elucidate how communicative conventions emerge “instantaneously,” and how they are modified and reshaped into the elaborate systems of conventions involved in human communication, including natural languages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Collaborative learning, {{as both a}} {{pedagogical}} {{method and}} a cognitive mechanism plays {{a prominent role in}} the Learning Sciences. In this symposium we will use the term “cognitive convergence ” to encompass various concepts that have been used to explain the important processes underlying successful collaboration, such as intersubjectivity, coconstruction, knowledge convergence, common <b>ground,</b> <b>joint</b> problem space, and transactive reasoning. The goal of the symposium is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms of cognitive convergence and to relate cognitive convergence to individual learning outcomes. We include studies that emphasize detailed analyses of the mechanisms, provide ideas about how to conceptualize and measure convergence, and include qualitative and quantitative measures of shared and converging learning outcomes. A special emphasis will be on methodological questions about how to analyze the processes of achieving convergence and how to assess how convergence affects outcomes of collaborative learning.

40|$|Powered {{prosthetic}} {{devices are}} robotic {{systems that are}} aimed to restore the mobility of subjects with amputations above the knee by imitating {{the behavior of a}} normal human leg. Powered prostheses have diverse advantages compared to passive devices, including the possibility of reducing the metabolic cost of the user, providing net power into the walking gait and walking on diverse terrain. In particular, this thesis is focused on the capacity of powered transfemoral prostheses to adapt to diverse terrains. Since most terrains consist of flat and inclined surfaces, it is important that a transfemoral prosthesis can walk on these surfaces and have the capacity to seamlessly transition from one surface to another. However, currently available controllers require either intention recognition procedures that delay the terrain transition or a collection of parameters that require a large tuning process for each possible surface profile. In this thesis, we propose a framework that can generate automatically stable and human-like gaits for both surfaces with immediate transition between them. The new framework is based on human-inspired control and a spline-based trajectory generation. Specifically, the proposed method i) inserts a set of cubic splines that smoothly blend the flat <b>ground</b> <b>joint</b> trajectories into arbitrary upslope surface joint trajectories for the ankle and knee joints and ii) employs a low gain PD control for terrain adaptation for various unknown surfaces. This framework is implemented on the powered transfemoral prosthetic device, AMPRO II, for both flat ground and upslope walking to test its use as a nominal controller. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework provides walking gaits for flat ground and upslope with seamlessly smooth transitioning gaits between them...|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described whereby powder specimens of controlled volatile content {{may be obtained}} for X-ray analysis. In the examination of clays, particularly those that have a variable basal spacing, it is frequently desired to prepare sealed specimens containing no adsorbed water and or other volatile substance, or at equilibrium with known pressures of such substances. Various methods {{have been used in}} the past for this purpose. The most effective one was that described by Mooney, Keenan and Wood 0952), who packed the powdered specimens into pyrex capillaries sealed to larger tubing, which was in turn connected to the vacuum and adsorption apparatus through a <b>ground</b> <b>joint</b> and a stopcock. This method has some disadvantages, such as the necessity of carrying out some fairly elaborate preliminary work before the preparation of each specimen. Considerable glass blowing skill is also required to draw out the pyrex tubes to the correct cross section and wall thick-ness at a short distance from the wider tubing, thus avoiding exces-sively long pumping times. Another disadvantage is that the pyrex glass has a relatively high absorption capacity for the softer X-rays, such as cobalt radiation, which are preferred for the examination of the long spacings of the clay minerals. Since special ithium borate (Lindemann glass) capillary tubes of negligible X-ray absorption capacity and suitable dimensions (e. g., 0. 2 ram. internal diameter) can be obtained commercially, it was desirable to devise a method to use these capillaries for the above purpose. The simple method described below, which was found to be quite satisfactory, makes use of the fact that Lindemann glass has a con-siderably lower melting temperature than the usual types of boro-silicate glass, such as pyrex. The particular type of Lindemann glass supplied for X-ray specimens by Philips Electrical Ltd. was found to melt sufficiently to seal the capillary at about 500 - 525 ~ which is more than 200 degrees lower than the corresponding tern...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} few years several methods have been {{described}} for the calibration of Warburg flasks and manometers with mercury 1, ~ 8. Although in all these methods the calibration is carried out in two steps, so that it can easily be performed by one operator, they have the disadvantage, in our view, that the flasks must always be filled with so much mercury that it exactly reaches a predetermined mark on the side-arm capillary when the flask is seated on the <b>ground</b> <b>joint</b> of the manometer. This adjustment of the volume of mercury gives unnecessary and time-consuming work. The following method, which does not possess this difficulty, is very rapid, and has given com-plete satisfaction in our laboratory for a number of years. a. Flask F is filled with so much mercury, paying due attention to the removal of trapped air bubbles, that when it is connected to the manometer in position i, the mercury rises to some arbi trary point M 1 in side-arm capillary C 1. This point is marked with a glass-marking pencil. Flask F is de-tached and the mercury is poured into a tared beaker. b. With the manometer in position 2, a short rubber tube R, closed at one end with a short piece of glass rod and filled with mercury, is pushed over the capillary at opening T 1, while stopcock S is open. The rubber tube is pushed on so F ~ 2 fax, and the manometer held at such an angle, that the mercury simultaneously rises to mark M 1 on side-arm capillary C 1 and to the reference mark M 2 on capillary C = (usually 16 o ram). The stopcock is closed in such a manner that the tail end com-municates with 'the capillary above the stopcock at T 1, and the rubber tube and the mercury in the capillary above the stopcock are removed. The manometer is now tilted to position 3, with opening T = above the tared beaker (that already con-tains the mercury from flask F), and the mercury is allowed to run out at Tz by pulling out stopcock S (it cannot be opened, because then the mercury in the bore would also run out) ...|$|E
