5|$|Before {{receiving}} the French intelligence material, Rejewski {{had made a}} careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form — a six-letter <b>indicator.</b> The <b>indicator</b> was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the <b>indicator</b> was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To develop <b>indicators</b> {{to assess}} quality of {{continuing}} care {{for persons with}} alcohol use disorder (AUD). Methods: A guideline-based RAND-modiﬁed Delphi method was used to develop and validate <b>indicators</b> regarding the process and outcome of continuing care. We systematically searched for evidence-based guidelines and existing quality <b>indicators.</b> A multidisciplinary expert panel prioritized recommendations using a written questionnaire followed by a group discussion. Important recommendations were then translated to quality <b>indicators.</b> The panel subsequently selected <b>indicators</b> that were measurable and applicable in Belgium. In a ﬁnal round the <b>indicators</b> facevalidity was assessed. Results: We extracted 69 recommendations from 06 guidelines and 17 relevant quality <b>indicators.</b> Of all, 13 <b>indicators</b> remained after 03 written rounds and 02 group discussions. Conclusions: This study describes a systematic approach to develop and validate quality <b>indicators</b> for continuing care for AUD. The ﬁnal set of selected <b>indicators</b> consisted of 10 process and 03 outcome <b>indicators.</b> As the level of evidence of effective continuing care components is very low further development of the <b>indicators</b> is recommended.

5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} beetles have been {{suggested}} as suitable as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an <b>indicator</b> taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas and saproxylic beetles in forests have been suggested as potential <b>indicator</b> species.|$|E

5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed <b>indicator,</b> a heading <b>indicator</b> and a VOR <b>indicator,</b> among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} and analyze energy key performance <b>indicators</b> among large European companies. Energy usage has become a very meaningful topic for both internal management as well as external stakeholders of a company. A review of current literature suggests that while environmental <b>indicators</b> in general have found broad attention and plenty of theories concerning good and meaningful <b>indicators</b> are published, no study investigating actually applied energy <b>indicators</b> exists. Therefore, this study gives an overview of predominant <b>indicators</b> on energy consumption and efficiency in three different energyintensive industries. Through the application of content analysis to energy <b>indicators</b> published online, in separate reports or in the company’s annual report, the content and quality of <b>indicators</b> was assessed and compared. The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest, that reporting on energy key performance <b>indicators</b> in general takes place at a high quality level, with disclosures being qualitative as well as quantitative and oftentimes comparable over time.
