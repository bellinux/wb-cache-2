25|$|A National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) study noted {{particle}} {{emissions from}} a <b>fused</b> <b>filament</b> peaked {{a few minutes}} after printing started and returned to baseline levels 100 minutes after printing ended. Emissions from <b>fused</b> <b>filament</b> printers can include a large number of ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} from emissions {{varies by}} source material due {{to differences in}} size, chemical properties, and quantity of emitted particles. Excessive exposure to VOCs can lead to irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headache, loss of coordination, and nausea and some of the chemical emissions of <b>fused</b> <b>filament</b> printers have also been linked to asthma. Based on animal studies, carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers sometimes used in <b>fused</b> <b>filament</b> printing can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis when at the nanoparticle size.|$|E
25|$|The {{problems}} {{noted in}} the NIOSH report were reduced by using manufacturer-supplied covers and full enclosures, using proper ventilation, keeping workers away from the printer, using respirators, turning off the printer if it jammed, and using lower emission printers and filaments.

2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In <b>Fused</b> <b>filament</b> fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This work aims to {{evaluate}} the influence of rheological properties of building materials on the bonding quality and ultimate tensile strength in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, through the investigation of parts printed by semi-crystalline and amorphous resins. Little information is currently available {{about the influence of}} the crystalline nature on FDM-printed part quality. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-crystalline polyamide 12 and amorphous acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were used to assess the influence of rheological properties on bonding quality and the tensile strength, by varying three important process parameters: materials, liquefier temperature and raster orientation. A fractography of both tensile and freeze-fractured samples was also investigated. Findings - The rheological properties, mainly the melt viscosity, were found to have a significant influence on the bonding quality of <b>fused</b> <b>filaments.</b> Better bonding quality and higher tensile strength of FDM parts printed with semi-crystalline PA 12, as compared with amorphous ABS, are suggested to be a result of higher initial sintering rates owing to the lower melt viscosity of PA 12 at low shear rates. Near-full dense PA 12 parts were obtained by FDM. Originality/value - This project provides a variety of data and insight regarding the effect of materials properties on the mechanical performance of FDM-printed parts. The results showed that FDM technique allows the production of PA 12 parts with adequate mechanical performance, overcoming the greatest limitation of a dependence on amorphous thermoplastics as a feedstock for the production of prototypes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{molecular}} phylogenetic {{study of}} Durio s. lat. was conducted based on sequences {{of the internal}} transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA for 30 ingroup exemplars, representing 16 species, and two taxa of Cullenia as outgroups. The phylogeny suggests the existence of two well-circumscribed clades composed, respectively, of species with poricidal pollen locules (Boschia) and species with pollen locules that open with longitudinal slits (Durio s. str.). The latter clade is subdivided into two strongly supported clades: /Tubulidurio, with highly <b>fused</b> <b>filaments</b> and free calyx lobes, and /Palatadurio, with largely free filaments and connate calyx lobes. We provide phylogenetic definitions for the names of these well-supported clades. Reconstruction of floral evolution {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis that vertebrate pollination is ancestral for Durio s. lat. and Cullenia. However, there have been further shifts in pollination system within Durio s. lat., which may account for some of the current diversity of floral characters. The correlation of fruit and aril characteristics suggests that there are two major dispersal syndromes, involving either birds (fruits opening on trees; aril red/yellow and odorless) or terrestrial mammals (fruits opening only after falling to the ground; aril pale colored and pungent). The distribution of extant taxa implies a Malesian origin and radiation of the study group, with a single dispersal of Cullenia to India and Sri Lanka. However, the fossil pollen record raises the possibility that Durio and relatives may have migrated to Southeast Asia from the Indian subcontinent after it collided with Asia. A molecular clock analysis suggests that the earliest divergence within the study group occurred about 20 to 32 mya and, hence, does not favor either biogeographic scenario...|$|R

40|$|We {{interpret}} extensive field {{observations of}} terata {{in the context}} of recent insights into monocot phylogeny and evolutionary-developmental genetics to explore the evolution of the orchid flower. Our arguably typological classification of floral terata focuses on natural occurrences of three contrasting modes of peloria (restoration of actinomorphy in a formerly zygomorphic perianth) and three contrasting modes of pseudopeloria (lessening of the degree of zygomorphy shown by the evolutionarily preceding perianth). Dynamic evolutionary transitions in floral morphology are assigned to recently revised concepts of heterotopy (including homeosis: evolutionary transitions in position of expression) and heterochrony (evolutionary transitions in timing of expression), seeking patterns that delimit developmental constraints and allow inferences regarding underlying genetic controls. Lateral heterotopy, occurring within the whorl of three petals (including the labellum) or within the adjacent whorl of three sepals, is more frequent than acropetal heterotopy, and full basipetal heterotopy does not occur. Pseudopeloria is more likely than peloria to generate a radically altered yet functional perianth but is also more likely to cause acropetal modification of the <b>fused</b> <b>filaments</b> and style that constitute the characteristic gynostemium of orchids. We infer that at least one gene or gene complex controls stylestamen fusion, which requires the preadaptation of strongly developed epigyny, and another determines both stamen suppression and labellum formation adaxially. Our earlier hypothesis implicating genes of the TCP family has recently been challenged by empirical evidence of complex interactions between several MADS-box genes. Many transitions are highly iterative, and some are reversible (atavistic). Once heritability has been demonstrated, the most effective criteria for determining the most appropriate taxonomic status of a novel morph are the profundity of the phenotypic shift that it represents, the number and uniformity of the resulting populations, and whether the novel morph subsequently diversified to generate further morphs that retain the innovative features. Although morphological transitions attributable to heterochrony may be a more common driver of speciation than those attributable to heterotopy, we demonstrate that arguably all of the modes of instantaneous floral transition described in this paper have the ability to generate prospecies...|$|R
