5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the fourth-generation iPad <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} fast as that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship.

Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
