5|$|The AC {{electric}} motor {{used in a}} VFD system is usually three-phase <b>induction</b> motor. Some types of single-phase motors or synchronous motors advantageous in some situations can be used, but three-phase <b>induction</b> motors are generally preferred as the most economical motor choice. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on <b>induction</b> motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.|$|E
5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the <b>induction</b> axiom) are {{statements}} in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of <b>induction</b> is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order axiom schema of <b>induction.</b> Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it weaker than the second-order axiom.|$|E
40|$|Although most {{definitions}} of hypnosis consider <b>inductions</b> as the initial {{stage in a}} hypnosis protocol, knowledge of <b>inductions</b> remains poor and uninformed by recent developments in theory and research. It is frequently argued that <b>inductions</b> {{play a critical role}} in hypnotic responding or, by contrast, are largely interchangeable and unimportant. Drawing on the literature on suggestibility, spontaneous phenomenology, neurophysiology, and cognition, this article argues that the value of <b>inductions,</b> as well as the potential value of <b>inductions,</b> is more nuanced and uncertain. Certain components of standard <b>inductions</b> appear to be efficacious in enhancing suggestibility, whereas others do not have any clear benefits. The impact of <b>inductions</b> on suggestibility seems to vary across suggestions and modes of assessment with the sources of this variability being unknown. Considering these effects, and the broader impact of <b>inductions</b> on spontaneous conscious states and cognition, through the lens of heterogeneity in high hypnotic suggestibility and componential models of hypnotic suggestibility may offer novel research avenues in this area. The article concludes by arguing for the practical and theory-driven optimization of <b>inductions...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Inductions</b> by perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA) of hepatomegaly, peroxisomal beta-oxidation, microsomal 1 -acylglycerophosphocholine acyltransferase and cytosolic {{long-chain}} acyl-CoA hydrolase {{were compared}} in liver {{between male and}} female rats. Marked <b>inductions</b> of these four parameters were seen concurrently in liver of male rats, whereas the <b>inductions</b> in liver of female rats were far less pronounced. The sex-related difference in the response of rat liver to PFOA was much more marked than that seen with p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (clofibric acid) or 2, 2 '-(decamethylenedithio) diethanol (tiadenol). Hormonal manipulations revealed that this sex-related difference in the <b>inductions</b> is strongly dependent on sex hormones, namely that testosterone is necessary for the <b>inductions,</b> whereas oestradiol prevented the <b>inductions</b> by PFOA...|$|R

5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: <b>induction</b> and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of <b>induction</b> therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if <b>induction</b> chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy for people with high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E

40|$|Many pre-scientific {{and common}} sense <b>inductions</b> are erroneous. Here are {{presented}} attempts to simulate that kind of inductive reasoning.

5|$|<b>Induction</b> generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, <b>induction</b> generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

5|$|Methoxyflurane has a {{very high}} lipid {{solubility}} (oil:gas partition coefficient of around 950), which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics (<b>induction</b> and emergence characteristics); this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting. Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in unpremedicated healthy individuals, <b>induction</b> of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane-oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time. It {{was found to be}} necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium thiopental to ensure a smooth and rapid <b>induction.</b> It was further found that after thiopental <b>induction,</b> it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia. This was despite using high flow (liters/minute) of nitrous oxide and oxygen, and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane.|$|E
