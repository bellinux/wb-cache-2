In the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tandem cockpit was flight instructor and safety pilot Capt. Thomas N. Coryell, 29, and behind him sat his student, 1st Lt. Gerald D.

25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon.

The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan.|$|E

The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{developed}} a cult following partially {{due to the}} large number of in-jokes it contains, most of which are aimed at [...] "nerds". In commentary on the DVD releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his [...] "nerdiest joke". These included mathematical jokes— such as [...] "Loew's -plex" [...] (aleph-null-plex) movie theater,— as well as various forms of science humor— for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner, exclaiming [...] "No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it", a reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the season six episode [...] "Law and Oracle", Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. On the <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies [...] "A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom". Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers [...] "It's a superposition of both states until you open the box and collapse the wave function." [...] When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled P and NP respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray— or more accurately, an [...] "F-ray"— of Bender's head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender's [...] "robo- or R-NA"). The show often features subtle references to classic science fiction. These are most often to Star Trek— many soundbites are used in homage— but also include the reference to the origin of the word robot made {{in the name of the}} robot-dominated planet Chapek 9, and the black rectangular monolith labeled [...] "Out of Order" [...] in orbit around Jupiter (a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey series). Bender and Fry sometimes watch a television show called The Scary Door, a humorous parody of The Twilight Zone.|$|E
