Modeling enhancements include a Decimate command, new poly editing selection methods and tools, STL (.stl) <b>file</b> <b>import</b> and export for 3D printing, and support for bump/normal maps in Collada import/export.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its history}} with the Poser product line, some {{versions}} of Shade also incorporate PoserFusion, a file hosting solution rather than a direct <b>file</b> <b>import</b> solution. This allows Shade to maintain Poser specific features within the Shade rendering environment; {{it is possible to}} later edit the original Poser file and then see the changes reflected in the hosting Shade scene.|$|E

5000|$|Calligra 2.7 was {{reviewed}} by LinuxUser in its October 2013 issue. Thomas Drilling, the reviewer, drew a positive conclusion overall. Among {{the positive aspects}} he pointed out were better [...]docx <b>file</b> <b>import</b> than LibreOffice {{and the amount of}} new features gained by the new version of the suite. Source for negative criticism was once again Words' stability, although Drilling noted improvements in this regard.|$|E
5000|$|Keynote {{is based}} on the tree data {{structure}} concept, allowing [...] "nodes" [...] in a tree panel (much like the tree panel in Windows file managers) to represent separate fields within a single text <b>file.</b> <b>Import</b> and export of KeyNote files to and from TreePad files is fully supported. Each field is then treated as a separate virtual document within the tree. Individual documents within the tree can be edited in Rich Text Format.|$|E
5000|$|Sibelius 5 (June 2007), {{with support}} for VST effects and instruments, a new sample library (Sibelius Sounds Essentials), 'Panorama' view, and {{numerous}} other new features. This version added <b>importing</b> of MusicXML <b>files,</b> but dropped <b>importing</b> <b>files</b> from RISC OS versions of Sibelius.|$|R

50|$|Versions 6.0 and 6.5 were {{subsequently}} released with vast {{improvements to the}} rendering engine and OpenGL performance. Version 6.5r2 added FBX <b>file</b> <b>importing</b> capability. 6.6 added Universal Binary support and finally drops support for Mac OS 9. Version 7.0 brought Multi-Layer Rendering, Image-Based Lighting, Raytrace Sky Maps and Rigid Body Dynamics. The version, 8.0, added Photon Mapping, Fast soft shadows, area light, Quadratic light drop-off, EXR and 16bit image input support, Displacement Sea Level, new Weight maps tools, lots of workflow enhancement and Renderama improvements.|$|R
50|$|As mentioned, the <b>file</b> <b>import</b> {{and export}} support does allow for an {{extremely}} varied workflow. By original design, canned Character modeling {{was done in}} Poser, those pose files were imported into Shade which could create the scene for the imported character. Shade could then rig, animate, render and export as a movie for video editing/compositing. As the comic book software Manga Studio EX has been importing the Shade format directly for some time, {{it seems likely that}} Manga Studio EX was used for print advertisement.|$|E
50|$|The {{web server}} uses a daemon to {{dynamically}} relay incoming VNC {{connections to the}} execution host on which an application session is running. Instead of using the port router {{to set up a}} separate channel by which a <b>file</b> <b>import</b> or export operation is conducted, it uses VNC to trigger an action on the browser which relays a file transfer through the main nanoHUB web server. The primary advantage of consolidating these capabilities into the web server is that it limits the entry point to the nanoHUB to one address: www.nanohub.org. This simplifies the security model as well as reduces on the number of independent security certificates to manage.|$|E
5000|$|The Forms Data Format (FDF) {{is based}} on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has {{essentially}} the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It {{can also be used}} to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form. Beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to define a container for annotations that are separate from the PDF document they apply to. FDF typically encapsulates information such as X.509 certificates, requests for certificates, directory settings, timestamp server settings, and embedded PDF files for network transmission. The FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf, filename extension [...]fdf and on Mac OS it uses file type 'FDF'. Support for importing and exporting FDF stand-alone files is not widely implemented in free or freeware PDF software. For example, there is no import/export support in Evince, Okular, Poppler, KPDF or Sumatra PDF, however, Evince, Okular and Poppler support filling in of PDF Acroforms and saving filled data inside the PDF <b>file.</b> <b>Import</b> support for stand-alone FDF files is implemented in Adobe Reader; export and import support (including saving of FDF data in PDF) is for example implemented in Foxit Reader and PDF-XChange Viewer Free; saving of FDF data in a PDF file is also supported in pdftk.|$|E
50|$|Some {{database}} programs {{take one}} load <b>file</b> for <b>importing</b> images {{and another for}} importing data while others take only one load file for both pieces of information.|$|R
50|$|Mosaic {{entered the}} market in 1992 as the {{successor}} to Professional Composer. An early user review of version 1.01 criticized stability issues and problems with <b>file</b> <b>importing</b> from other applications. In version 1.58 released in 1998, the notation software removed all limits on page size, score length, number of staves, and number of voices per staff. Configuration options in different windows created a flexible but sometimes confusing user interface. Drag and drop features and ability to convert MIDI files into usable notation were counted among the strongest points of Mosaic.|$|R

40|$|The steps {{required}} to migrate to geodatabase technology are different for each organization. This session will discuss how ArcMap extensions can ease this transition by enabling mapping professionals to continue using tools they are familiar with. Comprehensive ArcMap extensions give users tools to perform mapping {{functions such as}} parcel splits and merges, annotation, CAD <b>file</b> <b>import</b> and manipulation, and Coordinate Geometry (COGO) subdivision entry. These extensions can give users the flexibility to maintain parcels and addresses using methods that mimic their current business processes and streamline the parcel maintenance process. With many recent advances in GIS technology, mapping professionals are facing a series of new migration challenges. For most, migration to new technology is broken into three phases: data migration, employee training, and the redefinition of business processes, or workflows. The impact of this migration strategy, coupled with the consideration tha...|$|E
40|$|MathSBML is an open-source, freely-downloadable Mathematica {{package that}} {{facilitates}} working with Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) models. SBML is a tool-neutral, computer-readable format for representing models of biochemical reaction networks, applicable to metabolic networks, cell-signaling pathways, genomic regulatory networks, and other modeling problems in systems biology that is widely {{supported by the}} systems biology community. SBML is based on XML, a standard medium for representing and transporting data that is widely supported on the internet {{as well as in}} computational biology and bioinformatics. Because SBML is tool-independent, it enables model transportability, reuse, publication and survival. In addition to MathSBML, a number of other tools that support SBML model examination and manipulation are provided on the sbml. org website, including libSBML, a C/C++ library for reading SBML models; an SBML Toolbox for MatLab; file conversion programs; an SBML model validator and visualizer; and SBML specifications and schemas. MathSBML enables SBML <b>file</b> <b>import</b> to and export from Mathematica as well as providing an AP...|$|E
