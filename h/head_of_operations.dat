5|$|In 1940, when General Zhukov was {{promoted}} to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukrainian SSR, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to {{be presented to the}} commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation, apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations</b> for the Soviet 12th Army based in Ukraine. Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a colonel, was appointed deputy {{chief of staff of the}} Southwestern Front, headquartered in Kiev.|$|E

In the end, MI5 stop the attack, and Harry kills Kachimov.|$|E

5|$|Eight hours {{following}} the death of Adam Carter, Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) and Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) discuss how they are to get back at FSB <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> in London Arkady Kachimov (Stuart Wilson). Afterwards, Ros returns to her hotel room, and destroys it in a fit of rage. The next morning, Harry asks Richard Dolby (Robert East) to go after Kachimov, but is refused. However, Harry decides to disobey and go after Kachimov anyway, and promotes Ros to chief of Section D, a position previously held by Adam. Harry calls Lucas North (Richard Armitage) to meet with him for information on Kachimov. Before Lucas arrives, he calls Kachimov to warn him Harry is coming after him. Later, Lucas is appointed a handler from the FSB, and is shocked to find it is his ex-wife, Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza).|$|E
5|$|Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (née Caldwell; 13 December 1908 – 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime {{work with}} radar and radio led to early {{developments}} in radio astronomy. Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, {{and worked in}} Radio Direction Finding at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations</b> Research in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became pioneering {{work in the field}} of radio astronomy, making her one of the first women scientists to work in that field, albeit briefly.|$|E
5|$|Further {{testing of}} Silverplate B-29 {{aircraft}} and Thin Man and Fat Man bomb shapes {{was carried out}} at Muroc Army Air Field in March and June 1944. Testing shifted to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, in October. Project Y controlled the scheduling and contents of the tests, which were {{carried out by the}} Flight Test Section of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit as Project W-47. The tests were supervised by Ramsey until November, when Commander Frederick Ashworth became Parson's <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> and assumed responsibility for the test program. The test bombs were assembled by the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's Special Ordnance Detachment. Tests continued {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945. At first only the Ordnance Division's fuse and delivery groups were involved, but as the tests became more detailed, and live explosives were incorporated into the test bombs, other groups were drawn into the test program.|$|E

25|$|The ICAC {{has three}} divisions: Operations, Community Relations, and Corruption Prevention. The Operations Department {{is the largest}} by far, having 72 percent of the staff, and is {{responsible}} for all the high-profile busts. The person {{in charge of the}} Operations Department is appointed by the Chief Executive and not by the ICAC Commissioner. By custom and practice, the <b>Head</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operations</b> is usually bestowed the title of Deputy Commissioner. This department considers itself all powerful, and has apparently resisted all attempts to interfere with its investigations. The investigation into circulation fraud by Sally Aw at The Standard has been cited {{as an example of the}} embarrassment caused by such non-co-operation with the government hierarchy.|$|E
25|$|The Romanian royal court, army, and {{administration}} were subsequently forced to retreat into Moldavia, the last portion of territory still under Romanian control. Henceforth, Antonescu {{took part in}} an important decision involving defensive efforts, an unusual promotion which probably stoked his ambitions. In December, as Prezan became the Chief of the General Staff, Antonescu, who was by now a major, was named the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> {{being involved in the}} defense of Moldavia. He contributed to the tactics used during the Battle of Mărășești (July–August 1917), when Romanians under General Alexandru Averescu managed to stop the advance of German forces under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen. Antonescu lived in Prezan's proximity {{for the remainder of the}} war and influenced his decisions.|$|E

In September, Zatevakhin became the commander of the 2nd Airborne Brigade. In October 1938, he became the commander of the 212th Airborne Brigade. Zatevakhin led the brigade during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in August 1939, where he was wounded. For his actions during the Battle of Khalkin Gol, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.

25|$|Vipulanada {{was born}} in the village of Karativu, in the south of Batticaloa in Sri Lanka. His father's name was Jeyaseelan and mother's name was Shanthi. His birth name was Mylvaganam. Vipulanada had his early {{education}} in Christian mission-run schools in his native village, neighboring Kalmunai and eventually in Batticaloa city. After completing his high school education at the age of 16, Vipulanada became a teacher in various cities across the island nation.

25|$|Corby's lawyers {{argued that}} she had no {{knowledge}} of the cannabis until customs officials at the airport found it. Her defence centred on the theory {{that she had}} become an unwitting drug courier for what {{was supposed to have been}} an interstate shipment of drugs between Brisbane and Sydney in Australia. Her legal defence suggested that airport baggage handlers had put the drugs in Corby's bag, but they could not provide substantive probative evidence of this. According to her lawyers, the cannabis was meant to have been removed in Sydney. These claims were later supported when the former <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> for the Australian Federal Police's internal investigation unit, Ray Cooper, claimed that it was well known within the AFP that some passengers were unwittingly being used to transfer drugs between domestic airports in Australia. In a June 2008 documentary, , Corby's former lawyer, Robin Tampoe, said that he fabricated the defence theory that Australian baggage handlers could have planted the drugs in Corby's luggage and apologised to them, and said that former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer told him he suspected Corby's brothers were behind the convicted drug smuggler's crime. Tampoe was subsequently struck off for misconduct.|$|E
