25|$|Mechanical vehicle {{switching}} minimizes inter-vehicle spacing or headway distance, but it {{also increases}} the minimum distances between consecutive junctions. A mechanically switching vehicle, maneuvering between two adjacent junctions with different switch settings, cannot proceed from one junction to the next. The vehicle must adopt a new switch position, and then wait for the in-vehicle switch's locking mechanism to be verified. If the vehicle switching <b>is</b> <b>faulty,</b> that vehicle {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the next switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed vehicle would be affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM <b>is</b> <b>faulty</b> etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

On the other hand, David Suzuki, dismissing Levant as an [...] "apologist", argued that [...] "the logic <b>is</b> <b>faulty.</b> Just because a country or society is considered 'ethical' does not mean everything it produces or exports is ethical". In the Winnipeg Free Press, John Collins, a retired union negotiator, criticized some of Levant's sources, noting {{the presence of the}} Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in the footnotes, while Patrick Brethour, an editor for The Globe and Mail writing in the Literary Review of Canada, contends that the title of Levant’s book [...] "is a considerable misstatement" [...] and that Levant [...] "fails {{to make the case for}} ethical oil".|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the movie is {{discussed}} in the film's fourth scene. Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division's staff. He believes that its main [...] "legalistic drawback" [...] is that it [...] "arrests individuals who have broken no laws." [...] Jad responds, [...] "But they will!" [...] When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion, he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises; that the precogs' prevent an event accepted as fact, but one which will never happen. To show him that people regularly use predetermination, Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer, who catches it before it lands on the ground. When asked why he caught the ball, Witwer says [...] "Because {{it was going to}} fall." [...] Anderton replies, [...] "But it didn't." [...] Then confidently tells him, [...] "The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change {{the fact that it was}} going to happen." [...] Kowalski feels this example <b>is</b> <b>faulty</b> in the sense that the ball has no free will; it merely acts according to the laws of physics, but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder, then it would hold. Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws, Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs', whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science.|$|E

2500|$|Google Street View, {{released}} in the U.S. in 2007, is currently {{the subject of an}} ongoing debate about possible infringement on individual privacy. [...] In an article entitled “Privacy, Reconsidered: New Representations, Data Practices, and the Geoweb”, Sarah Elwood and Agnieszka Leszczynski (2011) argue that Google Street View “facilitate identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.” The medium through which Street View disseminates information, the photograph, is very immediate {{in the sense that it}} can potentially provide direct information and evidence about a person’s whereabouts, activities, and private property. Moreover, the technology’s disclosure of information about a person is less abstract in the sense that, if photographed, a person is represented on Street View in a virtual replication of his or her own real-life appearance. In other words, the technology removes abstractions of a person’s appearance or that of his or her personal belongings – there is an immediate disclosure of the person and object, as they visually exist in real life. Although Street View began to blur license plates and people’s faces in 2008, the technology <b>is</b> <b>faulty</b> and does not entirely ensure against accidental disclosure of identity and private property. [...] Elwood and Leszczynski note that “many of the concerns leveled at Street View stem from situations where its photograph-like images were treated as definitive evidence of an individual’s involvement in particular activities.” [...] In one instance, Ruedi Noser, a Swiss politician, barely avoided public scandal when he was photographed in 2009 on Google Street View walking with a woman who was not his wife – the woman was actually his secretary. Similar situations occur when Street View provides high-resolution photographs – and photographs hypothetically offer compelling objective evidence. [...] But as the case of the Swiss politician illustrates, even supposedly compelling photographic evidence is sometimes subject to gross misinterpretation. This example further suggests that Google Street View may provide opportunities for privacy infringement and harassment through public dissemination of the photographs. Google Street View does, however, blur or remove photographs of individuals and private property from image frames if the individuals request further blurring and/or removal of the images. This request can be submitted, for review, through the “report a problem” button that is located on the bottom left-hand side of every image window on Google Street View, however, Google has made attempts to report a problem difficult by disabling the [...] "Why are you reporting the street view" [...] icon.|$|E
