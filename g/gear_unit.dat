40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{problematic}} of <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> and machine foundating and consequences that occur by foundation screws releasing. Namely, reliable operating of <b>gear</b> <b>units,</b> {{as well as}} other stationary machines, requires properly foundating. However, after certain period of time, relaxation of screw material, self-untightening of nuts and looseness of foundation screws influence on reducing the force of preload screw tightening and unequal load distribution. This unequal load distribution causes unequal deformations, which generate occuring vibrations. In extreme cases, breakages of screws and heavier accidents of systems driven by that <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> or machines can happen. With this paper authors want to indicate influence of deterioration degree on its load capacity...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} program which simulates life {{and reliability of}} helicopter transmissions is presented. The helicopter transmissions may be composed of spiral bevel <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> and planetary <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> - alone, in series or in parallel. The spiral bevel <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> may have either single or dual input pinions, which are identical. The planetary <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> may be stepped or unstepped {{and the number of}} planet gears carried by the planet arm may be varied. The reliability analysis used in the program is based on the Weibull distribution lives of the transmission components. The computer calculates the system lives and dynamic capacities of the transmission components and the transmission. The system life is defined as the life of the component or transmission at an output torque at which the probability of survival is 90 percent. The dynamic capacity of a component or transmission is defined as the output torque which can be applied for one million output shaft cycles for a probability of survival of 90 percent. A complete summary of the life and dynamic capacity results is produced by the program...|$|R

50|$|The Gear Master was an {{accessory}} for the Sega Game Gear handheld game console. Manufactured by Beeshu, Inc., the Gear Master offered {{an alternative to}} the Master Gear peripheral, although both of these peripherals had similar compatibility issues.

50|$|The Company {{established}} a broad line of centrifugal and filtration equipment for liquid/solids separation in 1932. The significant development was the patented {{design of the}} first planetary <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> applied to centrifugal equipment.

40|$|In this Master’s Thesis, {{different}} methods for calculating thermal rating of industrial <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> are introduced. Thermal rating is calculated by estimating power losses and cooling {{power of the}} gearbox. Calculation methods for power losses introduced in this work are mostly standardized methods, {{which are based on}} work done by European researchers, universities and research centers. Background for calculation of cooling power is presented by using simplified equations for heat transfer. To find a suitable calculation method for power losses, cooling power and thermal rating of Santasalo <b>Gear’s</b> <b>gear</b> <b>units,</b> three different types of gears were calculated. Calculations were done with {{different methods}} and results were compared and discussed. It was shown that calculated values for power loss, cooling power and thermal rating vary significantly between different methods. Conclusion was, that calculation of thermal rating according to standard ISO/TR 14179 - 2 is suitable for Santasalo’s <b>gear</b> <b>units,</b> but the accuracy and reliability should be confirmed with test runs...|$|R

50|$|In 2007 {{the bike}} was made {{available}} in a new version, amended to RSA 250, characterized by many different details from previously, including a revised intake system and the new disposition of the <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> and of thermal groups. The measurements of the frame changed to use a longer swingarm, and obtain benefits both in acceleration and traction. Another change involved use of three accelerometers to get more data {{for the management of}} the power of motion in situations of low adhesion in order to speed up the development of Aprilia RSV 4 which entered the Superbike World Championship in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|All {{ships in}} this class except last ship Parizhskaya Kommuna were {{equipped}} with a steam turbine turbo <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> [...] "ТС-1" [...] consisting of double-case turbine and gear that were fed by two fuel oil boilers with capacity 25 tons of steam per hour at pressure of 42 atmospheres and temperature 470 °C. Turbine power was 13 000 hp giving 1000 rpm at full speed. Gearbox lowered that number of rpm to 100 in {{the transition to the}} propeller. One four-bladed propeller of bronze had diameter 6.3 m. Processes to manage by boilers and turbine were automated.|$|E
50|$|To {{further reduce}} engine plant noise, the normal {{propulsion}} setup of two steam turbines driving the screw through a reduction <b>gear</b> <b>unit</b> was changed instead to one large propulsion turbine with no reduction gears. This eliminated {{the noise from}} the main reduction gears, but the cost {{was to have a}} huge main propulsion turbine. The turbine was cylindrical, about 12 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet long. This massive size was necessary to allow it to turn slowly enough to directly drive the screw and be fairly efficient in doing so. The same propulsion setup was used on both the USS Narwhal and the land-based prototype.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier was {{typically}} {{used as a}} ground attack aircraft, though its manoeuvrability also allows it to effectively engage other aircraft at short ranges. The Harrier {{is powered by a}} single Pegasus turbofan engine mounted in the fuselage. The engine is fitted with two air intakes and four vectoring nozzles for directing the thrust generated: two for the bypass flow and two for the jet exhaust. Several small reaction nozzles are also fitted, in the nose, tail and wingtips, for the purpose of balancing during vertical flight. It has two landing <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> on the fuselage and two outrigger landing <b>gear</b> <b>units,</b> one near each wing tip. The Harrier is equipped with four wing and three fuselage pylons for carrying a variety of weapons and external fuel tanks.|$|R
50|$|The XC-31 {{was built}} with an {{aluminum}} alloy framework covered by fabric, and featured strut-braced wing and a fully retractable landing gear, the main <b>gear</b> <b>units</b> mounted on small wing-like stubs and retracting inwards.
