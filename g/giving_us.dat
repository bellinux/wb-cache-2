5|$|The {{defeat of}} the RSK led the Bosnian Serbs to realise that a {{settlement}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be negotiated as soon as possible, and reversed the tide of {{the war against the}} Serbs, <b>giving</b> <b>US</b> diplomacy a strong boost. The success of Operation Storm also represented a strategic victory in the Bosnian War as it lifted the siege of Bihać, and allowed the Croatian and Bosnian leadership to plan a full-scale military intervention in the VRS-held Banja Luka areaone aimed at creating a new balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a buffer zone along the Croatian border, and contributing to the resolution of the war. The intervention materialized as Operation Mistral 2 in September 1995. Combined with a NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it led to the start of peace talks that would result in the Dayton Agreement a few months later. The development also led to the restoration of the remaining Serb-held areas in eastern Slavonia and Baranja to Croatian control through the Erdut Agreement, ending the Croatian War of Independence in November.|$|E

This is in contrast to such dialogues as the Symposium, in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> an incomplete, fifth-hand account.|$|E

25|$|These {{rules of}} {{engagement}} {{were based on the}} situation in 1968, when North Vietnam's surface-to-air missiles were controlled by fire control radars with a high-pulse recurring frequency, which keyed an alarm in the USAF aircraft. By late 1971, shortly after Lavelle had taken command of 7th Air Force, the North Vietnamese had begun networking their long-range search radars with the missile sites. These additional sources of radar data allowed North Vietnam to turn on SAM radar at the last second, <b>giving</b> <b>US</b> aircrews virtually no warning.|$|E

25|$|Only {{seven of}} his {{estimated}} seventy to ninety plays have survived, {{and there is}} a longstanding debate regarding his authorship of one of these plays, Prometheus Bound, which some believe his son Euphorion actually wrote. Fragments of some other plays have survived in quotes and more continue to be discovered on Egyptian papyrus, often <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> surprising insights into his work. He was probably the first dramatist to present plays as a trilogy; his Oresteia is the only ancient example of the form to have survived. At least one of his plays was influenced by the Persians' second invasion of Greece (480–479 BC). This work, The Persians, is the only surviving classical Greek tragedy concerned with contemporary events (very few of that kind were ever written), and a useful source of information about its period. The significance of war in Ancient Greek culture was so great that Aeschylus' epitaph commemorates his participation in the Greek victory at Marathon while making no mention of his success as a playwright. Despite this, Aeschylus' work – particularly the Oresteia – is generally acclaimed by modern critics and scholars.|$|E

25|$|We are {{not able}} to see how the {{prohibition}} of teaching the theory that man has descended from a lower order of animals gives preference to any religious establishment or mode of worship. So far as we know, there is no religious establishment or organized body that has in its creed or confession of faith any article denying or affirming such a theory. So far as we know, the denial or affirmation of such a theory does not enter into any recognized mode of worship. Since this cause has been pending in this court, we have been favored, in addition to briefs of counsel and various amici curiae, with a multitude of resolutions, addresses, and communications from scientific bodies, religious factions, and individuals <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> the benefit of their views upon the theory of evolution. Examination of these contributions indicates that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are divided among themselves in their beliefs, and that there is no unanimity among the members of any religious establishment as to this subject. Belief or unbelief in the theory of evolution is no more a characteristic of any religious establishment or mode of worship than is belief or unbelief in the wisdom of the prohibition laws. It would appear that members of the same churches quite generally disagree as to these things.|$|E

50|$|This raises {{philosophical}} problems: {{suppose that}} random physical processes happen on length scales both smaller than and {{bigger than the}} horizon.

500|$|Mark Kermode {{writing for}} The Observer awarded the film {{four out of}} five stars, lauding Thompson's {{performance}} as [...] "impeccable", elaborating that [...] "Thompson dances her way through Travers' conflicting emotions, <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> a fully rounded portrait of a person who is hard to like but impossible not to love." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, writing: [...] "Thompson's the show. Each withering put-down, every jaundiced utterance, lands with a little ping." [...] In regard to the screenplay, he wrote that [...] "screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith treat everyone gently and with the utmost respect." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three out of four stars and equally commended the performances of the cast.|$|E

[...] Priestley was less impressed by the supposed Trollopian side of Walpole's work, finding some of it formulaic. He was more taken with a darker, Dostoyevskian, side that he found in the writing: [...] "suddenly it will transform the pleasant easy scene he is <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire...

[...] The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website.
