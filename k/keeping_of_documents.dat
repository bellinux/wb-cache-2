40|$|The author {{starts with}} the {{statement}} that the ancient city commune has recently much been studied and that we are faced with a real explosion of interest for the earlier historical periods of the Dalmatian cities. A number of sources from those periods is accessible to scholars, and the history of the mediaeval Dalmatian cities presents a picture of real life, able to be compared with the phenomena of the European history. A series of examples from the communal life in the cities of Zadar, Split, Trogir and Kotor, covering the period between 1260 and 1400 are quoted by the author. That was a period of a stirring development of all forms of life, a period of development of the city commune and administration. We learn the »Conslilium generale maius« of Dubrovnik {{for the first time in}} 1235, of Split in 1241, and of Zadar about 1260. Municipal offices for <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> offices of public notaries, archives and other elements of city administaration have been established in the 13 th century. The communal laws and statutes came into being at Split, Zadar, Trogir and Šibenik. The article then covers the period of the autonomous cities, extending from 1100 to 1260, preceded by an earlier form of communes, which the author tries to prove. The beginning of that stage probably was in the second half of the 9 th century. Then follow sporadic data relating to the emergence of trades, market-places, fish-markets, etc., which period is called pre-communal by the author. These are no elected functions yet, and the city has nog yet its definite shape with regard to planning, architecture, etc. The author emphasizes the existence of tribunes in the mediaeval Dalmatian cities. The relation to land and the distribution of land among the citizens is specially presented. Examples are quoted in connection with land on the Peninsula of Pelješac, in Kotor, Trogir and Zadar. There is also some information about the colonization of Venetian citizens in Zadar. The distribution of communal land in Split is also dealt with. This, according to the author, became a tradition in the city, and also a peculiar rustic way of life and consciousness. The question why land takes such a significant place in the life of citizens is also answered by the author. The penetration of peasants into the cities from the Roman era on is widely described. According to M. Suić, who had made investigations in the environs of Dalmatian cities in order to find out whether there are traces of the Roman system of field walls, known as »agri centuriati«, established ten of thousands kilometres of such traces in the fields around Zadar, Split, Pula. That ancient agrarian practice survived many centuries. The author then surveys the municipal services known from the ancient city statutes. The commune was constituted only by the members of the Major Council, i. e. the mobility, while the remaining citizens composed a body called »universitas«. The services were rendered without remouneration. The magistracy was divided into two categories: a higher one (the nobility) and a lower one (common people). Closing his article, the author emphasizes that all the exposed characteristics of Dalmatian cities should be sought in analogy with the ancient polis...|$|E

5000|$|The {{appearance}} {{of a young woman}} - das [...] "Archivfräulein" [...] - in charge of the university archives was difficult for some of the older professors to accept. Her academic background was far from conventional. There were even some who doubted the need for a central university archive, favouring instead the safe <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> archived <b>documents</b> in the private homes of the distinguished academic experts who best understood their significance. The main archive building, sandwiched between the Augusteum building and the Pauliner church was seen by some not as the University Archive but simply as an archive for the Rector's Office, which was reflected in its size. During the early 1950s an important task for Drucker involved pleading for, commandeering and improvising additional storage locations.|$|R

She had denied knowing that the documents were stolen, saying that former CRW soldier Selestino Kalounivale, a close relative of Afu's, who was killed by loyalist soldiers in the mutiny in which he allegedly participated, had given them to her at the Parliamentary complex {{at the height of the}} coup and instructed her to keep them, according to defence lawyer Angeline Lata. Her fears of the Military had inhibited her from returning the documents to them, Afu said.

While new technologies such as cable modems and digital subscriber lines promise to bring similar capabilities to every home, however, the mobile computing landscape looming over the technological horizon suggests a shift towards the opposite pole of connectivity.

40|$|Because modern {{managerial}} discourse {{emerges from}} a dominant discourse characterised by neo-liberalism and rational managerialism, there is little place for wisdom in its theory and practice.

Although the document soundly applies empirically-based psychological theory, there is a tension this and the values and assumptions privileged in the dominant discourse. Thus the capacity for wise management is inhibited to the extent that it attempts to work within the dominant managerialist discourse. Just as knowledge management is limited by a limited theory of knowledge, it is likely that wisdom management will be weakened by a lack of knowledge about wisdom...|$|R

The folk legends relate to the past of the locality Krapina, mostly narrating about the struggles of the inhabitants of Krapina for the recognition of their old privileges against the encroachments of feudal lords. So they talk about the secret <b>keeping</b> <b>of</b> old <b>documents</b> in a hollow trunk, about the deputations to the king, about the violences commited to »purgari« and a strong hero protector, then about the Turks, fays etc. In addition we also publish a Gaj 2 ̆ 7 s record of the tale about the step-mother and the step-daughter (AaTh 480 + 510 A). All texts are in old *kajkavština« and written in old orthography, which gives them, beside an adequate style of narrating, a special charm and attractiveness. In the introducing comment by M. Bošković-Stulli these oral traditions are confronted with the corresponding historical events in an effort to demonstrate, how the historical truth in these texts is interweaved and imbued with imagination and folk tradition.

What elements or <b>documents</b> give account <b>of</b> the different aspects that constitute the academic activity? There are a set <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> that reflect this activity: - the academic production, understood as the set of works (published or unpublished) made by faculty, searchers, under or post graduate students, and those who perform their activities in its scope: theses, disertations and the approved works {{at the end of}} studies, both in the undergraduate as in postgradute levels; publications of any kind published by the School through its publishing committee, departments, training centers and investigations and cathedras; the curriculas of subjects, courses and seminaries, as well as the curricula of the carrers that are attended in their scope; the documentation of projects of investigation and extension approved, projects, reports of results or advance, etc.,and that generated in centres of study and investigation. The systematic and permanent registry of this production, as well as set of all these works, constitute two fundamental strategies to contribute to its diffusion, to facilitate its location and access, to preserve the institutional academic-scientific memoire and to count on a source of data from which to obtain quantitative indicators that facilitate the institutional management and the take of decissions in this respect.
