His father, Usman Iskandar, was a wood merchant, and his mother, a housewife, was the {{daughter}} of an ulama (scholar of Islam). The couple, who were of modest means, had four other children, and the family's lack of a noble background meant the children were ineligible to receive an education at Dutch-run schools. Instead, Fakih studied Islam from a young age, receiving much of his instruction from his <b>father.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of ten he began studying at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Gresik, finishing four years later. In 1919 he continued his studies at several pesantren outside the city, including ones in rural Gresik and in nearby Bungah.|$|E

5|$|In {{dividing}} his lands, William {{appears to}} have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war.

Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his <b>father</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of his death, received Normandy. England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king. Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in Buckinghamshire and Gloucestershire. William's funeral at Caen was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.|$|E
