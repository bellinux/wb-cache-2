5|$|Carolingian support {{may have}} been one of the factors that helped Ecgberht achieve the {{military}} successes of the late 820s. However, the Rhenish and Frankish commercial networks collapsed at some time in the 820s or 830s, and in addition, a rebellion broke out in February 830 against Louis the Pious—the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> internal conflicts that lasted through the 830s and beyond. These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E
50|$|Dixie Dugan is a 1943 American comedy film, {{directed}} by Otto Brower. It stars Lois Andrews, James Ellison, and Charlotte Greenwood. Intended as the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series,</b> {{the film was}} not a success and the plans for sequels were scrapped.|$|R

5|$|Castillo Armas faced {{significant}} internal resistance, {{which was}} blamed on communist agitation. The government, plagued by corruption and soaring debt, became dependent on {{aid from the}} US. In 1957 Castillo Armas was assassinated by a palace guard with leftist sympathies. He was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> authoritarian rulers in Guatemala who were close allies of the US.

5|$|In 1534, Tabinshwehti and {{his deputy}} Bayinnaung, {{then a couple}} of 18-year-olds, {{launched}} their first military campaign against Hanthawaddy.

In 1538–39, the upstart kingdom captured Hanthawaddy's capital Pegu (Bago), and in May 1541, Martaban (Mottama) and Moulmein (Mawlamyaing). Significantly, for the first time, the Burmese and the Siamese shared a common border in the upper-Tenasserim coast.|$|E

The film {{was also the first}} to feature the use of Disney's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS). Developed for Disney by Pixar, which had grown into a commercial computer animation and technology development company, CAPS would become significant in allowing future Disney films to more seamlessly integrate computer-generated imagery and achieve higher production values with digital ink and paint and compositing techniques. The Little Mermaid was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> blockbusters that would be released over the next decade by Walt Disney Feature Animation, a period later designated by the term Disney Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|The PTBT was a <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> {{nuclear arms}} control {{treaties}} {{in the second}} half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to the NPT, the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972. In 1974, the Threshold Test Ban Treaty prohibited underground tests with yields above 150 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} at Hill 303 {{would be only}} one of the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> atrocities the U.S. forces accused North Korean soldiers of committing. In late 1953 the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, conducted an investigation of up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Hill 303 massacre {{was one of the first}} to be investigated. Survivors of the incident were called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the Geneva Convention, and condemned its actions.|$|E

5|$|This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of British physicist Alan Nunn May, who {{had worked in the}} Montreal Laboratory, in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated. It was but the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> spy scandals. The arrest of Klaus Fuchs in January 1950, and the June 1951 defection of Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, left Americans with a distrust of British security arrangements. The remaining British scientists working in the United States were denied access to papers that they had written just days before.|$|E

The series also led to versions and similar series abroad.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of Speech was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> four oil paintings, {{entitled}} Four Freedoms, {{painted by}} Norman Rockwell. The works {{were inspired by}} United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution were {{freedom of speech and}} freedom of worship. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U. S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
