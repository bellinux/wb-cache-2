5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in <b>domestic</b> <b>issues</b> but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that he may have been the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the term}} of office of his successor, Jimmy Carter, Ford {{received}} monthly briefs by President Carter's senior staff on international and <b>domestic</b> <b>issues,</b> and was always invited to lunch at the White House whenever he was in Washington, D.C. Their close friendship developed after Carter had left office, with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. Until Ford's death, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, visited the Fords' home frequently. Ford and Carter served as honorary co-chairs of the National Commission on Federal Election Reform in 2001 and of the Continuity of Government Commission in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on <b>domestic</b> <b>issues.</b> The power of the labor unions was {{significantly}} curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E

Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (0 electoral votes), who ran {{as an independent}} on a platform that focused on <b>domestic</b> <b>issues.</b> Bush's steep decline in public approval was {{a significant part of}} Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.|$|E

25|$|May Fourth radicalism, {{combined}} {{with changes in}} the education system, made possible {{the emergence of a}} large group of women writers.

The reason is that the new rules effectively charge corporations with the responsibility to self-regulate, thereby transforming sexual harassment from a public issue of human rights to a <b>domestic</b> <b>issue</b> of corporate governance...|$|R

In reaction, draft bills had been tabled in the Reichstag by Communists (requesting complete expropriation without compensation) and others (giving the Länder the right to finally settle this issue with the noble houses and barring recourse to the courts).|$|R
