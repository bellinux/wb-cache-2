I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
500|$|On the {{day that}} Pinfold was published, Waugh was persuaded to attend a Foyle's Literary Luncheon, {{as a means of}} {{promoting}} the book. He informed his audience that [...] "Three years ago, I had quite a new experience. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> my head for about three weeks". To further stimulate sales the dust-jacket also emphasised Waugh's experiences of madness, which brought him a large correspondence from strangers anxious to relate their own parallel experiences—"the voices... of the persecuted, turning to him as confessor".|$|E
500|$|She {{began work}} on her first novel, An Ordinary Lunacy, {{relatively}} late in life: she started writing in her late thirties, and it was published only in 1963, by which time she was aged 47. Although it began life as a radio play, Anderson quickly found that An Ordinary Lunacy was [...] "interesting enough for a novel, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> and it got quite out of hand." [...] The novel detailed the romance between thirty-five-year-old Sydney barrister, David Byfield, and Isobel Purdy, a woman accused of murdering her husband. Acclaimed for its adept portrayal of the protean nature of romantic love, An Ordinary Lunacy foregrounds the different perspectives of three women: Isobel, Daisy Byfield (David's mother), and Myra Magaskill, David's ex-lover. Pam Gilbert writes that [...] "Anderson's construction of the tensions existing between three women such as Daisy, Isobel and Myra offers an interesting platform for an exposition of romance and passion from a woman's perspective." ...|$|E

500|$|Chartwell {{was mostly}} unused during the Second World War. Its exposed {{position}} in a county so near to German occupied France, meant that it was vulnerable to a German airstrike or commando raid. As a precaution the lakes were covered with brushwood to make the house less identifiable from the air. A rare visit to Chartwell occurred in July 1940, when Churchill inspected aircraft batteries in Kent. His pre-war writing assistant Eric Seal recorded the visit; [...] "In the evening the PM, Mrs C and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to Chartwell. One {{of the features of}} the place is a whole series of ponds, which are stocked with immense goldfish. The PM loves feeding them". The Churchills instead spent their weekends at Ditchley House, in Oxfordshire, until security improvements were completed at the Prime Minister's official country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire. At dinner at Chequers, in December 1940, John Colville, Churchill's assistant private secretary recorded his master's post-war plans, [...] "He would retire to Chartwell and write a book on the war, which he had already mapped out in his mind chapter by chapter".|$|E
500|$|The band {{performed}} in the UK in April 1982. NME considered that the show [...] "was all very skillfully deployed: a bruisingly clear sound of scathing force, a clockwork, Pavlovian lightshow, a variegation of light and shade in the song order that builds to the unmitigating force of 'Pornography' itself as the climax". However, the mood on stage was not good: The journalist noted that Smith looked [...] "dejected and tired" [...] for his birthday. Behind the scene, Smith's relationship with Gallup was deteriorating. When the tour reached Europe, tension was so high between the two musicians {{that they had a}} fight after a concert in Strasbourg. Tolhurst found out the next day that his two partners [...] "had both gone back to England". At home, Smith heard his father telling him: [...] "Get right back out on that tour! People have bought tickets!" [...] After two more weeks of touring, the band played their final show in Brussels. Tolhurst later related: [...] "I remember sitting in the dressing room thinking, 'oh well, that's the end of the band, then' [...] <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to France for a bit. I guess I ran away. Escaping from the reality of The Cure". Back in England, Smith took a rest with a month's camping holiday to the Lake District to [...] "clean up".|$|E
2500|$|... "It became {{time to do}} {{something}} else. We did 7 albums and 131 shows... almost 200 songs recorded in our studio, and life just really became to a natural, if not dramatic, conclusion for me in Santa Barbara, I had a pretty traumatic accident, where I was hospitalized; I was jilted romantically in a pretty bad way and I didn't react to that very well, and I kinda' went crazy for awhile. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> my head, and I went to work at sea. I took a job on a ship for awhile....|$|E
6000|$|... "Stick a {{knife into}} me; do anything!" [...] {{he said to}} his second, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off,</b> only bring me up to time. He can't hold out much longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chabrol {{once said}} of Gégauff: [...] "When I want cruelty, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> {{and look for}} Gégauff. Paul {{is very good at}} gingering things up...He can make a {{character}} look absolutely ridiculous and hateful in two seconds flat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{hell you}} say!" [...] roared Bacon, as the truth burst upon him. [...] "So that's {{what you do}} when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> to town and leave you to chop wood. So you're goun' to git married, hey?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{picked up}} the girls {{and went to the}} beach. I had a shot behind the shed. While the girls were {{drinking}} I was trying to OD. We drove around with them. I was asleep most the time. Beckett told me he dropped them off at home. I remember waking up and seeing the girls and then later I asked Beckett where we were and he said Victoria, on the main road somewhere. And <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> my head. I told him to go home, {{get the fuck out of}} here. Then I saw him walking out of the bush. He had blood all over him. Told me he cut his finger." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they left}} it at that, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> with Peter to get my bone.|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{want to kill}} it--I {{only wanted}} to save it from living. And when I looked at it, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> screaming.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I say {{he came up}} to him, mother? I didn't say he was as fond o' me as my own father, but as if he was my father. However, it's all arranged, and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{unless he}} an' <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> by ourselves, <b>I</b> don't reckon {{this will be}} a very {{pleasant}} journey," [...] Isaac said to himself as he thought of the corporal and Nathan, each distrusting and making complaint against the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will lie}} quiet {{as long as}} I am awake, but I cannot answer for myself if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> to sleep, which will not be long, for I am as tired as a dog. To-day's walk would have been nothing if I had been all right, it was the pain that wore me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All in ruins. The fact is I've {{neglected}} {{the poor}} little brutes. I {{had no time}} for germs after <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> into the study of 'spooks.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, as I did {{not think}} it worth while to {{contradict}} his nonsense so far as I was concerned personally, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> on this latter point.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just that,--and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> rather {{suddenly}} {{to the other}} side of the country; and then I had to go up to London. Now I'm going to Patagonia." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> {{on my own}} {{train of}} thought, {{and it was a}} black and bitter one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{find that}} I can't {{get away from}} business," [...] he explained. [...] "It follows me down here; and in a new country like this there's {{generally}} some interesting project cropping up. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> into the bush hunting, and see {{something that looks like}} an opportunity; the idea sticks to me and begins to develop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the best}} way, anyhow," [...] he said. [...] "To-morrow, no doubt, the fellow I had the row with will be {{watching}} the hotel to see which way <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off,</b> but after once seeing {{me go to the}} hotel he will not guess that I shall be starting this evening. What have you got left, Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> in {{the canoe}} {{to ask about}} it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She left me," [...] said Mr. Davis, solemnly--"she left me {{thirty-five years}} ago. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to sea one fine morning, {{and that was}} the last I ever see of er.|$|E

6000|$|... "Whenever I can {{get money}} {{enough for an}} outfit <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> on the trail. There's a fascination in the thing that gets hold of you--you can't tell what you may strike, and the prizes are big. However, I'll admit that after {{seven or eight years}} of it I'm poorer than when I started at the game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's the point. Now and then, I think I see; {{but then}} <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>off</b> on a wrong tack: I get a silly fit, and a hopeless one, and lose my clue. And yet, after all, {{there is a}} highway; and wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein,' murmured Louis, as he gazed on the first star of evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Fred. Nevertheless I shall {{leave the}} moment my {{strength}} permits--that is, if health {{be restored to}} me--and <b>I</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>off</b> by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Got an idea," [...] said Mr. Polly. [...] "Would it put you {{out very}} much if <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> {{for a day}} or two for a bit of a holiday? There won't be much doing now until Thursday." ...|$|E
60|$|I got out at last {{by playing}} a game on her. I pertended to drop 'arf a dollar in the washus, and while she was busy on 'er hands and knees <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> as {{comfortable}} as you please.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} wrap it up, I'll keep this one," [...] he resumed. [...] "I expect {{you have not}} {{forgotten}} me. When I came into the shop I didn't imagine I should meet you, but if you'd sooner <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>off,</b> I'll go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, uncle, {{but suppose}} <b>I</b> do <b>go</b> <b>off</b> to the rock, what chance have you of making things appear {{better than they}} are at present?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{business}} had <b>I</b> to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> like that!" [...] And he moved very {{slowly to the}} glass. What a cadaverous chap! Her voice, behind him, murmured: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Naw, <b>I</b> won't <b>go</b> <b>off</b> the field. Leave {{me on the}} bench," [...] he said. [...] "Fight 'em now. It's our game. Never mind {{a couple}} of runs." ...|$|R
