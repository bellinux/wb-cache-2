5|$|The VX update from 2000 {{featured}} a revised <b>headlamp</b> design. The VT's rear tail lamp panel {{was replaced by}} two separate light assemblies. Conversely, the luxury-oriented Berlina and Calais sedans continued using a full-width boot-lid panel incorporating the registration plate and tail lamps.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were larger than those of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the <b>headlamp</b> switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a <b>headlamp)</b> by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
50|$|Projector <b>headlamps</b> are now {{standard}} {{across all}} trim {{levels in the}} US except for fleet vehicles; halogen projector <b>headlamps</b> replaced the reflector <b>headlamps</b> used in previous model years, HID <b>headlamps</b> are optional on Touring-L and Limited, and are standard on Limited Platinum. The reflector <b>headlamps</b> are retained on the Dodge Caravan. Last year for the Chrysler Town & Country.|$|R

5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular <b>headlamp,</b> and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular <b>headlamp,</b> and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E
5|$|Out of {{a desire}} to have four trains {{regularly}} running at once each day on the DRR, in the mid-1990s the Disneyland park began to search for an additional narrow-gauge steam locomotive to add to the railroad's rolling stock. One such locomotive was acquired from Bill Norred in 1996 in exchange for the combine car and four coaches from the DRR's retired Retlaw 1 passenger train set, but after the park received it, the new locomotive was deemed to be too large for the DRR's operations. It was then sent to the Walt Disney World Railroad in the Magic Kingdom park of Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, where the locomotive was dedicated, despite being too small for the railroad's operations, and named after Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ward Kimball. Still needing a fifth locomotive for the DRR, the park traded the Ward Kimball locomotive in 1999 to the Cedar Point & Lake Erie Railroad in the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, for a new locomotive suitable for the railroad. Named Maud L., the locomotive was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1902 and was originally used to haul sugar cane at the Laurel Valley Sugar Plantation in Louisiana owned by the Barker and Lepine Company. After arriving in Disneyland, the Maud L., later renamed Ward Kimball like the locomotive for which it was traded, was given a new cab built by Disney and a new boiler built by Hercules Power, which was subcontracted by Superior Boiler Works. Due to budget issues, the restoration of the locomotive was suspended not long after its arrival, and its parts were planned to be placed in long-term storage in late 2003. The Ward Kimball locomotive's restoration efforts were resurrected soon after, when it was decided that its addition to the DRR would be incorporated into the celebration of Disneyland's fiftieth anniversary in July 2005. In late 2004, Boschan Boiler and Restorations led by Paul Boschan, a former roundhouse manager and engineer at the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad in Felton, California, was awarded the contract to complete the restoration of the Ward Kimball. The restoration work performed included installing new driving wheels, attaching a new smokebox door, and applying gold-leaf silhouettes of Kimball's Jiminy Cricket character {{on the sides of the}} <b>headlamp.</b> The Ward Kimball locomotive, which entered service on June 25, 2005, became the DRR's No. 5 locomotive, and on February 15 the following year, John Kimball, the son of Ward Kimball, who died in 2002, christened the locomotive during its dedication ceremony.|$|E

50|$|Hidden <b>headlamps,</b> also {{commonly}} known as pop-up <b>headlamps,</b> hideaway headlights, are a form of automotive lighting and an automotive styling feature that conceals an automobile's <b>headlamps</b> {{when they are not}} in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{last time}} pop-up <b>headlamps</b> {{appeared}} on a volume-production car was in 2004 when both the Lotus Esprit and C5 Corvette ended production. Development of both projector beam <b>headlamps</b> — like those on the 1990 Nissan Z — and more efficient, bright LED <b>headlamps</b> of small size will most likely {{eliminate the need for}} concealed <b>headlamps</b> altogether, though composite <b>headlamps</b> containing small halogen bulbs offered enough freedom of styling have already replaced them to a mainstream scale.|$|R

25|$|HID <b>headlamp</b> burners produce between 2,800 and 3,500 lumens {{from between}} 35 and 38 watts of {{electrical}} power, while halogen filament <b>headlamp</b> bulbs produce between 700 and 2,100 lumens from between 40 and 72 watts at 12.8V.|$|E
25|$|<b>Headlamp</b> systems require {{periodic}} maintenance. Sealed beam headlamps are modular; {{when the}} filament burns out, the entire sealed beam is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made {{since the late}} 1980s use <b>headlamp</b> lens-reflector assemblies that are considered {{a part of the}} car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. <b>Headlamp</b> aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.|$|E
25|$|A <b>headlamp</b> is a lamp {{attached}} {{to the front of}} a vehicle to light the road ahead. While it is common for the term headlight to be used interchangeably in informal discussion, <b>headlamp</b> is the term for the device itself, while headlight properly refers to the beam of light produced and distributed by the device.|$|E

40|$|The project {{proposed}} {{a prototype of}} an adaptive car <b>headlamps</b> control using image processing. The adaptive <b>headlamps</b> system focuses on the lighting angle control of low beam in the <b>headlamps</b> which its light tracks moved horizontally. The controller in <b>headlamps</b> is based on image processing from a camera mounted on the car. Adaptive <b>headlamps</b> system consists of portable tiny computer of Raspberry Pi, Arduino microcontroller, and two stepper motors for {{the left and the}} right <b>headlamps.</b> The system was implemented on the <b>headlamps</b> of a Toyota Avanza car. The adaptive <b>headlamps</b> system could detect most types of cars ahead. It could decrease a ‘glare’ effect and increase the driver sight based on survey taken from the driver and the driver of opposite car. The system still couldn’t detect the opposite car with high intensity of light from braking lamps, as well as the light from the opposite front lamps...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} subjects' {{impressions of}} performance of high-intensity discharge (HID) <b>headlamps</b> after in-traffic experience, {{with an emphasis}} on colour appearance of red stop signs. In the first of two tasks, subjects drove (or rode) for half an hour on a variety of roads in a car equipped with either HID or tungsten-halogen low-beam <b>headlamps.</b> Instructions did not mention colour appearance. The second task involved a direct comparison of HID and tungsten-halogen <b>headlamps.</b> In this task, subjects drove (or rode) twice along a 7 -minute route in a residential area, and they were instructed {{to pay attention to the}} colour appearance of stop signs and other objects. The main finding from Task 1 is that subjects who experienced HID <b>headlamps</b> did not report more (or fewer) spontaneous negative comments on colour appearance of stop signs or other objects than did subjects who experienced tungsten-halogen <b>headlamps.</b> Furthermore, the evaluations of the overall performances of the two types of <b>headlamps</b> were not different. In the direct comparison of Task 2 there was no evidence of problems with colour appearance when using HID <b>headlamps.</b> Moreover, subjects preferred HID <b>headlamps</b> in terms of the overall performance, and in making stop signs and other objects stand out from their background. However, this preference for HID <b>headlamps</b> was present only for subjects who had the relatively extended exposure to the HID <b>headlamps</b> in Task 1. The present results provide no evidence for problems with colour appearance of stop signs and other objects when using HID <b>headlamps.</b> Furthermore, the study provides evidence that observers perceive HID <b>headlamps</b> as helping stop signs and other objects to stand out from their background. The results imply that given a somewhat extended exposure to HID <b>headlamps,</b> drivers would prefer them over current tungsten-halogen <b>headlamps...</b>|$|R
25|$|UN R48 has {{mandated}} {{the installation}} of automatic <b>headlamp</b> since July 30, 2016. With Daytime running lamp equipped and operated, the dipped beam <b>headlamp</b> should automatically turn on if the car is driving in less than 1,000 lux ambient condition (Automatic switching condition), such as in tunnel and in dark environment. while driving in tunnel or dark environment, Daytime running lamp would make glare more evident to the upcoming vehicle driver, which in turn would influence the upcoming vehicle driver's eyesight, such that, by automatically switching the Daytime running lamp to the dipped-beam <b>headlamp,</b> the inherent safety defect could be solved and safety benefit ensured.|$|E

25|$|Automotive <b>headlamp</b> {{applications}} using {{light-emitting diodes}} (LEDs) have been undergoing very active development since 2004.|$|E
50|$|The feature's {{popularity}} has waxed and waned over time. Hidden <b>headlamps</b> regained {{popularity in the}} mid-to-late 1960s, in Europe but particularly in the US where aerodynamic <b>headlamps</b> were not permitted. A relatively large variety of cars incorporated hidden <b>headlamps</b> in the 1970s, 1980s, and {{and up to the}} early 1990s. Then subsequent strict legislations led to hidden <b>headlamps</b> becoming increasingly out of favor.|$|R

50|$|Historically, one of {{the most}} {{conspicuous}} differences between UN and US regulations was the design and performance of <b>headlamps.</b> The Citroën DS shown here illustrates the large differences in <b>headlamps</b> during the 1940-1983 era when US regulations required sealed beam <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
25|$|These provide {{improved}} lighting for cornering. Some automobiles {{have their}} headlamps {{connected to the}} steering mechanism so the lights will follow {{the movement of the}} front wheels. Czechoslovak Tatra was an early implementer of such a technique, producing in the 1930s a vehicle with a central directional <b>headlamp.</b> The American 1948 Tucker Sedan was likewise equipped with a third central <b>headlamp</b> connected mechanically to the steering system.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electric}} <b>headlamp</b> {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the <b>headlamp</b> bulb or sealed beam. Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, blackening it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though blackening was less of a problem in sealed beam units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive <b>headlamp</b> service.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, Carl Fisher was {{approached}} by {{the owner of a}} U.S. patent to manufacture acetylene headlights. Soon Fisher's firm supplied nearly every <b>headlamp</b> used on automobiles in the United States as manufacturing plants were built {{all over the country to}} supply the demand. The headlight patent made him rich as an automotive parts supplier and led to friendships with notable auto magnates. Fisher made millions when he and partner James A. Allison sold their Prest-O-Lite automobile <b>headlamp</b> business to Union Carbide.|$|E
25|$|Designs as of MY2010, such {{as those}} {{available}} as optional equipment on the 2010 Toyota Prius, give performance between halogen and HID <b>headlamps,</b> with system power consumption slightly lower than other <b>headlamps,</b> longer lifespans and more flexible design possibilities. As LED technology continues to evolve, the performance of LED <b>headlamps</b> is predicted to improve to approach, meet, and perhaps one day surpass that of HID <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R

25|$|When a halogen <b>headlamp</b> is {{retrofitted}} with an HID bulb, {{light distribution}} and output are altered. In the United States, vehicle lighting {{that does not}} conform to FMVSS 108 is not street legal. Glare will be produced and the headlamp's type approval or certification becomes invalid with the altered light distribution, so the <b>headlamp</b> is no longer street-legal in some locales. In the US, suppliers, importers and vendors that offer non-compliant kits are subject to civil fines. By October 2004, the NHTSA had investigated 24 suppliers and all resulted in termination of sale or recalls.|$|E
25|$|Dirt buildup on <b>headlamp</b> lenses {{increases}} glare {{to other}} road users, even at levels {{too low to}} reduce seeing performance significantly for the driver. Therefore, <b>headlamp</b> lens cleaners are required by UN Regulation 48 on vehicles equipped with low-beam headlamps using light sources that have a reference luminous flux of 2,000 lumens or more. This includes all HID headlamps and some high-power halogen units. Some cars have lens cleaners fitted even where the regulations do not require them. North America, for example, does not use UN regulations, and FMVSS 108 does not require lens cleaners on any headlamps, though they are permitted.|$|E
25|$|In a two-{{filament}} <b>headlamp,</b> {{there can}} only be one filament exactly at {{the focal point of}} the reflector. There are two primary means of producing two different beams from a two-filament bulb in a single reflector.|$|E
