The past few years have seen not only a period of gradual ‘marketisation’ of the national gas sectors, but also the building of new gas infrastructure, a redrawing of the gas flow map, and changes in the ownership of the Central European gas companies. Another change in Central Europe is the fact that individual states and companies are moving away from their traditional focus on their national gas markets; instead, they are beginning to develop a variety of concepts for the regional integration of Central European markets. This publication attempts to grasp the main elements of the ongoing transformation of Central Europe’s gas markets, with particular emphasis on the situation in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary...|$|E
40|$|Current {{hazardous}} waste management in Europe is characterized by great differences from country to country. In the majority of EU and other European countries landfill or incineration are the main options, although in several Western European countries recovery of {{hazardous waste}} is also important. European Directive 99 / 31 rises up the environmental standards for landfills and pushes hard for a big increase of the already high landfill tipping fees. Practically, this Directive acts as a market driver prohibiting new hazardous waste landfills. Taking into account that <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> <b>Decision</b> 2003 / 33 provides a concrete framework for the safe use of underground space, it seems that underground disposal in abandoned mines is a cheap and viable solution for hazardous waste.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{substantive}} goals and mechanisms for implementing an integrated climate and energy policy have been ratified {{over the last}} two years at the European level. By 2020, greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are to be reduced by at least 20 percent; energy efficiency improved by 20 percent; and the share of energy from renewable sources increased to 20 percent. According to a recent <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> <b>decision,</b> by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are to be reduced by as much as 80 to 95 percent. In June of 2009 a new EU Directive was enacted for the promotion of renewable energy. The Directive sets binding goals for the share of energy from renewable sources in the 27 Member States by 2020 while also defining conditions for their achievement. The Directive replaced existing EU directives that had only set non-binding targets for electricity and fuels from renewable energy for 2010. These Directives have only been of limited effectiveness. Individual EU Member States must now immediately address how they plan to meet these requirements by devising and implementing appropriate domestic policy measures. Germany is in a good starting position for the further expansion of renewables, particularly because of its overhauled Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) and the new Renewable Energy Heat Act (EEW 4 rmeG). Nevertheless, the new German government faces great challenges in integrating larger amounts of renewable energy into the energy economy at an accelerated pace...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Following the June 2012 <b>European</b> <b>Council</b> <b>decision</b> {{to place}} the ‘Single Supervisory Mechanism’ (SSM) within the European Central Bank, the general {{presumption}} in the policy discussions has been {{that there should be}} ‘Chinese walls’ between the supervisory and monetary policy arms of the ECB. The current legislative proposal, in fact, is explicit on this account. On the contrary, however, this paper finds that {{there is no need to}} impose a strict separation between these two functions. The authors argue, in fact, that a strict separation of supervision and monetary policy is not even desirable during a financial crisis when the systemic stability of the financial system represents the biggest threat to a monetary policy that aims at price stability. In their view, the key problem hampering the ECB today is that it lacks detailed information on the state of health of the banking system, which is often highly confidential. Chinese walls would not solve this problem. Moreover, in light of the fact that the new, proposed Supervisory Board will be composed to a large extent of representatives of the same institutions that also dominate the Governing Council, the paper finds that it does not make sense to have Chinese walls between two boards with largely overlapping memberships. In addition, it recommends that some members of the Supervisory Boards should be “independents” in order to reduce the tendency of supervisors to unduly delay the recognition of losses...|$|E
