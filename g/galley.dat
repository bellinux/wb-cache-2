5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} <b>galley</b> attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The <b>galley</b> was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} <b>galley.</b> Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the <b>galley</b> apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another <b>galley</b> managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The <b>galley</b> San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E

50|$|On 7 October 1571, the League won {{a decisive}} {{victory over the}} Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in the Gulf of Patras.The fleet of the Holy League in this {{engagement}} consisted of 212 warships (206 <b>galleys</b> and 6 galleasses, the modern large <b>galleys</b> developed by Venice) with 1,815 guns and manned by 28,500 infantry. The majority of warships was Venetian (6 galleasses, 109 <b>galleys),</b> the next largest contingent were Spanish (49 <b>galleys,</b> including 26 <b>galleys</b> from Naples, Sicily and other Italian territories), and Genoese (27 <b>galleys),</b> with additional warships from the Papal States (seven <b>galleys),</b> the Order of Saint Stephen from the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (five <b>galleys),</b> the Duchy of Savoy and the Knights of Malta (three <b>galleys</b> each), and some privately owned <b>galleys</b> in Spanish service.|$|R

5|$|The action {{continued}} {{across the}} Narrow Seas towards Dunkirk, Nieuwpoort, Gravelines and Sluis. The Dutch Admiral Jan Cant soon {{cut off the}} Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship Mackerel (Makreel), came in sight and attacked the already damaged San Felipe, pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the <b>galley</b> found herself close to Vice-Admiral Cant's Half Moon (Halve Maene). The <b>galley</b> tried to evade discovery by remaining immobile in the darkness but this had disastrous results. The Halve Maene bore straight down upon the <b>galley</b> and struck at her amidships carrying off her mainmast and her poop. Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck Half Moon sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; San Felipe sunk quickly carrying with her all the <b>galley</b> slaves, sailors, and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Astrid had two deckhouses: one at {{the stern}} with navigational {{equipment}} and maps, and another forward containing a bar. The lower deck had twelve 2-person cabins (of which three {{could be used as}} 3-person cabins) as well as showers, toilets and a <b>galley.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared <b>galley</b> with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a sailing ship. The Mycenaean <b>galley</b> offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.|$|E
50|$|Lauria had around 40-45 <b>galleys.</b> He {{followed}} his usual tactic and retreated until the Angevin <b>galleys</b> had become disorganized, weathered their initial attack, then counterattacked from the sides, damaging the Angevin <b>galleys</b> oars. In a battle lasting {{much of the}} day, Henry di Mari again fled, leaving about 40 Angevin <b>galleys</b> to be captured, along with 5000 prisoners, including many counts and barons.|$|R

5|$|After {{three years}} as a <b>galley</b> slave, Judah is {{assigned}} to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who {{has been charged with}} destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' <b>galley</b> is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by falling on his sword, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s South Stoneham House was {{merged into}} the Wessex Lane Halls complex of residences, {{although}} each individual hall maintained an individual character.

Residents shared small kitchen and bathroom facilities.|$|E
5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or <b>galley,</b> was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the <b>galley</b> was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the age of}} the bucentaurs, it is {{probable}} that for ceremonies in the Venetian Lagoon the doge was simply assigned a small <b>galley</b> from the Venetian fleet. As Venice's wealth increased due to its naval power, plans were made for a special ship to be built. This is evidenced by the promissioni – sacramental pledges spoken by the doges when they were sworn into office – of Reniero Zeno of 1252, Lorenzo Tiepolo of 1268 and Giovanni Soranzo of 1312 which mention the construction of a bucentaur in the Arsenale shipyard and naval depot.|$|E

They were forcibly removed; Jervis made an official protest and promised retaliation if they were not handed over. The slaves were produced and Jervis took custody of them.|$|E
5|$|Galleys were {{effective}} as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially {{in relation to}} their large crews; a <b>galley</b> with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically carry only one 24-pounder cannon and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. The galleys also lacked decks and adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, many of whom succumbed to illness as a result of exposure during the war of 1741–43.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior firepower relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward firepower and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy <b>galley</b> formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E

50|$|From Egypt {{the use of}} rowing vessels, {{especially}} <b>galleys,</b> were extensively used in naval {{warfare and}} trade first in the Mediterranean from classical antiquity onwards. <b>Galleys</b> had advantages over sailing ships; they were easier to maneuver, capable of short bursts of speed, and able to move independently of the wind. <b>Galleys</b> continued in use in the Mediterranean until the advent of steam propulsion. Their (<b>galleys)</b> use in northern Atlantic waters was less successful, finishing with their poor performance with the Spanish Armada.|$|R
5|$|Marco Polo {{returned}} to Venice in 1295 with his fortune converted into gemstones. At this time, Venice was {{at war with}} the Republic of Genoa. Polo armed a <b>galley</b> equipped with a trebuchet to join the war. He was probably caught by Genoans in a skirmish in 1296, off the Anatolian coast between Adana and the Gulf of Alexandretta and not during the battle of Curzola (September 1298), off the Dalmatian coast. The latter claim is due to a later tradition (16th Century) recorded by Giovanni Battista Ramusio.|$|E
