40|$|In this contribution, {{we present}} a magnet-less non-reciprocal <b>filtering</b> <b>module</b> {{to be used in}} {{waveguide}} and antenna system for circular polarization applications. The <b>filtering</b> <b>module,</b> sandwiched between two thin dielectric slabs, consists of a annular aperture in a metallic screen which exhibits zero reflection, and thus maximum transmission, in a narrow frequency band around its resonant frequency. An artificial spatiotemporal modulation of the effective permittivity function around the annular aperture is introduced and, exploiting the concept of Angular Momentum-biased metamaterial, a non-reciprocity behavior takes place. The transmission and reflection coefficients turn out to be different for left- and right-handed circular polarized fields when impinging from the same side or, similarly, for the same polarization impinging from the opposite sides. Then, the non-reciprocal <b>filtering</b> <b>module</b> has been integrated in a circular waveguide and in an aperture antenna and we show some preliminary results of this new family of magnet-less non-reciprocal components...|$|R

40|$|Next {{generation}} access routers and {{edge devices}} {{need to provide}} functionalities, for layer- 4 packet forwarding and firewall/security checks. Consequently, a challenging issue concerns how to achieve fast packet filtering and forwarding at low cost. This paper studies the flow caching mechanisms for fast layer- 4 packet forwarding. We show by model analysis that flow caching performance is not very sensitive to the flow cache table lookup speed but it is sensitive to the cache hit ratio. By making use of the available layer- 4 information, we introduce two <b>filtering</b> <b>modules</b> to enhance the cache hit ratio. We demonstrate, by real trace simulation, that by adding these two <b>filtering</b> <b>modules,</b> the cache miss ratio can be reduced by up to 50 % and the full header filtering speed reduced by up to five-fold. The proposed flow caching mechanism is potentially useful for accessing routers and edge devices where costs are at a premium and where software based <b>filtering</b> <b>modules</b> are dynamically generated. 2002 Elsevier Science B.

The standard question of Singularity Theory is the finite-(Σ,G) -determinacy of matrices. Finite determinacy implies algebraizability and is equivalent to a stronger notion: stable algebraizability. In our previous work this determinacy question was reduced {{to the study of}} the tangent spaces to Σ and to the orbit, T_(Σ,A), T_(GA,A), and their quotient, the tangent module to the miniversal deformation. In particular, the order of determinacy is controlled by the annihilator of this tangent module.
