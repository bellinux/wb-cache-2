50|$|In {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy, {{the wavelength}} {{of the incoming}} laser or of its scattered light is adjusted to coincide with an electronic transition of the molecule or crystal. In most materials the laser and scatter electronic resonances overlap and are difficult to distinguish. Since the energy of these transitions differ between chemical species, this technique did not become broadly <b>applicable</b> <b>until</b> the advent of wavelength-tunable lasers in the early 1970s. When tuned near an electronic transition (resonance), the vibrational modes associated with that transition exhibit increased Raman scattering intensity.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{breadboard}} prototype {{to perform in}} situ <b>dating</b> <b>applicable</b> to planetary exploration. Based on the K-Ar dating method and using instruments inspired by flight-proven analytical components, 'KArMars' ablated a geological sample under high vacuum with a quadrupled ultraviolet (UV at 266 nm) Nd:YAG laser. During ablation, the K content of the target material was given by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and the released Ar- 40 was measured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Because K was measured as a concentration and Ar- 40 as a count of atoms, these values were converted using the ablated mass given by {{the product of the}} density and the ablated volume. The uncertainties of the age measurement were < 15 %. The quality of the K-Ar measurements was enhanced by the advantages of UV laser ablation such as the minimisation of thermal effects on argon diffusion. This work demonstrates that a specialised instrument inspired by this set-up could provide in situ absolute geochronology with sufficient precision for scientific investigations, particularly where the crater density counting provides higher uncertainties on Mars...|$|R

The main problems to govern a VC are to coordinate the communication among dispersed partners and to motivate employees to actively involve themselves into the network. Open source projects are confronted with similar problems. As several governance mechanisms are already analyzed in this context, the authors analyze and adopt governance concepts from open source projects to extract a governance framework for virtual corporations.

40|$|International audienceMyco{{bacterium}} avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a {{slow growing}} bacterium that can infect ruminants and remain latent for years without development of any clinical signs or disease. Diagnosis is often based on detection of MAP antibodies in milk or serum samples or culture of bacteria from faeces; however, these diagnostic tools are often not <b>applicable</b> <b>until</b> years after infection. Detection of MAP specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses can serve as an alternative and be implemented in a diagnostic tool. CMI responses can be measured {{at an early stage}} of infection, prior to development of antibodies and shedding of detectable amounts of MAP. At present, available diagnostic assays are limited by the lack of MAP specific antigens included in these assays resulting in poor specificity. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of diagnostic MAP antigen candidates described to date with special emphasis on antigen candidates tested for CMI responses. Relevant information on 115 different MAP antigens was systematically extracted from literature and summarized in 6 tables of CMI antigens, secreted antigens, cell wall and membrane antigens, lipoprotein antigens, heat shock antigens and hypothetical antigens. Strategies for evaluation of novel antigen candidates are discussed critically. Relatively few of the described antigens were evaluated for their use in CMI based diagnostic assays and so far, no obvious candidate has been identified for this application. Most of the novel diagnostic candidates were evaluated in few animals and it is recommended that an appropriate sample size is included for evaluation of antigen candidates in future studies...|$|R

The first, intergovernmental step of ratification was completed October 29, 2004. What has run aground now with the French and Dutch referenda is the second step—required, unanimous ratification by European member states.
