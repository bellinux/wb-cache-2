5|$|After their <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perils and {{obstacles}} of government, {{the political}} figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by}} a newer generation of politicians who had no <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E

If the caregiver is accepting of these proximity-seeking behaviors and grants access, the infant develops a secure organization; if the caregiver consistently denies the infant access, an avoidant organization develops; and if the caregiver inconsistently grants access, an ambivalent organization develops.|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

5|$|Birdsong is a 1993 war {{novel and}} family saga by the English author Sebastian Faulks. It is Faulks' fourth novel. The plot follows two main {{characters}} living at different times: {{the first is}} Stephen Wraysford, a British soldier {{on the front line}} in Amiens during the First World War, and the second is his granddaughter, Elizabeth Benson, whose 1970s plotline follows her attempts to recover an understanding of Stephen's <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 it {{was adapted}} as a two-part {{television}} drama for the BBC. The production starred Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Clémence Poésy as Isabelle Azaire, and {{was directed by}} Philip Martin, based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Steven Spielberg's War Horse as a successful evocation of the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World War I trenches.|$|E

5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while some aspects of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{debate about}} America {{remained}} mostly theoretical before the 19th century, since very few Swedes had any personal <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Emigration was illegal and population {{was seen as}} the wealth of nations. However, the Swedish population doubled between 1750 and 1850, and as population growth outstripped economic development, it gave rise to fears of overpopulation based on the influential population theory of Thomas Malthus. In the 1830s, the laws against emigration were repealed.|$|E
5|$|Symeon endured severe {{opposition}} from church authorities, {{particularly from the}} chief theologian of the emperor's court, Archbishop Stephen, who at one time was the Metropolitan of Nicomedia. Stephen was a former politician and diplomat {{with a reputation for}} a thorough theoretical understanding of theology, but one which was removed from actual <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiritual life. Symeon, in contrast, held the view that one must have actual <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit in order to speak about God, at the same time recognizing the authority of scripture and of the earlier church fathers. Their differing views on the source of authority to speak on spiritual matters was the cause of several years of intense conflict, ending with Symeon's eventual exile.|$|E

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that the life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine light.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} historian Simon Wessley {{describes the}} novel, alongside Barker's Regeneration, as an exemplar of contemporary fiction which uses the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World War I trenches to examine more contemporary understandings of PTSD.

5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises as simple luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and sprite animation quality. While the Sega Saturn port received praise {{for maintaining the}} <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original arcade version, the PlayStation port was met with mixed to negative critical reception for removing several features, such as tag team battles.
