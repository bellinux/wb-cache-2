500|$|On 3 January 1927, {{following}} a venture out to Gunnamatta Bay, Gibbs was piloting a launch {{back into the}} Grays Point area of Port Hacking when a scream rang out. Gibbs looked up and noticed 15-year-old Mervyn Allum struggling in the water about [...] from the shore. Subsequent reports indicate that the other bathers first thought that Allum, who {{was known to be}} a good swimmer, was drowning. Gibbs, however, quickly realised that the youth's leg had been grabbed by a shark. Gibbs immediately dived into the water and swam towards the scene to render Allum assistance, as the latter struggled to fend off the shark. By now the water was red with blood. As Gibbs <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> Allum, the teenager was pulled under water. Gibbs had to strike at the shark with his legs and fists and grasp its dorsal fin before the shark would release its grip. While Gibbs' friend, Donald Campbell, rowed a boat towards the pair, Gibbs maintained a hold on the now unconscious Allum, trod water, and splashed to discourage further attacks. The shark continued to circle below during this time, at one point brushing past Gibbs' feet. As Campbell drew near, he and Gibbs managed to lift Allum aboard before Gibbs pulled himself clear of the water. Gibbs later reported that the flesh had been stripped from the ankle to the thigh on one of Allum's legs, and there was evidence of teeth and bite marks to Allum's hands and stomach; Allum was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.|$|E
2500|$|After realizing she had missed, {{she raised}} her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived towards her and grabbed her arm, {{possibly}} saving President Ford's life. Sipple said at the time: [...] "I saw [...] pointed out there and I <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off." [...] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, still on the bench in 2010, spoke on the record, saying that Moore would have killed President Ford had {{she had her own}} gun, and it was only [...] "because her gun was faulty" [...] that the president's life was spared.|$|E
2500|$|As police arrived, {{the house}} lights {{were brought up}} and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near {{the rear of the}} theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that {{he was the first to}} reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to {{surrender}} saying, [...] "Well, it is all over now." [...] McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the thumb and index finger of his hand as he <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|E

60|$|Today I {{am getting}} better ideas about distances. I was {{so eager to}} get hold of every pretty thing that I giddily <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> it, {{sometimes}} when it was too far off, and sometimes when it was but six inches away but seemed a foot--alas, with thorns between! I learned a lesson; also I made an axiom, all out of my own head--my very first one; THE SCRATCHED EXPERIMENT SHUNS THE THORN. I think it is a very good one for one so young.|$|E
6000|$|The thing stopped {{then and}} looked at me a moment as much as to say: [...] "Why this thing has a stinger! I must be careful." [...] And then it reached out its long neck and opened its mighty jaws and <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> me; but I wasn't there. I had tumbled {{backward}} into the tower, and I mighty near killed myself doing it. When I glanced up, that little head on the end of its long neck was coming straight down on top of me, and once more I tumbled into greater safety, sprawling upon the floor of the centrale.|$|E
40|$|Discussions of land <b>grabs</b> <b>for</b> various purposes, {{including}} environmental ends, {{have expanded}} in recent years, yet land grabbing remains inconsistently defined and poorly understood. Our ability {{to assess the}} extent to which land grabs are occurring, and to identify the mixture of factors driving land and resource acquisition, is limited. This paper assesses whether a land <b>grab</b> <b>for</b> conservation is happening in southern Chile, and identifies the various driving forces that combine to drive land acquisitions in the region, based on a detailed exploration of the recent massive growth in privately owned protected areas in the region. This paper finds that the various dominant definitions of land grabs each apply only partially to southern Chile, that land <b>grabs</b> <b>for</b> conservation need to be understood as the latest stage in a longer process by which the region's natural resources are incorporated into the Chilean and the global economy, and that green grabs interact in various ways with broader resource <b>grabs,</b> particularly <b>for</b> forestry and hydroelectricity. This case study demonstrates the limitations of some definitions of land grabs, particularly their focus on capitalist accumulation within land grabs, their international nature and their emphasis on legal processes...|$|R

60|$|Weatherbee fell {{prey to the}} grosser superstitions, and did {{his best}} to resurrect the spirits which slept in the {{forgotten}} graves. It was a fascinating thing, and in his dreams they came to him from out of the cold, and snuggled into his blankets, and told him of their toils and troubles ere they died. He shrank away from the clammy contact as they drew closer and twined their frozen limbs about him, and when they whispered in his ear of things to come, the cabin rang with his frightened shrieks. Cuthfert did not understand--for they no longer spoke--and when thus awakened he invariably <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> his revolver. Then he would sit up in bed, shivering nervously, with the weapon trained on the unconscious dreamer. Cuthfert deemed the man going mad, and so came to fear for his life.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} idle {{to say that}} the dinner, as a dinner, was a {{complete}} success. Half-way through the Swiss general missed his diamond solitaire, and cold glances were cast at Raisuli, who sat on his immediate left. Then the King of Bollygolla's table-manners were frankly inelegant. When he wanted a thing, he <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> it. And he seemed to want nearly everything. Nor was the behaviour of the leader of the Young Turks all that could be desired. There had been some talk of only allowing him to come down to dessert; but he had squashed in, as he briefly put it, and it would be paltering with the truth to say that he had not had far more champagne than was good for him. Also, the general of Monaco had brought a pack of cards with him, and was spoiling the harmony by trying to induce Prince Ping Pong Pang to find the lady. And the brainless laugh of the Mad Mullah was very trying.|$|E
60|$|The most {{conspicuous}} feature of Benares is {{the pair of}} slender white minarets which tower like masts from the great Mosque of Aurangzeb. They seem to be always in sight, from everywhere, those airy, graceful, inspiring things. But masts {{is not the right}} word, for masts have a perceptible taper, while these minarets have not. They are 142 feet high, and only 8 1/2 feet in diameter at the base, and 7 1/2 at the summit--scarcely any taper at all. These are the proportions of a candle; and fair and fairylike candles these are. Will be, anyway, some day, when the Christians inherit them and top them with the electric light. There is a great view from up there--a wonderful view. A large gray monkey was part of it, and damaged it. A monkey has no judgment. This one was skipping about the upper great heights of the mosque --skipping across empty yawning intervals which were almost too wide for him, and which he only just barely cleared, each time, by the skin of his teeth. He got me so nervous that I couldn't look at the view. I couldn't look at anything but him. Every time he went sailing over one of those abysses my breath stood still, and when he <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> the perch he was going for, I grabbed too, in sympathy. And he was perfectly indifferent, perfectly unconcerned, and I did all the panting myself. He came within an ace of losing his life a dozen times, and I was so troubled about him that I would have shot him if I had had anything to do it with. But I strongly recommend the view. There is more monkey than view, and there {{is always going to be}} more monkey while that idiot survives, but what view you get is superb. All Benares, the river, and the region round about are spread before you. Take a gun, and look at the view.|$|E

50|$|The NES {{version was}} {{released}} by Hudson Soft in 1984 (North American release 1986) {{and became one of}} the earliest third-party games made for that system.

In addition, fruits and vegetables randomly appear which may be <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> additional points. Although a level editor was included, {{there is no way to}} save levels created with it. An arcade game of Lode Runner was produced with some added features like the ability to hang off the ends of ladders and an improved enemy AI.|$|E
50|$|On May 22, Kanehara faced Valentijn Overeem from RINGS Holland. Again {{facing a}} heavier opponent, Kanehara {{was hit with}} knees and kicks to the head and downed in the initial minute, {{but he managed to}} execute a {{takedown}} on Overeem, who fell badly and dislocated his knee. Judges and referee deliberated about letting the match continue after the knee was relocated, and they eventually conceded. Returning to action, Overeem landed a body kick which Kanehara <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> another takedown, but Hiromitsu fell into a guillotine and was forced to spend a rope escape. The sequence repeated itself before Overeem knocked Kanehara out with a high kick.|$|E
50|$|On August 29, 2009, Cassel {{suffered}} an MCL injury during the 1st {{quarter of a}} preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. Cassel was dragged {{to the ground and}} <b>grabbed</b> <b>for</b> his knee immediately upon impact. He attempted to continue playing but called a timeout and limped off the field. Brodie Croyle started the final game of the preseason against the St. Louis Rams as well as the regular season opening game against the Baltimore Ravens when Cassel was still unable to play. Cassel, though, started every game thereafter, going 4-11. Matt Cassel threw for 2,924 yards with 16 touchdowns and 16 interceptions and had a quarterback rating of 69.9 in his first season with the Chiefs.|$|E

5000|$|Because of this affair, Sulley gained notoriety in the United States. He {{testified in}} {{relation}} to the 1925 Yusupov-Gulbenkian suit that the prince's cronies had tried to claim money for the sale before signing a contract or handing over the paintings. The New York Times wrote up Sulley's story with the title [...] "Friends of Prince <b>Grabbed</b> <b>for</b> Cash." [...] The paper also quoted expert witnesses, including Stevenson C. Scott and Colin, saying that $100,000 was a fair price for the two Rembrandt works - particularly during the art market depression of 1921. Former New York governor Nathan L. Miller counseled Widener in the suit, which made it to the New York Supreme Court.|$|E
