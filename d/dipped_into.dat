5|$|On 14 July 1996, a NATO E-3A, LX-N90457, overran {{the runway}} and <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> the sea on takeoff from Preveza AB, Preveza, Greece.

It allegedly suffered a birdstrike during take off, but no evidence of a birdstrike was found.|$|E
5|$|The flowers provide dyes {{of bright}} yellow or green, {{and have been}} used for hair dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks, or put into shoes to help with {{insulating}} them. The dried stems were also <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> suet or wax to make torches. Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for {{it led to}} Michael Faraday's invention of the electric motor in 1821. Faraday's homopolar motor consisted of a permanent magnet sitting {{in a pool of}} mercury. A current was allowed through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet {{for as long as the}} current was maintained.|$|E

5|$|As the United States {{developed}} the Southwest, the Colorado River {{was seen as}} a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3million in 1906–07 to stabilize the waterway, an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after the waterway was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.|$|E
5|$|Devotees {{visit the}} temple {{to attend the}} daily pujas and make their offerings. Booths are erected outside {{for the sale of}} food, drink, brassware, pottery, cloth and holy images. On the {{penultimate}} day of the festival there is a procession, when the image of the goddess is placed upon a huge wooden chariot and pulled around the temple by devotees. On {{the final day of the}} festival, two large chariots are drawn by the devotees to the Deduru oya, a local river for the thirtham ("holy bath") ceremony when the images are <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> the river. At the same time thousands of devotees also jump into the river. After the holy bath, the procession goes back to the temple along a route through Chilaw, accompanied by traditional Nadeswaram and Thavil musicians. The procession then passes the Ayyanayake and Kali temples prior to entering the main temple.|$|E

However, when they saw Aslan and afterwards could not remember anything of their conversation, Reepicheep concluded that the island was cursed, giving it its name.|$|E
25|$|The {{porous pot}} {{version of the}} Daniell cell was invented by John Dancer, a Liverpool {{instrument}} maker, in 1838. It consists of a central zinc anode <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> a porous earthenware pot containing a zinc sulfate solution. The porous pot is, in turn, immersed in a solution of copper sulfate contained in a copper can, which acts as the cell's cathode. The use of a porous barrier allows ions to pass through but keeps the solutions from mixing.|$|E
25|$|Miró did not {{completely}} abandon subject matter. Despite the Surrealist automatic techniques that he employed {{extensively in the}} 1920s, sketches show that his work was often {{the result of a}} methodical process. Miró’s work rarely <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> non-objectivity, maintaining a symbolic, schematic language. This was perhaps most prominent in the repeated Head of a Catalan Peasant series of 1924 to 1925. In 1926, he collaborated with Max Ernst on designs for ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev. With Miró's help, Ernst pioneered the technique of grattage, in which he troweled pigment onto his canvases.|$|E

The ruby is <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> oils, then covered with powder, embedded on a tile {{and placed in the}} oven where it is heated at around 900°C (1600°F) for one hour in an oxidizing atmosphere. The orange colored powder transforms upon heating into a transparent to yellow-colored paste, which fills all fractures. After cooling the color of the paste is fully transparent and dramatically improves the overall transparency of the ruby.|$|E
25|$|An {{outstanding}} {{example of}} the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment {{was carried out by}} Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered {{on the end of the}} blowpipe and was subsequently <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> a pot of hot white glass. Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of white glass overlying the blue body.|$|E
25|$|Benghazi {{is home to}} many {{distinctive}} {{dishes that}} can be prepared in the home. Bazin {{is one of the}} most well known of these dishes. Bazin is a dish consisting of a small loaf of heated dough and a meat or vegetable sauce. The dough can be ripped into bite-sized pieces and <b>dipped</b> <b>into</b> the sauce. This dish uses essential ingredients such as garlic and oil. Other dishes like Couscous are more well known around the world and adopted by other cultures. One common dessert that can be found in Benghazi is deep fried dates. These are often served with milk.|$|E
