5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of woody plants. Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
5|$|To {{investigate}} the smoke cloud the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements, a research aircraft operated jointly by NERC and the Met Office, made two flights on 12 and 13 December. In {{the first flight}} {{the edge of the}} plume was followed along the south coast of England. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone concentrations were found to be low with soot particles being the major component <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> The second flight went into the centre of the plume to obtain data to help forecasting and emergency teams.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>clouds</b> {{are formed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean. The more extreme <b>the</b> {{difference}} <b>in</b> temperature, <b>the</b> more water is stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b> <b>The</b> Cold Drop can produce snow or hail.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cloud</b> cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the Sun {{as a source of}} energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is still unknown. In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Modern radar scans many angles {{around the}} site. Reflectivity values at {{multiple}} angles {{above ground level}} in a storm are proportional to the precipitation rate at those levels. Summing reflectivities in the Vertically Integrated Liquid or VIL, gives the liquid water content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> Research shows that hail development in the upper levels of the storm {{is related to the}} evolution of VIL. VIL divided by the vertical extent of the storm, called VIL density, has a relationship with hail size, although this varies with atmospheric conditions and therefore is not highly accurate. Traditionally, hail size and probability can be estimated from radar data by computer using algorithms based on this research. Some algorithms include the height of the freezing level to estimate the melting of the hailstone and what would be left on the ground.|$|E

25|$|Whenever {{the laptop}} is powered on it can {{participate}} in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> {{has access to the}} Internet—either directly or indirectly—then all computers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> are able to share that access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the store and forward Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed.|$|E
