Muslims predominate in all but Nuba Mountains region. The vast majority of Muslims in Sudan adhere to Sunni Islam of Maliki school of jurisprudence, deeply influenced with Sufism, making Sudan {{one of the most}} tolerant Muslim majority countries in the world. There are also some Shia communities in Khartoum, the capital. The most significant divisions occur {{along the lines of the}} Sufi brotherhoods. Two popular brotherhoods, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and <b>Democratic</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Parties</b> respectively.

50|$|Notable {{outcomes}} were the significant drop in {{support for the}} Labour Party, who came third, and the UK Independence Party (UKIP) finishing second in a major election {{for the first time}} in its history, coming level with Labour in terms of seats but ahead of them in terms of votes. This was the first time in British electoral history that a party in government had been outpolled in a national election by a party with no representation in the House of Commons. The BNP also won two seats, its first ever in a nationwide election. It also marked the first time the Scottish National Party (SNP) won the largest share of the European election vote in Scotland, and it was the first time since 1918 Labour had failed to come first in a Welsh election. It was the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party's</b> (DUP) worst ever European election result, and also the first time an Irish Republican party, Sinn Féin, topped the poll in Northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Always {{something}} of a maverick within Unionist politics, Barr served a three-month suspension from the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC) after endorsing the candidacy of Ken Gibson of the Volunteer Political Party for West Belfast in the October 1974 general election despite the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party's</b> John McQuade representing the UUUC. During his suspension Barr {{was part of a}} UDA delegation that made a fund-raising trip to Libya where they met with Muammar Gaddafi. Barr claimed when he returned that Gaddafi, who at the time was funding the Provisional IRA, had expressed a firm interest in providing money for an independent Northern Ireland. The trip however, on which Barr was accompanied by Tommy Lyttle, Andy Robinson and Harry Chicken, was widely condemned by unionist politicians because of the purportedly left-wing nature of the Gaddafi regime whilst the same reason was used a basis by Charles Harding Smith to launch a loyalist feud against UDA leader Andy Tyrie, whose idea the trip had been. In the course of this feud, Harding Smith placed Barr under a death threat, although nothing came of this as the pro-Tyrie forces quickly dispatched the challenge of Harding Smith.|$|R
50|$|Of the British parties, the Conservative Party is {{explicitly}} unionist; it has formally {{been called the}} Conservative and <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> since a merger with the Liberal <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> in 1912.

25|$|On 2 November 2015, 105 MLA's {{voted on}} {{a motion to}} {{recognise}} same-sex marriage, with 53 MLA's voting in favour and 51 voting against, the first time same-sex marriage had received majority support in the Assembly. However the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> tabled a petition of concern, preventing the motion from having any legal effect.|$|E
25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} is not performed or recognised in Northern Ireland. Prior to the March 2017 elections, First Minister of Northern Ireland Arlene Foster {{stated that the}} <b>Democratic</b> <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> would continue to use a petition of concern to block any bill which would legislate to allow same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions are treated as civil partnerships.|$|E
5000|$|Smyth {{was first}} elected to the council in 1972 as {{representative}} for the Shankill ward. He won a by-election resulting from the resignation of John McQuade, and beat James Brown of the Ulster <b>Unionist</b> <b>Party</b> and David Robb of the Ulster Constitution Party in a three-way contest. In the election, he received the support of McQuade's <b>party,</b> the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Unionists.</b> [...] Following a change in council structure, he was re-elected the following year for [...] "Area E" [...] which included the Glencairn, Woodvale, Ballysillan, Highfield, Legoniel and Ardoyne areas. He subsequently represented the Court electoral area which covered Glencairn, Highfield, Woodvale and the mid and lower Shankill areas. Smyth was appointed as Alderman in 1978, receiving the same honour in 1985, 1989 and 1993. In 1983 he was chosen as deputy mayor and served in this capacity again in 1993 before being appointed as Lord Mayor in June 1994. He again served as deputy mayor in 2001. As a councillor Smyth {{had been willing to}} oppose the main <b>unionist</b> <b>parties</b> on some issues, as he demonstrated in 1991 when he helped to overturn a ban on government ministers visiting Belfast City Hall, an initiative passed by unionist councillors in 1985 as a reaction to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.|$|R
