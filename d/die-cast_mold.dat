40|$|In <b>die-casting</b> <b>molds,</b> heat-checking is {{the typical}} failure mechanism. Optimizing the {{parameters}} that decrease this failure venture {{should be considered}} when designing and heat treating steels. The quality of die steels and their treatment continue to improve. This research investigated properties of the traditional materials 1. 2343 and 1. 2344 and the new steels (Dievar and TOOLOX 44) when applied to the <b>die-casting</b> <b>mold</b> specimens, after different experimental cycles. Also microstructures of the mentioned materials were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test. Chrome-molybdenum-silicon-vanadium steels have good hardening ability in oil and in air. Therefore, the hot-work steels have considerable toughness and plastic attributes through both regular and higher temperatures. So, {{it is a good}} traditional die-casting material. However, another special die steel, such as Dievar, is a particularly developed steel grade; its exclusivity profile is exceptional due to its chemical composition {{and the use of the}} latest production techniques. Dievar has good heat-checking and gross-cracking resistance as a result of both high toughness and good hot strength. An additional material, a new prehardened tool steel known as TOOLOX 44, exhibits control of the failure described above by optimizing the parameters of impact toughness that could reduce the heat-checking failures. A variety of heat treatment parameters exist for various reasons because the heat treatment operation is performed by a variety of companies. This issue of the diversity in heat treatments is resolved by TOOLOX 44; this steel is quenched and tempered in delivered state...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In present casting industries, product {{development}} paradigm is shifting from traditional trial-and-error to proof-of-concept based on CAE-enabled simulation. In the new production development paradigm, CAE simulation {{plays an important}} role because it models the entire casting process and reveals the dynamic behavior of the casting system in working conditions. In this research, Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) simulation was performed by using the simulation software (AnyCasting) in order to optimize casting design of an automobile part (Upper Oil Pan) which is well known and complicated to achieve a good casting layout.

40|$|Various PVD (physical vapor deposition) hard {{coatings}} including nitrides and metal-doped diamond-like carbons (Me-DLC) were applied in plastic injection and <b>die-casting</b> <b>molds</b> to improve wear resistance and reduce sticking. In this study, nitrides hcp-AlN (hexagonal close-packed AlN), Cr 2 N, (CrAl) 2 N) and Me-DLC (Si-DLC and Cr-DLC) coatings were prepared using a closed field unbalanced magnetron reactive sputtering system. The coatings were annealed in air for 2 h at various temperatures, {{after which the}} anti-sticking properties were assessed using water contact angle (WCA) measurements. The as-deposited hcp-AlN, Cr 2 N and (CrAl) 2 N coatings exhibit hydrophobic behavior and exhibit respective WCAs of 119 °, 106 ° and 101 °. The as-deposited Si-DLC and Cr-DLC coatings exhibit hydrophilic behavior and exhibit respective WCAs of 74 ° and 88 °. The annealed Cr 2 N and (CrAl) 2 N coatings exhibit hydrophobic behavior with higher WCAs, while the annealed hcp-AlN, Si-DLC and Cr-DLC coatings are hydrophilic. The increased WCA of the annealed Cr 2 N and (CrAl) 2 N coatings is related to their crystal structure and increased roughness. The decreased WCA of the annealed hcp-AlN, Si-DLC and Cr-DLC coatings is related to their crystal structures and has little correlation with roughness...|$|R
30|$|Selective laser melting (SLM), {{one of the}} {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) technologies, is able to fabricate complex metal parts with a high density layer by layer from 3 D CAD data [10, 11]. Recently, SLM {{has become one of}} the most promising AM routes for fabricating metal tools and molds due to its ability to create intricate structure, consequently attracted the attention of both industry and academia [12]. Previous researches have successfully used SLM to manufacture conformal cooling channels for injection molds [13], forging dies [14] and <b>die-casting</b> <b>molds</b> [5]. Meantime, many studies investigated the microstructure and mechanical properties of mold steel fabricated by SLM [15 – 22]. Zhao et al. [15, 16] developed a high-dense AISI 420 steel by SLM for injection molds. The hardness and the tensile strength reached 50.7 HRC and 1045  MPa respectively, showing a good potential for practical application. Mertens et al. [18] fabricated an H 13 mold steel by SLM using different powder-bed preheating temperatures to improve hardness and tensile properties. The more homogeneous microstructure and better mechanical properties were obtained at the preheating temperature of 400  °C comparable to those of wrought H 13 counterparts. A TiC-reinforced H 13 steel with enhanced wear resistance was in situ synthesized by SLM [20], which make it very attractive candidate materials for future tooling applications. Except the hardness, mechanical properties and wear resistance that mentioned above, the corrosion resistance is also one of the most important performances that affect the quality of die and mold. Because the injection molds are generally exposed to the acidic environment due to the decomposition of thermoplastics [23]. Nevertheless, to the best of authors’ knowledge, the studies on the corrosion behavior of the SLM samples for molds are limited.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mo 2 FeB 2 boride base cermets {{produced}} by a novel sintering technique, called reaction boronizing sintering through a liquid phase, have excellent mechanical properties and wear and corrosion-resistances. Hence, the cermets are applied to the injection <b>molding</b> <b>die-casting</b> machine parts and so on. Metal injection molding (MIM) is a suitable processing route for the mass production of complex shaped and high performance components. In general, {{it is difficult for}} the liquid phase sintered materials to be applied to the injection molding process because significant shrinkage and deformation occur during sintering. In this study, the MIM process was applied in the production of Mo 2 FeB 2 boride base cermets parts. We investigated that the effect of deoxidization and sintering temperature on mechanical properties and deformation of the cermets. As a result, deoxidization temperature of 1323 K and sintering temperature of 1518 K were suitable. The MIM products of the cermets showed allowable dimensional accuracy and the same mechanical properties as the press-sintered...|$|R
50|$|The largest {{construction}} or workplace utility knives typically feature retractable and replaceable blades, made of either <b>die-cast</b> metal or <b>molded</b> plastic. Some use standard razor blades, others specialized double-ended utility blades. The user can adjust {{how far the}} blade extends from the handle, so that, for example, the knife {{can be used to}} cut the tape sealing a package without damaging the contents of the package. When the blade becomes dull, it can be quickly reversed or switched for a new one. Spare or used blades are stored in the hollow handle of some models, and can be accessed by removing a screw and opening the handle. Other models feature a quick-change mechanism that allows replacing the blade without tools, as well as a flip-out blade storage tray. The blades for this type of utility knife come in both double- and single-ended versions, and are interchangeable with many, but not all, of the later copies. Specialized blades also exist for cutting string, linoleum, and other materials.|$|R
