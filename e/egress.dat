5|$|In 1761, Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov {{observed}} an arc {{of light}} surrounding {{the part of}} Venus off the Sun's disc {{at the beginning of}} the <b>egress</b> phase of the transit and concluded that Venus has an atmosphere. In 1940, Rupert Wildt calculated that the amount of CO2 in the Venusian atmosphere would raise surface temperature above the boiling point for water. This was confirmed when Mariner 2 made radiometer measurements of the temperature in 1962. In 1967, Venera 4 confirmed that the atmosphere consisted primarily of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} <b>egress</b> system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, {{which would have}} left an unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom was found {{not to have any}} of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E
5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM <b>egress</b> and ingress.|$|E
40|$|Potato cultivars Katahdin (susceptible) and Rosa (resistant) {{were exposed}} to infective second-stage juveniles (J 2) of Globodera rostochiensis for varying periods of time, after which root systems were washed and plants were placed in Hoagland's {{solution}} to assess J 2 egression and male emergence. After transfer to liquid culture, many J 2 <b>egressed</b> from both cultivars, but significantly more <b>egressed</b> from the resistant Rosa than from Katahdin. Juveniles that <b>egressed</b> from Rosa invaded a second host, resistant or susceptible, in significantly fewer numbers than did juveniles that <b>egressed</b> from Katahdin. Also, significantly fewer males developed in and emerged from resistant host roots, relative to susceptible ones. These effects of resistance {{may be an important}} component of the tolerance to invasion by G. rostochiensis exhibited by Rosa...|$|R

5|$|Two of {{the chief}} {{architectural}} concerns {{for the design of}} venues for mass audiences are speed of <b>egress</b> and safety. The speed at which the venue can be emptied is important both for amenity and safety because large crowds take a very long time to disperse from a badly designed venue and this in turn creates a safety risk. The Hillsborough disaster {{is an example of how}} poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. Sightlines and acoustics are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.|$|E
5|$|When {{radially}} broaching workpieces {{that require}} a deep cut per tooth, such as forgings or castings, a rotor-cut or jump-cut design can be used; these broaches are also known as free <b>egress</b> or nibbling broaches. In this design the RPT is designated {{to two or three}} rows of teeth. For the broach to work the first tooth of that cluster has a wide notch, or undercut, and then the next tooth has a smaller notch (in a three tooth design) and the final tooth has no notch. This allows for a deep cut while keeping stresses, forces, and power requirements low.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all <b>egress.</b> They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the amphibious {{landings}} depended on {{the establishment of a}} secure lodgement from which to expand the beachhead to allow the buildup of a well-supplied force capable of breaking out. The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, airborne operations were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the <b>egress</b> of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in {{position}} to block Hipper's chosen <b>egress</b> route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began {{to pass through the}} British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50km (31mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and <b>egress</b> from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E

5|$|The organ {{was totally}} reconstructed in 1997 by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn, {{retaining}} the existing instrument {{as far as}} was possible and restoring it largely to its 1895 condition, although the Positive division was kept. The instrument as it now stands has 63 speaking stops over four manuals and pedals, and is built largely on the Werkprinzip principle of organ layout: the case is only one department deep, except for parts of the Pedal sited at the back rather than {{the sides of the}} case. New 75percent tin front pipes were made and the case completed with back, side walls and roof. Pierced panelling executed by Derek Riley of Lyndale Woodcarving in Saxmundham, Suffolk, was provided to allow sound <b>egress</b> {{from the bottom of the}} case. The old console has been retained but thoroughly rebuilt with modern accessories and all-new manuals. Twenty-two of the organ's 83 ranks contain some pipework from the 1868 instrument. Four ranks are made up entirely of 1868 pipework, and 21 contain 1895 pipework. Only two ranks are entirely of 1895. Forty-eight ranks contain some new pipework, 34 of which are entirely new. Old wind pressures have been used wherever possible. The old wind reservoirs have also been restored rather than replaced. The instrument has tracker key action on the manuals, with electrically assisted tracker action to the pedals. The stop action is electric throughout.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{nearing the}} British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers {{split into two}} groups.

40|$|O presente estudo busca {{discutir}} a visão que os empregadores e os egressos dos cursos técnicos na modalidade subsequente do CEFET–BA têm a respeito da inserção desses egressos no mundo do trabalho. Para tanto, este estudo é constituído de duas partes: uma parte teórica que compreende uma incursão histórica, mostrando todas as transformações por que a educação profissional passou durante sua história até chegar aos dias atuais. Ademais, procurou-se discutir como estão as leis que regulamentam essa forma de educação e como ela está sendo oferecida na atualidade no CEFET–BA. A segunda parte compreende a pesquisa empírica e sua análise. Para isso, foi realizada uma entrevista com quatro profissionais das empresas que têm no seu quadro de funcionários egressos da instituição e aplicado um questionário com os alunos egressos, que se formaram nos anos de 2005 e 2006, de quatro cursos da modalidade subsequente, selecionados para esta pesquisa. Os dados foram analisados de forma quantitativa e qualitativa, cujos resultados são apresentados no decorrer dos capítulos. Por fim, pôde-se verificar que os egressos do CEFET– BA são reconhecidos no mercado de trabalho pela qualidade de sua formação profissional, mesmo que esta não consiga superar o desafio de aliar teoria e prática; em outras palavras, conciliar a formação técnica com as necessidades do mundo do trabalho. _________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{present study}} it searchs {{to argue the}} vision that the employers and the <b>egresses</b> of the technician courses in the subsequent modality of the CEFETBA have about the insertion of these <b>egresses</b> {{in the world of}} the work.

40|$|Accepté pour publication. International audienceWe {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of pedestrian evacuations through a narrow doorway by means of controlled experiments. The influence of the pedestrians' behaviours is investigated by prescribing a selfish attitude to a fraction c_s of the participants, while the others behave politely. Thanks to an original setup enabling the re-injection of <b>egressed</b> participants into the room, the analysis is conducted in a (macroscopically) quasi-stationary regime. We find that, as c_s is increased, the flow rate J rises, interpolating between published values for <b>egresses</b> in normal conditions and measurements for competitive evacuations. The dependence of several flow properties on the pedestrian density ρ at the door, independently of c_s, suggests that macroscopically the behavioural aspects could be subsumed under the density, at least in our specific settings with limited crowd pressure. In particular, under these conditions, J grows monotonically with ρ up to " close-packing " (ρ ≈ 9 pers/m²). The flow is then characterised microscopically. Among other quantities, the time lapses between successive escapes, the pedestrians' waiting times {{in front of the}} door, and their angles of incidence are analysed statistically. In a nutshell, our main results show that the flow is orderly for polite crowds, with narrowly distributed time lapses between <b>egresses,</b> while for larger c_s the flow gets disorderly and vanishing time lapses emerge. For all c_s, we find an alternation between short and long time lapses, which we ascribe to a generalised zipper effect. The average waiting time in the exit zone increases with its occupancy. The disorder in the flow and the pressure felt by participants are also assessed...|$|R

40|$|Today’s Internet {{users and}} {{applications}} are placing increased demands on Internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver fine-grained, flexible route control. To assist network operators in addressing this challenge, we present the Intelligent Route Service Control Point (IRSCP), a route control architecture {{that allows a}} network operator to flexibly control routing between the traffic ingresses and <b>egresses</b> within an ISP’s network, without modifying the ISP’s existing routers. In essence, IRSCP subsumes the control plane of an ISP’s network by replacing the distributed BGP decision process of each router in the network with a more flexible, logically centralized, application-controlled route computation. IRSCP supplements the traditional BGP decision process with an explicitly ranked decision process that allows route control applications to provide a per-destination, per-router explicit ranking of traffic <b>egresses.</b> We describe our implementation of IRSCP {{as well as a}} straightforward set of correctness requirements that prevents routing anomalies. To illustrate the potential of application-controlled route selection, we use our IRSCP prototype to implement a simple form of dynamic customer-traffic load balancing, and demonstrate through emulation that our implementation is scalable. ...|$|R
