5|$|Electricity {{generation}} in Flagstaff {{is provided by}} Arizona Public Service, an electric utility subsidiary operated by parent company Pinnacle West. The primary <b>generating</b> <b>station</b> near Flagstaff is the coal-fired, 995-MW Cholla Power Plant, near Holbrook, Arizona, which uses coal from the McKinley Mine in New Mexico. Located near Page, Arizona is the coal-fired, 750-MW Navajo Power Plant, supplied by an electric railroad that delivers coal from a mine on the Navajo and Hopi reservations in northern Arizona. Flagstaff {{is also home to}} Arizona's first commercial solar power <b>generating</b> <b>station,</b> which was built in 1997 and provides 87kW of electricity.

5|$|Several {{manufacturing}} complexes {{have been}} erected along the bay, which employ local residents. The Aluminum Company of America, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics all established plants in Point Comfort. The South Texas Nuclear <b>Generating</b> <b>Station</b> {{is found in}} nearby Bay City. Petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the bay in the 1930s.

In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.|$|E
5|$|In September 1942 {{men from}} No. 2 Commando {{took part in}} Operation Musketoon, a raid against the Glomfjord {{hydroelectric}} power plant. The Commandos were landed by submarine and succeeded in blowing up some pipelines, turbines, and tunnels. This effectively destroyed the <b>generating</b> <b>station</b> and the aluminium plant was shut down permanently. One Commando {{was killed in the}} raid and another seven were captured while trying to escape. They spent a short time at Colditz Castle before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Shortly after their arrival at Sachsenhausen they were executed. They were the first victims of the secret Commando Order, which mandated the execution of all captured Commandos. The three remaining Commandos managed to reach Sweden and were eventually returned to No. 2 Commando.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the electrical {{supply to the}} line and stations would be provided by a dedicated <b>generating</b> <b>station</b> at St George's Road, Southwark. This idea was abandoned in 1902 and electricity was instead provided by Lots Road Power Station, operated by the UERL. Six ventilation fans were installed along the line to draw 18,500 cubic feet per minute through the tunnels and out through exhausts placed {{on the roof of}} the stations. Fresh air was drawn back down from the surface via the lift and staircase shafts, thus replenishing the air in the tunnels. To reduce the risk of fire, the station platforms were built of concrete and iron and the sleepers were made from the fireproof Australian wood Eucalyptus marginata or jarrah.|$|E

5|$|Perks {{was also}} a large {{shareholder}} in Yerkes' next target, the Metropolitan District Railway, usually known as the District Railway or DR. By March 1901, the syndicate had acquired a controlling interest in the DR and made a proposal for its electrification. Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company (MDETC) on 15 July 1901 with himself as managing director. The company raised £1million (£ today) {{to carry out the}} electrification works including the construction of the <b>generating</b> <b>station</b> and supplying the new electric rolling stock.

A large commercial project titled Colony Place located near the Industrial Park was completed in late 2007. It consists of several large retail stores, various chain restaurants, and contains {{one of the largest}} outdoor designer outlet malls in the South Shore. Another large retail development that has recently finished construction off Route 3's exit 5 is The Shops at 5.

A single plant named Sainte-Marguerite-3 is located to the east on the Sainte-Marguerite River. The facilities located in the region were constructed {{over a period of}} five decades, from 1956 to 2005. The total generation capacity from these power stations is 10,500MW.

5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a <b>generating</b> <b>station</b> and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
