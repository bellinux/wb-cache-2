40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the market reaction and the differences between high-earning quality and low-earnings quality. And also analyze the market reaction and the differences between income smoothing and non-income smoothing. This issue is crucial to <b>be</b> analyzed because <b>earnings</b> <b>is</b> the most important thing in the financial statement. In another word, <b>earnings</b> <b>is</b> the one of the potential information for the internal and external users. The proxy of the market reaction in this study is abnormal return. Whereas, <b>earnings</b> quality <b>is</b> measured by higher (lower) transitory earnings. If the transitory <b>earnings</b> <b>is</b> high, we can say that <b>earnings</b> quality <b>is</b> low. On the other hand, if transitory <b>earnings</b> <b>is</b> low, we can say that <b>earnings</b> quality <b>is</b> high. Income smoothing in this study is measured with index Eckel. This study applies Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). This study hypothesis: First, the market reaction for high <b>earnings</b> quality <b>is</b> bigger than the market reaction for low earnings quality. Second, there is a significant difference between the market reaction at high earnings quality and low earnings quality.

40|$|Prior {{research}} has demonstrated higher value relevance of current earnings during economic expansions relative to contractions.

The subsequent military regime and BNP and Jatiya Party governments restored free markets and promoted the country's private sector. In 1991, finance minister Saifur Rahman introduced a programme of economic liberalization. The Bangladeshi private sector has rapidly expanded, with a number of conglomerates driving the economy. Major industries include textiles, pharmaceuticals, shipbuilding, steel, electronics, energy, construction materials, chemicals, ceramics, food processing and leather goods. Export-oriented industrialization has increased, with fiscal year 2014–15 exports of $30 billion. Most export <b>earnings</b> <b>are</b> from the garment-manufacturing industry.

25|$|Similarly, a study (2000) {{conducted}} by economic experts Claudia Goldin from Harvard University and Cecilia Rouse from Princeton University shows that when evaluators of applicants {{could see the}} applicant's gender {{they were more likely}} to select men. When the applicants gender could not be observed, the number of women hired significantly increased. David Neumark, a Professor of Economics at the University of California, Irvine, and colleagues (1996) found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against women in hiring. In an audit study, matched pairs of male and female pseudo-job seekers were given identical résumés and sent to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses at the same set of restaurants. In high priced restaurants, a female applicant's probability of getting an interview was 35 percentage points lower than a male's and her probability of getting a job offer was 40 percentage points lower. Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination. According to Neumark, these hiring patterns appear to have implications for sex differences in earnings, as informal survey evidence indicates that <b>earnings</b> <b>are</b> higher in high-price restaurants.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral health {{disorders}} are {{prevalent in the}} United States, but accessing treatment can be challenging. Nearly 1 in 5 adults experience a mental health condition for which approximately only 43% received treatment. When asked about access to mental health treatment, two-thirds of primary care physicians {{reported that they were}} unable to secure outpatient mental health treatment for their patients. This is due, in part, to the workforce shortage in behavioral health. In rural areas, 55% of US counties have no practicing psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Overall, 77% of counties have a severe shortage of mental health workers and 96% of counties had some unmet need. Some {{of the reasons for the}} workforce shortage include high turnover rates, high stress position, and inadequate compensation. Annual turnover rate is 33% for clinicians and 23% for clinical supervisors. This is compared to an annual PCP turnover rate of 7.1%. Compensation in behavioral health field is notably low. The average licensed clinical social worker, a degree that requires master's degree and 2000 hours post graduate experience, earns $45,000/year on average. As a point of reference, the average physical therapist earns $75,000/year on average. Substance abuse counselor <b>earnings</b> <b>are</b> even lower, with an average salary of $34,000/year. Job stress is another factor that may lead to the high turnover rates and workforce shortage. It is estimated that 21-67% of mental health workers experience high levels of burnout including symptoms of emotional exhaustion, high levels of depersonalization and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment. Researchers have offered various recommendations to reduce the critical workforce gaps in behavioral health. Some of these recommendations include the following: expanding loan repayment programs to incentivize mental health providers to serve in underserved (often rural) areas, integrating mental health into primary care, and increasing reimbursement to health care professionals.|$|E
