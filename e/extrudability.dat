40|$|<b>Extrudability</b> of {{aluminum}} alloys of the 6 xxx series is {{highly dependent on}} the microstructure of the homogenized billets. It is therefore very important to characterize quantitatively the state of homogenization of the as-cast billets. The quantification of the homogenization state {{was based on the}} measurement of specific microstructural indices, which describe {{the size and shape of}} the intermetallics and indicate the state of homogenization. The indices evaluated were the following: aspect ratio (AR), which is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum diameter of the particles, feret (F), which is the maximum caliper length, and circularity (C), which is a measure of how closely a particle resembles a circle in a 2 D metallographic section. The method included extensive metallographic work and the measurement of a large number of particles, including a statistical analysis, in order to investigate the effect of homogenization time. Among the indices examined, the circularity index exhibited the most consistent variation with homogenization time. The lowest value of the circularity index coincided with the metallographic observation for necklace formation. Shorter homogenization times resulted in intermediate homogenization stages involving rounding of edges or particle pinching.

The application of the carboxymethyl starches as alternative pharmaceutical gelling agents for topical delivery of drugs was also investigated. Accordingly, nine different topical gel formulations of ibuprofen were prepared. All formulations were evaluated with respect to cosmetic qualities, pH, drug content, viscosity, spreadability, <b>extrudability,</b> in vitro drug release, anti-inflammatory activity and stability.

Experimentation {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of extrusion temperature and extrusion rate on <b>extrudability</b> and product performance. Structure studies were carried out to explain variations in mechanical properties. Experimental extrusion limit diagrams for Al-Li-Cu and Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloys showed that the addition of magnesium lowered the working range by increasing the flow stress and enhancing the onset of incipient melting and surface tearing, particularly at the higher alloying levels. Plant trials were conducted with 2090 alloy. The <b>extrudability</b> of this alloy was more similar to 6061 alloy from the standpoints of press effort and run out speed than to the conventional 2 XXX and 7 XXX aircraft alloys. The mechanical properties of the extrusions were a function of microstructure and test direction. High longitudinal ultimate tensile and yield strength (> 600 MPa) and good toughness were obtained in the peak strength condition when the extrusions had fibrous, elongated grains. Transverse strengths and toughness were substantially lower. Material with a more recrystallized, equiaxed grain structure showed less variation with test direction, but significantly lower strengths were obtained. It was concluded that 2090, 8090 and 8091 alloys can be extruded using conventional equipment and methods. Alloy 2090 is easier to extrude than the Mg-bearing compositions.

In the near term, light weighting of vehicles through the use of high strength aluminum alloys is one solution to improve fuel efficiency. This research was performed to help understand the <b>extrudability</b> of some Al-Mg-Si alloys as well as the effect of extrusion conditions on final mechanical properties. The alloys studied were designed by General Motors (GM) and include variations in the Mg, Si and Cr contents. The research is primarily experimental in nature and consisted of measuring and modelling the hot flow stress behaviour of these alloys, performing both laboratory scale and industrial extrusion trials as well as mechanical and microstructural characterization of the extruded materials. 	The well-known Sellars-Tegart model was applied in development of constitutive equations for predicting the hot flow stress behavior of Al-Mg-Si alloys. The influence of hold time on Mg-Si solute content level during pre-deformation heating of an as-cast and homogenized Al-Mg-Si alloy was determined and the Mg-Si solute content (X) integrated into a constitutive equation for predicting the alloy’s flow stress behavior during hot compression testing. The constitutive model predictions were observed to agree well with experimental data for the aluminum alloys tested in this research. 	The effect of extrusion processing condition, alloy composition and aging time on the <b>extrudability,</b> mechanical properties and fracture morphology as well as microstructure of Al-Mg-Si alloys was studied. The <b>extrudability</b> of the Al-Mg-Si alloys was observed to reduce with an increase in the Mg-Si content, presence of 0. 2 wt % Cr and reduction in extrusion temperature. For laboratory extrusion trials, peripheral coarse grains were not observed in alloys containing Cr and Mn. The strength property in the T 4, T 5 and T 6 conditions was observed to increase with Mg-Si content while 0. 2 wt % Cr addition favors improved ductility. The alloys containing Cr were observed to exhibit ductile dimple fracture and a transgranular morphology while an intergranular fracture was observed in the Al-Mg-Si alloys with no Cr content. The strain rate sensitivity and anisotropic behaviors of an Al-Mg-Si alloy were determined by performing quasi-static tensile test at 0. 001, 0. 01 and 0. 1 s- 1 on heat treated (T 4 and T 6) profiles extruded in industrial scale extrusion equipment. The T 4 alloy samples were observed to exhibit reduced anisotropic behavior in comparison with T 6 samples. 	In this thesis, a more effective constitutive model for predicting the hot flow stress behavior of Al-Mg-Si alloys has been developed. The developed constitutive relation can be an effective tool for modeling forming processes such as extrusion and rolling, Also, a systematic through process (from extrusion processing to aging) investigation of the effect of alloy composition, extrusion and aging conditions on the final mechanical properties of Al-Mg-Si alloys has been performed...|$|E
