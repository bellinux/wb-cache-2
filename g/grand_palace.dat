5|$|In 1982, on {{the bicentennial}} anniversary {{year of the}} {{founding}} of Bangkok and the building of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace,</b> the building was selected as the site of a new museum. It was established at the instigation of Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn to hold certain architectural elements, which had to be replaced; various artefacts and Buddha images that were donated to the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> by the general public.|$|E
5|$|Today the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> {{is still}} a centre of {{ceremony}} and of the monarchy, {{and serves as a}} museum and tourist attraction as well.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s {{a series}} of new palaces were {{constructed}} elsewhere for the king's use; these included the more modern Dusit Palace, constructed in 1903, and Phaya Thai Palace in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual {{move out of the}} palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> to their own premises. Despite this the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy.|$|E

5|$|The Phra Maha Monthien (พระมหามณเฑียร) {{group of}} {{buildings}} are located roughly at {{the centre of the}} Middle Court, therefore {{at the very heart of}} the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> itself. The traditional Thai style building group is enclosed by a low wall, as this was once the residential and sleeping abode of kings. Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace.</b> All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls in the middle and residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> was both the country's administrative and religious centre. As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers and courtiers. The palace's high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> {{followed}} that of the Royal Palace at Ayutthaya in location, organization, and in the divisions of separate courts, walls, gates and forts. Both palaces featured a proximity to the river. The location of a pavilion serving as a landing stage for barge processions also corresponded {{with that of the}} old palace. To the north of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> there is a large field, the Thung Phra Men (now called Sanam Luang), which is used as an open space for royal ceremonies and as a parade ground. There was also a similar field in Ayutthaya, which was used for the same purpose. The road running north leads to the Front Palace, the residence of the Second King of Siam.|$|E

5|$|In shape, {{the palace}} complex is roughly {{rectangular}} {{and has a}} combined area of , surrounded by four walls. It is situated {{on the banks of}} the Chao Phraya River at the heart of the Rattanakosin Island, today in the Phra Nakhon District. The <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> is bordered by Sanam Luang and Na Phra Lan Road to the north, Maharaj Road to the west, Sanamchai Road to the east and Thai Wang Road to the south.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Maha Prasat (พระมหาปราสาท) {{group is}} {{situated}} on the westernmost part of the Middle Court. The main buildings within this area dates from the reign of King Rama I and contains some of the oldest existing edifice within the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace.</b> The entire throne hall group is contained within a walled and paved courtyard. Similarly {{to the other two}} groups, the Maha Prasat buildings were built, embellished and refurbished over successive reigns. The building formed a single axis from north to south, with the public throne hall to the front and residential halls behind. Surrounding them are lesser functional halls and pavilion for used by the king and his court.|$|E

5|$|The temple is {{surrounded}} on four sides {{by a series}} of walled cloisters, with seven different gates. Like those ancient royal temples of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya, the Wat Phra Kaew complex is separated from the living quarters of the kings. Within these walls are buildings and structures for diverse purposes and of differing styles, reflecting the changing architecture during the various reigns of the kings. Despite this, most of the buildings within adhere strictly to classical Thai architecture. The establishment of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha dates to the very founding of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> and Bangkok itself.|$|E
5|$|After {{a trip to}} Singapore and Java, in the East Indies (present day Indonesia) in 1875, King Rama V {{brought back}} with him two Englishmen, the {{architect}} John Clunich and his helper Henry C. Rose to design and construct the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall. Construction began on the 7 May 1876. At first the King wanted an entirely European structure with domes. However {{at the insistence of}} Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse (Chuang Bunnag), his Chief Minister, the King decided to add the gilded spires and Thai roofs. In 1878 the King personally supervised the raising of the final central spire of the building. The throne hall was completed in 1882, on the centenary of the House of Chakri and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace.</b> Thus the new throne hall was given the name Phra Thinang Chakri, meaning literally 'the seat of the Chakris'.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{significant}} easing of the closure policy in 2010, {{the economy of}} Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels {{during the height of}} the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace,</b> Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel. Upmarket hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, Thutob Namgyal, the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, {{shifted the}} capital from Tumlong to Gangtok, {{increasing}} the city's importance. A new <b>grand</b> <b>palace</b> {{along with other}} state buildings {{was built in the}} new capital. Following India's independence in 1947, Sikkim became a nation-state with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and Jelepla passes, offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business. The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.|$|E

5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace</b> {{is one of}} the {{historical}} attractions in the city, and is an example of Victorian-style architecture with a garden. Figure Museum is another historical colonial building since 1886 which ever become the house for the Johor first Menteri Besar Jaafar Mohamed; it is located on the top of Smile Hill (Bukit Senyum) overlooking the Johor Straits. The English College (now Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar) established in 1914 was located close to the Sungai Chat Palace before being moved to its present location at Sungai Chat Road; some of the ruins are visible at the old site. The Sultan Ibrahim Building is another historical building in the city; built in 1936 by British architect Palmer and Turner, it was the centre of the administration of Johor as since the relocation from Telok Blangah in Singapore, the Johor government never had its own building. Before the current railway station was built, there was Johor Bahru railway station (formerly Wooden Railway) which has now been turned into a museum after serving for 100 years since the British colonial era.|$|E
5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material in Han architecture. It was used for <b>grand</b> <b>palace</b> halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, {{as well as the}} often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and rammed earth walls (including aboveground city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era rammed earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.|$|E
5|$|When King Rama V {{ascended the}} throne in 1868, {{he decided to}} build a new group of grander throne halls to replace the old structures. The first phase of {{construction}} began in 1868, then again in 1876, and the final phase between 1882 and 1887. King Rama V resided in the palace until 1910 when he gradually moved to the new Dusit Palace, {{to the north of the}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Palace.</b> King Rama VI occasionally stayed in the palace; however he preferred his other residences in the country. By the reign of King Rama VII the buildings were in dire need of renovations, but due to economic constraints only the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall was renovated. This work was carried out by Prince Itthithepsan Kritakara, an architectural graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Many of his works can still be seen today. During the reign of King Rama IX many of the buildings once more became so dilapidated that they needed to be demolished altogether. In their stead new halls were constructed in 2004 to replace them.|$|E
