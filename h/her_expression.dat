25|$|The 1900 {{portrait}} depicts Williams {{from the}} left side. She is wearing a black dress with red stripes, a pair of red ribbon bowties, and a red ribbon around her neck. Williams's hair is worn down, set against a dark brown background. Her cheek is slightly sunken. <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> is much softer, virtually inscrutable. The portrait was originally painted on a 24 x 20inch canvas. Eakins cut two inches off the right side, and tacked it to a new stretcher. This {{had the effect of}} re-centering the work on Williams's face.|$|E
25|$|The letter {{shown in}} her right hand {{contains}} a demand from David for her to choose between fidelity to her husband or obedience to her king, and is an anecdotal catalyst for her introspection. In representing this moment, Rembrandt extrapolated from the biblical text, which treated Bathsheba incidentally while focusing on David's sinfulness. As a result, <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> is profound enough to suggest not only her sense of resignation, but the broader narrative as well. As a conception of the nude figure suffused with complexity of thought, Bathsheba at Her Bath is nearly unique in art.|$|E
25|$|Emi is an energetic, extroverted blonde {{girl with}} twintails and forest-green eyes. She has {{prosthetic}} legs, having had her original legs amputated below the knees {{as a result}} of a car accident. Despite her disability, she still has more than enough lower body strength to walk, and in fact she is a successful track runner. She values good diet and exercise, and is on friendly terms with the head nurse of Yamaku; she promises to keep tabs on Hisao's exercise in exchange for having him as a running partner. Indeed, she meets Hisao by literally running into him in the hallway, and ironically endangers his heart on more than one occasion. Hisao feels guilty whenever she pouts, equating <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> to that of a sad puppy. Emi is Rin's friend and hall mate due to both having extremely passionate vocations and complementary disabilities. However, she has trouble getting emotionally close to people, because she is afraid of losing people important to her.|$|E

25|$|Some {{art historians}} once {{identified}} {{the child as}} a young Cosimo I de' Medici, but it is now generally accepted to be Giulia. The child in the portrait {{appears to be a}} little girl, rather than a boy, and <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> is anxious. Maria Salviati, who is dressed soberly as befitted a widow, is seen sheltering the vulnerable child against her side. Art historian Gabrielle Langdon argues that the girl's demeanor in the portrait is different than would have been expected for the child Cosimo, whose family anticipated his role as a strong leader from his earliest days. It would have been to Cosimo I's advantage to commission a portrait depicting his mother as an exemplary widow, affectionately bringing up the orphaned daughter of Cosimo I's predecessor. The child's full lips, round nose, and curly reddish hair also bear little resemblance to known portraits of Cosimo as a child, though they do to portraits of the young Alessandro. Other girls of about the right age who were at court during this period also do not resemble the child in the portrait. The portrait might {{be one of the first}} in Renaissance-era Europe of a girl of presumed African and European ancestry. This painting is in the permanent collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{had more}} than the {{ordinary}} intellectual endowment; bold, striking, and original in her conceptions, and of singular facility and clearness in <b>her</b> <b>expression.</b> She was educated from early life to disbelieve in the capacity or general intelligence of the masses for efficient self-government. All her prejudices were nurtured {{in favor of the}} British Constitution as developed by Magna Charta, and administered by a king and ministers responsible to the nation; which form of government she believed to be above all comparison the best in the world. Yet, in spite of all these deeply-rooted prejudices, with a grasp of thought that could look at and examine questions of inherent right, on their original basis—with the abiding principles of the Christian faith to serve as a guide in judging of human duty in governments, and with the daily recurring practical examples of the conflicts of opinion between the Colonies and the mother country, which the American Revolution presented, she saw and acknowledged the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies—the justice of that cause in which they had, at length, banded for a higher measure of liberty, and the growing capacity of the people to maintain those rights. She was thus made an intellectual convert to the doctrines of the Revolution, and became a most useful and capable counsellor to Allen, in the subsequent critical periods of his life. Her mind was, indeed, a counterpart, in its boldness and originality, to that of her husband, whose intuitive mode of reaching conclusions enabled him to put into the shape of acts, what it might have sorely puzzled him sometimes to reason out; and what, indeed, if he could have reasoned ever so well, his bold and fiery zeal, and crushing rapidity of action, put him out of all temper to submit to the slow process of ratiocination. He also felt the happy influences of manners, opinions, and sentiments at once dignified and frank, yet mild and persuasive.|$|E
500|$|Bleecker's {{writing was}} {{exciting}} for the time, and {{her sense of}} style added dimension to {{a new type of}} novel, the didactic novel. <b>Her</b> <b>expression</b> was influenced by the [...] "eighteenth-century British cult of sensibility". She wrote in a mannered, and often exaggerated way, to express her moral lesson. In addition, she used the epistolic literary device, structuring the story as a series of letters to her half-sister, Susan Ten Eyck, in which she interrupted the narrative to comment on the action and address Susan directly.|$|E

500|$|The {{covers of}} The Nancy Drew Files and Girl Detective series {{represent}} further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy. The Nancy portrayed {{on the covers}} of The Nancy Drew Files is [...] "a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> is mischievous." [...] In the Girl Detective series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip {{across the top of the}} cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent of her eyes. The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of The Secret of the Old Clock.|$|E
500|$|Her eyes gaze {{downward}} in humility, {{in contrast}} to her relatively extravagant clothes. The piety of <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> is achieved through motifs common to van der Weyden's work. Her eyes and nose are elongated and her lower lip made fuller {{by the use of}} tone and pronounced finish. Some vertical lines around these features are emphasised, while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised. In addition the contours of her face are highlighted {{in a manner that is}} slightly unnatural and abstract, and outside the usual spatial constraints of 15th-century human representation. This methodology was described by art historian Erwin Panofsky: [...] "Rogier concentrated on certain salient features—salient both from a physiognomical and psychological point of view—which he expressed primarily by lines." [...] Her high forehead and full mouth have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual, ascetic, and passionate, symbolic of [...] "an unresolved conflict in her personality". Panofsky refers to a [...] "smouldering excitability".|$|E
500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in <b>her</b> <b>expression,</b> so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We have {{recently}} described {{the correlation between}} quantitative measures of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> or <b>HER</b> 2 homodimers by the HERmark assay and objective response (RR), time-to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS) in an expanded access cohort of trastuzumab-treated HER 2 -positive patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who were stringently selected by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). Multivariate analyses suggested a continuum of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> that correlated with outcome following trastuzumab. Here we investigate the relationship between <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> or <b>HER</b> 2 homodimers and OS in a clinic-based population of patients with MBC selected primarily by IHC. Methods HERmark, a proximity-based assay designed to detect and quantitate protein expression and dimerization in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, was used to measure <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> and <b>HER</b> 2 homodimers in FFPE samples from patients with MBC. Assay results were correlated with OS using univariate Kaplan-Meier, hazard function plots, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results Initial analyses revealed a parabolic relationship between continuous measures of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> and risk of death, suggesting that the assumption of linearity for the <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> measurements may be inappropriate in subsequent multivariate analyses. Cox regression analyses using the categorized variable of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> level demonstrated that higher HER 2 levels predicted better survival outcomes following trastuzumab treatment in the high HER 2 -expressing group. Conclusions These data suggest that the quantitative amount of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> measured by Hermark may be a new useful marker to identify a more relevant target population for trastuzumab treatment in patients with MBC. </p...|$|R
50|$|Criticism of Rachel Ray's {{show has}} been levied despite its successes. Ray had no formal cooking experience, leading to {{complaints}} about the appearance of her food.

2500|$|Many {{art historians}} have {{considered}} the painting one of Vermeer's less successful works. Cant, for instance, calls it [...] "harder, more brittle, less convincing.

2500|$|The 1899 {{portrait}} of Williams depicts her wearing a pleated black {{dress with a}} high white collar. Her hair is in a tight bun, set against a dark brown background.

5000|$|On December 2, 1929, The New York Times called [...] "Pandora's Box...a {{disconnected}} melodrama ...with a seldom interesting" [...] narrative.

60|$|There was an energy, a self-possession, an {{abandonment}} in {{her voice}} and manner, a total resignation of herself to his generosity, which, together with the kindness of <b>her</b> <b>expressions</b> to himself, moved him deeply.

30|$|Although <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> is {{routinely}} determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) [4], technical problems can arise when lesions are not easily accessible by core needle biopsy [5]. In addition, <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> can vary {{during the course of the}} disease [6] and even among tumor lesions in the same patient [7]. To overcome these problems, a novel molecular imaging technique using positron emission tomography (PET) with 124 I-, 89 Zr-, or 64 Cu-labeled antibodies has been studied for the noninvasive evaluation of <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> [8 - 10].|$|R
2500|$|The {{woman in}} Mare ni Au Koi ( [...] , [...] "love that rarely meets") appears quite young and sheltered; she is {{probably}} in her teens. [...] She wears an ornate kushi-kanzashi comb-shaped hairpin and bashfully sticks her fingers just barely from {{the sleeve of}} her kimono. [...] The title refers not to a woman who rarely meets her lover, but to a shy young woman inexperienced in love, and <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> is the most withdrawn in the series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} squealed {{with delight}} as her hands kept {{time with the}} music.

Her eyes mournfully contemplated the cross during the hymn. As the people sang the [...] "Ave Maris Stella," [...] the cross vanished and her smile returned, though {{with a touch of}} melancholy. Two small white crosses then appeared on her shoulders before Our Lady disappeared behind a cloud. As the night prayers came to a close, the apparition ended. It was about nine o'clock. The Apparition had lasted about three hours.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Shelley's early {{journals}} record {{several times}} when Clairmont and Shelley shared visions of Gothic horror and let their imaginings take flight, stirring each others' emotions {{to the point}} of hysteria and nightmares. In October 1814, Shelley deliberately frightened Clairmont by assuming a particularly sinister and horrifying facial expression. [...] "How horribly you look... Take your eyes off!" [...] she cried. She was put to bed after yet another of her [...] "horrors". Shelley described <b>her</b> <b>expression</b> to Mary as [...] "distorted most unnaturally by horrible dismay". In the autumn of 1814, Clairmont and Shelley also discussed forming [...] "an association of philosophical people" [...] and Clairmont's conception of an idealized community in which women were the ones in charge.|$|E
60|$|I think, however, myself, {{and with}} all my admiration for Miss Martineau, that her {{statement}} and her reasonings on it are not free from vagueness and apparent contradictions.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> and its {{correlation with}} clinicopathological variables between proximal and distal gastric cancers (GC) in the Chinese population. METHODS: Immunostaining of HER 2 was performed and {{scored on a}} scale of 0 - 3 in 957 consecutive GC cases, according to the revised scoring criteria of HercepTestTM as used in the ToGA trial. Correlations between <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> and clinicopathologic variables of proximal (n = 513) and distal (n = 444) GC were investigated. RESULTS: Our results showed that <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> was significantly higher in the proximal than in distal GC (P < 0. 05). Overall, <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> was significantly higher in male patients (P < 0. 01), the Lauren intestinal type (P < 0. 001), low-grade (P < 0. 001) and pM 1 (P < 0. 01) diseases, respectively. There was a significant difference in <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> among some pTNM stages (P < 0. 05). In contrast, <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> in the distal GC was significantly higher in male patients (P < 0. 001), low-grade histology (P < 0. 001), the Lauren intestinal typeÿ 08;P < 0. 001), and pM 1 (P < 0. 001). In the proximal GC, however, higher <b>HER</b> 2 <b>expression</b> scores were observed only in tumors with low-grade histology (P < 0. 001) and the Lauren intestinal type (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSION: HER 2 over-expression in GC of Chinese patients was significantly more common in proximal than in distal GC, and significantly correlated with the Lauren intestinal type and low-grade histology in both proximal and distal GC, and with pM 1 disease and male gender in distal GC...|$|R
2500|$|Morales {{argues that}} [...] "...Tarantino manages to do {{precisely}} what Alex de Large {{was trying to}} do in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange: he presents violence as a form of expressive art......violence is so physically graceful, visually dazzling and meticulously executed that our instinctual, emotional responses undermine any rational objections we may have.

2500|$|Film {{historian}} Jeffrey Vance {{said that}} Garbo communicated her characters' innermost feelings through her movement, gestures, and most importantly, her eyes. With the slightest movement of them, he argues, she subtly conveyed complex attitudes and feelings toward other characters {{and the truth}} of the situation. [...] "She doesn't act," [...] said Camille co-star Rex O’Malley; [...] "she lives her roles." [...] Director Clarence Brown, who made seven of Garbo's pictures, told an interviewer [...] "Garbo has something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up.
