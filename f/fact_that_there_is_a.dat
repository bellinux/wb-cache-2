The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually had been much larger than previously thought.|$|E

However, sankharas {{in the sense of}} constructed consciousness, which exists as a 'karmically-resultant-consciousness' (vipāka viññāna), continue to exist.

She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E
25|$|Shallow water {{blackout}} – {{caused by}} hyperventilation prior to swimming or diving. The primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. The body detects CO2 levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing. Hyperventilation reduces the carbon dioxide content of the blood but leaves the diver susceptible to sudden loss of consciousness without warning from hypoxia. There is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout, and victims (often capable swimmers swimming under the surface in shallow water) become unconscious and drown quietly without alerting anyone to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> problem; they are typically found on the bottom.|$|E

Even Jack Thornton, an active, go-ahead young businessman, is interested in the professor's home, but although he tries to pretend it is Egyptology which interests him, the professor's fair young daughter is really the lodestone. Jack decides to win the old man's respect by posing as an Egyptologist himself. To start his collection, he purchases a mummy at an auction sale, and takes it home expecting that later he can make a great hit with his sweetheart's father, by presenting it to him as a gift. While the mummy is in Jack's room, a live electric wire is by accident brought in contact with it. The body has been so perfectly mummified, that the electric current is all that is necessary to ignite the vital spark, and Jack is amazed to see dancing forth from the case which he thought contained only unattractive rags and bones, a beautiful Egyptian princess. As soon as she is released, the mummy makes violent love to Jack, and causes his sweetheart to quarrel with him (for how can a plain businessman explain the presence in his room of a beautiful barbarian?). When her love is spurned, the visitor from the distant past avenges herself by having Jack made into a mummy and placed in the case in her stead. Her heart relents, however, in time to save him from being 'cut up' by the professor, who with the sharp knife, starts to investigate the contents of the mummy case. But all ends happily when Jack's plain statements of the seemingly impossible facts are proved true by the professor. Jack is reunited to his sweetheart, and the professor, being a widower, also an ardent admirer of everything antique, leads the recreated Egyptian lady to the altar, in spite of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> difference of several thousand years in their ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sexually speaking, {{the same}} 2006 study by Nordling et al. found that gay males {{were aware of}} their S/M {{preferences}} and took part in them at an earlier age, preferring leather, anal sex, rimming, dildos and special equipment or uniform scenes. In contrast, straight men preferred verbal humiliation, mask and blindfolds, gags, rubber/latex outfits, caning, vaginal sex, and cross-dressing among other activities. From the questionnaire, researchers {{were able to identify}} four separate sexual themes: hyper-masculinity, giving and receiving pain, physical restriction (i.e. bondage), and psychological humiliation. Gay men preferred activities that tended towards hyper-masculinity while straight men showed greater preference for humiliation. Though there were not enough female respondents to draw a similar conclusion with, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> difference in gay and straight men suggests strongly that S/M (and BDSM in general) can not be considered a homogenous phenomenon.

2500|$|SRI International is {{discussed}} at length in patent attorney Eric Guttag's treatise Applying the Printed Publication Bar in the Internet Age. Guttag argues that SRI International {{has contributed to}} a growing confusion about whether electronic documents should be considered printed publications due to the Federal Circuit's conflation between the [...] "dissemination" [...] of a document and whether the document is publicly accessible, as in the [...] "library/thesis" [...] cases. Guttag is {{highly critical of the}} majority opinion's decision to simply cite In Re Bayer and In Re Klopfenstein without any real analysis and agrees that Judge Moore's much more careful analysis of the factors enunciated in In Re Klopfenstein are hard to overcome. Guttag concludes, however, that the simple <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disagreement between Moore and the majority is sufficient to support the majority's assertion that there are issues of material fact in the case and that summary judgment of invalidity is inappropriate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to skyglow, light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube {{of the telescope}} and is reflected from non-optical surfaces until it eventually reaches the eyepiece. This direct form of light pollution causes a glow across {{the field of view}} which reduces contrast. Light trespass also makes it hard for a visual observer to become sufficiently dark adapted. The usual measures to reduce this glare, if reducing the light directly is not an option, include flocking the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection, and putting a light shield (also usable as a dew shield) on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target. Under these conditions, some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum dark adaptation. In one Italian regional lighting code this effect of stray light is defined as [...] "optical pollution", due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> direct path from the light source to the [...] "optic" [...] – the observer's eye or telescope.|$|E
2500|$|For most of MLS' existence, league clubs {{could not}} draw the same crowds for Open Cup matches {{as they would}} for the regular season or playoff matches. [...] Some of it is {{attributed}} {{to the fact that}} MLS clubs typically play a majority of their matches against lower tier clubs which may create a lack of interest. Additionally, all Open Cup matches are scheduled mid-week, which can be inconvenient for fans and supporters. [...] Often, it is considered that the MLS team that wins the Open Cup is one with great depth on their roster, or one that has nothing much to play for in league competition. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lesser amount of interest in the competition leads most MLS clubs to play their home Open Cup games at smaller stadiums, usually high school or smaller college football fields or on their training facilities due to the lower seating capacity, and to create a more [...] "intimate" [...] setting.

2500|$|Petar Mitev {{notes that}} despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} discrepancy of viewpoints {{between the government and}} the presidency, the former would not benefit from a strategy premised on seriously discrediting the latter, as this could lead to general political chaos and embolden the protesters. In November 2013, culturologist Ivaylo Ditchev, in a contribution for Deutsche Welle, analyzed some possible scenarios that could bring about a resignation of the government – his preferred one is a [...] "moral catharsis of Bulgarian society", with students inspiring the support of wide segments of the intelligentsia, who in turn convince a majority of ordinary citizens to join the anti-government wave. A Citizen Forum (reminiscent of the one established in 1989 Czechoslovakia) is to be created and serve as a guarantor for the cleansing of Bulgarian politics – the participants in it will set the tone for political discussions, but refrain from taking part in politics. However, he regards this scenario as rather utopian and draws attention to the more realistic (if increasingly less appealing – from his standpoint – possibilities) – corporate and social issues like those related to health care causing a mass discontent and unions going on strike, triggering a paralysis of the country; [...] "behind the curtain events" [...] within the political echelons themselves, with GERB succeeding in using procedural tools (also with the tacit support of Western allies) to alter the balance of power in the National Assembly; the Attack party withdrawing its support for the government and emerging as the political face of popular protests inspired by nationalist causes (possibly attributable issues like the Syrian refugee crisis and illegal African migrants or concerns pertaining to the selling of Bulgarian land to foreigners). The latter scenario is regarded as especially problematic and as being incompatible with the underlying goals of the protest movement, because the new Parliament formed after such events would almost inevitably include fascist-leaning parties and would need to contend with significant polarization due to the presence of pro- and anti-European voices. In April 2014, sociologist Mikhail Mirchev rated the cabinet's chances to fend off future storms as good, but cautioned that the MRF was not necessarily a reliable coalition partner (judging by the past history of the MRF-BSP coalition dynamics) and any erratic behaviour on their part could be a major factor in bringing down the government. German political researcher Daniel Kadick notes that it may be advisable for a protest party to be formed, so that the current status quo in Bulgaria is not recreated after the next elections and in order for the electoral prospects of populist movements like [...] "Bulgaria without censorship" [...] to be reduced. Philologist and popular talk show host Iulian Vuchkov has declared his support for the protests, considering them long overdue because of the political passivity of Bulgarians, but has opposed early elections due to his belief that it will take time for a successful [...] "professor party" [...] to be formed, so that it could become a viable election challenger. Political analysts Tihomir Bezlov and Ruslan Stefanov have suggested that tensions along political lines may manifest themselves in the aftermath of the next Parliamentary elections (while holding the view that the caretaker government will not have to deal with popular discontent) and do not believe that the protest potential has been exhausted.|$|E
