5|$|Nicholson was {{commissioned}} into the United States Navy on 30 April 1915 {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander A. E. Watson in command. After a shakedown cruise in the North Atlantic, Nicholson operated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> along the east coast until early 1917.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the monitor was {{transferred}} to Washington, D. C. and used to temporarily incarcerate some of the suspected conspirators after the assassination of President Lincoln. She was decommissioned in June and recommissioned in early 1869 for service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> {{off the coast of}} Florida. Saugus was again recommissioned in late 1872 and generally remained active until late 1877. She was condemned in 1886 and sold for scrap in 1891.|$|E

5|$|After the United States entered World War II, Pan Gulf {{frequently}} sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, {{as well as}} some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> the Gulf of Mexico. Between April and September 1942, Pan Gulf {{made two}} roundtrips from the U.S. to Liverpool. In September, the cargo ship sailed from New York to the Caribbean to take on a load of bauxite in early November, and then sailed on to Galveston, Texas, before returning to New York in mid-February 1943.|$|E
5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} {{landfall}} at some location at hurricane strength. Most Category5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall {{because of their}} proximity to land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, {{as opposed to the}} westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1670s France became an {{increasing}} threat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> Morgan {{took control of}} the defence of Port Royal. He declared martial law in 1678 and 1680 – both during his periods as temporary governor of the island– because of the threat of invasion, re-built the fortifications surrounding the town, and increased the number of cannon from 60 to more than 100 in the five years up to 1680.|$|E

His {{job was to}} monitor the health and physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan was a {{powerful}} hurricane that caused death and destruction in over a dozen countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Central America. Moving on a due west course for nearly two weeks in October 1988, Hurricane Joan caused widespread flooding and over 200 deaths after moving into Central America. Widespread suffering and economic crises were exacerbated by Joan, primarily across Nicaragua, as heavy rains and high winds impacted those near the hurricane's path.|$|E

5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that in the early}} 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Central America. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1962, President Kennedy {{ordered a}} naval {{quarantine}} of Cuba {{in response to}} the presence of Soviet missiles on the soil of that island nation. Yancey sortied in support of the American operations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> remained on station until the missiles were removed and tensions were relaxed. Over the next few years, Yancey made regular deployments to the Mediterranean to take part in joint exercises with NATO forces.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} end of the roof, the church had a cupola which was topped with a large {{concrete}} pineapple. Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton as a symbol of welcome, an idea that originated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> which possibly reached the city {{as a result of the}} slave trade in the 16th century. The pineapple survived the bombing and has been used as an exhibited on special occasions, such as Black History Month.|$|E

5|$|The British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council still {{serves as}} the highest court of appeal for several former colonies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Pacific. British Protestant missionaries who {{travelled}} around the globe often in advance of soldiers and civil servants spread the Anglican Communion to all continents. British colonial architecture, such as in churches, railway stations and government buildings, {{can be seen in}} many cities that were once part of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Washington assumed {{command of}} the Continental Army in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts in July 1775 during the ongoing siege of Boston. He {{recognized}} his army's desperate shortage of gunpowder and sought new sources. American troops raided British arsenals, including some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> some manufacturing was attempted. They obtained a barely adequate supply (about 2.5million pounds) {{by the end of}} 1776, mostly from France.|$|E
5|$|After King Francis I {{commissioned}} Jacques Cartier {{to search}} out an eastern route to Asia, the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia. From there, the French Crown's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River, as well as islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> the north eastern shore of South America; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV. Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties, and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day.|$|E

5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression of the slave trade was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> <b>and</b> did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Between 7 June and 26 August, New Jersey formed part of {{the first}} {{training}} squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II. Over two thousand United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly, Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth, Scotland 23 June. She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo, where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July, and at Portsmouth, England. The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Western Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|De Mena {{was born}} into a Creole family in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, and {{obtained}} her education in the United States before marrying a Nicaraguan and moving to Central America. After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became {{one of the leaders of}} the pan-African movement. She was responsible for increasing the membership of the organization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> <b>and</b> Latin America. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to Jamaica, de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.|$|E
