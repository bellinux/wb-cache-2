40|$|To {{make the}} {{development}} process for new <b>laminated</b> wood <b>products</b> more effective, there is need for a simulation tool based on {{a model of the}} wood material. With help from this tool the risk of fractures in the veneers, cracking in the wood or in the glue line will be estimated. Wood is a complex hygroscopic material that is highly anisotropic, non-homogeneous, and strongly dependent on the loading rate. Most importantly, it is very sensitive for changes in temperature and moisture content. The material stiffness in the transversal directions is very low for wood and it is highly affected by changes in environmental conditions. During a manufacturing procedure of veneered products for curved furniture panels, the veneers are exposed to large membrane and bending deformations and high pressure in the radial fibre direction. When hot-press forming is used, the products are also exposed to high temperature on their surface. These hard conditions often result in large viscoelastic and elasto-plastic strains that have strong influence on the final quality of the product (spring-back, stiffness, distortion etc). To be able to improve the manufacturing process the key issue is to understand the material behaviour during these severe conditions. The main scientific challenge is to establish a new thermal and moisture related elasto-plastic material model for non-linear and strongly orthotropic wood material behaviour. Based on this work a FE-model for analysing the whole forming procedure of the bended <b>and</b> <b>laminated</b> wood <b>products</b> is presented...|$|R

Six locally available species, which consist of three hardwoods and three softwoods were investigated, which were Berlina, Danta, Alstonia, Agba, Ohia, and Obeche. The dimension of the hardwoods solid beams are 100 mm× 100 mm× 900 mm and softwoods solid beams are 150 mm× 150 mm× 900 mm. The result showed that the density of Berlina is 0. 00128 g/mm 3, Danta is 0. 000903 g/mm 3, Alstonia is 0. 00816 g/mm 3, Agba is 0. 000724 g/mm 2, Ohia is 0. 000716 g/mm 3 and Obeche is 0. 000568 g/mm 3 and the weight for Berlina was 11. 58 kg, Danta was 8. 13 kg, Alstonia was 7. 75 kg, Agba was 14. 67 kg, Ohia was 14. 5 kg and Obeche was 11. 5 kg. Comparing it with the maximum load the species could carry, Berlina was 108 kN, Danta was 85. 0 kN, Alstonia was 66. 0 kN, Agba was 50. 0 kN, Ohia was 103 kN and Obeche was 60. 0 kN. Futhermore, twenty-four (24) laminated timber beams of the same dimensions were manufactured with six (6) different species, viz: Afara, Okwen, Danta, Obeche, Alstonia, Bombax. These beams were glued together using top-bond gum and allowed to dry for twenty-four hours after which they were weighed before testing. The twenty-four beams were tested to failure and the deflection reading taken from the dial-guage. Finally, a curve of deflection against the load was plotted.

For this purpose an empirical research project with one sample containing 44 specimens with nominal sizes of 24. 3 mm in width, 100 mm in depth and 2. 44 m in length was carried out. The characteristic strength value was 74 % and 118 % higher, respectively, than those adopted by Argentinean standards for the best strength class of sawn <b>and</b> <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber of the same species. It was similar to that reported for LVL of Norway spruce and lower than that published for LVL made from Uruguayan Eucalyptus grandis even though in the latter case the reported value was not obtained according to European standards.

Before the breakthrough of synthetic adhesives in the wood industry, proteins were commonly used in furnitureproduction. Today, proteins in the form of industrial by-products e. g. soy protein, blood and wheatprotein are on the market, and these proteins can in general be used as a base for wood-productsadhesives. Proteins are in general denatured by a change in pH, heat or organic solvents before theycan be used as adhesives. In this study, a cold-dissolution of wheat protein (gluten) was tested withregard to its usability for the production of particleboards <b>and</b> <b>laminated</b> veneer <b>products.</b> The bondingwas evaluated by testing the internal bond strength, thickness swelling, tensile strength and tensileshear strength. The results showed that the strength of the bond-line was in some cases as high asthe strength of the wood material, but also that there were in some cases problems with thepenetration of the adhesive into the wood and this lowered the bond-line strength considerably. Themain conclusion is that cold-dissolved gluten adhesives are a good alternative to commercial syntheticadhesives for interior use, but that there are still challenges with the poor moisture resistance of theadhesive.
