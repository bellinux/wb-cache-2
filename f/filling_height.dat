5000|$|The iron lion {{was cast}} using a piece-moulding {{technique}} {{in a single}} mould. In this technique, which has also been used in ancient Chinese bronze-casting, a clay model of the sculpture is made {{and covered with a}} new layer of clay after drying. This outer layer of clay is then cut into pieces and removed before it dries completely. In the next step, material is taken off the surface of the inner clay model in order to provide room for pouring the iron between the outer and inner mould. Hence, [...] "seams" [...] visible on the cast do not represent boundaries between separate iron pieces, but are impressions of the seams between the pieces of the outer mould. Casting did proceed in several stages between which the iron already poured into the mould did cool down. As a result, fault lines were introduced into the cast at regular intervals which mark the <b>filling</b> <b>height</b> of the mould at successive casting stages. These fault lines were bridged by the craftsmen carrying out the cast with pieces of wrought iron which were plunged into the solidifying surface of the iron from the previous pour and then covered in the next pour. Traces of these bridging pegs {{as well as those of}} wrought iron spacers used to separate the outer mould from the core can still be found in the sculpture.|$|E

40|$|Experiments of bulk solid mixing in a twin ribbon blade blender {{have been}} {{performed}} in this work in order to characterize mixing behavior in such a mixer for binary mixtures with different cohesionless materials. The effects of <b>fill</b> <b>height</b> and blade rotation speed on mixing homogeneity have been studied. Mixing homogeneity was determined by sampling. It has been observed that mixing is relatively fast towards a final mixing state within approximately 100 blade rotations for different combinations of material, <b>fill</b> <b>height</b> and blade rotational speed. Moreover, these final mixing states seemed stable within a range of fluctuations, which may prove useful in determining an optimal mixing time for binary, cohesionless particle mixtures and potentially lead {{to a reduction in}} the required number of blade rotations in mixers of this type in industry. Mixing homogeneity results indicated an increased final mixing homogeneity for increasing <b>fill</b> <b>height,</b> most clearly in the range of 30 – 70 vol. % in the studied twin ribbon blade mixer.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{production}} of corn‐based ethanol in the U. S. has been dramatically increasing in recent years, and consequently {{so has the}} quantity of co‐products, especially distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), generated from this industrial sector. DDGS is sold as a commodity for animal feed, and like corn, its bulk {{physical and chemical properties}} are quality attributes {{that can be used in}} trading by merchandisers. Consistency in product quality has been a cause for concern in the industry, and the lack of standard methods for physical and chemical property determination potentially confounds the issue, especially when results of attributes measured by different methods have not been evaluated for method parity. Toward that end, this research examined the sources of DDGS bulk density variability using samples from six commercial ethanol plants (three from Indiana, and three from South Dakota) and conducted in two different laboratories. Variations due to sample handling, container filling method, <b>filling</b> <b>height,</b> and container size were also examined.

It was also determined that <b>filling</b> <b>height</b> and measuring container size resulted in significant differences in the resulting bulk density values...|$|E

The differential settlement between abutment and approach embankment was easy to produce. Coupled with the the structural differences of the abutment and embankment, how to ensure abutment stable and prevent bridge head bump has been an engineering roadblock in the abutment approach embankment filling engineering. The key factor {{to solve the problem}} of the roadblock is reducing the horizontal thrust of embankment on abutment and the difference in settlement between road and bridge. Test results showed that liquid fly ash is a new lightweight value material of self-compacting, which has higher strength, stiffness and smaller density. Using liquid fly ash as the bridge-approach embankment filling material can effectively reduce the horizontal thrust of embankment on abutment and decrease its own settlement deformation. ANSYS computational analysis showed that when we use liquid fly ash filling the bridge approach embankment, the horizontal thrust of the same position will increase with the increase of the <b>filling</b> <b>height,</b> and the value is lesser than the horizontal thrust of soil filling subgrade. Pavement settlement increases with the <b>filling</b> <b>height</b> increasing, but it is significantly less than the general soil filling subgrade...|$|E

For accountability and criticality safety, the material must be measured at SRS, and handling restrictions require assay in 9975 shipping drums. A Multiplicity Neutron Counter is available to perform the measurements, but requires about 12 hours per assay, too long to support the measurement schedule. The assay time {{has been reduced to}} 2 hours by use of the Known-M method, the first known routine application of Known-M. The approach involves expression of the multiplication in terms of the effective 239 Pu mass and a quadratic polynomial. Because only a few measured values of multiplication were available, values from Monte Carlo neutron transport calculations (using code MCNP) were used. Because the scrap cans have variable <b>fill</b> <b>heights</b> and <b>fill</b> <b>height</b> affects multiplication, an algorithm to correct the effective 239 Pu mass values for that effect was developed. Testing of the Known-M calibration with limited data suggests a 2 -sigma uncertainty of about 5 percent.

The Known-M assay calculations will be performed off line using a spreadsheet. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{granular}} silo {{is one of}} {{the many}} interesting illustrations of the thixotropic property of granular matter: a rapid flow develops at the outlet, propagating upwards through a dense shear flow while material at the bottom corners of the container remains static. For large enough outlets, the discharge flow is continuous; however, by contrast with the clepsydra for which the flow velocity depends on the height of fluid left in the container, the discharge rate of granular silos is constant. Implementing a plastic rheology in a 2 D Navier-Stokes solver (following the mu(I) -rheology or a constant friction), we simulate the continuum counterpart of the granular silo. Doing so, we obtain a constant flow rate during the discharge and recover the Beverloo scaling independently of the initial <b>filling</b> <b>height</b> of the silo. We show that lowering the value of the coefficient of friction leads to a transition toward a different behavior, similar to that of a viscous fluid, and where the <b>filling</b> <b>height</b> becomes active in the discharge process. The pressure field shows that large enough values of the coefficient of friction (≃ 0. 3) allow for a low-pressure cavity to form above the outlet, and can thus explain the Beverloo scaling. In conclusion, the difference between the discharge of a hourglass and a clepsydra seems to reside in the existence or not of a plastic yield stress. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{discharge}} of polydisperse grains in a two-dimensional silo, {{operating in a}} continuous-discharge mode, is studied {{with the help of}} soft-particle discrete element simulations. We find that the mass flow rate displays similar variation with vertical normal stress at the base and the transition-point in the bulk, signifying that the base normal stress can be considered as a representative of its bulk counterpart. The variation of the base and transition-point normal stresses with <b>fill</b> <b>height</b> follows the Janssen's model, with the former being larger than the latter. The transition-point ($y_t$) is defined as the vertical extent of Region of Orifice Influence (ROOI), which is situated directly above the orifice in its neighbourhood. The transition-point occurs largely at the same location irrespective of the <b>fill</b> <b>height.</b> It shifts, however, upon changing the orifice size, indicating its occurrence to be a localized phenomenon. Finally, the scaling of the vertical velocities at the transition-point and outlet uncovers $y_t$ to be a more relevant length scale than the orifice size $D$.
