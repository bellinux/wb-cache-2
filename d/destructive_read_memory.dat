40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the results of resistive-open defect insertion in different locations of Infineon 0. 13 µm embedded-SRAM with the main purpose of verifying the presence of dynamic faults. This study is based on the injection of resistive defects as their presence in VDSM technologies is more and more frequent. Electrical simulations have been performed to evaluate the effects of those defects in terms of detected functional faults. <b>Read</b> <b>destructive,</b> deceptive <b>read</b> <b>destructive</b> and dynamic <b>read</b> <b>destructive</b> faults have been reproduced and accurately characterized. The dependence of the fault detection has been put in relation with memory operating conditions, resistance value and clock cycle, and the importance of at speed testing for dynamic fault models has been pointed out. Finally resistive Address Decoder Open Faults (ADOF) have been simulated and the conditions that maximize the fault detection have been discussed as well as the resulting implications for memory test...|$|R

5000|$|FeRAM's {{advantages}} over flash include: lower power usage, faster write performance {{and a much}} greater maximum read/write endurance (about 1010 to 1014 cycles). FeRAMs have data retention times of more than 10 years at +85°C (up to many decades at lower temperatures).Market disadvantages of FeRAM are much lower storage densities than flash devices, storage capacity limitations, and higher cost. FeRAM also has the unusual technical disadvantage of a <b>destructive</b> <b>read</b> process, necessitating a write-after-read architecture.|$|R

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} {{to detect}} inter-word coupling faults in word-organized SRAMs (WOMs) is proposed in this paper. This algorithm (referred to as March-NU) {{relies on a}} new fault model which extends fault detection to three additional types of coupling faults, i. e. <b>read</b> <b>destructive,</b> deceptive <b>read</b> <b>destructive</b> and incorrect <b>read</b> coupling faults. These faults are related to well known fault mechanisms that {{have been reported in}} the literature to occur in the read operation of SRAMs. Previous algorithms can not guarantee 100 % fault detection of these coupling faults. March-NU sensitizes and detects with 100 % coverage all coupling faults as well as traditional faults. A detailed analysis of its fault detection capabilities are presented. March-NU utilizes 8 March elements and its complexity is 30 N, whereN is the number of words in the WOM under test...|$|R

40|$|Vulnerabilities that {{disclose}} executable memory pages {{enable a}} new class of powerful code reuse attacks that build the attack payload at runtime. In this work, we present Heisenbyte, a system to protect against memory disclosure attacks. Central to Heisenbyte is the concept of <b>destructive</b> code <b>reads</b> – code is garbled right after it is read. Garbling the code after reading it takes away from the attacker her ability to leverage memory disclosure bugs in both static code and dynamically generated just-in-time code. By leveraging existing virtualization support, Heisenbyte’s novel use of <b>destructive</b> code <b>reads</b> sidesteps the problem of incomplete binary disassembly in binaries, and extends protection to close-sourced COTS binaries, which are two major limitations of prior solutions against memory disclosure vulnerabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that Heisenbyte can tolerate some degree of imperfect static analysis in disassembled binaries, while effectively thwarting dynamic code reuse exploits in both static and JIT code, at a modest 1. 8 % average runtime overhead due to virtualization and 16. 5 % average overhead due to the <b>destructive</b> code <b>reads...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A good {{object-oriented}} effects system {{gives the}} ability to define abstract regions (or &quot;data groups&quot;) of state within objects that can be extended in subclasses. Then one can specify (for instance) read and write effects on these abstract regions. Additionally, effects on &quot;wholly owned subsidiary &quot; objects {{should be seen as}} effects on regions of the owning object. For instance, an assignment within a bucket of a hash table should be seen as an effect on the hash table alone. Correctness of this transfer of effects depends on the bucket being accessible only through the hash table; it must be unique. Uniqueness can be guaranteed using <b>destructive</b> <b>reads</b> (in which a unique variable can be used at most once). <b>Destructive</b> <b>reads</b> are inconvenient, so most uniqueness systems permit borrowing reads as well, in which a temporary alias of a unique variable is permitted. But if the unique variable is read during the lifetime of this alias, the uniqueness invariant fails. So we wish to ensure that this read effect does not happen. For modularity reasons, we use effects annotations on methods to check for such read effects. Thus we see that effects and uniqueness depend on each other. Our position is that the use of annotations breaks the cyclic dependence as long as the annotations are given semantics independent of the analyses. As a semantics of uniqueness annotations is already available, we then sketch a semantics of effects annotations independent of uniqueness. Thus decoupled, one can prove the correctness of a uniqueness analysis and an effects analysis without regard for the other...|$|R

Together with the still effective Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) it has significant influence on the 6 T SRAM memory cell. We present simulations of both effects, first isolated, then combined in SRAM operation. During long hold of one data, both effects add up to a worst case impact. This leads to an asymmetric cell, which, in a directly following read cycle, combined with the generally unavoidable production variations, maximizes the risk of <b>destructive</b> <b>reading.</b> In future SRAM designs, it will be important to consider this combination of effects to avoid an undesired write event...|$|R
