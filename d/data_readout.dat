50|$|Timepix-3 is a {{successor}} of the Timepix chip. One {{of the biggest}} distinguishing changes is the approach to the <b>data</b> <b>readout.</b> All previous chips utilized the frame-based readout, i.e. the whole pixel matrix was read out at once. Timepix-3 has event-based readout where values recorded in pixels are read out immediately after the hit together with coordinates of the hit pixel. The chip therefore generates a continuous stream of data rather than a sequence of frames. The next major difference compared to the previous Timepix chip {{is the ability to}} measure the hit amplitude simultaneously with the time of arrival. Other parameters such as energy and timing resolution were also improved compared to the original Timepix chip.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative high {{throughput}} screening (qHTS) has {{the potential}} to transform traditional toxicological testing by greatly increasing throughput and lowering costs on a per chemical basis. However, before qHTS data can be utilized for toxicity assessment, systematic errors such as row, column, cluster, and edge effects in raw <b>data</b> <b>readouts</b> need to be removed. Normalization seeks to minimize effects of systematic errors. Linear (LN) normalization, such as standardization and background removal, minimizes row and column effects. Alternatively, local weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS or LO) minimizes cluster effects. Both approaches have been used to normalize large scale data sets in other contexts. A new method is proposed in this paper to combine these two approaches (LNLO) to account for systematic errors within and between experiments. Heat maps illustrate that the LNLO method is more effective in removing systematic error than either the LN or the LO approach alone.
