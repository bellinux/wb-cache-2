40|$|Now-a-days water {{scarcity}} {{has become a}} serious problem in India {{and there are many}} factors responsible for this like improper supply of water from the dam, improper water saving systems, etc. but one major factor is the improper opening and closing of the <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> according to the level of water in the dam. Also till date the control mechanism of the dam gates are done manually and using PLC. But there are lots of errors in manual method. Also the PLC based system is huge and hence suitable for major dams due to its cost. For medium and small dams like irrigation dams does not require such huge PLC systems. So to reduce these problems a mechatronic control system is proposed in this paper. This project is a AT 89 S 51 microcontroller based <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> control system which helps in {{keeping an eye on the}} frequent usage of water resources from dam for irrigation purposes and efficient operation of <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> according to the level of water and also helps in indicating about flood to people living in the surrounding. This proposed mechanism of <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> control reduces the water wastage and efficient usage of available water is ensured. Also there are heavy load shedding problems in the villages in almost all states of India. To overcome these problems the proposed <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> control system can be combined with the operation of the geothermal and nuclear power plants for generation of electricity.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} water {{resource}} management problems faced from an Automatic Control point of view. The {{motivation for the}} study {{is the need for}} an automated management policy for an artificial reservoir (dam). Two problems are addressed in the article: the control of the <b>dam</b> <b>gate,</b> that is a typical control problem, and the definition of the water flow to supply to the user, that is a decision problem. In particular, a mathematical model of the reservoir is deduced, and a PID controller with fuzzy (nonlinear) gains is designed to operate the <b>dam</b> <b>gate.</b> Moreover, a hybrid model of the reservoir is considered and implemented in Stateflow/Simulink, and a second fuzzy decision mechanism is implemented in order to produce different water release strategies. A new cost functional is proposed, able to weight user’s desiderata (in terms of water demand) with water waste (in terms of water spills). The parameters of the fuzzy system are optimized by employing Genetic Algorithms, which have proved very effective due to the strong nonlinearity of the problem. Copyright c© 2005 IFAC...|$|E

40|$|Some {{discussion}} of the <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> valve has already taken place. As mentioned earlier, the valve {{will need to be}} approximately one-eighth open to allow the water wheel to turn during times when the mill is not in operation. The operational position will be one-quarter to one-half open. These positions may vary with the level of the pond and the operator will have to make adjustments as needed. The trash rack (below left) at the dam needs to be regularly inspected for debris. This is most critical following a significant rain event and in the fall when there will be leaves flowing into the pond. If the raceway is free of debris, maintenance should be minimal to none, since the raceway is completely underground and constructed of an 0. 4 m (14 in.) smooth bore pipe (below, right). Since the mill is not operated on a daily basis, wintertime operation and maintenance may be problematic. The wheel should be kept wet and not allowed to dry out for long periods of time. This would allow wooden joints to shrink and become loose. On the other hand, if water is allowed to flow over the wheel when it is not turning, ice will form on very cold days and will be difficult to remove when it becomes necessary to operate the mill.

Geographic survey, interview and focused group discussion of fishermen {{were used to assess}} factors influencing effectiveness of fishing and the preferred gear of Asejire Lake. Water usage (s) such as frequency of Complete and Partial Opening of Dams Gate (CODG and PODG) were investigated as indices for hydrodynamic condition. Response during focused group discussion with about 33 % of fishermen of the Lake were obtained on sources of disturbance to effective fishing (SDEF), most effective gear (MEG) - least environmentally perturbed gear, comparability of catch structure of preferred gear to conventional gear and sustainability of superiority of preferred gears in situations outside hydrodynamic condition (SSPPG). The PODG occurred 1 - 7 times/Month-dry season, 15 - 18 times/Month-wet season; CODG occurred 1 - 2 times/Month in both season; Interval of CODG was 3 - 17 and 5 - 12 days (dry and wet season). It affected set-net and catch. The SDEF were gear availability, weather condition, dam’s gate opening, religion activities and Health of fisher-folks. 50 % respondents accepted opening of dams gate as most important disturbance while religion was least (5 % respondents accepted). 60 % respondents accepted traps as MEG being the least affected while 75 % respondents accepted Gura cage trap as the MEG among traps. 90 % respondents accepted that among traps, its catch structure was closest (comparable) to conventional gear. However, 75 % respondents rejected SSPPG. Opening of dams’ gate creates hydrodynamic condition and it affects fishing. Gura trap was preferred for fishing hydrodynamic condition...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} field {{monitoring of}} bedload transport rate associated with experimental sediment release {{in a natural}} channel to clarify behavior of the supplied sediment on mixed size bed. Observation of bedload rate at two sites along the 30 m channel reach revealed that downstream migration of finer particles delay compared with coarser particles. Ratio of the bedload sediment that deposited during the migration was higher for finer sediments. These behaviors of the mixed size particles were clear during passage of the sediment wave without changes in water discharge. Flashing peak of discharge that caused artificially by opening of the <b>dam</b> <b>gate</b> did not destroy channel bed structure including steps and pools formed by coarser sediments, and only small amount of bedload was mobilized. Both reach scale channel features including steps, pools, and riffles as well as fine scale features (i. e., armour coat) likely increased critical shear stress of particles and decreased bedload rate during our experiment. Extreme sediment supply induced two types of sediment deposition; (1) filling the pools in reach sales and (2) the intrusion of fine particles into the coarser sediment that formed an armour layer. The all grain size fractions can deposit as type (1) when shear stress of stream water {{is not enough to}} entrain bedload particles, while deposition type (2) occurs when finer sediment pass over channel bed on which armour coat is well-developed. Deposition of finer sediment into coarser sediment that forms armour coat is affected by grain size distribution of bed surface sediment. Thus, impact of the sediment supply on downstream channel depends on both bedforms and grain size distribution of bed surface sediment over which the supplied sediment pass...|$|E

40|$|Invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) {{and silver}} carp (H. molitrix), hereafter, bigheaded carp, pose {{a major threat}} to the Great Lakes {{ecosystem}} as they advance toward Lake Michigan via the Illinois River. However, a series of navigation dams may deter their upstream movement. Starved Rock Lock and Dam (SRLD) is the most downstream <b>gated</b> <b>dam</b> on the Illinois River, therefore presenting the first navigation challenge for upstream migrating bigheaded carp. Before 2015, five acoustic receivers near SRLD detected successful upstream passage of only two of 900 tagged bigheaded carp. I further investigated the permeability of SRLD to bigheaded carp migration as a function of temperature, gage height, and dam operation. In 2015, I added 12 receivers around SRLD and acoustically tagged an additional 118 bigheaded carp downstream of SRLD. I also investigated the timing of bigheaded carp arriving downstream of SRLD using a generalized linear model. The explanatory variables influencing bigheaded carp arrival were average water temperature, average tailwater elevation, and the change in average water temperature. During 2015 - 2016, acoustic receivers recorded a total of 11 upstream passage events through SRLD, with nine through the <b>dam</b> <b>gates,</b> one through the lock chamber, and one undetermined. Passage through the <b>dam</b> <b>gates</b> occurred most frequently at high water levels when the <b>dam</b> <b>gates</b> were completely out of the water. The probability of upstream migrating bigheaded carp approaching SRLD was positively correlated with rising temperature and high gage. No upstream migrants approached SRLD between mid-September and late March. Overall, <b>dam</b> <b>gates</b> were more susceptible to upstream passage than the lock chamber, and environmental factors accurately predicted the arrival of bigheaded carp at SRLD. Modifying gate use during times of bigheaded carp arrival will likely prevent upstream passage through SRLD and other lock and dam structures...|$|R

50|$|While the dam is {{relatively}} small, it has historically blocked passage of salmon, steelhead and sturgeon {{runs on the}} Sacramento River with resulting detrimental impact on these fish populations. This occurred both due to improper construction of the fish ladders on the dam, and turbulence caused by water diversion which disorient migrating fish. A fish screen was installed between 1969 and 1971 to prevent fish from entering the canal headworks, and a new fish ladder was later constructed {{at a cost of}} $17 million. Starting in 1987, the <b>dam</b> <b>gates</b> were left open between December 1 and April 1 to help the winter Chinook salmon run. However, this did not have an appreciable impact on fish populations; in 1991, the winter Chinook count hit a record low of 191, down from 118,000 in 1969. The spring Chinook salmon run has not been as severely impacted by dam operations. By 2008, the <b>dam</b> <b>gates</b> were open in all months except for the primary irrigation season of mid-May to mid-September, but the migrating fish count remained low. In 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Service mandated that the <b>dam</b> <b>gates</b> be opened year round, allowing the river to flow freely. A new pumping plant and fish screen was constructed upstream to divert water into the Tehama-Colusa and Corning Canals. These works effectively made the Red Bluff dam obsolete.|$|R
