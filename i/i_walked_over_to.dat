2500|$|In August 1900, Taylor {{was called}} up to the major leagues {{to play for the}} New York Giants. [...] He made his major league debut on August 27, 1900. [...] In his first game for the Giants, five Boston players tried to take {{advantage}} of Taylor's deafness by trying to steal third base. [...] Interviewed in 1942, Taylor recalled with pride, [...] "I nailed each one. [...] <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> (Herman) Long, the last man caught, and let him know by signs I could hear him stealing." [...] Appearing in 11 games for the 1900 Giants, Taylor compiled a 4–3 record with a 2.45 earned run average (ERA).|$|E

60|$|George {{was very}} anxious to receive me at his home. The Ram had as yet only a six days licence, so on Sunday {{afternoon}} <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> tea.

He'd brought his ladder over the side fence, where the dog, a-barkin' and plungin' at the boy outside, couldn't see him. I stood dumb for a minute, an' then I know'd I had him. I rushed into the house, got a piece of well-rope, tied it to the bull-dog's collar, an' dragged him out and {{fastened}} him to the bottom rung of the ladder. Then <b>I</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the front fence with Lord Edward's chain, for I knew that if he got at that bull-dog there'd be times, for they'd never been allowed to see each other yet. So says I to the boy, 'I'm goin' to tie up the dog, so you needn't be afraid of his jumpin' over the fence,'--which he couldn't do, or the boy would have been a corpse for twenty minutes, or may be half an hour. The boy kinder laughed, and said I needn't mind, which I didn't. Then I went to the gate, and I clicked to the horse which was standin' there, an' off he starts, as good as gold, an' trots down the road. The boy, he said somethin' or other pretty bad, an' away he goes after him; but the horse was a-trottin' real fast, an' had a good start." ...|$|R

My plan {{for him is}} that he should still profit by the {{interest}} which his present employers take in him. Their knowledge of affairs in the City will soon place a good partnership at his disposal, and you will give him the money to buy it out of hand. I shall limit the sum, my dear, to half your fortune; and the other half I shall have settled upon yourself. We shall all be alive and hearty, I hope"--he looked tenderly at his wife as he said those words--"all alive and hearty at the year's end. But if I am gone, Magdalen, it will make no difference. My will--made long before I ever thought of having a son-in-law divides my fortune into two equal parts. One part goes to your mother; and the other part is fairly divided between my children. You will have your share on your wedding-day (and Norah will have hers when she marries) from my own hand, if I live; and under my will if I die. There! there! no gloomy faces," [...] he said, with a momentary return of his every-day good spirits. [...] "Your mother and I mean to live and see Frank a great merchant.

60|$|I {{was never}} {{a man who could}} sit down and wait for things to happen, and I felt now that it was {{absolutely}} necessary that I should do something, that I should talk to somebody; and accordingly, on the morning after my arrival, <b>I</b> determined <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the House of Martha and talk to Mother Anastasia. For a man to consult with the Mother Superior of a religious institution about his love affairs was certainly an uncommon proceeding, with very prominent features of inappropriateness; but this did not deter me, for, apart from {{the fact that there was}} no one else to talk to, I considered that Mother Anastasia owed me some advice and explanation, and without hesitation I went to ask for it.|$|R
6000|$|You must {{understand}} that I had no set plan of murder when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Checkshill. I had no set plan of any sort.

Of course, you may say I was a sneak for doing it, but just look at what I found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was given}} to me in New York, sir," [...] said he, [...] "by a Dago, one of these I-talians. He gave me the money to go to Blackburn Station in the cars, and then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the tavern. He said he thought I'd find you there, sir. He told me just what sort of a lookin' man you was, sir, and that letter is for you, and no mistake. He didn't know your name, or he'd put it on." ...|$|E
6000|$|Very {{often it}} was a good idea to close the {{transaction}} instantly, when a man offered a stock present to a friend, for the offer was only good and binding at that moment, and if the price went to a high figure shortly afterward the procrastination was a thing to be regretted. Mr. Stewart (Senator, now, from Nevada) one day told me he would give me twenty feet of [...] "Justis" [...] stock if <b>I</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his office. It was worth five or ten dollars a foot. I asked him to make the offer good for next day, as I was just going to dinner. He said he would not be in town; so I risked it and took my dinner instead of the stock. Within the week the price went up to seventy dollars and afterward to a hundred and fifty, but nothing could make that man yield. I suppose he sold that stock of mine and placed the guilty proceeds in his own pocket. [My revenge will be found in the accompanying portrait.] I met three friends one afternoon, who said they had been buying [...] "Overman" [...] stock at auction at eight dollars a foot. One said if I would come up to his office he would give me fifteen feet; another said he would add fifteen; the third said he would do the same. But I was going after an inquest and could not stop. A few weeks afterward they sold all their [...] "Overman" [...] at six hundred dollars a foot and generously came around to tell me about it--and also to urge me to accept of the next forty-five feet of it that people tried to force on me.|$|R

Many items {{of great interest}} are in the news tonight. 1. I love you. 2. It was cold today 3. I love you. 4. Where did a certain girl in a certain town in New York get those beautiful eyes? 5. You’re wonderful 6. I love you. And that covers the news for this evening. Be sure to get your next Sugar Report from the nearest Postman tomorrow! Gosh hon, it will seem funny {{to have a long}} Saturday night for a change, one with the full twelve hours, instead of the scanty twelve minutes that these past few have been. It was swell to talk to you last night, even if it was about moves, and yellow gold, and turkish bath’s. We never seem to talk about important things do we? Except our wedding, and you. So—let’s talk about something important, for a change. O. K. hon, let’s get a yellow gold ring. I thought you didn’t like yellow gold. I like it better than white, it makes the diamond(s) look much brighter;—and also then we can get wedding bands that match. I looked at one that a fella has up here. It’s really sharp. About 1 / 16 ” thick. Sort of a design on it. You wouldn’t want just a plain band would, you? They look too much like curtain rings. We’ll probably have all this talked over {{by the time you get}} this, but it’s nice to talk about, anyhow. Gosh hon, I still can’t believe it. You of all people. Yes I remember the day we walked in the rain, I guess I fell in love with you that day. <b>I</b> remember we <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> my house, and Owen came. We played some records on my Victrola. I can remember you lying in front of it on your stomach (I remember the damndest [sic] things). Gee I’ve known you a long time, haven’t I? Yet every time I see you, I fell [sic] that I meet you all over again, love’s a strange thing all right. Well darling I’ll see you Sunday, for about six puny hours. Until then I’ll count the minutes, (and the hours) I love you, darling,—you’ll never know how much. Give my best to your family. I love you— As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} been special constable myself to-day--thinking there was rather an {{epidemic}} in that wise abroad. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> {{and looked at the}} preparations, without any baggage of staff, warrant, or affidavit.|$|R
60|$|Every morning <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Rothland and {{received}} two hours' instruction from the curate, {{and in the}} afternoon my mother taught me modern languages. The {{rest of the day}} I spent alone, wandering whithersoever I pleased, staying away as long as I chose, and returning when I felt inclined. The results of such a life at my age soon developed themselves. I became something of a misanthrope, a great reader, and a passionate lover of Nature. At any rate, it was healthy, and my taste for all sorts of outdoor sport prevented my becoming a bookworm.|$|E
60|$|During {{the summer}} I {{found it very}} {{pleasant}} to live by myself. It was a novelty, and I could arrange and manage everything in my own fashion, which was a pleasure I had not enjoyed when I lived in my father's house. But when winter came I found it very lonely. Even my servants lived in a cabin at some little distance, {{and there were many}} dark and stormy evenings when the company even of a bore would have been welcome to me. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the town and visited my friends there, but this was not feasible on stormy nights, and the winter seemed to me a very long one.|$|E
6000|$|I got up {{and walked}} about the room. It was evidently Lucretia's own bedroom; [...] "part of the decoy," [...] said I to myself sapiently. But could so {{beautiful}} a girl really hurt one? A piece of music was lying on the dressing-table. I took it up and looked at it casually. Gracious heavens! it was a song from [...] "Lucrezia Borgia!" [...] Her very name betrayed her! She too was a Lucretia. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the mantelpiece. A little ivory miniature hung above the centre: I gave it a glance as I passed. Incredible! It was the Beatrice Cenci! Talk of beautiful women! Why, they poison one, they stab one, they burn one alive, with a smile on their lips. Lucretia must have a taste for murderesses. Evidently she is a connoisseur.|$|E
