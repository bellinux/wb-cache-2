The {{remaining}} Serb-held area in Croatia, in Eastern Slavonia, was faced {{with the possibility of}} military confrontation with Croatia. Such a possibility was repeatedly stated by Tuđman after Storm.

50|$|An <b>intervening</b> {{cause is}} an event that occurs after a tortfeasor's initial act of {{negligence}} and causes injury/harm to a victim. An <b>intervening</b> cause will generally absolve the tortfeasor of liability for the victim's injury only if the event is deemed a superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable <b>intervening</b> cause. By contrast, a foreseeable <b>intervening</b> cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible for the victim's injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable result.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to <b>intervene</b> and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to <b>intervene</b> in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|Even if the ARBiH had not {{provided}} aid, the HV {{would almost certainly}} have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj {{for less than a}} single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not <b>intervene</b> militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to <b>intervene,</b> the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.|$|E

5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to <b>intervene</b> if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to <b>intervene</b> so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E

40|$|An rDNA {{size class}} in the genome of the {{nematode}} Ascaris lumbricoides is described which is interrupted by a 4. 5 -kb long <b>intervening</b> sequence located in the 26 S coding region. This molecular form occurs in approximately 15 copies per haploid genome and amounts to approximately 5 % of the total nuclear rDNA. <b>Intervening</b> sequences are present only in the 8. 8 -kb rDNA, {{but not in the}} 8. 4 -kb rDNA repeating units of A. lumbricoides. Cloning of the interrupted rDNA units revealed, in addition to the main 4. 5 -kb insertion, shorter <b>intervening</b> sequences of 4 -kb and 119 -bp length. Both shorter rDNA forms are present in the single copy range of the haploid genome. Sequence analyses of the <b>intervening</b> sequence/rDNA junctions show an identical right-hand junction for all of the three different rDNA forms. The two shorter <b>intervening</b> sequences are a coterminal subset of the right-hand end of the main 4. 5 -kb insertion, whereas all three insertions have a different left-hand junction with the coding region of rDNA. Each <b>intervening</b> sequence is flanked by a short direct repeat of variable length, being only once present in the uninterrupted rDNA. The <b>intervening</b> sequences of A. lumbricoides show striking similarity to the organization of type I insertion family in dipteran flies, even though they are inserted at different positions in the 26 S coding region. Additional rDNA <b>intervening</b> sequences may be present outside of the rDNA cluster, but in not more than 15 - 20 homologous copies per haploid genome...|$|R

5|$|In July 1956, Nasser {{unilaterally}} nationalised the Suez Canal. The {{response of}} Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt {{that would give}} Britain and France an excuse to <b>intervene</b> militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was {{the possibility of a}} wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to <b>intervene</b> on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in one nation had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to <b>intervene</b> in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not <b>intervene</b> and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
