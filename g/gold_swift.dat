40|$|Recently Bouneau et al. {{measured}} the angular and energy distributions of negative Au_n (n= 2 – 7) ions emitted from gold targets following bombardment with <b>swift</b> <b>gold</b> cluster projectiles. They {{found that the}} energy distributions could be fitted with a spike-like model, and that the angular distributions were independent of the azimuthal emission angle and relatively strongly forward directed. We have used MD simulations to investigate the temporal development of energy and angular distributions of sputtered atoms from Au(1 1 1) targets following bombardment with 100 keV/atom Au 2 ions. Our results show that during the very {{early stages of the}} collision cascade the energy distribution of sputtered atoms is described well by the linear cascade model. Essentially all high energy sputtered atoms are emitted during this phase of the collision cascade. However, the energy distributions of atoms sputtered after 0. 5 ps were typical of emission from a thermal spike and could be fitted well with a Sigmund–Claussen model. The polar angle distributions of sputtered atoms were strongly forward directed early in the collision cascade, but became less forward directed as the thermal spike developed...|$|R

50|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>swift</b> (Phymatopus hectus), {{originally}} {{belonging to}} the Hepialus genus, is widely distributed across Europe (Central and North) and the Ural mountains, follows the distribution of its foodplant- bracken and roots of Erica, Primula, Rumex, Calluna.The male forewings bear two silvery white stripes consisting of individual spots separated by dark veins, which are fringed with thin black lines. The dorsal process of valvella (part of male genitalia) is almost straight, and the mesosome tip is rounded.|$|E
40|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>swift</b> Phymatopus hecta in acidified {{forests in}} the {{southern}} part of the Netherlands (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) The <b>gold</b> <b>swift</b> Phymatopus hecta (Linnaeus, 1758) is a small moth which occurs in woods on peaty and sandy soils. The moth belongs to the family of the Hepialidae of which the young caterpillars feed on the roots of herbaceous plants. It was assumed that the species is declining in the Netherlands. During a research undertaken in 2004 and 2005 the species appears to be common in woods in a large area in the south of the Netherlands. Based on observations from other researchers the species seems to be fairly common on the sandy and peaty soils in the middle, east en north of the Netherlands. The most important host plant is the broad buckler fern Dryopteris dilatata. This plant has expanded in old pine woods and profits from the acidification of the soils caused by emissions from transport, industry and agriculture. The top of the flight period lies at the beginning of June, which is about one to two weeks earlier than mentioned in the literature. The presence of the <b>gold</b> <b>swift</b> can be determined by visiting rich populations of ferns at dusk. The fact that this method is not much used any more is the cause for the presumed decline and has in fact covered up an expansion...|$|E
