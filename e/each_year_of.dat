5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points for <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> age {{based on their}} age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E

5|$|The Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine is on {{the main}} campus {{as well as in}} two {{regional}} campses at St. Catharines and Kitchener. The Waterloo Regional Campus is located in downtown Kitchener, sharing facilities with the Health Sciences Campus of the University of Waterloo. The campus in St. Catharines is at Brock University's Niagara Health and Bioscience Research Complex. Approximately 30 medical students in <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the program attend each campus. Those who apply to McMaster's School of Medicine are asked to rank their site choice (Hamilton, Niagara Region, Waterloo Region) from first to third, or no preference. Offers of admission to the medical school are made from a rank list irrespective of geographical preference. Subsequent to an applicant's acceptance, registrants to the class are placed based on their preference and geographical background. The offers given out by McMaster are bound to the assigned site.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{have studied the}} {{surviving}} Pipe rolls, using them {{as the basis for}} study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era. A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns. Recent work by Nick Barratt on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research. Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign. The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking. Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges. Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Battle {{losses of}} horses were {{approximately}} 25percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion {{accounted for the}} remainder and the Germans specifically targeted horses with gunfire. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the tsetse fly. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals <b>each</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the Crimean War, 120 percent in the Boer War and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 Battle of Verdun between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the Clydesdale horses, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over {{the course of the}} war, Britain lost over 484,000horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.|$|E
