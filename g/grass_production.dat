50|$|Camp Grafton (South Unit) (CGS) {{consists}} of 10000 acre of a transitional grassland ecosystem. Transitional grasslands contain both tall grass prairies {{of the east}} and mixed grass prairies of the west. CGS {{is one of the}} largest contiguous areas of transitional grasslands North Dakota. Grazing has been the predominant use of the training area since 1920. Cattle grazing mimics the prehistoric grazing by herbivores (elk and bison). The rolling hills of transitional grasslands are a tremendous training area for open-area combat arms maneuvers necessary for our mechanized engineer and air defense artillery units. To maintain the transitional grassland ecosystem, grazing licenses are auctioned to local ranchers; providing income, which is, reinvested back into the training site. The transitional grassland ecosystem is seriously threatened by leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), an introduced weed. The primary control in the past has been concentrated use of 2,4-D and picloram herbicides. In the past five years, the North Dakota Army National Guard, in partnership with the Range Science Department of North Dakota State University has implemented an integrated pest management plan to control leafy spurge using cultural and chemical controls. The cultural controls consist of grazing spurge tolerant sheep on heavily infested sites, and treating small concentrations through chemical application. The NDARNG is expected to reduce herbicide costs by 79% over the next six years, with a realization of increased <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> of 50%. The USDA in other trials throughout the United States is implementing this integrated plan of combined cultural and chemical treatment.|$|E

40|$|This report {{analysed}} {{the modern}} continuous stocking system for dairy {{farms in the}} Netherlands. This system {{has to deal with}} a minimum grass height of 8 or 10 cm (depending on the season) in order to obtain maximum <b>grass</b> <b>production.</b> A model should predict the available herbage mass under changing weather conditions and therefore the available fresh grass and the related amount of additional feed needed for the cows. A concept model, called McGraze, is developed for farmers in order to manage modern continuous stocking (Figure 1). McGraze consists of a <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> section and a stoking related section. The <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> section is based on an existing <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> model called LINGRA, which resulted from a literature review to be the most accurate model to predict <b>grass</b> <b>production.</b> LINGRA needs some minor changes in order to fit into McGraze. The stocking related section is key to the final hours of stocking and the related additional feeding, which are the outputs of McGraze. All values used to predict the outputs are a result of a literature study on grass height, grass quality, grass intake and the effect of stocking on grass growth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Above-ground grass biomass, necromass {{and tree}} litter were {{measured}} monthly over a vegetation cycle under tree clumps {{and in the}} open, in a humid savanna in Côte d’Ivoire. <b>Grass</b> <b>production</b> was calculated using several meth-ods to better discriminate {{the contribution of the}} different grass compartments. Above-ground grass biomass is higher in the open than under canopies during {{the second part of the}} growing season, but there is no difference in grass necromass dynamics. Physical protection of grass necromass by tree litter against decaying under tree canopies was assumed to explain this discrepancy. <b>Grass</b> <b>production,</b> calculated as the sum of positive increments of biomass and necromass, equals 1073 g m– 2 yr– 1 in the open, against 74 % underneath trees. However, basal ground cover is only 50 % of that in the open. Compari-son with other savanna studies as a whole does not show any significant effect of rainfall on the relationship between under-canopy and outside-canopy <b>grass</b> <b>production.</b> However, in arid conditions, <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> tends to increase under light-canopied trees (mostly Acacia legumes) which hardly affect grass photosynthesis, but add high quality litter to the soil surface...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{efficient}} {{solutions for}} six farm biogas production {{was found by}} calculating mass and energy balance in different scenarios. Raw materials in biogas production were cow manure and grass silage that were produced in these farms. There were calculated mass and energy balances on average for one year biogas prouduction that consisted of <b>grass</b> silage <b>production,</b> raw material transportation and biogas production in the biogas plant. In addition, direct greenhouse gases from biogas production were estimated. The direct mass and energy flows were calculated. It turned out that one input energy unit can produce 5. 0 to 5. 5 energy units as heat and electricity. Biogas reactor consumed heat from 42 to 66 % of the produced electricity. The electricity consumption in the biogas plant was from 12 to 18 % of the produced electricity. Energy consumption in the raw material transportation was from 7 to 14 % of the produced electricity. Energy consumption in the <b>grass</b> silage <b>production</b> was from 11 to 16 % of the produced electricity. In the electricity production the heat is also produced that should be utilized to keep the total energy balance positive. If the heat utilizer would not considered, the direct carbon dioxide emissions and the energy consumption in transportation could be decreased by one third. The energy consumption in the <b>grass</b> silage <b>production</b> consisted of an energy consumption {{in the field and}} a transportation energy consumption between farms and their field blocks. It turned out that the transportation energy consumption can be even {{more than half of the}} energy consumption in the field.

We also investigated effects of the addition of EM-A to slurry manure on nitrogen losses from the manure and <b>grass</b> biomass <b>production</b> after application of the manure as organic fertilizer. EM® and Agri-mest® were tested in a factorial set-up so that the factors could be distinguished. Effective Organisms (EM) {{is a mixture of}} several effective, disease-depressing micro-organisms. Agri-mest contains energized minerals, which will influence biochemical processes occurring in the manure. Different EM-stocks, and EM-Active suspensions prepared by different users showed large variation in bacterial community structure and, thus, low reproducibility. Through the addition of Agri-mest to the slurry manure, loss of inorganic nitrogen from the slurry manure appeared to be reduced. Moreover, after application of such Agri-mest slurry as an organic fertilizer, nitrogen uptake by grass was reduced. Addition of EM-A had no measurable effects on the bacterial diversity and the chemical composition of the slurry manure.

We tested for contrasts between the unburned controls and each of the four burn treatments in those years with significant (P < 0.05) yearly effects. Spring burns significantly reduced C 4 <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> in the first year of the experiment, likely because burns occurred after C 4 growth was initiated (Scheintaub et al. 2009 and Figure 5 b). However, plots that burned a second time during the dormant season in 2007 recovered to the same level of C 4 <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> as unburned plots (Schientaub et al. 2009). From 2008 through 2014, none of the burn treatments affected C 4 <b>grass</b> <b>production</b> (Figures 4 b and 5 b), despite the fact that precipitation varied widely among these years, from a drought in 2012 to substantially above-average precipitation in 2009.

It assumes that the gross <b>grass</b> <b>production,</b> the nutritive value and the intake of grass by cattle decline over time due to an increasing content of undesirable grass species, like Poa trivialis and Elymus repens. This model approach is the basis for the 'Grassland Renovation Guide', a computer program which runs on the Internet site of our institute (www. asg. wur. nl). Farmers can use this program for a cost/benefit analysis, depending on factors such as actual costs, present content of desirable grasses and clover, soil type, groundwater level, irrigation and N fertilisation level.
