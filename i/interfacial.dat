5|$|Drop volume method: A {{method for}} {{determining}} <b>interfacial</b> tension {{as a function}} of interface age. Liquid of one density is pumped into a second liquid of a different density and time between drops produced is measured.|$|E
5|$|Du Noüy ring method: The {{traditional}} {{method used}} to measure surface or <b>interfacial</b> tension. Wetting properties of the surface or interface have little influence on this measuring technique. Maximum pull exerted on the ring by the surface is measured.|$|E
5|$|Spinning drop method: This {{technique}} {{is ideal for}} measuring low <b>interfacial</b> tensions. The diameter of a drop within a heavy phase is measured while both are rotated.|$|E
5|$|Pendant drop method: Surface and <b>interfacial</b> tension can be {{measured}} by this technique, even at elevated temperatures and pressures. Geometry of a drop is analyzed optically. For pendant drops the maximum diameter and the ratio between this parameter and the diameter at {{the distance of the}} maximum diameter from the drop apex has been used to evaluate the size and shape parameters in order to determine surface tension.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} region between the hydrophobic inner core and the hydrophilic <b>interfacial</b> regions is very narrow, at around 3Å, (see lipid bilayer article for {{a description of}} its component chemical groups). Moving outwards away from the hydrophobic core region and into the <b>interfacial</b> hydrophilic region, the effective concentration of water rapidly changes across this boundary layer, from nearly zero to a concentration of around 2 M.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} the {{dispersion}} relation allows for two modes: a barotropic mode where the free surface amplitude is large compared with the amplitude of the <b>interfacial</b> wave, and a baroclinic mode where the opposite is the case – the <b>interfacial</b> wave is higher than and in antiphase with the free surface wave. The dispersion relation for this case is of a more complicated form.|$|E
25|$|Particle {{size and}} <b>interfacial</b> {{interactions}} with adjacent matrices affect the mechanical properties of food composites.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{waves are}} {{a special case}} of <b>interfacial</b> waves, on the {{interface}} between two fluids of different density.|$|E
25|$|Sottos {{has also}} been {{involved}} in research on thin films, and the measurement techniques for dynamic <b>interfacial</b> energy measurements of adhesion in multilayer thin films.|$|E
25|$|For <b>interfacial</b> {{waves to}} exist, the lower layer {{has to be}} heavier than the upper one, ρ>ρ‘. Otherwise, the {{interface}} is unstable and a Rayleigh–Taylor instability develops.|$|E
25|$|Since {{transmission}} electron goniometry {{is based}} on Bragg’s Law for the transmission (Laue) case (diffraction of electron waves), interzonal angles (i.e. angles between lattice directions) can be measured by a procedure that {{is analogous to the}} measurement of <b>interfacial</b> angles in an optical goniometer on the basis of Snell’s Law, i.e. the reflection of light. The complements to <b>interfacial</b> angles of external crystal faces can, on the other hand, be directly measured from a zone-axis diffraction pattern or from the Fourier transform of a high resolution TEM image that shows crossed lattice fringes.|$|E
25|$|Ionic {{relaxation}} comprises {{ionic conductivity}} and <b>interfacial</b> and space charge relaxation. Ionic conductivity predominates at low frequencies and introduces only losses to the system. <b>Interfacial</b> relaxation occurs when charge carriers are trapped at interfaces of heterogeneous systems. A related effect is Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, where charge carriers blocked at inner dielectric boundary layers (on the mesoscopic scale) or external electrodes (on a macroscopic scale) {{lead to a}} separation of charges. The charges may be separated by a considerable distance and therefore make contributions to the dielectric loss that are orders of magnitude larger than the response due to molecular fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|Emulsifying agent (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the <b>interfacial</b> tension γ between oil and water. When emulsifying agent, lecithin, {{is added to the}} oil and water emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail point toward the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the <b>interfacial</b> tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy of {{the skin}} sample {{obtained}} from the biopsy is used to detect the presence of cleavage within the dermis, epidermal acantholysis (breaking apart {{of the skin}}), dyskeratotic keratinocytes and vacuolar changes in the layers of the skin, <b>interfacial</b> dermatitis, and epidermal exocytosis. Presentation of these characteristics suggests PNP.|$|E
25|$|The foam in the {{downcomer}} {{is about}} 50–60% air. Because of this, the pulp is {{distributed in the}} form of thin <b>interfacial</b> slurry films between the bubbles, providing an ideal environment for particle–bubble contact. Collection occurs by migration of the particles within the thin films, which are not much thicker than the diameter of the particles.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{sciences}} – ORNL conducts both {{fundamental and}} applied research {{in a number}} of areas, including catalysis, surface science and <b>interfacial</b> chemistry; molecular transformations and fuel chemistry; heavy element chemistry and radioactive materials characterization; aqueous solution chemistry and geochemistry; mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy; separations chemistry; materials chemistry including synthesis and characterization of polymers and other soft materials; chemical biosciences; and neutron science.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical fluids {{can be used}} {{to deposit}} {{functional}} nanostructured films and nanometer-size particles of metals onto surfaces. The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in chemical vapour deposition allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate limited regime, providing stable and uniform <b>interfacial</b> growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under chemical vapour deposition would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable <b>interfacial</b> growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than atomic layer deposition, the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} mechanically agitated cell, the void fraction is low (5–10%) and the bubble size is large (2–3mm), {{which results in}} a low <b>interfacial</b> area with a low probability of particle–bubble contact. In {{a conventional}} flotation column, the void fraction is similarly low, and so the probability of particle–bubble contact is increased by increasing {{the height of the}} column to provide greater residence time.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{bubbles in}} soapy {{water in a}} fcc or hcp arrangement, when {{the water in the}} gaps between the bubbles drains out, also {{approach}} the rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb or trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb. However, such fcc or hcp foams of very small liquid content are unstable, as they do not satisfy Plateau's laws. The Kelvin foam and the Weaire–Phelan foam are more stable, having smaller <b>interfacial</b> energy in the limit of a very small liquid content.|$|E
25|$|Between {{two phases}} in {{equilibrium}} {{there is a}} narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, it can have significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit surface tension. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding {{the behavior of a}} particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the <b>interfacial</b> region as a separate phase.|$|E
25|$|Two {{unprotected}} oil droplets {{with small}} radii in water are favored thermodynamically to coalesce into one bigger droplet because the process yields a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio. The energetic {{contribution of the}} <b>interfacial</b> layer over that same volume of oil is minimized when the two droplets fuse together. Thus, the coalescence process puts the system in a lower energy state and the process would occur spontaneously. However, when the oil droplets are coated with emulsifying agent, electrostatic repulsive force is introduced among the oil droplets which keeps the droplets from coming together.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} can be functionalized {{to attain}} desired properties {{that can be}} used in a wide variety of applications. The two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their hydrophobic nature, carbon nanotubes tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite. The surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the hydrophobicity and improve <b>interfacial</b> adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment.|$|E
25|$|The {{phospholipid}} bilayer {{that forms}} the cell surface membrane consists of a hydrophobic inner core region sandwiched between two regions of hydrophilicity, one at the inner surface and one at the outer surface of the cell membrane (see lipid bilayer article {{for a more detailed}} structural description of the cell membrane). The inner and outer surfaces, or <b>interfacial</b> regions, of model phospholipid bilayers have been shown to have a thickness of around 8 to 10 Å, although this may be wider in biological membranes that include large amounts of gangliosides or lipopolysaccharides.|$|E
25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} {{disrupt the}} motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve strength, as described by the Hall–Petch relationship. Since grain boundaries are defects in the crystal structure they tend to decrease the electrical and thermal conductivity of the material. The high <b>interfacial</b> energy and relatively weak bonding in most grain boundaries often makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the precipitation of new phases from the solid. They are also important {{to many of the}} mechanisms of creep.|$|E
500|$|... where α, β, and θ are {{the angles}} shown and γij is the surface energy {{between the two}} {{indicated}} phases. These relations can also be expressed by an analog to a triangle known as Neumann’s triangle, shown in Figure 4. Neumann’s triangle {{is consistent with the}} geometrical restriction that , and applying the law of sines and law of cosines to it produce relations that describe how the <b>interfacial</b> angles depend on the ratios of surface energies.|$|E
2500|$|... where index [...] {{is of the}} <b>interfacial</b> -plane, and [...] and [...] are {{the linear}} and {{nonlinear}} Fresnel factors.|$|E
2500|$|Phase {{separation}} {{of oil and}} water is not only entropy-driven, but is also driven forward to undo the increase in contact area between oil and water. Forming extra <b>interfacial</b> layer, as when oil droplets are in the water layer, increase the overall energy of the oil-water system. This is because water and oil molecules at the interface are higher in energy compared to {{when they are in}} the middle and are surrounded on all directions by their own molecules. Thus, oil droplets would move out of water phase, after letting the mixture sit for a little, to get the change in <b>interfacial</b> area (ΔA) as small as possible in order to minimize the energy rise of the system (ΔG). The relationship between free energy change of a system and its <b>interfacial</b> area is expressed in the equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] is the {{coefficient}} of the Gibbs adsorption. [...] Values of [...] are calculated using the Double layer (<b>interfacial)</b> models of Helmholtz, Gouy, and Stern.|$|E
2500|$|... where ΔG is the {{increase}} in surface free energy, ΔA is {{the increase}} in surface area, and γ is the <b>interfacial</b> {{tension between the two}} liquids.|$|E
2500|$|Stability is {{hindered}} by aggregation and sedimentation phenomena, which {{are driven by}} the colloid's tendency to reduce surface energy. Reducing the <b>interfacial</b> tension will stabilize the colloidal system by reducing this driving force.|$|E
2500|$|Heat {{generation}} during friction-stir welding {{arises from}} two main sources: friction {{at the surface}} of the tool and the deformation of the material around the tool. The heat generation is often assumed to occur predominantly under the shoulder, due to its greater surface area, and to be equal to the power required to overcome the contact forces between the tool and the workpiece. The contact condition under the shoulder can be described by sliding friction, using a friction coefficient μ and <b>interfacial</b> pressure P, or sticking friction, based on the <b>interfacial</b> shear strength at an appropriate temperature and strain rate. Mathematical approximations for the total heat generated by the tool shoulder Qtotal have been developed using both sliding and sticking friction models: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the all-solid state batteries, most lithium batteries employ liquid electrolytes, which pose safety issues due to their flammability. [...] Many different solid electrolytes have been proposed to replace these hazardous liquid electrolytes. For most solid-state batteries, high <b>interfacial</b> resistance lowers the reversibility of the intercalation process, shortening the life cycle. [...] These undesirable <b>interfacial</b> effects are less problematic for TiS2. [...] One all-solid-state lithium battery exhibited a power density of 1000 W/kg over 50 cycles with a maximum power density of 1500 W/kg. [...] Additionally, the average capacity of the battery decreased by less than 10% over 50 cycles. Although titanium disulfide has high electrical conductivity, high energy density, and high power, its discharge voltage is relatively low compared to other lithium batteries where the cathodes have higher reduction potentials.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{distinct}} membrane-association {{modes of}} proteins have been identified. Typical water-soluble proteins have no exposed nonpolar residues {{or any other}} hydrophobic anchors. Therefore, they remain completely in aqueous solution and do not penetrate into the lipid bilayer, which would be energetically costly. Such proteins interact with bilayers only electrostatically, for example, ribonuclease and poly-lysine interact with membranes in this mode. However, typical amphitropic proteins have various hydrophobic anchors that penetrate the <b>interfacial</b> region and reach the hydrocarbon interior of the membrane. Such proteins [...] "deform" [...] the lipid bilayer, decreasing the temperature of lipid fluid-gel transition. The binding is usually a strongly exothermic reaction. Association of amphiphilic α-helices with membranes occurs similarly. Intrinsically unstructured or unfolded peptides with nonpolar residues or lipid anchors can also penetrate the <b>interfacial</b> region of the membrane and reach the hydrocarbon core, especially when such peptides are cationic and interact with negatively charged membranes.|$|E

He worked for Syncrude Canada Limited for the next six years, conducting studies on the molecular and <b>interfacial</b> properties of the oils sands and the mechanism of the Clark hot water separation process., leading to a paper presented at the Seventh World Petroleum Congress in Mexico City in 1967.|$|E
