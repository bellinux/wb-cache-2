However, increased human intervention on their habitat is expected to, in the future, be the most likely cause of the decline of its range and population. A series of recommendations were issued <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> proper <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> the species, among which is the implementation and publication of studies on the structure of populations, making a record of the distribution of the species, information about potential threats as the magnitude of fishing operations and location of pipelines.|$|R

30|$|Increasing {{efforts for}} breast cancer {{screening}} {{have been made in}} LDCs: national recommendations and/or guidelines have been laid out, MS programs had been incorporated in some countries and relevant studies have been conducted in others. Based on our review, there may be a role in LDCs to employ western style MS for targeted minority groups, such as high socioeconomic level and high risk populations. Meanwhile, for LDCs, it is also important <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> patient <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> maintain high adherence rates, to ensure the accuracy of screening mammography, to shorten the waiting time to definitive diagnostic procedure after suspicious results, and to deliver state-of-the art treatment after early detection by screening. MS programs are currently too resource-demanding for most LDCs, {{due to the lack of}} breast cancer awareness among the population, the inadequate identification of appropriate target populations, the low likelihood of up-take and compliance, the scarcity of mammography resources, unaffordable screening costs and overall sub-optimal outcomes in survival benefit.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{quantitative}} study aiming {{to identify the}} profile of mothers and newborns (NB) {{in the presence of}} gestational dia­betes mellitus (GDM) in Fortaleza-Ceará/ 2006. The sample comprised 51 women and their newborns. As for the mother, the results showed 60. 7 % aged over 30 years; 15. 6 % with hypertension and 29. 5 % with urinary tract infection; 89. 2 % had had cesarean delivery; 35. 3 % had had family history of diabetes; 21. 5 % had had premature delivery; 35. 2 %, had had previous abortion and 82. 3 % had attended antenatal care.

40|$|With {{the continual}} {{pressure}} <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>follow-up</b> molecules <b>to</b> billion dollar blockbuster drugs, {{there is a}} hurdle in profitability and growth for pharmaceutical companies in the next decades. With each success and failure we increasingly appreciate that {{a key to the}} success of synthesized molecules through the research and development process is the possession of drug-like properties. These properties include an adequate bioactivity as well as adequate solubility, an ability to cross critical membranes (intestinal and sometimes blood-brain barrier), reasonable metabolic stability and of course safety in humans. Dependent on the therapeutic area being investigated it might also be desirable to avoid certain enzymes or transporters to circumvent potential drug-drug interactions. It may also be important to limit the induction of these same proteins that can result in further toxicities. We have clearly moved the assessment of in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME/TOX) parameters much earlier in the discovery organization than a decade ago with the inclusion of higher throughput systems. We are also now faced with huge amounts of ADME/TOX data for each molecule that need interpretation and also provide a valuable resource for generating predictive computational models for future drug discovery. The present review aims to show what tools exist today for visualizing and modeling ADME/TOX data, what tools need to be developed, and how both the present and future tools are valuable for virtual filtering using ADME/TOX and bioactivity properties in parallel as a viable addition to present practices...|$|R
40|$|Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is a {{group of}} idiopathic disorders characterized by the proliferation of specialized, bone marrow-derived langerhans cells and mature eosinophils. The clinical spectrum ranges from an acute, fulminant, disseminated disease called Letterer-Siwe disease to solitary or few, indolent and chronic lesions of the bone or other organs called eosinophilic granuloma. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is very rare in LCH. We present the case of a 53 -year-old woman referred by her primary care physician for a screening colonoscopy. A single sessile polyp, measuring 4 mm in size, was found in the rectum. Histopathological examination revealed that the lesion was relatively well circumscribed and comprised mainly a mixture of polygonal cells with moderate-to-abundant pink slightly granular cytoplasm. The nuclei within these cells had frequent grooves and were occasionally folded. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD- 1 a which confirmed the diagnosis of LCH. On further workup, {{there was no evidence of}} involvement of any other organ. On follow up colonoscopy one year later, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. Review of the published literature revealed that LCH presenting as solitary colonic polyp is rare. However, with the increasing rates of screening colonoscopy, more colonic polyps may be identified as LCH on histopathology. This underscores the importance of recognizing this rare condition and <b>ensuring</b> proper <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> rule out systemic disease...|$|R

40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a {{pathogen}} and {{the most}} frequent cause of gastric ulcers. There is also a close correlation between the prevalence of H. pylori infection and the incidence of gastric cancer. We present {{the case of a}} 38 -year-old woman referred by her primary care physician for screening positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), which showed a nodular strong accumulation point with standardized uptake value 5. 6 in the gastric fundus. Gastroscopy was then performed, and a single arched ulcer, 12 mm in size, was found in the gastric fundus. Histopathological examination of the lesion revealed chronic mucosal inflammation with acute inflammation and H. pylori infection. There was an obvious mitotic phase with widespread lymphoma. Formal anti-H. pylori treatment was carried out. One month later, a gastroscopy showed a single arched ulcer, measuring 10 mm in size in the gastric fundus. Histopathological examination revealed chronic mucosal inflammation with acute inflammation and a very small amount of H. pylori infection. The mitotic phase was 4 / 10 high power field, with some heterotypes and an obvious nucleolus. Follow-up gastroscopy 2 mo later showed the gastric ulcer in stage S 2. The mucosal swelling had markedly improved. The patient remained asymptomatic, and a follow-up PET-CT was performed 6 mo later. The nodular strong accumulation point had disappeared. Follow-up gastroscopy showed no evidence of malignant cancer. H. pylori-associated severe inflammation can lead to neoplastic changes in histiocytes. This underscores the importance of eradicating H. pylori, especially in those with mucosal lesions, and <b>ensuring</b> proper <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> prevent or even reverse early gastric cancer...|$|R

40|$|Childhood {{blindness}} has {{an adverse}} effect on growth, development, social, and economic opportunities. Severe visual impairment (SVI) and blindness in infants must be detected {{as early as possible}} to initiate immediate treatment to prevent deep amblyopia. Although difficult, measurement of visual acuity of an infant is possible. The causes of SVI and blindness may be prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal. Congenital anomalies such as anophthalmos, microphthalmos, coloboma, congenital cataract, infantile glaucoma, and neuro-ophthalmic lesions are causes of impairment present at birth. Ophthalmia neonatorum, retinopathy of prematurity, and cortical visual impairment are acquired during the perinatal period. Leukocoria or white pupillary reflex can be cause by congenital cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, or retinoblastoma. While few medical or surgical options are available for congenital anomalies or neuro-ophthalmic disorders, many affected infants can still benefit from low vision aids and rehabilitation. Ideally, surgery for congenital cataracts should occur within the first 4 months of life. Anterior vitrectomy and primary posterior capsulotomy are required, followed by aphakic glasses with secondary intraocular lens implantation at a later date. The treatment of infantile glaucoma is surgery followed by anti-glaucoma medication. Retinopathy of prematurity is a proliferation of the retinal vasculature in response to relative hypoxia in a premature infant. Screening in the first few weeks of life can prevent blindness. Retinoblastoma can be debulked with chemotherapy; however, enucleation may still be required. Neonatologists, pediatricians, traditional birth attendants, nurses, and ophthalmologists should be sensitive to a parent’s complaints of poor vision in an infant and <b>ensure</b> adequate <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> determine the cause. If required, evaluation under anesthesia should be performed, which includes funduscopy, refraction, corneal diameter measurement, and measurement of intraocular pressure...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In studies {{evaluating}} {{methods for}} diagnosing tuberculosis (TB), <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> verify {{the presence or}} absence of active TB is crucial and high dropout rates may significantly affect the validity of the results. In a study assessing the diagnostic performance of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube test in TB suspect children in Tanzania, factors influencing patient adherence <b>to</b> attend <b>follow-up</b> examinations and reasons for not attending were examined. METHODS: In 160 children who attended and 102 children who did not attend scheduled 2 -month follow-up baseline health characteristics, demographic data and risk factors for not attending follow-up were determined. Qualitative interviews were used to understand patient and caretakers reasons for not returning for scheduled follow-up. RESULTS: Being treated for active tb in the dots program (OR: 4. 14; 95 % CI: 1. 99 - 8. 62;p-value 100;P-value< 0. 001) were positive predictors for attending follow-up at 2 months, and 21 / 85 (25 %) of children not attending scheduled follow-up had died. Interviews revealed that limited financial resources, i. e. lack of money for transportation and poor communication, were related to non-adherence. CONCLUSION: Patients lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> is a potential problem for TB research. Receiving money for transportation to the hospital and communication is crucial for adherence <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> conducted at a study facility.
